I've been using Kubernetes for almost a year now and, to be honest, I like the experience so far. Most of my use cases were rather trivial and thanks to its declarative approach, Kubernetes makes deploying and scaling stateless services pretty simple. I usually just describe my application in a YAML file as a set of interconnected services, feed it to Kubernetes, and let the built-in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">control loops</a> bring the state of the cluster closer to the desired state by creating or destroying some resources for me automagically.</p>
<p>However, many times I've heard that <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/the-staying-power-of-kubernetes-with-kelsey-hightower/">the real power of Kubernetes comes with its extensibility</a>. Kubernetes designed for automation. It brings a lot of useful automation out of the box. But it also provides extension points that can be used to customize Kubernetes capabilities. The cleverness of the Kubernetes design is that it encourages you to keep the extensions feel native! So when I stumbled upon the first few Kubernetes Operators on my Ops way, I could not even recognize that I'm dealing with custom logic...</p>
<p>In this article, I'll try to take a closer look at the Operators pattern, see which Kubernetes parts are involved in operators implementation, and what makes operators feel like first-class Kubernetes citizens. Of course, with as many pictures as possible.

<h2 id="kubernetes-objects-and-controllers">Kubernetes Objects and Controllers</h2>
<p>Everything in Kubernetes seems to revolve around <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/">objects</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">controllers</a>.</p>
<p>Kubernetes objects such as Pods, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, or Events are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Objects are also used as "records of intent." By creating (or removing) objects one can describe the <em>desired</em> state of the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p><i>Objects are like data structures.</i></p>
<p>On the other hand, controllers are infinite loops that watch the <em>actual</em> and the <em>desired</em> states of your cluster. When these two states diverge, controllers start making changes aiming to bring the current state of the cluster closer to the desired one.</p>
<p><i>Controllers are like algorithms.</i></p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-control-loop-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes Control Loop">
</p>

<p>I'll get to the controllers part later in this article and now let's focus on the objects.</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-api-architecture">Kubernetes API Architecture</h2>
<p>All interactions with Kubernetes objects, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/">directly</a> or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/">indirectly</a>, happen through <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/">Kubernetes API</a> - a highly structured masterpiece of software design.</p>
<p>There is a ton of documentation written on Kubernetes API and related topics and I spent quite some time digesting it. Since we are going to talk about the Kubernetes Operator pattern which heavily depends on the capabilities of the Kubernetes API, it's important to familiarize ourselves with the API design principles first. Following is my super-condensed excerpt from the docs.</p>
<p>Kubernetes offers a RESTful declarative HTTP API. Still remember those Kubernetes objects? <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources">A collection of objects of a certain kind form an <em>API resource</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A resource is an endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores a collection of API objects of a certain kind; for example, the built-in pods resource contains a collection of Pod objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can always check the list of available API resources using <code>kubectl api-resources</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-resources
NAME          SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION   NAMESPACED   KIND
namespaces    ns           v1           false        Namespace
nodes         no           v1           false        Node
pods          po           v1           true         Pod
deployments   deploy       apps/v1      true         Deployment
jobs                       batch/v1     true         Job
...</code></pre>
<p>OK, great, we've got resources. But Kubernetes evolves quickly. What if a new attribute needs to be added to an existing resource definition? API versioning is always hard. <i>&lt;speculation mode&gt;</i>Apparently, Kubernetes API started with a common prefix <code>/api/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;resource&gt;</code> for all the API resources. However, a change in a single resource would require a whole API version bump. So, with the growth in the number of available resources, the need for some sort of grouping and subversioning emerged.<i>&lt;/speculation mode&gt;</i></p>
<p>API groups to the rescue! <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning">A bunch of related resources forms an API group</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make it easier to evolve and to extend its API, Kubernetes implements API groups that can be enabled or disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also check the list of available API groups and their versions using <code>kubectl api-versions</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-versions
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apps/v1
...</code></pre>
<p>Well, at this point, I should warn you - it seems that in the documentation, the term <em>resource</em> is often used in the meaning of an <em>object</em> (but not vice versa). So, context matters.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes, objects of the same kind are distinguished by their names. So, if you start two Pods, both should get a unique name. But clusters can be pretty big and since names are supposed to be unique within a cluster, we need a mechanism to prevent collisions. Something like lots of logical clusters within one physical cluster. Allow me to introduce you to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#when-to-use-multiple-namespaces"><em>namespaces</em></a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, API objects are fully qualified by their API group, resource type, namespace (unless cluster-scoped), and name.</p>
<p>Have you become totally confused by this time? No, worries, I've got a <del>simple</del> diagram for you 🙈</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-structure-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API structure"></p><p><i>Kubernetes API structure.</i></p>
</div>

<p>So, a quick summary - we've learned about objects, resources, groups, and namespaces. But what's up with the promised customization?</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-custom-resources">Kubernetes Custom Resources</h2>
<p>It seems like there is <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md">a great deal of effort</a> in keeping the Kubernetes API coherent but extensible.</p>
<p>What do I mean by <em>coherent</em> here? Kubernetes API consists of endpoints called <em>resources</em>. These API resources adhere to a set of common requirements - they are nouns and manipulated in a declarative manner (RESTful CRUD), they should be updated relatively infrequently and be reasonably small in size, their names should be <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names">valid DNS subdomains</a>, etc.</p>
<p>These restrictions allow unifying the resource workflows. For instance, you can get, describe, or update a collection of Pods in pretty much the same way as a collection of Services, Nodes, or RBAC roles:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl get services
$ kubectl get roles

$ kubectl describe pods  # or services, or roles

$ kubectl edit pods  # or services, or roles</code></pre>
<p>Not only <code>kubectl</code> benefits from this uniformity. Here is a full list of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#common-features">common features</a> enabled by the unified design:</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-common-features-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API common features"></p>
</div>

<p>It's pretty handy, isn't it?</p>
<p>So, if I were to extend the API, it'd be reasonable for me to expect that my endpoints would benefit from this common functionality as well. But that would mean that the API extension should be done by adding more resources!</p>
<p>And indeed, in Kubernetes, one can easily register <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources"><em>custom resources</em></a>. The procedure is fully dynamic and doesn't require restarting or updating the API server.</p>
<p>How such a custom resource can be added? Well, again, it's Kubernetes! Of course, by interacting with another, already existing resource! There is a special API resource called <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions">CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CustomResourceDefinition API resource allows you to define custom resources. Defining a CRD object creates a new custom resource with a name and schema that you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#create-a-customresourcedefinition">from another documentation page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you create a new CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), the Kubernetes API Server creates a new RESTful resource path for each version you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-create-custom-resource">How to Create Custom Resource</h2>
<p>Let's try to create a custom resource. Remember, a resource specifies a certain kind of Kubernetes object. Canonically, objects possess some attributes. So, our CustomResourceDefinition should be mostly concerned with describing the attributes of our future resource. Additionally, it's good to know that custom resources can be either namespaced or cluster-scoped. This is specified in the CRD's scope field.</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1

                <p><strong>T</strong><span>here is no one in American government — or perhaps any government — quite like Dr. Anthony Fauci. His position, with its mixture of informal power and public visibility, scientific authority and beltway influence, is sui generis. Few other unconfirmed civil servants have access to as many rooms in the executive interagency; no public official commands as much respect in the world of science and medicine. As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984, he has advised six presidents (and now a seventh) on domestic and global health issues — HIV/AIDS, SARS, Ebola, Zika, and MERS — and overseen decades of research on infectious disease, pandemics, and virology. Under his stewardship, NIAID’s mission has been reshaped around his personage: its priorities are </span><i><span>his</span></i><span> priorities, its research agenda is </span><i><span>his</span></i><span> research agenda. And that agenda has borne fruit: breakthrough treatments for HIV and other deadly diseases and now, a vaccine for Covid-19. As Stanford microbiologist David Relman told </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>New Yorker</span></i><span> in April, “Tony has essentially become the embodiment of the biomedical and public-health research enterprise in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span>Although Fauci has no statutory authority to preside over a public health crisis, he has become the nation’s de facto Doctor-in-Chief during this pandemic. His face — elven and expressive — is the face of the medical establishment’s response to the novel coronavirus. I doubt most Americans can name the (</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/20/biden-surgeon-general-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>outgoing</span></a><span>) U.S. Surgeon General, CDC Director, or Fauci’s nominal boss, the director of the National Institutes of Health (Jerome Adams, Robert Redfield, and Francis Collins, respectively), but everyone knows Dr. Fauci. His plaintive but never pessimistic patter and disarming outer-borough rasp are soothing sonic features of our daily dirge of death, doom, and statistics. I was relieved when I first saw Fauci on TV — sometime in March 2020 — thinking dimly to myself, for the millionth time, “Ah, an adult in the room.” Amid a ceaseless current of chaos and grief, Fauci’s egoless display of competence, his grandfatherly warmth and irony, were ports in a storm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But a comforting bedside manner has done little to mitigate catastrophe. Over 400,000 Americans are dead, twice as many as any other country. Infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are currently at record highs. And although we have a vaccine, the rollout has already been stymied by a dearth of resources and coordination. As one public health expert told <em>The </em></span><i><span>New York Times </span></i><span>on January 17</span><i><span>,</span></i><span> our pandemic response has been “a colossal failure at every level of government.” And herein lies a paradox. America is suffering from a disease outbreak whose morbid scope is the consequence of world-historic negligence. We are desperately and needlessly sick. And yet, the man known as “America’s Doctor,” the undisputed personification of public health research and pandemic preparedness, faces no reputational consequences. On the contrary, Dr. Fauci remains one of our most beloved public figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What explains this? Liberals, who otherwise harshly condemn the federal government’s pandemic response, are especially besotted with the diminutive virologist. For fans of the #Resistance, a well-timed </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dr-anthony-fauci-did-a-facepalm-during-trumps-coronavirus-briefing-2020-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>facepalm</span></a><span> during one of the Mad King’s early soliloquies guaranteed Fauci’s place on a Mount Rushmore of replacement patriarchs, alongside James Comey and Robert Mueller. (Fauci later insisted the gesture was innocuous; he was merely obscuring his face to dislodge a lozenge from his throat.) Still, Democrats’ devotion has never waned. They see in Fauci a lonely champion of “truth” and “facts” in a White House otherwise hostile to “science.” Brad Pitt earned an Emmy nomination for portraying the 80-year-old physician on Saturday Night Live. One Hamilton-inspired TikTok (“My name is Dr. Anthony Fau-CHEE…”) went viral. Just since the beginning of the “third wave” of Covid infections in October, Fauci has received leadership awards from the National Academy of Medicine, the FBI Agents Association, the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, and the Boy Scouts of America. Joe Biden has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/politics/anthony-fauci-biden-transition/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>asked</span></a><span> Fauci to stay on at NIAID and serve in his administration as a chief medical advisor. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser proclaimed “Anthony S. Fauci Day” on December 24.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fauci’s celebrity, however, cannot obscure empirical reality. As America’s Doctor would surely agree, the numbers don’t lie: 2,824 Americans died of Covid-19 on Anthony S. Fauci Day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anthony Fauci is no doubt a dedicated public servant, respected by his colleagues, beloved by many Americans. But the puzzle remains: why has the man most closely associated with the public health response to the pandemic entirely avoided accountability for its failure?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>F</strong><span>irst, the most straightforward defense: it wasn’t his fault. He did the best he could, but Fauci’s better instincts were thwarted by Trump and his coterie of idiots. Of course, there’s truth in this. The uneasy peace between Trump and his medical advisors started to unravel almost before it began. By the end of March, Trump was sweating the stocks and tweeting that the “cure” must not be worse “than the problem itself.” He clashed with Fauci throughout the spring — over masks, hydroxychloroquine, school openings, and Easter. By summer, Trump was publicly lambasting the good doctor, leaking anti-Fauci talking points to the press and sidelining him in task force meetings, which were themselves increasingly rare. Scott Atlas, the libertarian radiologist and herd-immunity advocate whom Trump hired based on his Fox News appearances, was calling the shots.</span></p>
<p><span>But Fauci seldom contradicted the president’s lies outright, opting for tact and de-escalation instead. “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Fauci </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/dr-fauci-press-conference-white-house-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>said</span></a><span> in late March. “OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.” On July 4, Trump said 99 percent of Covid cases were “harmless.” Fauci characterized this as a misinterpretation. (“I’m trying to figure out where the president got that number…” he said.) Though Fauci has a reputation for bluntness, as the </span><i><span>Financial Times</span></i><span>’s Hannah Kuchler </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57834c2c-a078-4736-9173-8fb32cfbbf4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>observed</span></a><span>, “he clearly also tries to hold back, believing he will make a bigger difference to the course of the pandemic if he keeps his job.”</span></p>
<p><span>This logic pervades the most common defense of Fauci’s record. “Tony is unique, in that he has such credibility with politicians that he’s been able to insert hard facts into the conversation,” Nobel laureate biologist David Baltimore told </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>New Yorker</span></i><span> in April. “That has been wonderful for our country and the world.” In this view, Fauci was </span><i><span>handling</span></i><span> Trump, just as he handled previous presidents, including a reluctant Ronald Reagan during the AIDS epidemic. When he pulls his punches, it’s always for the greater good; namely, the cause of remaining in the room. Stepping too far out of line, contradicting Trump with too much vigor, would have imperiled his standing. “The argument for Fauci saying more,” </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/16/anthony-fauci-built-truce-trump-is-destroying-it/?arc404=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>wrote</span></a><span> Molly Roberts in <em>The</em> </span><i><span>Washington Post</span></i><span>, “… is also an argument for self-exile.” And then what? Truth and facts would have had no advocate inside the White House. As Fauci himself </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/health/fauci-trump-covid.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> the </span><i><span>Times</span></i><span> on Sunday, “I felt that if I stepped down, that would leave a void. Someone’s got to not be afraid to speak out the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span>At a briefing in July, Trump </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/politics/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-approval-rating/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>mused</span></a><span>, “It’s interesting: [Fauci’s] got a very good approval rating. And I like that, it’s good. Because remember, he’s working for this administration. He’s working with us.” Winding his way to his point, Trump said, “So why don’t I have a high approval rating… with respect to the virus?” After a pause, he deadpanned, “It can only be my personality, that’s all.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As is often the case with Trump, he had a point, just not the one he meant. The liberal apologia for Fauci </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> internally contradictory. As one scientist said to me, “We can’t deify Fauci’s response to the pandemic as fantastic while simultaneously condemning Trump, when for months, the two were hand in hand.” Indeed, Fauci is only blameless if he was utterly powerless to stop the administration’s disastrous plans. And if he </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> powerless, he should’ve resigned and communicated the truth bluntly to the public long ago. Otherwise, he knowingly lent credibility to an abject failure he couldn’t control.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To put an even finer point on it, the precise conditions that would maximally exonerate Fauci — i.e., Trump is solely at fault; Fauci had no influence — are conditions under which Fauci </span><i><span>absolutely </span></i><span>should have bolted. The more aberrant Trump’s behavior, the more he diverged from the medically prudent course of action, the greater Fauci’s responsibility to leave and blow the whistle.

<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>Recently I have become curious about <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">the Gemini
Project</a> and the content that people have
made available to be retrieved over the gemini:// protocol.  I’m not convinced
by the arguments for not just using http, and mostly it’s just that I
typically find more things that I am interested in casually reading through on
people’s gemlogs than I would on, say, reddit, and similar aggregators.  But
presumably advocates of gemini:// and the text/gemini format would argue that
it’s various respects in which it differs from the web that makes geminispace
conducive to the production of the sort of content you find there.  So I’m
remaining open minded about the possibility that having a completely separate
protocol is important, and not just an annoyance because rss2email doesn’t
work and I had to spend time writing
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/gmi2email">gmi2email</a>.</p>

<p>I now have a games console at home for the first time in some years, which I
bought in response to the ongoing pandemic, and one thing that I have noticed
is that using it feels like being offline in a way that playing games on a
regular computer never would.  It has a WiFi connection but it doesn’t have a
web browser, and I am glad that using it provides an opportunity to be
disconnected from the usual streams of information.  And perhaps something
similar ought to be said in favour of how the Gemini project does not just use
http.  There is, perhaps, a positive psychological effect induced by making
the boundary between text/gemini and the web as hard as it is made by using
gemini:// rather than http.</p>

<p>Something about which I find myself much more sceptical is how the
specification for gemini:// and text/gemini is not extensible.  Advocates of
Gemini have this idea that they can’t include, say, a version number in the
protocol, because the extensibility of the web is what has led to the problems
they think it has, so they want to make it impossible.  Now on the one hand
perhaps the people behind Gemini are in the best position that anyone is in to
come up with a spec which they will finalise and render effectively
unchangeable, because a lot of them have been using Gopher for decades, and so
they have enough experience to be able to say exactly what Gopher is missing,
and be confident that they’ve not missed anything.  But on the other hand,
Gemini is one technological piece in attempts to make a version of the
Internet which is healthier for humans – the so-called “small Internet”
movement – and maybe there will be new ideas about how the small Internet
should be which would benefit from a new version of the Gemini specification.
So it seems risky to lock-in to one version.</p>

<center><b>Counterfeiting Stock 2.0</b></center>

<p>
Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.
</p>
<p>
<span>Why is This Important?</span> This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans.
</p>
<p>
The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations.
</p>
<p>
The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed—the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.
</p>
<p>
<span>A Glossary of Illogical Terms</span> — The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Broker Dealer or Prime Broker</b> — The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house — also known as a broker's broker.
</li>
<li><b>Hedge Funds</b> — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.
</li>
<li><b>Market Maker</b> — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting.
</li>
<li><b>Short Seller</b> — An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as “the shorts.”
</li>
<li><b>The Securities and Exchange Commission</b> — The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top–level management is a five–person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.
</li>
<li><b>Depository Trust Clearing Corp</b> — Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later.
</li>
<li><b>Short Sale</b> — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back.
<p>This relatively simple process is perfectly legal—so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.
</p></li>
<li><b>Disclosed Short</b> — When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing. 
</li>
<li><b>Naked Short</b> — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud. 
<p>
Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.
</p></li>
<li><b>Fails–to–Deliver</b> — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.
<p>
Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).
</p></li>
<li><b>Options</b> — The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to sell shares (a “put”). Options are an integral part of short manipulations, the result of SEC promulgated loopholes in Reg SHO. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called “out of the money.” If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.
</li>
<li><b>Naked call</b> — The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list. A share of stock that has a naked call as its borrowed shares is marked as a disclosed short when it is sold, even though nobody in the transaction actually owns a share.
</li>
</ol>

<p>In a previous <a href="https://onurgumus.github.io/2020/12/26/Functional-Programming.html">post</a> I have explained my motivations for functional programming.
It’s no secret I love F# because F# makes me sleep better. In this post, I would like to discuss some different aspects of F#.</p>

<h2 id="f-is-gaining-independence-from-net">F# is gaining independence from .NET</h2>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/platform.png" alt="F# platforms"></p>

<!--more-->

<p>F# is mostly known to the developer community as the small ignored brother of C# running on the .NET platform. However, what is less known about F# is that it
has come to a level to be .NET independent. Thanks to <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, today F# can be considered as a complete replacement of TypeScript. Yes,
people do write full-blown SPA, React, Svelte applications by using F# instead of TypeScript. If you think Fable is just a transpiler, think again:  https://github.com/kunjee17/awesome-fable . I would say Fable is on the way being an ecosystem by itself.</p>

<p>There is also a new prototype target for Fable that allows F# code to transpile to Python developed by Dag Brattli.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/python2.gif" alt="Python"></p>

<p>F# also works as on WebAssembly with <a href="https://fsbolero.io/">Bolero</a> which is still based on .NET. And not to forget another F# web platform called <a href="https://websharper.com/">WebSharper</a> from the same people who developed Bolero.</p>

<p>Just like JavaScript people were using NodeJs to bring the front-end devs to the backend zone, F# also can be used to bring the backend-devs to the front-end realm. I am a living example myself. By using F# in the font-end you can practically share the code between your .NET/Node backend and the browser, giving you an isomorphic development experience.</p>

<p>This somewhat puts F# in an interesting position as historically most dotnet has been languages are managed by Microsoft. But Fable simply liberates
F# from Microsoft and .NET.</p>

<h2 id="the-f-fanboys">The F# fanboys</h2>

<p>You might have heard “one of those guys” like me who is talking about how great functional programming and/or F# is. And from that point, it looks like below</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/music.png" alt="music"></p>

<p>I know it’s annoying, however, let’s look at it from the side and this is how an F# developer feels when he or she is suggesting you using F#:
<img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/wheel.png" alt="wheels"></p>

<h2 id="microsofts-and-communitys-stance">Microsoft’s and community’s stance</h2>

<p>From Microsoft’s point of view, F# is actively supported and maintained. There are Microsoft developers actively fixing things and adding new features however as a general Microsoft’s point of view .NET == C# and that is that. From .NET developer community’s
point of view, things are even worse. Since all Microsoft docs and tools geared towards C#, adding up unfamiliarity with the functional paradigm, most people follow C# way and completely ignore its little brother F#. I still think this is a missed 
opportunity for the .NET community. For example, let’s look at the excellent server side F# web framework <a href="https://giraffe.wiki/">Giraffe</a>. 
While C# and asp.net developers are busy memorizing the Microsoft way of handling requests, learning what attributes to decorate their
classes and members, the F# developers who use giraffe, simply rely on functional composition:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>route</span> <span>"/"</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setHttpHeader</span> <span>"X-Foo"</span> <span>"Bar"</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setStatusCode</span> <span>200</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setBodyFromString</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As HTTP processing is usually treated as a pipeline by itself on the server-side, it’s an excellent target for functional programming. Just like lego, plug-in your pipes, and you are good to go.</p>

<p>Furthermore, most developers worry about if they could find an F# job whereas companies who consider making the switch worry if they could find an F# developer.
As of today on linked in there are approximately 700 F# jobs and even most of these are not F# specific rather than they are like “C# or F# developers wanted”.</p>

<p>And most non-.NET people are not willing to touch anything related to Microsoft even with a 10 foot pole. (Of course, the major exceptions to this are TypeScript and Visual Studio Code which both are widely popular). The  Functional programmers’ camp also dismisses F# at sight blaming it’s not like Haskell as in for example F# does not support type classes.</p>

<h2 id="couple-of-unique-features-of-f">Couple of unique features of F#</h2>

<p>I am not going to talk about the features of F# but just wanted to highlight a couple of them.</p>

<p>The first one is the file order. Please look at the below photo:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/files.png" alt="file-order"></p>

<p>In F# the order of the files matter. It is somewhat a disliked feature by the newcomers, but it makes the dependencies immediately visible.
So the code in the top file has no dependency on any others below and the 2nd file from the top only depends on the first. When you open a project which you are not 
familiar, file ordering helps to find your way.</p>

<p>The second one is Type Providers:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/sqlprovider.gif" alt="type-providers"></p>

<p>Type providers are somewhat code generators but they do that non-intrusively. Very roughly similar to LISP style macros they expand at compile time. Type providers make it very easy to discover HTML or JSON documents read database rows, file system, and discover DDL and rows within the coding screen without leaving your editor. And everything becomes so type-safe.</p>

<h2 id="develop-fantastic-ui-apps-with-f-and-elmish">Develop fantastic UI apps with F# and Elmish</h2>

<p>Well they say seeing is believing, so let’s see how well F# handles UI development. While React devs on Facebook trying to solve the state problem over and over again by using hooks and perhaps new experimental
recoil and contexts IMHO, all are horrible options as they encourage rendering code inter-mix with business code reminding me asp.net web forms times where you could write your SQL statements right into the page itself.</p>

<p>F# developers have ported elm architecture to something called elmish and it flourished well among F# community.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of things you can do with Elmish as you can write your business code once and port it to any UI platform below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>React: <a href="https://github.com/elmish/react">Elmish React</a></li>
  <li>Windows Desktop: <a href="https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF">Elmish WPF</a></li>
  <li>Gaming: <a href="https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/Xelmish">Xelmish</a></li>
  <li>Cross platform UI: <a href="https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Avalonia.FuncUI">Avalonia.FuncUI</a></li>
  <li>Mobile development: <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous">Fabulous</a></li>
  <li>Terminal: <a href="https://github.com/DieselMeister/Terminal.Gui.Elmish">Terminal.Gui.Elmish</a></li>
  <li>Web Assembly: <a href="https://fsbolero.io/">Bolero</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They all share the same single architecture: Elmish. So you can write your code for one and port it to another.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-and-some-resources">Getting started and some resources</h2>

<p>If you want to get started to F#, the first place you should check out is <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F# Software Foundation</a></p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/fsf2.png" alt="fsharp-foundation"></p>

<p>As you can see FSharp Software Foundation offers mentorship programs periodically, which means you can have a free weekly 1 on 1 session with an experienced F# developer! As of today the program is open for people who want to have an F# mentor or want to be
an F# mentor. You can apply from <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKgZaAcjf7ZxVqBZzyZcBi609BOc0etBnV5XhR6BMihdyYRw/viewform">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are sold with F# there is one important point to highlight. Do not treat F#, just another language with different syntax especially if you are familiar
with Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, etc. You have to embrace functional programming as a paradigm. F# is a functional-first programming language. In other words,
although F# has OOP syntax as well, it mostly makes sense to use F# when you want to get benefit from functional programming concepts. If you try to program
F# the same way you program other imperative languages you won’t get much benefit.</p>

<p>If you are a C# develeoper and you want to start functional programming with F# this is the go-to book:
<em>Disclaimer: I do not know the author nor I am affiliated with the publisher by any way</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp">Functional programming in C#</a></p>

<p>Although the book is mostly about C#, it will show you how painful to do functional programming with C# and only perhaps then you can develop
some love for F#. Having that said it will also help you to understand some more new coming but confusing features of C# 9 like Records and Pattern matching.
If you think  C# records are for immutability, no they are not. They are for Value semantics and <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/what-is-referential-transparency/#:~:text=In%20functional%20programming%2C%20referential%20transparency,the%20result%20of%20the%20program.">referential transparency</a>.</p>

<p>To try F# right away you may use the following links:</p>

<p>https://try.fsharp.org/</p>

<p>https://fable.io/repl/</p>

<p>https://tryfsharp.fsbolero.io/</p>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>When you are unfamiliar with F# syntax, it might look a bit cryptic. And I have seen some people complained that it is very verbose. On the contrary, I would make a bold claim that F# beats most other languages when it comes to conciseness. You don’t believe me? see it your self (make sure you check all implementations)</p>

<p><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:F_Sharp">F# problems on Rosetta Code</a></p>

<h2 id="a-couple-of-toy-projects-of-mine">A couple of toy projects of mine</h2>

<p>I have developed commercial applications with F#, but as public stuff here are a couple of projects I have built. One is a full blazor/web assembly project:</p>

<p>https://github.com/OnurGumus/FBlazorShop</p>

<p>And the actual app for the 3D bin packing problem, in which items of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each of a fixed given volume in a way that minimizes the number of bins used.</p>

<p>https://github.com/OnurGumus/BinDrake</p>

<p>Trying and learning F# really requires you to dismiss your prejudices and be patient. But in the end, once you master the functional paradigm,
it makes you sleep better as a developer.</p>

            <p>This month marks the tenth anniversary of the <a href="https://ring.nlnog.net/">NLNOG RING</a> project.
In this article we look back on how the project came to be and how it evolved over this past decade.</p>
<h3 id="a-network-engineers-tale">A network engineer’s tale…</h3>
<p>The story of NLNOG RING starts on the <a href="https://nlnog.net/irc/">#nlnog</a> IRC channel, at the end of 2010.
A network engineer received complaints that his customers had difficulty reaching various destinations in several Dutch networks.
The case was a curious one, because the problem would come and go.
Some TCP sessions would establish immediately, whereas others would take multiple attempts before a connection was made.
It was clear something was broken, but locating the root cause proved to be difficult.</p>
<p>To find the source of the problem, the engineer proceeded to ask engineers from other networks for traceroute outputs, gathering data about how packets would travel from their networks to his.
The other engineers were of course happy to help, but because each question had to be answered individually it took a long time to gather the necessary data.
All in all it took several days to get a complete picture and identify a root cause, which turned out to be a faulty backbone link within the fabric of a large Dutch internet exchange point.</p>
<p><img src="https://ring.nlnog.net/images/post/10-years-of-nlnog-ring/original-problem.png" alt="Manual coordination of network troubleshooting" title="Manual coordination of network troubleshooting"></p>
<p>During the surrounding discussion on the IRC channel, seeing the amount of effort it took to collect the required information from different vantage points, the question came up: “What if we had a way for an engineer to access other networks securely, and collect troubleshooting data, without having to wait for the other side?”
Several people immediately offered to dedicate servers or virtual machines to the project, and a few others started building tooling for software installation and user management.
And so, in January 2011, NLNOG RING <a href="http://mailman.nlnog.net/pipermail/nlnog/2011-January/002433.html">was born</a>.</p>
<h3 id="architecture-and-tools">Architecture and tools</h3>
<p>The NLNOG RING is a “looking glass on steroids”. Participants join the project by making a (virtual) server available, hosted inside their own network. In return they gain access to their own shell account on all the machines provided by all other participating networks.</p>
<p>Right from the start we were conscious of the fact that we would have to manage a potentially large number of systems with a small group of volunteers.
To do this in a time-efficient manner we deployed <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a> on all provided systems.
This allowed us to install software tools and configure users in a centralized manner.
To further limit the scope of work we decided to support only a single operating system: <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/what-is-an-ubuntu-lts-release">Ubuntu LTS</a>.
For security we did not want to rely on passwords. All user access is controlled through SSH keys and there is no superuser access for any of the participants.</p>
<p>The basis of the NLNOG RING is a shell account, which offers a lot of freedom to participants to run their own troubleshooting scripts or programs.
To add extra value to this, each machine is provisioned with a collection of commonly used network troubleshooting tools.
We provide a DNS-interface and a <a href="https://ring.nlnog.net/toolbox/restful-api/">RESTful API</a> for retrieving participant and node information, and we have a regular BGP <a href="http://lg.ring.nlnog.net/">looking glass</a> providing insight into many networks.</p>
<p>NLNOG RING is a community project.
Over the years, many people have contributed tools and code to make the project more useful.
One of the first tools was <a href="https://github.com/NLNOG/nlnog-ring/blob/master/scripts/ring-trace">ring-trace</a>, a piece of software to run traceroutes from different vantage points, and display them in a graphical format.</p>
<p><img src="https://ring.nlnog.net/images/post/10-years-of-nlnog-ring/trace-ring.nlnog.net.jpeg" alt="Example of ring-trace output" title="Example of ring-trace output"></p>
<p>Another user-contributed tool is <a href="https://github.com/NLNOG/ring-sqa">ring-sqa</a>, a piece of software that attempts to automatically detect connectivity problems between NLNOG RING nodes and notifies their owners.
Events are also correlated to detect larger, sometimes Internet-wide outages, which are published on a <a href="http://sqa.ring.nlnog.net/">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2013 we also cooperate with <a href="https://atlas.ripe.net/">RIPE Atlas</a>, to combine the strengths of the two platforms.
NLNOG RING nodes are selectable as <a href="https://atlas.ripe.net/targets/ringnodes/list/">measurement targets</a> in the RIPE Atlas interface.
Furthermore, the RIPE Atlas <a href="https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/ripe-atlas-tools">tools package</a> is installed on all NLNOG RING nodes, so participants can integrate RIPE Atlas measurements in scripts run on the RING.</p>
<h3 id="operating-model-and-sponsoring">Operating model and sponsoring</h3>
<p>The NLNOG RING was started by a couple of network engineers in their free time, and is still completely run by a small number of volunteers.
All participating networks provide their own machines.
In most cases (75%) this is a VM, making the barrier to participate very low.</p>
<p>At the start of the project all management tooling was running on infrastructure from <a href="https://intouch.eu/">InTouch</a>, the employer of one of our founding volunteers.
As the project grew the requirement for some dedicated management infrastructure arose.
In 2013 we successfully held a <a href="https://ring.nlnog.net/post/ring-fundraiser-successfully-closed/">fundraiser</a>, which enabled us to obtain the necessary hardware for hosting our management tooling.
Over the years more <a href="https://ring.nlnog.net/patrons/">sponsors</a> donated resources. These generous donations help us to run the project on essentially zero budget.</p>
<h3 id="growth">Growth</h3>
<p>Because the project originated within the Dutch ISP community, the first participants were all Dutch network operators.
After giving our first public presentation at <a href="https://ripe62.ripe.net/presentations/176-JobSnijders_NLNOG_RING_RIPE62.pdf">RIPE62</a> in May of 2011, ISPs from outside The Netherlands also showed interest in participating.
While The Netherlands is still the country with the most active participants (93 nodes as of January 2021), the majority of participants is based elsewhere.
At the time of writing we have 472 participating autonomous systems, with (virtual) machines in <a href="http://map.ring.nlnog.net/">56 countries</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ring.nlnog.net/images/post/10-years-of-nlnog-ring/ring-map=january-2021.png" alt="Map of NLNOG RING nodes (January 2021)" title="Map of NLNOG RING nodes (January 2021)"></p>
<p>Supporting all these machines was significantly increasing in load on our central Puppet server, to a point where in 2016 configuration of a single machine would take more than 30 minutes.
In addition to this we were facing the planned obsolescence of Puppet 2, which meant we would have to rewrite a significant part of our configurations to a syntax supported by Puppet 3.
Altogether a good opportunity to re-evaluate our architecture.</p>
<p>After evaluating several configuration management systems we decided on <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, mostly because of its support for a masterless “pull” model.
In this model all servers download their latest configs from a source code repository, and apply their changes locally.
This removes the need for a centralized management server, which means we can scale to a virtually unlimited number of machines.
All configuration files are published on our <a href="https://github.com/NLNOG/ring-ansible/">GitHub repository</a>, so that all participants can contribute.</p>
<p>To further cope with the increased growth in participants and machines we automated <a href="https://ring.nlnog.net/toolbox/health-monitoring/">health monitoring</a>, to automatically notify participants of problems with the (virtual) machines they provided to us.</p>
<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>In ten years the NLNOG RING has grown from a handful of machines in the Netherlands to over 500 nodes worldwide, and we continue to see the number of active nodes grow.
To scale the platform further we plan to invest some time in building more self service tooling for provisioning of machines.
Another item high on our wishlist is a graphing solution that displays latency and packet loss on the full mesh of network paths between all nodes.
We will also continue to add features and tools <a href="https://github.com/NLNOG/ring-ansible/issues">requested</a> by participants.</p>
<p>We of course hope to continue to see a diverse set of ISPs join the project. The success of the project largely depends on the networks that provide us with resources. We thank all <a href="https://ring.nlnog.net/participants/">current participants</a> for making the NLNOG RING a huge success! Tell your friends to join too!</p>

The crumbling of Google’s cornerstone</p>
<p>Search was Google’s only unambiguous win, as well as its primary source of revenue, so when Amazon rapidly surpassed Google as the top product search destination, Google’s foundations began to falter. As many noted at the time, the online advertising industry experienced a major shift from search to discovery in the mid-2010s.</p>
<p>While Google protected its monopoly on the dying search advertising market, Facebook — Google’s biggest competitor in the online advertising space — got on the right side of the trend and dominated online advertising with its in-feed native display advertising.</p>

January 31, 2021 | https://www.swyx.io/create_luck/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.swyx.io/create_luck/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>My entire worldview changed when I realized that <strong>luck can be created</strong>.</p>
<p>More precisely, you can actively <strong>create optimal conditions for lucky things to happen to you</strong>. The more I looked into this, the more I realized that this is not only <em>not</em> a new insight, but successful people have studied this for <em>decades</em> and I am just late to the party.</p>
<p>In this post we'll briefly review the "Literature of Luck", and then I'll end with some personal thoughts on how it could be extended.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="binary-luck"><a href="#binary-luck">Binary Luck</a></h2>
  <p>Most people have a binary view of luck:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kgd335km9x3ujfmhxnz7.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>This is true enough. Some people are born into privilege, some people just win some literal or figurative lottery or other.</p>
  <p>The closing question of every episode of Guy Raz's <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this">How I Built This</a> podcast asks successful people: <em>"How much of your success is due to skill, and how much is due to luck?"</em></p>
  <p>Those who believe in their own agency answer the former. Others - who've seen people smarter and harder working than them fail - answer the latter. Those who are politically correct cop-out with the half-and-half.</p>
  <p>It can be comforting to subscribe to the binary luck model. If you just got a bad roll of the dice, there's nothing you could do. Your lack of success is not your fault.</p>
  <p>But what if I told you <strong>there are people who have skill at creating luck</strong> for themselves?</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="luck-surface-area"><a href="#luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</a></h2>
  <p>Jason Roberts coined the term "<a href="https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</a>", and it was expanded by <a href="https://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2019/04/03/increase-your-luck-surface-area-to-get-more-customers/">Sean Murphy</a> and popularized by <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous">Patrick McKenzie</a>.</p>
  <p>I liken this model of luckiness to a "catchment area" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchment_area">a term from urban and hydrological geography</a>). Luck is still randomly occurring, but you can position yourself in a way that captures more of it:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ogbkk8weenqb9nltrl34.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>Jason has a really simple model of how to grow your LSA - do more things, and tell more people about it. <strong>Doing and Telling</strong>. Already this embodies a more active attitude toward how you can orient your life for more positive random events. It's "<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Fixed vs Growth mindset</a>" adapted for luck.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="four-kinds-of-luck"><a href="#four-kinds-of-luck">Four Kinds of Luck</a></h2>
  <p>A parallel, older school of thought dates back to James Austin in 1978 and was repopularized by <a href="https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html">Marc Andreesen</a> in 2007, then <a href="https://twitter.com/nivi/status/1094940675353784320?lang=en">Naval and Nivi</a> a decade later.</p>
  <p>Here, there are no helpful visuals. James Austin just gives a list of types, and Marc quotes verbatim. <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1093981014920052736">Naval summarizes</a> the 4 kinds of luck as such:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Hope luck finds you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Hustle until you stumble into it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I've quoted this many times to friends and always had trouble remembering what the 4 types are. I gave it some thought and visualized/organized it as such:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5ycsicfgoxsvxoyys5ip.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>🌱 Accidental Luck</strong>: You have the same luck as a plant. A plant does not move. Whether or not a plant does well pretty much just depends on where it's seed lands. It's not very interesting since by definition you can't do anything about it, but ofc privilege plays a huge part.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>🏃🏽‍♀️ Active Luck</strong>: The luck you get from constantly moving around. There's no particular direction in mind, but you're more likely to find something good if you move around and explore instead of stay put and hope. You're more likely to roll a 6 if you roll more dice.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"I have never heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down." - <a href="https://due.com/blog/keep-going-charles-f-kettering/">Charles Kettering</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"You don’t get extreme results without extreme actions." - <a href="https://sive.rs/extremex">Derek Sivers</a></p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>💊 Prepared Luck</strong>: The luck you get from noticing that something lucky has happened, that most would miss. The canonical story on this is Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, which was a huge medical breakthrough. The discovery was a total accident (some mold happened to fall in the right spot + Fleming happened to see it + he had a similar experience that was a nonevent 9 years ago), but Fleming was not only "uniquely equipped to observe it" by his background, he took action to confirm the observation.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity." - Seneca</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Chance favors the prepared mind." - Louis Pasteur</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”" - <a href="http://themattheweffect.org/tag/richard-feynman/">Gian-Carlo Rota</a></p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>🧲 Magnetic Luck</strong>: <em>"Chance IV comes to you, unsought, because of who you are and how you behave."</em> All sources call it "individualized action" but I've renamed it "magnetic luck" to emphasize the end result rather than how you get there. I'm quite familiar with this as <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learning-gears/#miner">the "Miner" gear of my Learning Gears</a> terminology (since updated to 4 gears in <a href="https://learninpublic.org/">my book</a>). This was already a thing pre-Internet, but search and social media have given tremendous reach and influence to the oddballs and obsessives that become the spiritual leaders of every idea and purpose both big and niche.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>I find the 4 of these hard to remember, so I've organized them along two axes - <strong>active vs passive</strong>, and <strong>general vs individual</strong>. The first axis is the same realization as "Luck Surface Area" - you actually have the power to do things to create more luck than you were given.</p>
  <p>The second axis is the insight - that there are forms of luck that apply to everyone, and there are forms of luck that are available only to someone in your unique position. There is a you-shaped hole in the universe and you can either passively occupy it or you can become a beacon for some idea or purpose.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="habits-and-strategy"><a href="#habits-and-strategy">Habits and Strategy</a></h2>
  <p>I of course find the Four Kinds of Luck very appealing, since I've quoted it so much to friends that I'm writing this post at all. But upon closer reading I think there's a <em>slightly</em> different direction that is unaddressed by the Four Kinds (I originally thought this was embedded in the Four Kinds, only to discover that it wasn't in the source material and I had completely read my own thinking into it).</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/poue5zg9homy1eo4ml05.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>This model differs in two ways. It treats both axes as a spectrum rather than a 2x2. It also focuses more on <strong>actions</strong> (you can take) rather than <strong>classification</strong> (which are a little more abstract). I've also swapped out "Active vs Passive" for "Active Habits" and "Individual vs General" for "Good Strategy". So my version is more about HOW you get more lucky. It's not very actionable to be "more magnetic", but you can Claim a Domain or Hustle and have a good sense of what those things entail.</p>
  <p>I've written about a few of these ideas in prior posts so I won't elaborate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/marketing-yourself/">Claiming a Domain, Personal Branding</a></li>
    <li>"Copywork" I wrote about in the "Clone Open Source Apps" chapter of the book</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I think <strong>Exploring</strong> and <strong>Prospecting</strong> are worth elaborating here.</p>
  <p><strong>Exploring</strong> (and to a lesser extent Grinding and Copywork) are <strong>Actively Habitual, non Strategic</strong> activities. But this doesn't mean it is bad. I think this is what you do when you take in general life and career advice and apply them to yourself. You know there are a list of <strong>Principles</strong> which are just generally good things to do in life, and trust that you will do well if you do those things (e.g. <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>). Keep doing the "right" things, and "trust the process".</p>
  <p><strong>Prospecting</strong> is a term I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospecting">borrowed from the oil exploration industry</a>. <strong>Prospecting is a highly Active habit, and highly Strategic.</strong> These days, when you look for oil, there is a whole science to handicapping whether or not a plot of land is likely to have oil. You don't know it for a fact, all you're doing is estimating probabilities. Not to get too tautological, but you will be luckier if you can consistently assess and move towards areas where you are more likely to be "lucky". It might look like luck to others, but the motion and intention you invested to get yourself in a position to be lucky was far from random. I've also written many times about how I think strategic <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22&amp;oq=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22">manoeuvring for "Megatrends"</a> is a good idea.</p>

<p>Hey, folks. Sorry it's been a while, but it's been a busy time. Let's start with the bad news first.</p>

<h2>Bad news</h2>

<p>As you know, SuperDuper 3.3.1 cannot copy a volume with Big Sur on it. We're currently blocked on some issues I don't have direct control over, and as such I don't have a new version for you that <strong>fully</strong> supports Big Sur, nor a timeframe for when that will be released.</p>

<p>Right now, as many of you know, v3.3.1 <strong>will</strong> work with non-boot volumes, but it <strong>won't</strong> work with volumes that have macOS on them, because it will try to do some of the things that no longer work in macOS 11.</p>

<p>I know that's been a disappointment, but that's where we are with v3.3.1.</p>

<h2>Good news!</h2>

<p>However, after wracking my brain for <strong>far</strong> too long, I've come up with a <strong>workaround</strong> that will let you make the backups you need to save your files, and to supplement your Time Machine backup. And for that, we need to go Back...to the Future!</p>

<h2>Huh?</h2>

<p>Let me try to explain.</p>

<p>In Catalina, as I explain in <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/breaking_the_tape/">Breaking the Tape</a>, Apple split the startup volume into two parts: the System volume and the Data volume. We did a ton of work that year to support this new setup in a way that was transparent to the user; SuperDuper automatically creates the proper volumes, converts the drives to APFS as needed, etc.</p>

<p>Worked great.</p>

<p>In macOS 10.15.5, though, <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/black_boxes_and_bugs/">Apple broke 3rd party copy tools</a> in a way that couldn't be worked around without the use of <code>asr</code>, a low-level drive copy tool that has its own issues. They fixed that in 10.15.6...but it was a rather ominous sign for the future.</p>

<p>That ominous sign became terrifying reality in macOS 11. Due to the new Sealed System Volume, use of <code>asr</code> became mandatory if you wanted to make a copy that was bootable. And even <strong>that</strong> didn't work <strong>at all</strong> until <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/big_sur/">November 5th</a> of last year—just before Big Sur's official release.</p>

<p>Even now, as of the time of this writing, <code>asr</code> won't make a bootable copy of an M1-based Mac.</p>

<p>So, as of Big Sur, 3rd party tools like SuperDuper can no longer make bootable copies on their own. For that, it's <code>asr</code> or nothing.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2007/06/13/a-very-sweet-solution/">a <em>very</em> <strong>sweet solution</strong></a>.</p>

<p>But, 3.3.1 doesn't know that. It tries to do all the special stuff that we had to do for Catalina, and those things no longer work. And so, as you've seen, that copy generates errors or seems to hang right at the start (because it's thrown exceptions that stop the copy).</p>

<h2>Didn't You Say "Good News"?</h2>

<p>I'm getting there.</p>

<p>SuperDuper! 3.3.1's magic was all about dealing with the split startup volume. It built on the APFS support and scheduling fixes we put into the previous version...and added new things for compatibility with Catalina.</p>

<p>But...what if it <strong>didn't</strong> do that? What if SuperDuper was...<strong>stupider</strong>?</p>

<h2>Wonderfully Awful</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oUUdW2bTa3Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I've been testing this out for a while in-house. and I've come up with a weird-sounding workaround that...works!</p>

<p>Basically, you can use SuperDuper to copy the Data volume of the volume group. The result contains all <strong>your</strong> data and applications, can be restored in a few different ways...and can even be made bootable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that, as I indicated above, M1 Macs <strong>can't readily boot from external drives</strong>. There are things you can do, if you have an external Thunderbolt 3 drive (USB-C isn't sufficient), but even that won't work if the internal drive is dead. Unless things change, bootable backups are basically a thing of the past on M1-based Macs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>It's actually easy. To accomplish this, use an old version of SuperDuper—<a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/downloads/SuperDuper!+3.2.5.dmg">specifically, v3.2.5</a>—to copy the Data volume, which is shown in the older version!</p>

<p>v3.2.5 is well tested, having been on the market for quite some time, and is reliable. So we don't have to worry about doing a broad beta test of a partially complete new release. It's already tested, and I've been busy doing the additional testing necessary to prove it works on Big Sur.</p>

<p>Again, this will make a copy of the data that you need to preserve <strong>your</strong> stuff, both Applications and Data, while leaving the Sealed System Volume alone.</p>

<p>And it's a valid source for "restore" during a clean install or migration! So restoration is <strong>easy</strong> and <strong>fast</strong> should it become necessary.</p>

<h2>Neat!</h2>

<p>Yeah, I wish I had thought of this earlier.</p>

<p>So, if you're on Big Sur, and you want to copy a startup drive, here's what to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have your license information handy. You can retrieve it from SuperDuper's Register... page should you need to.</li>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/downloads/SuperDuper!+3.2.5.dmg">SuperDuper! v3.2.5 from here</a>.</li>
<li>Remove SuperDuper! from the Security &amp; Privacy preference pane and restart your Mac. This is important, and works around an Apple bug triggered by the change of SuperDuper!'s bundle ID.</li>
<li>Run SuperDuper and follow the steps to add it back into Security &amp; Privacy.</li>
<li>If your license is missing, re-enter it from your license email. </li>
<li>Turn off "Check for Updates" in our Preferences so we don't nag you about v3.3.1.</li>
<li>Select the "Data" volume in the source pop-up, and a <strong>new</strong> APFS backup volume in the destination pop-up, along with "Backup - all files" (or whatever script you want).
&gt; If you already have a backup volume, you can use Disk Utility to delete <strong>just</strong> the System volume, rather than create a new one. After doing this, you may need to repair it with Disk First Aid before it will show up in SuperDuper.</li>
<li>Make your copy as normal, set up your schedule as needed, etc. Your regular Smart Updates will work as expected.</li>
</ol>

<p>To fully restore, it's easiest to boot to recovery, erase the internal drive you want to restore to, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904">reinstall the OS from Recovery mode</a>, and then, when prompted to restore during the first boot of the fresh copy of macOS, point at the backup. All your data and applications will be brought in automatically.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to make the backup bootable and have an Intel Mac, boot to Recovery (Cmd+R during power on) and install Big Sur to the backup drive. You can then start up from the backup. Note, though, that once made bootable, you can no longer copy <strong>to</strong> the backup until you delete the system volume as above. So <strong>don't</strong> do this unless you need to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Forward-Looking Statements</h2>

<p>It seems clear that the future of bootable backups is unclear.</p>

<p>M1 Macs <strong>can't</strong> be copied in a way that makes them bootable. Bare metal recovery on an M1 Mac isn't possible, since they depend on the contents of their internal drive even when booting externally. And the tools required to make bootable copies of Intel Macs are limited, often fail, and produce inscrutable and undocumented diagnostics when they do.</p>

<p>Everything's a tradeoff, and with the M1 Macs, Apple has given us an amazing new platform, while taking away some of the things that made macOS such a joy to work with. And one of those things is bootable backups.</p>

<p>I have <strong>no idea</strong> if this is going to change for the better in whatever the next macOS version brings, and have no insight into Apple's future plans.</p>

<p>But I <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/practices_make_perfect_backups/">continue to advise multiple backup strategies</a>, including Time Machine (to an APFS volume under Big Sur), SuperDuper! (for a simple copy of your data and applications) and an online backup program (as a last resort).</p>

<p>With that, back to plugging away at a new version.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and for using SuperDuper.</p>

<p>Since 2014 I have been slowly (very slowly) building <a href="https://github.com/conwaysgame/">implementations of Conway’s Game of Life for different programming languages and technologies</a>.</p>

<p>Most recently I set out to write a version of the Game of Life which “runs on Ethereum”. In other words, it’s a Smart Contract. In other words, it’s a Distributed App (Dapp). In other words, it’s a small application written in Solidity. There are many ways to describe it but the coolest way, in my opinion is, “it’s Conway’s Game of Life for Ethereum.”</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out</h2>

<p>As I’ll explain later, I decided not to deploy this on the Ethereum main-net, so if you want to play with it, you can do so using the Rinkeby Test Network - or you can just watch as others do.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visit <a href="https://conwaysgame.github.io/solidity-ethereum/">the web application</a>.</li>
  <li>See the current state of the world.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Get some ETH from the <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">Rinkeby Faucet</a>.</li>
  <li>Transfer 0.00001 ETH to the contract address (and pay the gas charge) listed on the page<br>(you can do this easily via MetaMask, or just manually).</li>
  <li>Check the web app again, the state of the world should have changed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d recommend also installing <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en">MetaMask</a>, or using <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> as your browser, in order to make transactions more easily.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="howd-i-do-it">How’d I do it?</h2>

<p>I started by completing <a href="https://techbrij.com/hello-world-smart-contract-solidity-ethereum-dapp-part-1">a Hello World tutorial by Brij Mohan</a>, and then started from scratch with a new project. This involved using Truffle, a CLI to help with writing and interacting with smart contracts and Ganache, a personal ethereum blockchain (for much quicker development), among some more common JavaScript tools.</p>

<p>I did it entirely using TDD, so I wrote my tests first (in JavaScript, thank goodness) and then slowly but surely implemented the rules of the game.</p>

<p>I’ve written many Games of Life, but this was the most challenging.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<h3 id="unforgiving">Unforgiving</h3>

<p>Before starting, I vaguely knew that the more work my contract did, the more ‘expensive’ it was to run. So I focused on trying to make it efficient. Normally when implementing the game of life, I create a two-dimensional array to represent the world, loop through all the possible neighbours of each cell and I check if it is on or off the grid. With the languages I’ve used so far this is straightforward: many allow signed, negative integers for indexes and automatically allocate memory, and often won’t complain if I’m referencing an element which doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>With Solidity, I tried to make sure I wasn’t going to even <em>try</em> to reference a position in the grid that didn’t exist (such as <code>-1</code>), since I’d then need to handle an error. It’s definitely better to <em>avoid</em> an error here.</p>

<p>In an effort to make my contract more efficient, I tried to avoid allocating too much memory for a number, e.g., 16 bits when all I needed was 8. I also tried to avoid switching between byte arrays and strings, when replacing the old world with the new one, so that less casting would be necessary.</p>

<p>Thanks to some very helpful compilers and interpreters doing most of this work for me, my usual programming work (mostly JavaScript) doesn’t often involve quite so much decision-making around integer sizes. This was surprisingly fun and a very different challenge than usual.</p>

<h3 id="deployment---too-much-gas">Deployment - too much Gas?!</h3>

<p>After I got it all working, I started learning more seriously about the cost of Ethereum transactions. It turns out that despite all this thought about performance and the runtime cost, I had inadventedly made my contract expensive even to deploy onto a network.</p>

<p>Ethereum has this concept of “gas.” Each time you perform a transaction of any kind (send ETH, deploy smart contract, interact with smart contract, etc) the initiating party must offer some ETH to the various miners on the network whose hardware processes the transactions. “One gas” is worth an amount in “Gwei”, which is a denomination of the currency worth 0.000000001 ETH. That amount can be set by the person initiating, but the recommended price is a value which fluctuates based on supply and demand.</p>

<p>With all of this in mind, I decided to find out how much it might cost to deploy in a fiat currency such as the US Dollar. I opened up <code>truffle console</code> to estimate the gas by running <code>ConwaysGameOfLife.new.estimateGas()</code>, looked up how much 1 gas would be on the main-net at <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/">https://ethgasstation.info/</a>, and found out the rate of ETH to USD. This is how I worked out the cost.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>gasPrice = 145                        # Obtained from ethgasstation
gasTxCost = 722539                    # Obtained using `estimateGas()`
ethToUSDPrice = 1305.33               # Obtained from Google
costInGwei = gasPrice * gasTxCost     # =&gt; 104768155
costInETH = costInGwei * 0.000000001  # =&gt; 0.104768155
costInUSD = costInETH * ethToUSDPrice # =&gt; $136.76
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s $136.76 USD at the time of writing. This is hypothetical, until I decide to deploy to the main-net.</p>

<p>To me, for a fun little project which probably nobody would use, that price was too high. I don’t know how much I’d be willing to spend, but $136.76 is too much.</p>

<p>I Googled how to improve the efficiency of a contract’s deployment and found <a href="http://article.nadiapub.com/IJGDC/vol10_no12/6.pdf">this little paper</a>. So I got rid of some variables and hard-coded the values instead, among other changes. With each change, I’d run <code>truffle compile</code> and <code>estimateGas()</code>.</p>

<p>First, I got it down to <strong>708,354 gas</strong>, then <strong>644,904 gas</strong>. Then it went up again to <strong>695,936 gas</strong>; some things I did made it worse. Unintuitively, using larger integer types such as <code>uint</code> (256 bits) instead of smaller (<code>uint8</code>) reduces gas costs.</p>

<p>I also experimented with increasing the size of the world from 5x5 to 10x5. That brought the deployment price up to <strong>652,508 gas</strong> and the transaction price to <strong>106,708 gas</strong>. Committing to this, though, would mean re-doing the tests since the size is now hardcoded in the contract. By this point, I had sunk more than enough time into it.</p>

<p>In the end, I settled on a solution with these hypothetical costs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deployment price: <strong>611,944 gas</strong>, which would be equivalent to about $115.82.
    <ul>
      <li>Saving: <strong>110,595 gas</strong>, or $20.93.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Transaction price: <strong>72,213 gas</strong>, which would be equivalent to about $13.66.
    <ul>
      <li>Saving: <strong>298,057 gas</strong>, or $56.41.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I was happy with this amount of rewriting in order to get a more efficient contract working.</p>

<h3 id="networks">Networks</h3>

<p>I’ve become quite familiar with the concept of “Web 3.0.” In this “version” of the web, everything is distributed across a network rather than centralised in servers and served up to clients. It would appear though that for the time being, the only part of traditional web app which gets distributed is the backend.</p>

<p>In order to interact with this backend from a web browser, I had to install <code>web3</code>, a JavaScript API for Ethereum, which involved a lot of async <code>await</code> statements and polling.</p>

<p>In this world, rather than my backend being located at an IP address, resolved by a domain such as <code>gameoflife.com</code>, it’s located at an Ethereum address which is resolved by a contract name such as <code>GameOfLife</code>, which may or may not be on the specified network.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting paradigm shift, but interacting with it through a web browser currently still involves using traditional HTTP-based servers. Maybe there’s a future where that isn’t the case?</p>

<h2 id="whyd-i-do-it">Why’d I do it?</h2>

<p>The future of cryptocurrency is uncertain, and my feelings about the subject change every day. However, Bitcoin and Ethereum are in the news a lot right now, so it feels relevant. There is a chance there’ll be more demand for smart contracts and developers who know how to work with them in the future. It feels important for me to keep on learning new skills not only to progress my career, but to make life more interesting.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-put-it-on-the-main-net">Why not put it on the main-net?</h2>

<p>As I explained earlier, the gas price for deployment is fairly high. After showing it to a few Ethereum enthusiasts, I came to the conclusion that there was no need to spend the money, buy the ETH and put it on the main-net. There are better uses of this blockchain out there than Conway’s Game of Life. My goal here was experimentation and learning, both of which I achieved with the Rinkeby test network. Oh, and if you come across a contract called <code>ConwaysGameOfLife</code> on the main-net, unless I edit this post and mention it here, it isn’t mine!</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<p>I learned that writing basic Smart Contracts for Ethereum isn’t too tricky - like with any sofware, there’s an input and an output. The challenge, as expected, was getting my environment set up. It wasn’t too difficult to do that, though.</p>

<p>I also learned how one can create an interface between “web 2.0” applications and “web 3.0” applications, and the tooling available for that is pretty decent too. <span id="sendEthBlock">For instance, if I wanted to <a href="#">ask for a donation in ETH I could make it super easy with a JavaScript function</a>.</span></p>

<p>Also, a mind to application performance means a heck of a lot more when the operating cost can be measured in direct, immediate currency transactions, as opposed to a some-time-in-the-future slight increase in AWS fees over time, for example.</p>

        Cheops-pyramid (pyramid of Khufu)<a name="khufu"></a></h2>
      <p>Of the the famous Seven Wonders of the Ancient World the Great Pyramid 
        of Khufu (Cheops) at Giza is the only one still standing. Even for modern 
        men it is amazing how this man-made structure lasted so long. </p>
      <p>The Giza pyramids must have made an incredible visual impact - at the 
        edge of the desert three abstract geometrical symbols were rising, huge 
        luminous white triangles reflecting the blinding light of the sun! </p>
      <p>The pyramids on the Giza plateau are with 146.59m (Khufu / Cheops) and 
        143.87m (Khafre / Chefren) respectively the largest, however there are 
        over 30 major pyramids and a myriad of smaller pyramids in Egypt. </p>

              assuming, that more time had to be used for the huge granite blocks 
              for the King's chamber and for the more difficult upper part of 
              the pyramid, where work went slower than in the lower parts. There 
              probably were also other factors delaying the building of the pyramid

      <p>It is suggested, that the Egyptians used a right angled triangle to determinate 
        the angle of inclination of the pyramid, using the numbers a=11 and b=14 
        with c=17.8 (or a=22 - b=28 - c= 35.6). This determines a so called seked 
        of 5½ palms. <br>

    <p>Though the most common use of git is source code version control, it also works well for maintaining Software configuration files. Consider the case of a Software that receives some data, does some processing based on some parameters provided by the user and generates some results. The user could tinker with the parameters to find the optimal solution. As long as the change history is maintained the user can go back and forth with all the parameter combinations that were tried so far. It is a common approach to save these parameters, settings and user preferences in flat, ini, xml or json files. But once the program ends it wouldn’t be possible to get back to the previous parameter combinations, or to know if someone else accidentally changed the parameters. </p>
<p>Just like checkpoints feature in jupyter notebooks, one could use git to make snapshots of configuration files. It gives all the goodies of a version control system, like change history, tags etc. The user can revert to older configurations using git commands. To integrate this feature into the software, one could use the library <a href="https://libgit2.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">libgit</a>. It is a portable, pure C implementation of the Git core methods. Bindings are available for most of the popular languages like python, ruby, lua, C# etc.</p>
<p>To further demonstrate this use case, let us consider this toy application written in Python with Qt bindings. It converts a color image to binary image. It needs two parameters, a lower threshold and an upper threshold. As the application starts, it creates a git repository to store the configuration file. When the user saves the settings it creates a new commit. As shown in the gif below the git log shows all the commits.</p>

                <p><strong>T</strong><span>here is no one in American government — or perhaps any government — quite like Dr. Anthony Fauci. His position, with its mixture of informal power and public visibility, scientific authority and beltway influence, is sui generis. Few other unconfirmed civil servants have access to as many rooms in the executive interagency; no public official commands as much respect in the world of science and medicine. As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984, he has advised six presidents (and now a seventh) on domestic and global health issues — HIV/AIDS, SARS, Ebola, Zika, and MERS — and overseen decades of research on infectious disease, pandemics, and virology. Under his stewardship, NIAID’s mission has been reshaped around his personage: its priorities are </span><i><span>his</span></i><span> priorities, its research agenda is </span><i><span>his</span></i><span> research agenda. And that agenda has borne fruit: breakthrough treatments for HIV and other deadly diseases and now, a vaccine for Covid-19. As Stanford microbiologist David Relman told </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>New Yorker</span></i><span> in April, “Tony has essentially become the embodiment of the biomedical and public-health research enterprise in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span>Although Fauci has no statutory authority to preside over a public health crisis, he has become the nation’s de facto Doctor-in-Chief during this pandemic. His face — elven and expressive — is the face of the medical establishment’s response to the novel coronavirus. I doubt most Americans can name the (</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/20/biden-surgeon-general-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>outgoing</span></a><span>) U.S. Surgeon General, CDC Director, or Fauci’s nominal boss, the director of the National Institutes of Health (Jerome Adams, Robert Redfield, and Francis Collins, respectively), but everyone knows Dr. Fauci. His plaintive but never pessimistic patter and disarming outer-borough rasp are soothing sonic features of our daily dirge of death, doom, and statistics. I was relieved when I first saw Fauci on TV — sometime in March 2020 — thinking dimly to myself, for the millionth time, “Ah, an adult in the room.” Amid a ceaseless current of chaos and grief, Fauci’s egoless display of competence, his grandfatherly warmth and irony, were ports in a storm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But a comforting bedside manner has done little to mitigate catastrophe. Over 400,000 Americans are dead, twice as many as any other country. Infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are currently at record highs. And although we have a vaccine, the rollout has already been stymied by a dearth of resources and coordination. As one public health expert told <em>The </em></span><i><span>New York Times </span></i><span>on January 17</span><i><span>,</span></i><span> our pandemic response has been “a colossal failure at every level of government.” And herein lies a paradox. America is suffering from a disease outbreak whose morbid scope is the consequence of world-historic negligence. We are desperately and needlessly sick. And yet, the man known as “America’s Doctor,” the undisputed personification of public health research and pandemic preparedness, faces no reputational consequences. On the contrary, Dr. Fauci remains one of our most beloved public figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What explains this? Liberals, who otherwise harshly condemn the federal government’s pandemic response, are especially besotted with the diminutive virologist. For fans of the #Resistance, a well-timed </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dr-anthony-fauci-did-a-facepalm-during-trumps-coronavirus-briefing-2020-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>facepalm</span></a><span> during one of the Mad King’s early soliloquies guaranteed Fauci’s place on a Mount Rushmore of replacement patriarchs, alongside James Comey and Robert Mueller. (Fauci later insisted the gesture was innocuous; he was merely obscuring his face to dislodge a lozenge from his throat.) Still, Democrats’ devotion has never waned. They see in Fauci a lonely champion of “truth” and “facts” in a White House otherwise hostile to “science.” Brad Pitt earned an Emmy nomination for portraying the 80-year-old physician on Saturday Night Live. One Hamilton-inspired TikTok (“My name is Dr. Anthony Fau-CHEE…”) went viral. Just since the beginning of the “third wave” of Covid infections in October, Fauci has received leadership awards from the National Academy of Medicine, the FBI Agents Association, the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, and the Boy Scouts of America. Joe Biden has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/politics/anthony-fauci-biden-transition/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>asked</span></a><span> Fauci to stay on at NIAID and serve in his administration as a chief medical advisor. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser proclaimed “Anthony S. Fauci Day” on December 24.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fauci’s celebrity, however, cannot obscure empirical reality. As America’s Doctor would surely agree, the numbers don’t lie: 2,824 Americans died of Covid-19 on Anthony S. Fauci Day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anthony Fauci is no doubt a dedicated public servant, respected by his colleagues, beloved by many Americans. But the puzzle remains: why has the man most closely associated with the public health response to the pandemic entirely avoided accountability for its failure?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>F</strong><span>irst, the most straightforward defense: it wasn’t his fault. He did the best he could, but Fauci’s better instincts were thwarted by Trump and his coterie of idiots. Of course, there’s truth in this. The uneasy peace between Trump and his medical advisors started to unravel almost before it began. By the end of March, Trump was sweating the stocks and tweeting that the “cure” must not be worse “than the problem itself.” He clashed with Fauci throughout the spring — over masks, hydroxychloroquine, school openings, and Easter. By summer, Trump was publicly lambasting the good doctor, leaking anti-Fauci talking points to the press and sidelining him in task force meetings, which were themselves increasingly rare. Scott Atlas, the libertarian radiologist and herd-immunity advocate whom Trump hired based on his Fox News appearances, was calling the shots.</span></p>
<p><span>But Fauci seldom contradicted the president’s lies outright, opting for tact and de-escalation instead. “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Fauci </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/dr-fauci-press-conference-white-house-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>said</span></a><span> in late March. “OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.” On July 4, Trump said 99 percent of Covid cases were “harmless.” Fauci characterized this as a misinterpretation. (“I’m trying to figure out where the president got that number…” he said.) Though Fauci has a reputation for bluntness, as the </span><i><span>Financial Times</span></i><span>’s Hannah Kuchler </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57834c2c-a078-4736-9173-8fb32cfbbf4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>observed</span></a><span>, “he clearly also tries to hold back, believing he will make a bigger difference to the course of the pandemic if he keeps his job.”</span></p>
<p><span>This logic pervades the most common defense of Fauci’s record. “Tony is unique, in that he has such credibility with politicians that he’s been able to insert hard facts into the conversation,” Nobel laureate biologist David Baltimore told </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>New Yorker</span></i><span> in April. “That has been wonderful for our country and the world.” In this view, Fauci was </span><i><span>handling</span></i><span> Trump, just as he handled previous presidents, including a reluctant Ronald Reagan during the AIDS epidemic. When he pulls his punches, it’s always for the greater good; namely, the cause of remaining in the room. Stepping too far out of line, contradicting Trump with too much vigor, would have imperiled his standing. “The argument for Fauci saying more,” </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/16/anthony-fauci-built-truce-trump-is-destroying-it/?arc404=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>wrote</span></a><span> Molly Roberts in <em>The</em> </span><i><span>Washington Post</span></i><span>, “… is also an argument for self-exile.” And then what? Truth and facts would have had no advocate inside the White House. As Fauci himself </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/health/fauci-trump-covid.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> the </span><i><span>Times</span></i><span> on Sunday, “I felt that if I stepped down, that would leave a void. Someone’s got to not be afraid to speak out the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span>At a briefing in July, Trump </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/politics/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-approval-rating/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>mused</span></a><span>, “It’s interesting: [Fauci’s] got a very good approval rating. And I like that, it’s good. Because remember, he’s working for this administration. He’s working with us.” Winding his way to his point, Trump said, “So why don’t I have a high approval rating… with respect to the virus?” After a pause, he deadpanned, “It can only be my personality, that’s all.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As is often the case with Trump, he had a point, just not the one he meant. The liberal apologia for Fauci </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> internally contradictory. As one scientist said to me, “We can’t deify Fauci’s response to the pandemic as fantastic while simultaneously condemning Trump, when for months, the two were hand in hand.” Indeed, Fauci is only blameless if he was utterly powerless to stop the administration’s disastrous plans. And if he </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> powerless, he should’ve resigned and communicated the truth bluntly to the public long ago. Otherwise, he knowingly lent credibility to an abject failure he couldn’t control.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To put an even finer point on it, the precise conditions that would maximally exonerate Fauci — i.e., Trump is solely at fault; Fauci had no influence — are conditions under which Fauci </span><i><span>absolutely </span></i><span>should have bolted. The more aberrant Trump’s behavior, the more he diverged from the medically prudent course of action, the greater Fauci’s responsibility to leave and blow the whistle. If Fauci knew better but didn’t say, what use was he inside the room? If he </span><i><span>didn’t</span></i><span> know better, then he shares the blame.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In recent days, Fauci and Covid task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx — another veteran AIDS researcher who’s received slightly </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/biden-coronavirus-team-deborah-birx-437923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>less deferential</span></a><span> treatment from the media than her male counterpart — have undertaken a goodwill tour. Birx </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FaceTheNation/status/1353332977560735744?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> CBS that denialists in the White House “derailed” the pandemic response, putting out information she knew to be false. Fauci joked with Rachel Maddow that Trump had </span><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/fauci-to-maddow-i-ve-been-wanting-to-come-on-your-show-for-months-and-months-99905093921" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>forbidden</span></a><span>&nbsp;him from coming on her show and </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/21/anthony-fauci-speaking-covid-liberating-under-biden-vs-trump/4244169001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> the White House press corps, “The idea that you can get up here and… let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling.” Meanwhile, liberal pundits like Ezra Klein have </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/opinion/biden-covid-19-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>praised</span></a><span> Biden’s “maddeningly obvious” Covid plans, describing their simplicity as a “damning indictment” of Trump’s negligence. But if Biden’s life-saving interventions are so straightforward and crucial, why weren’t Fauci and Birx loudly demanding them months ago?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“To keep their jobs” should not be a satisfying answer — not for the living or for the dead.&nbsp;</span></p>

<center><b>Counterfeiting Stock 2.0</b></center>

<p>
Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.
</p>
<p>
<span>Why is This Important?</span> This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans.
</p>
<p>
The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations.
</p>
<p>
The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed—the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.
</p>
<p>
<span>A Glossary of Illogical Terms</span> — The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Broker Dealer or Prime Broker</b> — The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house — also known as a broker's broker.
</li>
<li><b>Hedge Funds</b> — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.
</li>
<li><b>Market Maker</b> — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting.
</li>
<li><b>Short Seller</b> — An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as “the shorts.”
</li>
<li><b>The Securities and Exchange Commission</b> — The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top–level management is a five–person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.
</li>
<li><b>Depository Trust Clearing Corp</b> — Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later.
</li>
<li><b>Short Sale</b> — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back.
<p>This relatively simple process is perfectly legal—so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.
</p></li>
<li><b>Disclosed Short</b> — When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing. 
</li>
<li><b>Naked Short</b> — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud. 
<p>
Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.
</p></li>
<li><b>Fails–to–Deliver</b> — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.
<p>
Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).
</p></li>
<li><b>Options</b> — The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to sell shares (a “put”). Options are an integral part of short manipulations, the result of SEC promulgated loopholes in Reg SHO. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called “out of the money.” If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.
</li>
<li><b>Naked call</b> — The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list. A share of stock that has a naked call as its borrowed shares is marked as a disclosed short when it is sold, even though nobody in the transaction actually owns a share.
</li>

    <p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/fawkes_face_cloaking.jpg" alt="a randomly generated face from ThisPersonDoesNot Exist"></p>
<center><h6><em> This is not the author. It was generated by <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a>.</em></h6></center>

<p>I admitted to myself before I started writing that this probably wasn’t going to succeed. Bad habits were too ingrained for too long. The technology was too easy to use, and now I’m fucked.</p>

<p>Between around 2013 when the first Android device arrived in the Crow’s nest and 2018 when I ditched Google entirely, I’ve uploaded around 12,000 photographs to Google. They’re pictures of myself, of my wife, of my kids, and of the landscapes and scenery where I live and where I visit.</p>

<p>Before that, I used to manually upload similar pics to Facebook, where I would dutifully tag myself, tag my friends, and help train the Facebook AI in recognising me, my friends, and my family to the extent that it probably no longer needs human input.</p>

<p>It’s not like either of the tech giants made my private photos public. I can’t type my name into Google images and see the thousands of images snapped over the years as I travelled the world.</p>

<p>But Google knows exactly what I look like. Facebook knows exactly what I look like. Intelligences owned by both companies have been trained on my features with the massive dataset I provided for them.</p>

<p>If an unknown stranger snaps a picture as I make my way around town or if I’m caught on one of the many security cameras which litter the towns and villages of the British Isles, and that photo makes its way back to one of the behemoths, I can be auto-tagged.</p>

<p>I don’t like this idea.</p>

<p>There’s no particular reason I want to flee from Facebook. Google isn’t gunning for me. I have nothing to hide.</p>

<p>But I don’t like it.</p>

<h2> Privacy is now a privilege</h2>

<p>The photos exist, and they’re out in the wild - during the (very extended) period when I was uploading to Facebook and Google, I didn’t read the Terms of service - dumb, I know, but I was young and naive. While I was <em> vaguely </em> aware that facial recognition would be improved using my pictures, I didn’t thoroughly think through the implications as they applied to the real world - only how cool it would be to not have to tag my pictures by hand. So, young, naive, and incredibly short-sighted to boot.</p>

<p>If you’re so inclined, and if you used the photo sharing platform, Flickr in the last decade or so, you can see which, if any of the facial recognition datasets - which are used by police, security service, and marketers across the world - are using the snaps you uploaded to the platform.</p>

<p>Hop across to <a href="https://exposing.ai/"> Exposing.ai</a> and plug in your Flickr username, photo URL, or #tag, and in a second or so, the tool will run through datasets from VGG Face, People in Photo Albums (PIPA), MegaFace, IARPA Janus Benchmark C, FaceScrub, and DiveFace.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that with the exception of MegaFace, Flickr is a minority contributor to these datasets. Most of the snapshots are acquired through other sources, and are used by commercial operators, police and governments.</p>

<p>Other people may have something to hide. Demonstrators in a crowd may have good reason to resent the fact that captured images of them can be run against the datasets, and their true identity revealed to the relevant authorities.</p>

<p>If you think that’s bad, it gets worse - <a href="https://clearview.ai/"> Clearview AI</a>, an unregulated service, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html"> is used by more than 600 law enforcement agencies and private companies in the US and around the world.</a> Its facial recognition models were built using over 3 billion photos of people from the Internet and social media without their knowledge or permission.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/hong_kong_protests_facial_recognition.jpg" alt="Pro-democracy protest at Hong Kong International airport. August 2019"></p>

<p>But the truth is that it’s their own fault, in allowing their images to be associated with their identity, their online accounts, and every other aspect of their lives.</p>

<h2>Fawkes is the digital equivalent of a false moustache</h2>

<p>But you can’t go through life in disguise, donning a <a href="https://amzn.to/3t7zho9"> Guy Fawkes mask</a> every time you shoot a selfie to send to your paramour. You’d look silly, and the recipient wouldn’t recognise you - which kind of defeats the point of taking the photograph in the first place.</p>

<p>It’s important that <em>real people</em> - including me - can recognise my beautiful visage in photographs, but I’d prefer that I couldn’t be recognised by machines.</p>

<p>Which is where a nifty piece of software called <a href="https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/"> Fawkes </a> comes in.</p>

<p>It was built by researchers at the University of Chicago specifically to baffle the AIs whose job it is to match a face to an identity, while keeping the subject recognisable to a human viewer.</p>

<p>Although Fawkes is as-yet unfinished, and the current release version is v0.31, <a href="https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/#faq">tests </a> have shown protection against “state-of-the-art facial recognition models from Microsoft Azure, Amazon Rekognition, and Face++ are at or near 100%.”</p>

<p>Fawkes runs locally on your computer, and doesn’t need to connect to the Chicago servers once you’ve installed it. I’m not going to attempt to explain <em>how</em> Fawkes works. I’m a man pretending to be a bird, writing humorous and mildly interesting articles for a general audience.</p>

<p>Here’s how its creators describe Fawkes face cloaking technology:</p>

<blockquote>
At a high level, Fawkes "poisons" models that try to learn what you look like, by putting hidden changes into your photos, and using them as Trojan horses to deliver that poison to any facial recognition models of you. Fawkes takes your personal images and makes tiny, pixel-level changes that are invisible to the human eye, in a process we call image cloaking. <p>You can then use these "cloaked" photos as you normally would, sharing them on social media, sending them to friends, printing them or displaying them on digital devices, the same way you would any other photo. The difference, however, is that if and when someone tries to use these photos to build a facial recognition model, "cloaked" images will teach the model an highly distorted version of what makes you look like you. </p><p>The cloak effect is not easily detectable by humans or machines and will not cause errors in model training. However, when someone tries to identify you by presenting an unaltered, "uncloaked" image of you (e.g. a photo taken in public) to the model, the model will fail to recognize you.
</p></blockquote>

<p>I recently had cause to upload a photograph of my face to a new work-related Slack group (Yes. The crow <em> does </em> have a day job (sort of)), and I thought this was the perfect opportunity to put Fawkes to the test.</p>

<p>I cropped a headshot from a family picture, dumped it in the Fawkes directory, and let rip. The process took around a minute, and the fans of my <a href="https://thecrow.uk/gpd-p2-max-ultrabook-cyberdeck-review/"> teeny tiny laptop</a> went into overdrive. This was for one cropped photo.</p>

<p>The result was OK. It was still very recognisably me, athough there was something slightly different around the eyes, and the resolution was <em> slightly</em> off. But it was definitely me, and if I had a mind to, I could hang it on my hallway wall. Guests would ask me, “Crow, why do you have a photograph of yourself on the hallway wall.” So yes, it holds up to being recognisable by people, but not recognisable by machine - which was the point of the exercise.</p>

<p>I’m not going to show you this photo, instead, here’s a Fawkes-treated example using AI generated images from <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/fawkes_cloaked_face.jpg" alt="An AI generated model from thispersondoesnotexist.com cloaked using Fawkes"></p>

<p>Yes. There are visible differences, and some artefacts I’d prefer were not present, but it is still recognisably the same person, and remember - Fawkes is currently only on version 0.31. It’s a work in progress.</p>

<p>The fans kicked in after 18 seconds, and the entire process took 77.842498 seconds. That’s a lot for a single picture. If I were to apply cloaking to my entire photo album (kept locally, not online), my machine would need to be running Fawkes for 270 hours straight.</p>

<p>And there is a limit to how much Fawkes will help me, personally. I surrendered my 12,000 or so images to Facebook and Google years ago, and it’s safe to assume that they’re already part of the dataset.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve disengaged from social media altogether. No photos of me have been uploaded in the last two years or so (at least by me).</p>

<p>To poison the model, I would need to re-engage. I would need a new Facebook account tied to my real name and identity and I would have to upload handfuls of Fawkes-doctored selfies and snapshots every day before it would begin to make a difference. I would be spamming Facebook, Google, Flickr, Pinterest, and every other outlet I could think of. It would be almost a full-time job, and I would be disclosing different information which would otherwise have remained private.</p>

<p>It’s a difficult one. All I can <em>really</em> do is run Fawkes going forwards, and write this article to help any other people who may benefit from it in the future.</p>

<p>Spread the word.</p>

Canada also has pre-existing summer school programs designed to help students catch up.&nbsp;Ontario, for instance, funds two- to three-week summer programs. They are&nbsp;offered by nearly every school board in the province&nbsp;to support students with learning loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>Beyond what's in place, Ontario is exploring measures to support learning recovery and working on a further plan to target learning loss "head on —&nbsp;with enhanced supports for reading and math for all students, for vulnerable children, including students with exceptionalities and from underrepresented communities," said Caitlin Clark, spokesperson for Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2gV9UBgoCRw" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>Protecting and increasing investments into education&nbsp;is what UNESCO's Giannini&nbsp;wants to see.

			<p>I have never used WhatsApp, and never will. Despite this, I still feel the need to write an article about WhatsApp since it’s the perfect case study to help understand a class of businesses models I call “user domestication”. The domestication of users is high on my list of problems plaguing the human race, and is worth a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>WhatsApp wasn’t the first instant messenger of its kind, and probably won’t be the last. I simply chose to focus on WhatsApp since its recent privacy issues have made it a hot topic.</p>
<p>With the meta-explanation out of the way, let us begin.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-rise">WhatsApp’s rise</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a tool that makes it convenient and easy to help Facebook further its core mission: the optimization and auctioning of human behavior (colloquially known as “targeted advertising”). It originally persuaded people to consent to this by allowing them to send text to each other over the Internet, something that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols">already possible</a>, and combining an easy-to-learn UI with successful marketing. It then expanded to include features such as free voice and video calls. Free calls helped it grow to become the de-facto communication platform many regions. I’m stunned at its ubiquity every time I visit my extended family in India; I’m frequently greeted by looks of confusion when I remind them that I don’t use WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Having its own proprietary chat system incompatible with other clients allowed WhatsApp to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>: WhatsApp’s existing users were held captive by the fact that leaving WhatsApp meant losing the ability to communicate with WhatsApp users. People switching from WhatsApp must convince all their friends to switch, too; this includes less technically inclined friends who had a hard time learning WhatsApp in the first place.</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp world, people who want to keep in touch must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can only use the proprietary WhatsApp client to send messages; developing alternative clients isn’t supported.</li>
<li>Everyone’s mobile device must run an operating system supported by said client. Since WhatsApp developers will only write a client for popular operating systems, the Android and iOS duopoly strengthens.</li>
<li>Users fully depend on WhatsApp developers. If WhatsApp developers decide to include user-hostile features in the app, users must go with it. They can’t switch to a different server or client without switching away from WhatsApp and losing the ability to communicate with all their WhatsApp contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-domestication">User domestication</h2>
<p>WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in <strong>user domestication:</strong> the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors.</p>
<p>I chose this metaphor because animal domestication is a gradual process that isn’t always deliberate, and typically revolves around one group becoming dependent upon another. For example: there’s evidence that domestication of dogs began with socialization, resulting in not-entirely-artificial selection promoting genes that resulted in more friendliness with and dependence upon humans.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether it happens on purpose or by accident, user domestication almost always follows the same three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high level of dependence given from users to a software vendor</li>
<li>An inability for users to control their software, through at least one of the following methods:
<ol>
<li>Preventing modification of the software</li>
<li>Preventing migration onto a different platform</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The exploitation of now-captive users who are unable to resist</li>
</ol>
<p>The completion of the first two steps left WhatsApp users vulnerable to user domestication. With investors to answer to, they had every incentive to implement user-hostile features without consequence.</p>
<p>So, of course, they did.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-descent">WhatsApp’s descent</h2>
<p>Domestication has a purpose: it enables a master species to exploit the domesticated species for its own gain.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with its parent, Facebook. Users who agreed to use WhatsApp under its previous privacy policy had two options: agree to the new policy or be unable to use WhatsApp again. The WhatsApp privacy policy update is a classic bait-and-switch: WhatsApp lured users in with a sleek interface and the impression of privacy, domesticated them to remove their autonomy to migrate, and then backtracked on its previous commitment to privacy with minimal consequence. Each step in this process enabled the next; had user domestication not taken place, it would be easy for most users to switch away with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Those of us who were sounding the alarm a few years ago experienced a brief moment of sadistic bliss when our titles were upgraded from “annoying and paranoid conspiracy theorists” to just “annoying”.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt-at-damage-control">An attempt at damage control</h3>
<p>The bait-and-switch operation incurred backlash significant enough for a noticeable minority of users to actually migrate; this number turned out to be slightly more than the rounding error WhatsApp was likely expecting. In response, WhatsApp delayed the change and published the following ad:</p>
<picture>
	<source srcset="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad_dark.3e9ad6a0c2c8c377c4583cf92bddcd47.avif" type="image/avif" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">

	<source srcset="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.94ed78578e240dfd57f833807f8167ed.avif" type="image/avif">

	<img width="600" src="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.png" alt="WhatsApp ad describing data not collected">
</picture>

<p>The ad lists various data that WhatsApp doesn’t collect or share. Allaying data collection concerns by listing data <em>not</em> collected is misleading. WhatsApp doesn’t collect hair samples or retinal scans either; not collecting that information doesn’t mean it respects privacy because it doesn’t change the information WhatsApp <em>does</em> collect.</p>
<p>The ad denies “keep[ing] logs of who everyone is messaging or calling”. Collecting data is not the same as “keeping logs”; it’s possible for metadata to be fed into an algorithm before being discarded. A model can thus learn that two users call each other frequently without keeping logs of the metadata for each call. The fact that they specifically chose to phrase this line around logging implies that WhatsApp either already collects this class of data or has deliberately left the door open to collecting it in the future.</p>
<p>A stroll through WhatsApp’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124061525/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">actual privacy policy</a> at the time reveals that they do collect considerable metadata used for marketing through Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="software-freedom">Software freedom</h2>
<p>With user domestication, providing useful software to users is a means to the end of exploiting them. The alternative is simple: make serving users the end in and of itself.</p>
<p>To prevent being controlled by software, users must be in control. Software that allows users to be in control is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>. The word “free” in this context refers to freedom rather than price. Software freedom is similar to the concept of open-source, but the latter is focused on practical benefits rather than ethics. A less ambiguous term that neutrally refers to both free and open-source software is <strong><abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">explained</a> the concepts underpinning free software better than I can, so I won’t go into detail. It comes down to four essential freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-money-with-foss">Making money with FOSS</h3>
<p>The most common objection I hear is that FOSS makes it harder to make money.</p>
<p>The key to making money with FOSS is to make software a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Complement">commoditized complement</a> of other, more profitable services. Examples of such services include selling support, customization, consulting, training, managed hosting, hardware, and certifications. Plenty of companies use this approach instead of building proprietary software: Red Hat, Collabora, System76, Purism, Canonical, SUSE, Hashicorp, Databricks, and Gradle are some names that come to mind.</p>
<p>Managed hosting isn’t a basket worth all your eggs if giants like AWS can do the same at a lower price. Being the developer can give an edge in areas like customization, support, and training; it doesn’t offer as obvious an advantage when it comes to hosting.</p>
<h2 id="foss-isnt-always-enough">FOSS isn’t always enough</h2>
<p>Free software is a necessary but sometimes insufficient requirement to build domestication immunity. Two more measures include <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>open platforms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>When software grows too complex, it needs to be maintained by a large team. Users who disagree with a vendor can’t easily fork and maintain a multi-million-line codebase, especially if the software in question potentially contains security vulnerabilities. Dependence on the vendor can grow quite problematic when complexity causes development costs to skyrocket; the vendor might resort to implementing user-hostile features to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Complex software that can’t be developed by a different group of people creates dependence, step one of user domestication. That alone is enough to open the door to problematic developments.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-mozilla-and-the-web">Case study: Mozilla and the Web</h4>
<p>Mozilla was a ray of hope in the browser wars, a space dominated by adtech, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, developing a browser engine is a monumental task difficult enough for Opera and Microsoft to give up and re-skin Chromium. Browsers are more than the document readers they were meant to be: they’ve evolved into application runtimes with their own stacks for GPU acceleration, Bluetooth, permissions, device enumeration, bundled media codecs, <abbr title="digital rights management">DRM</abbr><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, extension APIs, developer tools…the list goes on. It takes billions of dollars a year to respond to vulnerabilities in such a massive attack surface and keep up with a standard that grows at such a worrying rate. Those billions have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Mozilla ended up having to make major compromises to stay afloat. It cut search deals with blatantly user-hostile companies, and bundled the browser with <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">ads</a> and bloatware such as a partially …</p></section></article></div></div>

<h3><time datetime="2020-01-31T21:00:00-00:00">January 31, 2020</time></h3>

</p><div><p>Some months ago, I got curious about ESP32 microcontrollers. The exact reason is not important. I ended up learning about <a href="https://www.nodemcu.com/">NodeMCU</a>, <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a>, <a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/">I<sup>2</sup>C</a>. In the end, I was able to wire up an ESP32 to an OLED screen which showed a small set of rotating fortune cookies.</p>
<p>It turned out to be rather straightforward. I wanted more artificial constraints. After all, I am not doing this for real work. It’s just a different way of having a well defined task that can be accomplished in a short amount of time with a visible outcome. In that sense, it is similar to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/100754/sinan-%c3%9cn%c3%bcr">answering questions on Stackoverlow</a>. I find it helpful in a way others might find meditation helpful.</p>
<p>Before going further, I am know I late to the party. People have been doing this stuf for quite some time now. This gives me the ability to more easily discover how to solve a given problem because others did and wrote blog posts about them years ago.</p>
<p>My search for a <em>reasonably</em> constrained environment led me to <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85" title="ATtiny85 datasheet">ATtiny85</a>. I decided I wanted to do something with it, but I did not know what. So, the first thing I tried was to wire up an ATtiny85 to an OLED screen and display a (now much smaller) set of rotating <a href="https://www.nu42.com/2020/12/small-is-beautiful.html">fortune cookies</a>.</p>
<p>ATtiny85 has 8 kilobytes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">programmable flash</a>, 512 bytes of programmable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM">EEPROM</a>, and 512 bytes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory">SRAM</a>. As I said, for a while I did not know what I wanted to do with it. I would occasionally browse Amazon and order things that looked cheap and fun.</p>
<p><em>Note that in what follows, I will be using shortened Amazon affiliate links to the products I actually bought and used in making this blog post. The advantage of shortened links is that just loading the page does not immediately result in tracking images and cookies to be fetched (of course, if your browser does aggressive <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Link_prefetching_FAQ">link prefetching</a>, all bets are off). Linking to those products do not mean I endorse them or even recommend them. I am just writing about my experience using them.</em></p>
<p>Among the things I bought because it looked cheap at the time was <a title="Amazon afiliate link to Liyafy HC-35 product page" href="https://amzn.to/3raaH4b">Liyafy HC-35 8 LED 4x4 push button matrix keyboard</a>. From my perspective, it looked appealing because it came with no documentation, there were no useful comments or Q&amp;A on the product page, and a Google search only revealed <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=500018.0">an unanswered question from 2017 on the Arduino forums</a>.</p>
<p>In the package were two keypads on a single board with a slight perforation running through the middle. So, I cracked them apart :-) Now, I had two keypads with no documentation. Here is one of them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/liyafy-hc-35-lg.jpg"><img src="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/liyafy-hc-35-sm.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Documentation or not, the task seemed simple to me: There are three banks of pins on the left side of the board. The bottom bank is for manipulating the LEDs, and the two banks above that are for reading the state of the red buttons and the state of the black buttons, respectively. Eight LEDs, eight bits in a byte, not a huge leap to assume that each LED maps to a bit in a byte. It is not really clear whether the LEDs are ordered MSB first or LSB first. I am not good at reading board traces.</p>
<p>So, we need to have eight wires to drive the LEDs. VCC is clearly marked, but I didn’t know whether the board needed 5V or 3.3V. In fact, at first I guessed wrong and tried 5V. It doesn’t seem to have harmed the board, but after the fact, I thought maybe it would have been better to try the lower voltage first :-)</p>
<p>The ATtiny85 has 8 pins in <em>total</em>. We need a further four wires to read the state of the KEY B bank consisting of the red buttons, and we need an additional eight wires to read state of the KEY A bank consisting of the 4x4 keypad. Note the pins on the KEY A bank are labeled <var>L<sub>i</sub></var> and <var>R<sub>i</sub></var> where I would expect L to stand for “line” and R to stand for “row” which seem like the same thing to me. I decided to anchor on “R is row” and “L is column” as a working assumption, and focus solely on getting some lights to blink first.</p>
<p>Before going further, I should note that by the time I got around the thinking about this, a couple of months had gone by. Luckily, I had picked some other bits and pieces I thought might come in handy if I ever got around to trying this. Here is a list of what I ended up using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NNFi97" title="Amazon affiliate link to ATtiny85 10 pack">A ten-pack of ATtiny85 chips</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NNF1TD" title="Amazon affiliate link to Belker 45W/3A AC/DC adapter">Belker 45W 5V 6V 7.5V 9V 12V 13.5V 15V Universal AC DC Power Supply</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3tfScgj" title="Amazon affiliate link to REXQualis Electronics Component Fun Kit">REXQualis Electronics Component Fun Kit</a>
<ul>
<li>Breadboard</li>
<li>Jumper wires</li>
<li>Extra LEDs</li>

<li><a href="https://www.ti.com/product/SN74HC595" title="595 8 bit serial to parallel shifter data sheet">74HC595</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3r5mXmo" title="Amazon affiliate link to Tiny AVR Programmer">Tiny AVR programmer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that stuff you find on Amazon tends to have a markup compared to the unit prices you find when shopping at speciality or overseas suppliers. And, prices on Amazon tend to vary a lot. I was not in a rush, did not have a specific project in mind, and just grabbed a thing or two when I thought the price was right. The Belker adapter is great. I have, of course, a box of wall warts accumulated over time, but with those either the specs turn out not to be what you want (if you can read them) or the tips don’t match etc. Since I bought this, it’s already been useful in multiple other contexts.</p>
<p>Well, I figured the first task was to actually be able to get something on the ATtiny85 to execute. I knew that I needed to install some drivers for the “programmer”, stick the chip in the right way (here’s where the 10-pack comes in handy: If you insert the chip in the wrong way, it burns because you end up swapping VCC and GND and 5V runs through going the wrong way … don’t trust your eyes, triple check before plugging the programmer in to your computer’s USB port). The <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85" title="ATtiny85 datasheet">datasheet</a> has the pin out diagram as well as other good information:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/attiny85-8pin-dip.png"><img title="ATtiny85 8 pin DIP package pinout diagram" alt="[ ATtiny85 8 pin DIP package pinout diagram ]" src="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/attiny85-8pin-dip-thumb.png"></a></p>
<p>I followed <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tiny-avr-programmer-hookup-guide/all">SparkFun’s Tiny AVR programming hookup guide</a> followed by <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/11/01/drawing-on-an-oled-with-an-attiny85-no-ram-buffers-allowed/">Drawing On An OLED With An ATtiny85</a> to produce some output on a <a href="https://amzn.to/3aiv5JA" title="Amazon affilliate link to SSD1306 128x32 OLED 3-pack">128x32 OLED screen</a> to get warmed up.</p>
<p>The next task was to figure out how to drive the LEDs which require 8 wires using the five pins I had at my disposal. So, I started by staring at the contents of the “Fun Kit”. There are only two ICs included in the pack. I did not know what the 4N35 was for (it turned out to be a <a href="https://www.vishay.com/docs/81181/4n35.pdf">light sensor</a>) but it has only six pins, so clearly it could not do anything with mapping one bit at a time (aka serial) output to eight bits at a time (parallel). So, I searched the web for the only other IC in the package, <a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/sipo">74HC595</a>. TI’s page for the product mentions “<a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/ti-595-snip.png">8-bit shift registers with 3-state output registers</a>” right under the product name. To be honest, that didn’t mean any thing to me and I almost navigated away from the page, but scrolling down a little (is it me, or is everything on the web in huge and huger fonts now?) revealed the description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SNx4HC595 devices contain an 8-bit, serial-in, parallel-out shift register that feeds an 8-bit D-type storage register. The storage register has parallel 3-state outputs. Separate clocks are provided for both the shift and storage register. The shift register has a direct overriding clear (SRCLR) input, serial (SER) input, and serial outputs for cascading. When the output-enable (OE) input is high, the outputs are in the high-impedance state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yay! It looks like the “fun kit” includes just the part I needed for this! Good.</p>
<p>Time to learn what the gobbledygook means … It sounds like it’s saying it takes serial input, puts bits in eight bins, and, when you give it the all clear, it puts those zeros and ones on some IO pins. Here is the pin-out:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/SN74HC595-pins.png"><img alt="[ SN74HC595 pin out diagram ]" width="326" src="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/SN74HC595-pins.png"></a></p>
<p><var>Q<sub>A</sub></var> - <var>Q<sub>H</sub></var> are the eight output pins. VCC is VCC, GND is GND. <u>SER</u> better be serial. O̅E̅ is “output enable” meaning put “put the bits you buffered on the pins”. <var>Q<sub>H</sub><sup>′</sup></var> seems to provide the same output serially.</p>
<p>OK, so I need to connect <var>Q<sub>A</sub></var> - <var>Q<sub>H</sub></var> to the LED inputs … I think I did this the “wrong” way by connecting <var>Q<sub>A</sub></var> to <var>D<sub>1</sub> on the keypad, but at this stage, I didn’t care what lit up … just that something did.</var></p>
<p>The big question is what to do with the five other pins. How do I drive them from the ATtiny85? I was confronted with a choice: I could read the datasheet, draw on my “vast” knowledge from electronics all gained in 8th grade, and translate the information in the datasheet to a program. Or, I could see if anyone else had done something similar. Searching for 74HC595 and Arduino led me to the documentation for the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/advanced-io/shiftout/">shiftout</a> function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shifts out a byte of data one bit at a time. Starts from either the most (i.e. the leftmost) or least (rightmost) significant bit. Each bit is written in turn to a data pin, after which a clock pin is pulsed (taken high, then low) to indicate that the bit is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice. It turns out Arduino documentation is really good like Perl documentation (docs on both focus on giving you the information you need to be able to use a specific piece of functionality – For a contrast, see Python’s documentation which tends to obscure the information you need in dense prose). The docs for <code>shiftout</code> came with a complete example as well as a link to a <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations/ShiftOut" title="Serial to Parallel Shifting-Out with a 74HC595">tutorial on controlling the 74HC595 shift register</a>. Of course, the mnemonics used in the pin-out diagram in the tutorial do not fully match the datasheet, but it is really nice to have these resources when you are trying to take the baby steps. It is easier to understand how you ended up blinking those if you can get them to blink in the first place.</p>
<p>Obviously, the tutorial is great. Explains all you need to know really. It is geared towards an Arduino board and those tend to have way more available pins than the ATtiny85. Laying cable on a breadboard is not my strong suit (never touched a soldering iron either), but after spending a moment considering my options, I decided to use the three available pins on the right side of the ATtiny85 (<var>PB<sub>0</sub></var> … <var>PB<sub>2</sub></var>) for interfacing with the 595. While reading the tutorial, I noticed this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“3 states” refers to the fact that you can set the output pins as either high, low or “high impedance.” … Neither example takes advantage of this feature and you won’t usually need to worry about getting a chip that has it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good. One less thing to worry about.</p>
<p>Anyway, I used whatever wires were available within the routing constraints and came up with this wiring:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/attiny85-SN74HC595-HC-35-breadboard.jpg"><img src="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/attiny85-SN74HC595-HC-35-breadboard-thumb.jpg" width="400" title="ATtiny85 SN74HC595 Liyafy HC-35 keypad breadboard wiring" alt="[ ATtiny85 SN74HC595 Liyafy HC-35 keypad breadboard wiring ]"></a></p>
<p>The colors of the wires were dictated by available …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>an even <i>smaller</i> static site generator</p>
<hr>
<p>from the mind that brought you <b>UNK</b>, comes the new and improved SON OF
UNK, <b>NEF</b>.  Where <b>UNK</b> was a bloated <i>one thousand bytes</i>, the
entirety of <b>NEF</b> is <i>four hundred forty-four</i>, over a fifty per cent
<i>reduction</i> in size.</p>
<h2>installation</h2>
<p>clone this repo.
<b>NEF</b> requires a POSIX environment.</p>
<h2>use</h2>
<p>create the following files and directories in the same directory as <b>NEF</b>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>L</b>, the <i>Layout</i> file, which gets expanded by <b>NEF</b>.
        if <b>L</b> isn't provided, a default <b>L</b> will be generated.
    </li><li><b>H</b>, the <i>Html</i> generator, which converts the input files to
        HTML.  if <b>H</b> isn't provided, a default function H is called, which
        is pretty stupid: it wraps blank-line-separated paragraphs in 
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> blocks.  otherwise, it's pure HTML (mostly; see
        <b>layouts</b>, below).
    </li><li><b>I/</b>, where the <i>Input</i> files, like pages, go.
        each page should have a name of the form 
        <code>NAME.OUT-FMT.IN-FMT</code>, where
        <code>NAME</code> is the basename of the file,
        <code>OUT-FMT</code> is the output format (usually HTML),
        and <code>IN-FMT</code> is the input format (whatever -- in this repo
        it's called <code>.h</code>).
    </li><li><b>S/</b>, where the <i>Static</i> files, like CSS and images, go.
</li></ul>
<h2>layouts</h2>
<p>the <b>L</b> file is basically a big here-doc, meaning that you can write
arbitrary shell in it however you'd like.  the following variables and functions
are made available to <b>L</b>'s environment (in addition, of course, to
whatever <b>NEF</b>'s environment is):</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>X</b>, the <i>eXpander</i>.  it turns <b>L</b> into a here-doc.
        <i>make sure to escape your files properly!</i>
    </li><li><b>H</b>, the <i>Htmlizer</i>.  it's a dumb awk function.  even if you
        have a file <b>H</b> in <b>NEF</b>'s directory, this function will 
        still be here, taunting you with its stupidity.
    </li><li><b>P</b>, aliased to <code>echo</code>.
    </li><li><b>T</b>, aliased to <code>sed q</code>, which pulls the first line from
        a file.  aka, the <i>Title</i>.
    </li><li><b>$H</b>, which keeps track of whether you're using the <b>H</b> file
        or function.  you probably don't need this.  but it's here.
    </li><li><b>$F</b>, the <i>Filename</i> of the current input file.
    </li><li><b>$N</b>, the <i>baseName</i> (without <code>I/</code>) of the current
        input file.
</li></ul>
<p>the default <b>L</b> <i>also</i> runs each input file through the
<b>X</b> function (<b>UNK</b> devotees will be aware of the <b>X</b> function;
it's basically <a href="https://github.com/zimbatm/shab">shab</a> but stupider and
smaller), meaning that input files can basically function as templates
themselves, and create their own fun.</p>
<h2>uh, yeah, that's it</h2>
<p>look, the script is a super short POSIX shell script.  it's barely usable by
itself.  you're probably going to throw it out and write something else --
that's what I do.</p>
<h2>copying</h2>
<p><b>UNK</b> used the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL</a>, which is the
shortest license I've been able to find.  however, for <b>NEF</b>, 443 bytes is
<i>far</i> too long: it basically <i>doubles</i> the size of the repo!  so I
wrote my own license, which I'm calling the <b>good choices license</b>, or
<b>GCL</b> for short.  you can read the LICENSE file, or just read it here:</p>

He issued a video, telling victims, "We are there, we hear you, we believe you. You will never be alone."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>He promised tougher laws on sexual crimes. The French parliament is already debating them.</p>  <h2>Book reveals dark secret</h2>  <p>This began, and stayed for years, a family story. But not just any family. Olivier Duhamel, 70, was a high-flyer in the tight French elite, not a politician in public view but an adviser, a political scientist and constitutional expert. And friend to French presidents.</p>  <p>When the scandal erupted, he was the president of the powerful Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques, which runs one of France's most influential universities, the Paris Institute of Political Studies.</p>  <p>He was also the president of Le Siècle, a club of France's political and intellectual elite. For good measure, he appeared weekly on radio and television.</p>  <p>That carefully constructed world collapsed in early January with the publication of a book. It's called <em>La Familia Grande</em> and is written by his stepdaughter, Camille Kouchner, 45. In it, she details&nbsp;the alleged sexual abuse&nbsp;of her twin brother, whom she calls Victor in the book to protect his privacy, by her&nbsp;stepfather, Olivier Duhamel, when Victor was 13 and 14.</p>  <p>Duhamel immediately resigned all his posts and went to ground. He admitted nothing, simply saying he had been the target of personal attacks.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892782.1611890445!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/france.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892782.1611890445!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/france.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892782.1611890445!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/france.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892782.1611890445!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/france.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892782.1611890445!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/france.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892782.1611890445!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/france.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Olivier Duhamel, second from right, used to be an influential political scientist in France, seen here in 2007 with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, left. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Philippe Wojazer/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Others also resigned, including a former justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou. She was a close friend of Duhamel and his family but, for the record, denied knowing of the allegations. Almost unbelievably, the post she resigned from was as chair of a government commission on incest.</p>  <p>According to Camille Kouchner, Duhamel's family, and then others close to the family, had known for a dozen years of the alleged sexual abuse, but Victor had not wanted the facts to become public.</p>  <p>Her book unleashed a storm. The social media hashtag&nbsp;#MeTooInceste attracted thousands of testimonies from people saying they had been victims of incest. This reflected the shocking result of an opinion poll from Ipsos in November 2020 that surveyed a random sample of 1,033 French adults. In it, one in 10 people surveyed said they had been victims of incest. (In France, incest is defined more widely, and includes sexual abuse by a family member even if not related by blood.)</p>  <h2>Change to the law</h2>  <p>Camille Kouchner's book has already had a print run of more than 300,000 copies. Two weeks after its publication, Victor was interviewed by French police. An investigation 10 years earlier had been dropped because the statute of limitations on incest and sexual aggression against minors was limited to 20 years.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Two years ago, the statute of limitations was lengthened to 30 years from the age of majority of the minor.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And, in response to the groundswell of outrage, Macron said, "We will go after the aggressors."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892849.1611888315!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/france-mali.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892849.1611888315!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/france-mali.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892849.1611888315!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/france-mali.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892849.1611888315!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/france-mali.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892849.1611888315!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/france-mali.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892849.1611888315!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/france-mali.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>French President Emmanuel Macron, wearing a protective face mask, has offered his support to victims of sexual abuse within families.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>On Jan. 26, Victor officially indicated that he considered his stepfather an aggressor. He made a criminal complaint against Olivier Duhamel.</p>  <p>Victor's brother, Julien Kouchner, was quoted in the newspaper Le Parisien two days earlier saying, "In our circle, many people knew of the behaviour of my stepfather." That circle was one of the highest in France. The father of Julien, Victor and Camille is Bernard Kouchner, a former French foreign minister and co-founder of Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders). His second wife is Christine Ockrent, a famous television anchor and journalist.&nbsp;</p>  <p>According to Camille and Julien, Kouchner and Ockrent were horrified when Victor told them of Duhamel's behaviour in 2008, but Victor&nbsp;didn't want it made public because his mother, Evelyne Pisier, was still with Duhamel and refused to accept he had raped her son. But Kouchner and Ockrent allegedly told friends.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892783.1611883020!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-iran-opposition.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892783.1611883020!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-iran-opposition.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892783.1611883020!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-iran-opposition.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892783.1611883020!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-iran-opposition.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892783.1611883020!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-iran-opposition.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892783.1611883020!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-iran-opposition.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Bernard Kouchner, former foreign minister of France, is seen during the 2018 Iran Uprising Summit in Manhattan, New York. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Amr Alfiky/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Julien told Le Parisien: "Our world then divided into two, those who distanced themselves or even broke with [Duhamel], and others who stayed with him because of disbelief or opportunism…. But I've since discovered a third category, that of the accomplices who said things were only rumours which they knew to be exact facts."</p>  <p>For 12 years, Olivier Duhamel carried on untouched. He lost none of his positions or clout.</p>  <p>Only after Evelyne Pisier died in 2017 did Camille, with Victor's permission and support, decide to write about what happened.</p>  <h2>Social reckoning&nbsp;</h2>  <p>The detonation has been huge, but there was another bomb a year earlier. It, too, took the form of a book, this one called <em>Le Consentement</em> (<em>Consent</em>). The author, Vanessa Springora, told of being sexually pursued and possessed at age 14 in the 1980s by a man more than 30 years older.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The man was Gabriel Matzneff, 84, a successful author whose works detailed the pursuit and conquest of teenage girls and boys. He was rewarded with editing jobs at a big publishing house and major French literary prizes.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892781.1611882879!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/france-sexual-consent.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892781.1611882879!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/france-sexual-consent.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892781.1611882879!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/france-sexual-consent.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892781.1611882879!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/france-sexual-consent.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892781.1611882879!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/france-sexual-consent.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892781.1611882879!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/france-sexual-consent.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The book Le Consentement by Vanessa Springora is displayed in a bookstore outside Paris.

Matzneff was stripped of his positions and charged with justifying&nbsp;aggravated rape.</p>  <p>He expressed "regret" for his sexual activities, but, in an interview with the New York Times in February 2020, seemed unrepentant. "Even the silly things I might have done in those euphoric days of freedom, I wasn't the only one. What hypocrisy."</p>  <p>"Those days of freedom" refers to the years after what in France are called "the events of 1968." France was brought to a halt in May 1968 by massive strikes. The call was for revolution, and for sexual freedom in particular.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The 1960s, '70s and '80s among elites in France became an era of open sex and open marriages. The mother of Victor, Evelyne&nbsp;Pisier, both before and after she divorced Bernard Kouchner, embraced this ethos with several lovers, including, for four years, Fidel Castro, Cuba's president.</p>  <p>Then she met and married Olivier Duhamel. Even when Victor told her of her husband's behaviour, she refused to believe it, her children say.</p>  <p>There is now a sad reckoning in France.</p>  <p>"How do you resist the call of the flesh, liberated from all restraints? How do you say no when imposed sexuality is labelled as emancipation?" Malka Marcovich says in her book <em>L'Autre Héritage de 1968: La Face Cachée de la Révolution Sexuelle</em> (<em>The Other Heritage of 1968: The Hidden Face of the Sexual Revolution</em>), published in 2018. "So people, male and female, who were dragged into a premature sexuality, now seen as violent, preferred to keep quiet."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892784.1611883098!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/france-sexual-misconduct.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892784.1611883098!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/france-sexual-misconduct.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892784.1611883098!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/france-sexual-misconduct.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892784.1611883098!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/france-sexual-misconduct.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892784.1611883098!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/france-sexual-misconduct.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5892784.1611883098!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/france-sexual-misconduct.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Emmanuel Pierrat, lawyer of French writer Gabriel Matzneff, leaves Paris's courthouse on Feb. 12, 2020.

Sixty-nine French intellectuals including Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre signed. So did two future cabinet ministers. One of them was Bernard Kouchner, Victor's father.&nbsp;</p>  <p>After Springora's book was published, Kouchner recanted in an interview with the French magazine Le Point in January 2020. "That was idiocy. I didn't even read it. A friend said I should sign it."</p>    <p>And in an interview with Le Nouvel Obs, a French magazine, on Jan. 17, author Camille Kouchner offered a harsh verdict on that time, a verdict that, along with her stepfather, finds her mother guilty.</p>  <p>"Liberty, women, the couple, joyous infidelity, intelligent modernity — I was brought up with these ideas.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>As someone who frequents the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php">PHP tag on StackOverflow</a> I pretty often see questions about how to parse some
particular aspect of HTML using regular expressions. A common reply to such a question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot parse HTML with regular expressions, because HTML isn’t regular. Use an XML parser instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement - in the context of the question - is somewhere between very misleading and outright wrong. What I’ll try
to demonstrate in this article is how powerful modern regular expressions <em>really</em> are.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-regular-actually-mean">What does “regular” actually mean?</h2>

<p>In the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language">formal language theory</a>, something is called “regular” when it has a grammar where all production
rules have one of the following forms:</p>



<p>You can read those <code>-&gt;</code> rules as “The left hand side can be replaced with the right hand side”. So the first rule would
be “B can be replaced with a”, the second one “B can be replaced with aC” and the third one “B can be replaced with the
empty string” (<code>ε</code> is the symbol for the empty string).</p>

<p>So what are <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>a</code>? By convention, uppercase characters denote so called “non-terminals” - symbols which <em>can</em>
be broken down further - and lowercase characters denote “terminals” - symbols which <em>cannot</em> be broken down any
further.</p>

<p>All that probably sounds a bit abstract, so let’s look at an example: Defining the natural numbers as a grammar.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>N -&gt; 0
N -&gt; 1
N -&gt; 2
N -&gt; 3
N -&gt; 4
N -&gt; 5
N -&gt; 6
N -&gt; 7
N -&gt; 8
N -&gt; 9
N -&gt; 0N
N -&gt; 1N
N -&gt; 2N
N -&gt; 3N
N -&gt; 4N
N -&gt; 5N
N -&gt; 6N
N -&gt; 7N
N -&gt; 8N
N -&gt; 9N
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What this grammar says is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>A natural number (N) is
... one of the digits 0 to 9
or
... one of the digits 0 to 9 followed by another natural number (N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example the digits 0 to 9 would be terminals (as they can’t be broken down any further) and <code>N</code> would be the
only non-terminal (as it can be and is broken down further).</p>

<p>If you have another look at the rules and compare them to the definition of a regular grammar from above, you’ll see
that they meet the criteria: The first ten rules are of the form <code>B -&gt; a</code> and the second ten rules follow the form
<code>B -&gt; aC</code>. Thus the grammar defining the natural numbers is <em>regular</em>.</p>

<p>Another thing you might notice is that even though the above grammar defines such a simple thing, it is already quite
bloated. Wouldn’t it be better if we could express the same concept in a more concise manner?</p>

<p>And that’s where regular expressions come in: The above grammar is equivalent to the regex <code>[0-9]+</code> (which is a hell lot
simpler). And this kind of transformation can be done with <em>any</em> regular grammar: Every regular grammar has a
corresponding regular expression which defines all its valid strings.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-regular-expressions-match">What can regular expressions match?</h2>

<p>Thus the question arises: Can regular expressions match only regular grammars, or can they also match more? The answer
to this is both yes <em>and</em> no:</p>

<p>Regular expressions in the formal grammar sense can (pretty much by definition) only parse regular grammars and nothing
more.</p>

<p>But when programmers talk about “regular expressions” they aren’t talking about formal grammars. They are talking about
the regular expression <em>derivative</em> which their language implements. And those regex implementations are only very
slightly related to the original notion of regularity.</p>

<p>Any modern regex flavor can match a <em>lot</em> more than just regular languages. How much exactly, that’s what the rest of
the article is about.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, I’ll focus on the PCRE regex implementation in the following, simply because I know it best (as
it’s used by PHP). Most other regex implementations are quite similar though, so most stuff should apply to them too.</p>

<h2 id="the-language-hierarchy">The language hierarchy</h2>

<p>In order to analyze what regular expressions can and cannot match, we first have to look at what other types of
languages there are. A good starting point for this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">Chomsky hierarchy</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Chomsky hierarchy:

/-------------------------------------------\
|                                           |
|     Recursively enumerable languages      | Type 0
|                                           |
|   /-----------------------------------\   |
|   |                                   |   |
|   |    Context-sensitive languages    |   | Type 1
|   |                                   |   |
|   |   /---------------------------\   |   |
|   |   |                           |   |   |
|   |   |  Context-free languages   |   |   | Type 2
|   |   |                           |   |   |
|   |   |   /-------------------\   |   |   |
|   |   |   | Regular languages |   |   |   | Type 3
|   |   |   \-------------------/   |   |   |
|   |   \---------------------------/   |   |
|   \-----------------------------------/   |
\-------------------------------------------/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see the Chomsky hierarchy divides formal languages into four types:</p>

<p>Regular languages (Type 3) are the least-powerful, followed by the context-free languages (Type 2), the
context-sensitive languages (Type 1) and at last the all-mighty recursively enumerable languages (Type 0).</p>

<p>The Chomsky hierarchy is a containment hierarchy, so the smaller boxes in the above image are fully contained in the
larger boxes. For example every regular language is also a context-free language (but <em>not</em> the other way around!)</p>

<p>So, let’s move one step up in that hierarchy: We already know that regular expressions can match any regular language.
But can they also match context-free languages?</p>

<p>(Reminder: When I say “regular expression” here I obviously mean it in the programmer sense, not the formal language
theory sense.)</p>

<h2 id="matching-context-free-languages">Matching context-free languages</h2>

<p>The answer to this is <em>yes</em>, they can!</p>

<p>Let’s take the classical example of a context-free language, namely <code>{a^n b^n, n&gt;0}</code>, which means “A number of <code>a</code>
characters followed by the <em>same</em> number of <code>b</code> characters”. The (PCRE) regex for this language is:</p>



<p>The regular expression is very simple: <code>(?1)</code> is a reference to the first subpattern, namely <code>(a(?1)?b)</code>. So basically
you could replace the <code>(?1)</code> by that subpattern, thus forming a recursive dependency:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/^(a(?1)?b)$/
/^(a(a(?1)?b)?b)$/
/^(a(a(a(?1)?b)?b)?b)$/
/^(a(a(a(a(?1)?b)?b)?b)?b)$/
# and so on
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From the above expansions it should be clear that this expression can match any string with the same number of <code>a</code>s and
<code>b</code>s.</p>

<p>Thus regular expressions can match at least some non-regular, context-free grammars. But can they match all? To answer
that, we first have to look at how context-free grammars are defined.</p>

<p>In a context-free grammar all production rules take the following form:</p>



<p>Here <code>A</code> once again is a non-terminal symbol and <code>β</code> is an arbitrary string of terminals and non-terminals. Thus every
production rule of a context-free grammar has a non-terminal on the left hand side and an arbitrary symbol string on
the right hand side.</p>

<p>As an example, have a look at the following grammar:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function_declaration -&gt; T_FUNCTION is_ref T_STRING '(' parameter_list ')' '{' inner_statement_list '}'

is_ref -&gt; '&amp;'
is_ref -&gt; ε

parameter_list -&gt; non_empty_parameter_list
parameter_list -&gt; ε

non_empty_parameter_list -&gt; parameter
non_empty_parameter_list -&gt; non_empty_parameter_list ',' parameter

// ... ... ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What you see there is an excerpt from the PHP grammar (just a few sample rules). The syntax is slightly different from
what we used before, but should be easy to understand. One aspect worth mentioning is that the uppercase <code>T_SOMETHING</code>
names here also are terminal symbols. These symbols which are usually called <em>tokens</em> encode more abstract concepts.
E.g. <code>T_FUNCTION</code> represents the <code>function</code> keyword and <code>T_STRING</code> is a label token (like <code>getUserById</code> or
<code>some_other_name</code>).</p>

<p>I’m using this example to show one thing: Context-free grammars are already powerful enough to encode quite complex
languages. That’s why pretty much all programming languages have a context-free grammar. In particular this also
includes well-formed HTML.</p>

<p>Now, back to the actual question: Can regular expressions match all context-free grammars? Once again, the answer is
<em>yes</em>!</p>

<p>This is pretty easy to prove as regular expressions (at least PCRE and similar) provide a syntax very similar to the
above for constructing grammars:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <main>
      

      <p>One topic that kept me thinking on and off for a couple of years now is time tracking. That is for very practical reasons, as I was (and still am) interested to keep track of my working hours. Back in the day, when I used to work full-time, I wanted to know how well on track I was with the 40&nbsp;hours that I agreed to devote to my employer. Nowadays, as a freelancer, I need to log my working hours for bookkeeping reasons, as my invoices are based on an hourly rate.</p>

<p>There exist countless web services for time tracking, some of which offering an impressive feature set that cater for all imaginable use-cases. However, I never felt too much appeal to use them. It’s not that I have any special requirements or practice an extravagant workflow. My reluctance is instead stemming from a conceptual thought: keeping track of times is a rather mundane and simple thing to do, so why rely on (semi-) commercial online services that build on complex technology stacks for something that you can basically do with a pencil and a piece of paper?</p>

<p>What did the trick somewhat well for me throughout the years was a spreadsheet that I setup and maintained by hand. It allowed me to enter data quickly and I could also run some simple evaluations, e.g. in order to aggregate the entries by week or month. While this solution was both simple and flexible, it also felt a bit cumbersome, especially for things like writing more sophisticated formulas or configuring pivot tables. As luck would have it I am in the fortunate position of being able to build my own tools. But before we get to this I need to share another thing with you first.</p>

<p>The longer I have been working with computers the more I appreciate the freedom and simplicity of plain text files: not being bound to proprietary software for opening or editing them; not being exposed to the risk that your data gets sold to advertising companies; no lock-in on arbitrary subscription plans; no connectivity issues that would prevent or slow down access. Instead, the data is just there, it’s all yours and you can rest assured that you will be able to work with it for decades to come. Viewing or manipulating the files can be done with any off-the-shelf text editor, and syncing them across multiple devices is as easy as putting them into your Dropbox folder. While plain-text formats don’t work for each and every application obviously, they seem to be a more than reasonable choice for this task here.</p>

<p>Born out of this conception I experimented with different formats to record time tracking data using plain text files. Over the past weeks I tried out various structures to model and layout the information. What I came up with is a lightweight format with minimal syntax that I called “klog”. The idea is to record the data in a similar style as you would using a physical notebook: it’s basically the date, then time-related entries such as a time range or duration of how long something took, and maybe a short note about what you did.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jotaen.net/posts/2021-01-31-klog/demo.gif" alt="A terminal window demonstrating the file format and the command line tool usage"></p>

<p>I implemented a parser for the klog file format along with a small command line tool that allows to evaluate the data programatically. You find the project <a href="https://github.com/jotaen/klog">on Github</a>, where you can also download the binary in order to experiment with klog. If you happen to be interested in this idea I’d appreciate some feedback and learn about your use-cases – drop me an <a href="https://www.jotaen.net/mail">email</a> or open an issue on Github. klog obviously fits <em>my</em> needs, but I aimed for making it general-purpose enough so that other people may find it useful too.</p>

<p>Building klog was not just a fun programming exercise, I also ran into some interesting questions along the way: is it necessary to support timezones? Is it okay to restrict time values to hours and minutes, but to omit the seconds part for convenience? What if someone starts an activity close to midnight and finishes it on the next day, like working a night shift? Which of the numerous date and time notations need to be understood? How can you start tracking something that’s not yet finished and therefore doesn’t have an end time? I wrote a brief guide (that you find in the repository) that gives a tour of klog and also covers these questions.</p>

<p>The command line tool is fairly minimalistic for now, as I first and foremostly want to validate that my basic idea sustains before investing more work into it. The cli tool has read-only functionality so far and can basically pretty-print, filter and evaluate files. I attributed special attention to error handling, so in case there are formatting errors you should see precise and (hopefully) helpful error messages. The application is written in Go, which ensures that it runs cross-platform without relying on runtime dependencies, and – as a bonus – it’s also quite fast even on large data sets.</p>

<p>And as for the name, “klog” is what we call a “Kofferwort” in German: since my original use-case was tracking work times it is a blend of the two terms “work” and “log”.</p>

Google banned Element late Friday night, a ban thatÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355465650114846720">Element said</a> "is due to abusive content somewhere on Matrix." Matrix has millions of users, and as a federated chat protocol, Element does not control the content on Matrix, so this is a bit like banning a Web browser for displaying Web content. Element says it is working with Google to "explain how Element works and get the situation resolved."</p>
<p>Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/google-bans-parler-from-android-app-store/">been cracking down</a> on apps that display hateful content, but Element says that it shouldn't be part of the crackdown. "We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce," Element said. "We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content."</p>
<p>Element says it has a full-time team dedicated to handling abuse reports.</p>
<p>Element (which was formerly called Riot.im) is <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now">often cited</a> as one of the best Matrix clients. It looks a lot likeâ€”and is actually <a href="https://element.io/blog/slack-bridging/">interoperable with</a>â€”Slack and Discord. Element says it is used by "the French, German, UK and US governments, countless universities, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world." The app has recently seen <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">an influx of new users</a> after WhatsApp's announcement about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/">Facebook data sharing</a>, so maybe that triggered deeper scrutiny from Google. At press time, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=matrix%20chat&amp;c=apps">many other Matrix apps</a>â€”which by definition show the same content as Elementâ€”are still active on the Play Store.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Google takes a 30 percent cut of all Play Store transactions, which is supposed to pay for the cost of running the Store, but the company doesn't hire humans to primarily review apps the way Apple does, choosing instead to let the bots handle it. Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/apple-lowers-its-cut-of-app-store-revenues-for-some-developers/">recently cut</a> its App Store tax from 30 percent to 15 percent, so Apple actually charges developers less than Google while also offering better human support.
</p><p>Element's <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355595359582638080">latest update</a> on the situation as of this writing said it has been waiting more than eight hours for an email response. Element says it was not notified of the takedown, which has now passed the 24-hour mark.</p>
<p>The bots' interpretation of Google's rules often make no sense, and as a result Google regularly bans random small apps from the Play Store because they can display content from the Internet. We've seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/96kpsf/more_issues_with_google_play_suspended_for_hate/">Reddit apps,</a> <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/19/podcast-addict-pulled-play-store-allegedly-violating-coronavirus-policy/">podcast apps</a>, and other apps that display third-party Web content all "win" the Google Play ban-of-the-week lottery, just because they can be made to display third-party content. The same is true of Google Search, Chrome, Gmail, all of Google's chat apps, YouTube, Google Drive, and Google Podcasts, but those apps never get banned. Earlier this week Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/googles-bots-decide-ass-subtitle-support-is-too-risque-for-the-play-store/">banned a video app</a> because it listed support for the standard ".ass" subtitle filetype in its description.</p>
<p>The one benefit of the Play Store is that you don't have to use it, since Android supports sideloading. Element is also up <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">on F-Droid</a>, an all-open source repository of Android apps, though the version offered there is a month out of date. A more up-to-date version is on <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/vector-creations-limited/riot-im-communicate-your-way/riot-im-communicate-your-way-1-0-14-release/">APKmirror</a>, the Android hacking community's biggest app store.</p>
<p>These bans are almost always temporary mistakes that are rectified after a few hours or days, but that gives little solace to app developers who can suddenly have their businesses ripped out from under them because of an enforcement mistake. Element says, "we can only apologize for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this."</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Element got in touch with a person at Google and says the app should be back up soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Update: we just got a call from a Google VP who explained the suspension was triggered by a report of extremely abusive content accessible on the <a href="https://t.co/g01j4u6O2e">https://t.co/g01j4u6O2e</a> server. Our trust &amp; safety team had already acted on it, and the app should be reinstated shortly.</p>

<p>Ever wished that you had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">Cray 1</a> Supercomputer? Ever wondered if an RC2014 backplane could wrap around a cylinder? Ever thought about how many retweets a Z80 drawing a Mandelbrot fractal could get? Ever had an idea that’s so daft, the only way to exorcise it is to do it? If so, would you like to Seymore…</p>

<p>Like most ideas in Lockdown, things started with a throwaway comment on Twitter and quickly escalated to laser cutting a toilet roll. I blame <a href="https://twitter.com/shieladixon/status/1262781895038902272">Shirley Knott</a></p>

<p>So, as a practical joke, the homage to the powerful Cray 1, and also the less powerful Rolodex worked surprisingly well. This inevitably lead to the question of making it work for real</p>

<p>Taking some measurements from the toilet roll, I laser cut a simple jig to hold 12 40 pin sockets around 270 degrees, with the intention of soldering wire from pin to pin in situ. This quickly demonstrated that it just wasn’t practical to get the soldering iron in such a tight area. </p>



<p>Another jig was made to hold the sockets at an even distance, and use brass wire to connect them up, with the intention of bending them around afterwards. This also became quickly apparent that it wasn’t going to work.</p>

<p>Luckily <a href="https://docs.oshpark.com/services/flex/">OSHPark</a> offer a flex PCB option. I’ve been aware of this for a while, and wanted to try it, but there hadn’t been anything suitable within the RC2014 ecosystem. (Well, there have been requests for a Floppy Module, but I don’t think anybody actually wants a module which is floppy!).  At $10 per square inch, it isn’t cheap, but, after a bit of KiCad work, the smallest 12 slot RC2014 backplane was ordered.</p>

<p>Soldering through hole components on to flex PCB is not easy, and 480 solder joints generate a lot of heat which will warp the plastic if it is not done carefully in a controlled manner. The Flex PCB was designed to fit the existing jigs, and when soldered up, it fitted perfectly!</p>

<p>Using the jig dimensions, I was able to 3D print a couple of end caps which held the slots in place and made things much more solid.  I filled it with a bunch of spare modules and tested out if the backplane itself worked…</p>



<figure><img src="https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty15-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty15-1.jpg 600w, https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty15-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty15-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>Huston we have a problem! Nothing came up when I plugged in a FTDI cable :-(</p>



<p>A few hours were wasted going down different rabbit holes chasing too many red herrings.  The modules I’d put together essentially made up a <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/semachthemonkey/rc2014-zed-homebrew-z80-computer-kit/">RC2014 Zed</a>, and were picked from some of my non-current module archive. What I’d forgotten about is that old versions of RomWBW which are built for use with a DS1302 RTC Module will hang for about 2 minutes on startup if the RTC cannot be found. So, in fact, it was all working perfectly, I just had to wait a little while after plugging in!</p>



<p>A quick upgrade to RomWBW v3.0.1 overcomes this problem, and should have been done right at the start!</p>



<figure><img src="https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty16-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty16-1.jpg 600w, https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty16-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty16-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>To make things more Cray-like, I redesigned the end caps to be open at the top and bottom, and extended the lower one to support a laser cut skirt.  One day this will house an IDE hard drive, but for now, it’s just there to mimic the bench seat on the Cray 1</p>



<figure><img src="https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty17-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty17-1.jpg 600w, https://rc2014.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CrazeeEighty17-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>The irony is not lost on me that the Pi Zero, which is only used to generate HDMI from serial data, is several orders of magnitude more powerful than the Cray 1, which is, itself, way more powerful than the Z80 which is calling all the shots!</p>



<p>There are no plans to release this as a product at this stage. The price would be too high to justify for a kit which really is not very practical at all.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We have written a lot about the blind spot the US venture ecosystem has for <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2019/09/30/3042/">semiconductors</a> (<a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/08/10/not-a-drop-for-you/">and here</a>) and hardware more generally. We recently helped a venture firm conduct due diligence on an electronics company, which put us in the awkward position of having to walk in someone else’s shoes. Sympathy for the devil, and all that. In our posts we have attempted to be fair, pointing out that US VCs are making sensible economic decisions albeit on a short-sighted viewpoint. Investing in hardware is much more capital intensive and thus risky than investing in software. In this post, we want to work through some of the math behind that. </p>



<p>Let’s say we have a company, Unicorn Electronics, that wants to build The SmartHorn <sup>TM</sup>, a device that magically solves customers’ problems perfectly. How do we get the company to “escape velocity” – positive cashflow sufficient to fund the company’s immediate growth needs?</p>



<p>First, Unicorn needs to design the Horn. Depending on how complex the device is this can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million, from a third party design shop. Some people can do this design themselves, others are going to need outside help. For our purposes, let’s say the Horn design costs $500,000. This amount gets the company the “blueprints” and a few prototypes.  </p>



<p>But most devices today are fairly complex. Even if the hard computation is done in the cloud or in the app, the device itself needs to be able to function, to be programmed and to communicate with the Internet. That means firmware. This is low-level software, and not only is their no standard “firmware” programming language or operating system, pretty much every chip company has its own instruction language. Hiring firmware engineers is not that expensive in dollars, but it can be very expensive in time. Here’s a typical scenario. The design shop hands the firmware designers some prototypes. The firmware team finds a bug that requires a new wire or capacitor. So the design firm has to build (by hand) a new prototype. The firmware team then finds that two of the chips are not speaking to each other – the Bluetooth and the temperature sensor for instance. Is the problem in one chip or the other or somewhere in the wiring in between? Often this will mean the design team needs to spin up yet another prototype. And since these teams are likely in different cities, if not different countries, every re-spin loses days in shipping and re-work. </p>



<p>So far, we have spent $500,000 and a month on the design, and $100,000 and four months on firmware.</p>



<p>Now we have to find a manufacturer. This company will need to create tools and molds as well as designing a manufacturing flow. They can do this fairly quickly, but as they are operating on expensive machine tools, they will have minimum quantity requirements. These can be as low as a few thousand units, but here is where the costs really start to add up. </p>



<p>Let’s say the SmartHorn costs $100 in parts and manufacturing, but the manufacturer requires a minimum of 5,000 units. Then the tricky part becomes sourcing parts. The global electronics supply chain is incredibly tight right now. <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/10/27/what-is-happening-to-the-supply-chain/">We wrote about this back in October</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/auto-factories-semiconductor-chips.html">New York Times was catching up last week</a>. Lead times for many parts can be several months, and frustratingly it is hard to predict with often some of the lowest value parts in the shortest supply. So add $500,000 (5,000 units X $100 BOM) and four months. </p>



<p>Then we enter into a whole sea of minutiae. The device will need various certifications UL, FCC, etc. Add $50,000, but fortunately this can be done while the manufacturing is ramping up. But there are bigger costs as well such as insurance. Most distributors (i.e. retail) and enterprise customers will want the company to maintain a range of insurance policies, tack on another $50,000 or so. Then we have to factor in shipping and customs and taxes, so maybe $20 per device. </p>



<p>Next up, the company has to factor in warranties and returns. The accountants have requirements for setting reserves for these, but a rough rule of thumb (sufficient for our purposes here only) is 10% of the costs of the materials needs to be set aside to cover the cost of returns and replacements. </p>



<p>Finally, the company has to contend with marketing. This amount can range from nothing to A Lot, depending on whether they are selling to consumers or to a single large enterprise customer. A basic PR budget and some content marketing runs about $50,000, plus or minus. </p>



<p>Adding this up we have the following budget:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Item</td><td>Amount</td><td data-align="center">Time</td></tr><tr><td>Design</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Firmware</td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacture</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Certification</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Insurance</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Shipping </td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Sub-total Cost of Goods Sold</td><td>$1,350,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Warranty Reserve</td><td>$135,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>$1,485,000</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>9 Months</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>All of this has to take place before the company can collect any revenue, unless they have done some form of crowdsourcing. So just to break even the company has to charge $297/unit, and to get a 50% gross margin the retail price would need to be $594. </p>



<p>We also need to factor in software costs. For this example, we will assume Unicorn Electronics does their own app and back-end software. The company could probably build all of the hardware and software with a team of ten people. If the average salary is $150,000 year (assume some expensive onshore talent and some less expensive offshore talent), the total comes out to $1.5 million for a year. </p>



<p>So $1.485 million in hardware costs and $1.5 million for headcount, for a total of $2.985 million. The company then sells 5,000 units for $594 a piece or $2.97 million in revenue and yielding a net <em><strong>loss</strong></em> of ($15,000). Hardware can be dispiriting.</p>



<p>The good news is that there is a heavy fixed costs component to this model, so tweaking a few variables can have a big impact. For instance, if they raise prices by $6/unit to an even $600, the net profit goes to $15,000 (positive). Sell an additional 1,000 units and the net profits are close to half a million dollars. If they sell 100,000 units then the company has a path to becoming a true Unicorn. There is a lot of leverage in the model, which is why people keep trying to build hardware. </p>



<p>That being said, the realities of hardware can be daunting. Take the $3 million the company needs to get a product out the door, a similarly sized team could build a software application that can potentially grow much faster and they would still have a million dollars to do customer acquisition. Compounding this, the software would come with a recurring revenue stream. The trouble with hardware is that for the company to grow, they have to come out with the Smart Horn 2 and the Smart Horn 3, and go through all of the above again, and again. </p>



<p>Hardware has immense financial leverage, but the upfront costs and more crucially the time required are daunting. </p>

    <figcaption>Is it worth the trouble?</figcaption>
  </figure>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>So you’ve come to a point where it just seems like a good idea to simplify the frontend implementations and get rid of the dozens (dozens) of endpoints scattered throughout your application. The time has come to switch to GraphQL (or you just like shiny, new, things).</p>
<h2 id="graphql">GraphQL</h2>
<p>For a long time, a classic REST(ful) API has been the de facto standard for data sharing between applications and services. The issue with REST stands in its lack of flexibility, most new use cases on the UI require more work from the backend. Syncing these requirements is a tedious task that requires time and coordination that might be better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>A new solution appeared in the form of GraphQL which tackles these issues by allowing the client to specify the schema of what it needs. This allows the clients to have more flexibility and gives product managers more power to improve user facing features without worrying about wasting too much time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results from a survey made by The State of JavaScript stated that from 20,000 JavaScript developers, 83% are using or intending to learn GraphQL.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-does-graphql-work">How does GraphQL work?</h2>
<p>Most of the readers are probably familiar with GraphQL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What it does is it exposes a API endpoints, which allow you to be fully independent of the backend implementation and only worry about the query which is executing on them. This means that you no longer have to rework the backend for every change on the client, if you need another data point that is held in the database, using GraphQL you can fetch it by just adding it to the query.</p>
<p>For example, executing the following query</p>
<pre><code>{
  product {
    name
    current_price
    available_qty
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Would yield the following results</p>
<pre><code>{
  "product": {
    "name": "Banana",
    "current_price": "I MEAN IT'S ONE BANANA, MICHAEL, WHAT COULD IT COST? TEN DOLLARS?",
    "available_qty": 100001
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>By adding or removing the fields in the query you would get a result with different structure. It is a great way of having flexibility in how you want to build things, and reduce unnecessary payload size if your API is riddled with god endpoints which return half of your database.</p>
<h2 id="downsides">Downsides</h2>
<p>The biggest downside is additional complexity, as you now have another layer to implement, and in case of issues debug. There is also the need to actually know how to query the API, and the fact that you might expose some database design details depending on how you expose the GraphQL server. And don’t get me started on trying to cache results.</p>
<h2 id="selling-the-idea-to-your-vp">Selling the idea to your VP</h2>
<p>So once you reach the point of understanding what GraphQL helps you with, and the downsides aren’t scaring you off, you actually need to persuade your VP that it makes sense to implement it. It sure does sound nice, but what will it look like on the client, how will we actually make it work?</p>
<h2 id="using-mocking-to-demonstrate-value">Using mocking to demonstrate value</h2>
<p>You can write your own mock server and try to get up and running, but it will be time consuming, and even after spending all that time the idea might not be accepted. We think you should use Mockadillo. With Mockadillo you can do this, depending on the scope of the API, in a very short time period. Let’s demonstrate that.</p>
<h2 id="real-life-example">Real life example</h2>
<p>Let’s build a GraphQL backend for a produce store. For this demonstration it’s going to be a pretty simple one.</p>
<p>First we have to define some structure for data. Let’s say we can query for <code>products</code></p>
<pre><code>type Query {
  product: Product
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which has the following structure.</p>
<pre><code>type Product {
  id: String,
  name: String,
  current_price: Int,
  available_qty: Int,
  price_history: [PriceHistory],
  active: Boolean,
}
 
type PriceHistory {
  price: Int
  active_from: Date
  active_to: Date
}
</code></pre>
<p>It is obvious here that, if we’re building a storefront, some pages might not need <code>price_history</code>. Other pages might not need the <code>active</code> parameter, where others might (for an admin interface). We can mock these queries easily by using <strong>conditions</strong>, specifically <strong>body request conditions</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-the-proof-of-concept-through-mockadillo">Implementing the proof of concept through Mockadillo</h2>
<p>After creating the <strong>API</strong> and <strong>Route</strong> in your admin dashboard (if you’re unfamiliar with the process visit <a href="https://docs.mockadillo.com/docs/prologue/introduction/">the getting started page</a>), we need to create and setup the successful <strong>Response</strong>.</p>
<p>For this demo we see a couple of pages that the client will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main page that will return a list of products.</li>
<li>A single page that will return detailed product information.</li>
<li>A single page that will be shown to admins with extra information.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these requirements, it’s obvious we need to create 4 different responses. The first one will be a default response, returning an error since it means that the query must have been invalid since we didn’t match any request conditions. The other three represent the data needed for the rest of the pages we will need. We will go into detail for one of these, as the principle is the same for the rest.</p>
<h3 id="list-of-products-response">List of products response</h3>
<p>For this endpoint, we want to return a couple of products, and we assume the page will render certain information limited to</p>
<pre><code>{
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Banana",
    "current_price": 1000,
    "available_qty": 100001,
    "active": true
}
</code></pre>
<p>As in most cases we don’t need other fields. Let’s define the conditions:</p>
<p>So at the least we expect the query to contain the keyword <code>products</code>. This means that we will create a new <strong>body</strong> condition, with the <strong>jsonpath</strong> value of <strong>$.query</strong>, using the <strong>contains</strong> filter, looking for the <strong>products</strong> value.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.mockadillo.com/images/graphql-condition.png" alt="Condition requiring &amp;lsquo;products&amp;rsquo; string in the query">
    <figcaption>Condition requiring 'products' string in the query</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>We can repeat the same process for the fields we want to return, so let’s add 5 more conditions for <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>current_price</code>, <code>available_qty</code> and <code>active</code> so that the end results looks like this.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.mockadillo.com/images/graphql-conditions.png" alt="Five body conditions for this response">
    <figcaption>Five body conditions for this response</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>You could also click on <code>Toggle editing mode</code> to switch to the raw conditions json and paste the following</p>
<pre><code>{
  "headers": [],
  "body": [
    {
      "source": "$.query",
      "kind": "contains",
      "value": "products"
    },
    {
      "source": "$.query",
      "kind": "contains",
      "value": "id"
    },
    {
      "source": "$.query",
      "kind": "contains",
      "value": "name"
    },
    {
      "source": "$.query",
      "kind": "contains",
      "value": "current_price"
    },
    {
      "source": "$.query",
      "kind": "contains",
      "value": "available_qty"
    },
    {
      "source": "$.query",
      "kind": "contains",
      "value": "active"
    }
  ],
  "queryString": [],
  "origin": []
}
</code></pre>
<p>And let’s add the response body to show some data to the client</p>
<pre><code>{
  "data": { 
    "products": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Banana",
      "current_price": 1000,
      "available_qty": 100001,
      "active": true
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "name": "Juice",
      "current_price": 300,
      "available_qty": 55,
      "active": true
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "name": "Bread",
      "current_price": 100,
      "available_qty": 8,
      "active": false
    }]
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s repeat the process for other pages that the application will have. For the details page, according to the GraphQL spec, we expect the query to be similar but to contain a singular <code>product</code> instead of <code>products</code>, and we don’t need the <code>id</code> field for it. On the other hand it might be useful to show the user previous prices (though probably only if they were higher). And for the admin we want to be able to toggle the <code>active</code> field, if we want to disable showing a certain product.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-result">The end result</h3>
<p>In the end, we should have the rest of the conditions setup for each of the responses, totaling 4 different responses.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.mockadillo.com/images/graphql-responses.png" alt="Four different responses, three with conditions">
    <figcaption>Four different responses, three with conditions</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>This is pretty much already enough for our POC application, we can start testing.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>For API testing we use <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a>. Let’s first try to get a list of our products.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.mockadillo.com/images/insomnia-products.png" alt="The products endpoint returning a list">
    <figcaption>The products endpoint returning a list</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Now let’s see if we can get a single product</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.mockadillo.com/images/insomnia-products.png" alt="The product endpoint returning a single product">
    <figcaption>The product endpoint returning a single product</figcaption>
  </figure>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, it took us (me) under 5 minutes to create everything that was needed to achieve this. You can go for more granularity and implement more responses to support more use cases. But for now I think this should be enough to show you how Mockadillo can be useful for quickly prototyping a GraphQL application. You can go one step further, plan out the features in more detail, and implement the end schema in Mockadillo. This allows you to, when you are done with the actual implementation, to just swap out the API host URL, and technically your application should work.</p>

  <article>
    <p>Stimulus has a description top and center of its home page: â€œA modest JavaScript
framework for the HTML you already have.â€� By â€œmodestâ€� I think it is claiming that: 
it wonâ€™t take over your routing, it wonâ€™t bury its view code deep in JavaScript
code, it can be applied to the pages you choose (and wonâ€™t affect the pages that
you donâ€™t), etc. By â€œHTML you already haveâ€� I think it is claiming that you can
take an HTML-first approach; you can write your HTML and then â€œsprinkleâ€� in some
JavaScript functionality later.</p>

<p>I like Simulusâ€™s proposition, but <a href="https://tad.thorley.dev/2021/01/24/writing-stimulus-sold-me-on-vue.html">I donâ€™t like the implementation</a>. So letâ€™s do it in a Ruby on Rails
application with Vue instead (<a href="https://github.com/phaedryx/modest-vue-for-your-html">source code</a>).</p>

<p>Even though <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/">Vue 3</a> was released in September 2020, Rails
still doesnâ€™t support it as an option for creating new applications, so weâ€™ll
have to create the app first and then configure it for Vue.</p>

<p>
$ rails new modest-vue-for-your-html<br>
$ cd modest-vue-for-your-html
</p>

<p>Next add vue, the vue loader (for webpack).</p>

<div>
<p>
$ yarn add vue@next<br>
$ yarn add vue-loader@next<br>
</p></div>

<p>Now that Vue is installed, it needs some configuration. Edit the webpack configuration
file:</p>

<p>Now that the Vue is configured letâ€™s give it some HTML to work with</p>

<p>
$ rails generate scaffold Widget style:string color:string runcible:boolean<br>
$ rails db:migrate
</p>

<p>and edit the routes file to use it.</p>

<figure><figcaption>config/routes.rb</figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre><span>Rails</span><span>.</span><span>application</span><span>.</span><span>routes</span><span>.</span><span>draw</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>root</span> <span>'widgets#index'</span>

  <span>resources</span> <span>:widgets</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>

<p>Suppose I want to ensure that people fill out the style name correctly. I could 
add a Rails validation that the name matches a certain regular expression (and I
will later) but that means filling out the form, submitting it, and <em>then</em> discovering
a problem. It would be nicer if I got a warning as I was filling the form out. A
bit of JavaScript could be nice.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to set this up, but since it is a comparison to Stimulus
letâ€™s set it up in a Stimulus style. In Stimulus you give an element a specific
<code>data-controller</code> attribute and it hooks code to the element. Letâ€™s add a 
<code>data-component</code> (because Vue uses components) attribute to our HTML and then
hook some Vue code to it.</p>

<p>Our Widget views share a common form, so letâ€™s add it to the form partial:</p>

<figure><figcaption>app/views/widgets/_form.html.erb</figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;div</span> <span>data-component=</span><span>"Widget"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;%=</span> <span>form_with</span><span>(</span><span>model: </span><span>widget</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>form</span><span>|</span> <span>%&gt;</span>
    ...
  <span>&lt;%</span> <span>end</span> <span>%&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>

<p>Create the component:</p>

<figure><figcaption>app/javascript/components/Widget.js</figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>Widget</span>

<p>And add code to hook them together:</p>

<span>})</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>

<p>The plan is to run a check on a form field when it loses focus (<code>onBlur</code>), so letâ€™s
start with that. In our component letâ€™s write a function that takes a parameter and
logs it out with <code>console.log</code>.</p>

<p>If you start the server and start up the page, you should be able to click in the first text field,
click out of the text field, and see the message in the browserâ€™s console.</p>

<p>This is interesting, but not terribly useful. Letâ€™s assume that widget styles start with â€œWX-â€œ and
we want to check that in the component:</p>

<p>When you try out the modified page you should see â€œvalidâ€� and â€œinvalidâ€� when you type different
strings into the text field and remove focus.</p>

<p>This is nice, but users arenâ€™t going to look in their web console for messages. Letâ€™s output a
message into the HTML. First weâ€™ll create a Vue <code>ref</code> in our Widget:</p>

<p>Final observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I think this code is quite readable. You can look at the HTML and get a good
  sense of what the JavaScript will do. You can look at the JavaScript and get
  a good sense of what will happen in the HTML.</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t have to reason about JavaScript to know what the resulting HTML is
  going to be.</li>
  <li>This is easy to backtrace. If you â€œview sourceâ€� on this in a browser it is
  finding the corresponding partial in your Rails views and component in your
  JavaScript should be pretty easy.</li>
  <li>It is easy to see what is being passed to the JavaScript functions.</li>
  <li>I chose a naming scheme and setup that made sense to me, but there are a lot
  of different approaches that would work.</li>
  <li>Vue is a â€œprogressiveâ€� framework. That means that you can add more techniques
  as needed. If you want to evolve this into a single page application you can.
  If you want to add child components to this component you can. If you want to
  start using <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/single-file-component.html#introduction">single file components</a> you can (I like this tutorial: <a href="https://dev.to/vannsl/vue3-on-rails-l9d">https://dev.to/vannsl/vue3-on-rails-l9d</a>).</li>
  <li>Because the components are just objects with functions, it would be easy to
  extract this into something …</li></ul></article></section></section></div>

        <h2 id="github-should-start-an-app-store">GitHub Should Start An App Store</h2>
<p>Yesterday, Google suspended Elements - matrix chat app - from play store <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25965443">without any reasonable explanation</a>. I think this was an automated removal triggered by user reports or some other factors. The matrix team tried to reach out to them for explanation to no avail. We have seen this pattern in many cases now. Either it’s getting overwhelming for Google to monitor apps in its store or they don’t want apps like Elements which is decentralized to be on their store. The later mostly seems like a conspiracy theory and I think former is more true. In any case, it doesn’t make any sense for a single entity to govern what gets installed and not on billions of devices. A decentralized app store whould be best to fight this sort of suspensions but it’s far from reality at the moment. The alternative? GitHub App Store.</p>
<h3 id="but-why-github">But Why GitHub?</h3>
<p>Few reasons why I think GitHub is our best bet:</p>
<ol>
<li>They already host source code of millions of apps. Release integration should be trivial to implement.</li>
<li>Unlike Google they actually listen to their users. They were awesome during <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">youtube-dl</a> debacle.</li>
<li>Backed by Microsoft. Microsoft has been playing good by the developers for years now. I trust them more than Apple and Google.</li>
<li>They could finally give the desktop the app store it deserves</li>
<li>This is a minor but users will be able to raise issues with developers directly instead writing comments over app pages which I think you would agree completely suck.</li>
</ol>
<p>They will have to create app store applications for major platforms along with provision to host closed source applications on their store and they should be good to go. Honestly I can not imagine any other player being more successful in app stores than GitHub.</p>
<p><em>Update: <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355663753380032512">Google has reinstated Elements</a></em></p>

    <div>
        <p>There's been enough time for the dust to settle and for Robinhood's actual reason for halting trades to come out. But the question of why only buys and not sells has not really been answered in detail, and that's mainly because it's a pain-in-the-ass and delves deep into how the deposit requirements are calculated by the DTCC for brokers. </p>
<h2>First, what happened</h2>
<p>On that fateful day, Gamestop stock had massive volatility, and given the cries of "Buy!" and "Hold!" from /r/WSBs, I'd assume on Robinhood, a broker targeted at retail investors, it'd be heavily imbalanced towards buy trades.</p>
<p>As volatility increased, the DTCC (Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation) increased the deposit requirements for brokers. Basically, when you submit a trade on a broker, the exchange of money for stock doesn't actually happen until 2 days later, and the firm that handles that exchange is called a clearing firm. Before then, Robinhood just sends records: John bought 2 GME for $600, Mary sold 1 GME for $290. If that's all that happened that day, then Robinhood would need to provide $310 dollars to the clearing firm, and receive 1 stock.</p>
<p>That's a credit risk - what if Robinhood doesn't have the money on settlement? The clearing firm would be on the hook. So the DTCC requires that brokers put up a deposit beforehand. On that day, the DTCC massively increased the deposit requirements for brokers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spokesman for the DTCC wouldn’t specify how much it required from specific firms but said that by the end of the day industrywide collateral requirements jumped to $33.5 billion, up from $26 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop">Levine</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount required by clearinghouses to cover the settlement period of some securities rose tremendously this week. How much? To put it in perspective, this week alone, our clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities increased ten-fold. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week">Robinhood</a></p>
<p>So, Robinhood legally could not submit trades on $GME until they could muster the deposits for GME that they needed. And they quickly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/robinhood-gamestop-reddit/index.html">scrounged up some capital</a> so they could continue on Friday.</p>
<h3>Robinhood's Clearing Firm</h3>
<p>Robinhood actually has their own clearing firm, Robinhood Securities... for some reason, but it's still a DTCC member and must listen to what the SEC regulates. </p>
<h3>update 12:32 - On margin?</h3>
<p>Some people seem to be mistaking the situation. It is not about margin accounts - while yes, Robinhood "instant transfers" provides the illusion of being instant effectively with margin, it's not really the issue here.</p>
<p>Brokers cannot use client money to satisfy their clearing fund obligation.  So whether or not the accounts had a settled balance didn't matter - as you can see from the other brokers which halted buys and did not have "instant transfers".</p>
<p>Again, this is about what's effectively <em>collateral</em> the brokers must put up so that all parties can mitigate the risk of a broker failing. Of course client money is used when the transaction <em>settles</em>, but, naturally, you can't use their money, which isn't yours, as collateral.</p>
<h2>But why ONLY Buys?</h2>
<p>The deposit requirement is </p>
<p><code>deposit = min( 99% 2d VaR + Gap Risk Measure, Deposit Floor Calc) + Mark-to-Market</code></p>
<p>And the variable to look at is the 99% 2d VaR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The volatility component is designed to capture the market price risk associated with each Member’s portfolio at a 99th percentile level of confidence. The VaR Charge is the volatility component applicable to most Net Unsettled Positions, and usually comprises the largest portion of a Member’s Required Deposit. Procedure XV of the Rules currently provides that the VaR Charge shall be calculated in accordance with a generally accepted portfolio volatility margin model utilizing assumptions based on reasonable historical data and an appropriate volatility range. As such, NSCC currently calculates a Member’s VaR Charge utilizing the VaR model, which incorporates an EWMA volatility
estimation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2018/34-82631.pdf">SEC</a></p>
<p>Remember when I subtracted John's buys of $600 with Mary's sell of $290 to get $310? That's the broker's net unsettled cash positions. The 99% VaR is basically, "99% of the time the broker's net unsettled will not be higher than X". You might remember if you took statistics about confidence intervals; this is the upper 99% confidence interval.</p>
<h3>Bad Desmos Graphs</h3>
<p>So, let's model our risk as a Normal curve, for simplicity's sake. Here I've graphed a normal distribution with a line representing the 95% percentile</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Y axis is probability, the X axis is Robinhood's net unsettled positions. The more positive, the more money they'd owe theoretically.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if more people buy than sell? Then it'd shift over to the right</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r2" alt=""></p>
<p>Hasn't the 95% percentile moved rightward as well? Now, what happens if the market is super volatile (i.e, the std dev of the distribution increases)</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r3" alt=""></p>
<p>Wow, now it's even more to the right! </p>
<p>As you can see, <strong>buys make this worse</strong>, <strong>sells make it better</strong>. Robinhood <em>could not</em> execute buys, because it would increase the deposits they'd need, which they legally must obligate by.  Sells, on the other hand, do not have this problem. They would not push the 95% boundary more to the right.</p>
<h2>The Decision</h2>
<p>So really, it's not a bad decision or good decision that Robinhood halted buys of GME - it wasn't a decision, and it wasn't something they alone did.</p>
<p>These brokers halted buys of GME</p>
<ul>
<li>Robinhood</li>
<li>Webull</li>
<li>M1 Finance</li>
<li>Public</li>
<li>E-Trade</li>
</ul>
<p>While others only halted options</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive</li>
<li>TDA</li>
<li>Schwab</li>
<li>Tradeing212</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm, see a pattern? The former group includes companies like Robinhood (2013), WeBull (2017), M1 Finance (2015), while the latter has TDA (1975), Schwab(1971), Trading212 (2004).</p>
<p>(Okay, E-Trade is actually old too, but I guess they're just cash-strapped right now?)</p>
<p>Looks like young brokers with a limited capital resources to me.</p>
<h2>Stay or Switch?</h2>
<p>If there's something to fault Robinhood, it's that they're a young, janky broker (and also you might be getting screwed on the spread by Citadel). If they had more money on-hand they might not have had to stop buys of Gamestop. Perhaps they should have expected this and raised more capital earlier. </p>
<p>And that's a real reason to stay away from Robinhood. But for the love of god do not swap to WeBull or something if that's your concern.</p>
<p>And don't do it because you're abhorred by Robinhood's class warfare or something. Because that didn't happen - it was a mixture of SEC regulations and a cash-strapped startup (well, cash-strapped on big broker scales).</p>
<p>Although if you want to get mad at Hedge Funds anyway, feel free! You should always be mad at Hedge Funds. But please pick a real reason - you have no lack of choice to pick from.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>What does Emacs need for us to someday run M-x neuralink-mode and evaluate Lisp in the brain?</p><div><p>I started using <a href="https://github.com/mpereira/.emacs.d/commit/30024f963ed794ec3a4c41229dbd4fab81f9b912">Emacs</a> almost exactly four years ago, after almost a decade
of <a href="https://github.com/mpereira/.vim">Vim</a>. I made the switch cold turkey. I vividly remember being <em>extremely</em>
frustrated by unbearable slowness while editing a Clojure file at work.
With no sane way of debugging it, just moving the cursor up and down would
result in so much lag that I had to step away from the computer to breathe
for a while. When I came back I quit Vim (I knew how at that point), opened
Emacs, and started building my configuration.</p><p>More recently, I’ve been very put off by the performance and stability (or
lack thereof) of building large scale software via Tramp. This has been
sufficient to have me looking out again. On a whim, I installed VSCode for
the first time and tried its “remote development” capabilities and holy
smokes are they good. Getting up and running was trivial and the
performance was great. Saving files was snappy and LSP worked out of the
box. What a different experience from my carefully-put-together,
half-working, slow Emacs setup.</p><p>My common denominator for rage-quitting software seems to be
consistent: <i>bad performance</i>.</p><p>There has recently been more discussion than usual regarding “modernizing”
Emacs, by making keybindings more consistent with other applications and
using more attractive color schemes and visuals, with the end goal of
attracting more users and by extension more contributors.</p><p>In my view improving these aspects of user experience wouldn’t hurt. The
way I see it, though, is that for Emacs to attract more users it needs to
be objectively better than the alternatives. And the way to do it is for
Emacs to become <em>even more</em> like Emacs.</p><p>I see Emacs as being fundamentally two things: a programmable runtime,
and a beacon for free software. I'm talking more about the former.</p><p>It needs to be a <em>more</em> robust, <em>more</em> efficient, and <em>more</em> integrated
platform with a <em>more</em> powerful extension language, to empower its users to
build their own environment.</p><p>Getting LSP integrated <em>pervasively</em> in Emacs in a way that it reliably
<em>just works</em> and performs well out of the box, would go a long way towards
making Emacs more attractive not just to new users, but to existing ones
too. Imagine an experience similar to VSCode’s:</p><ol><li>Open Emacs for the first time</li><li>Open a source code file</li><li>Emacs asks if you want it to configure itself for the programming
language of that source file</li><li>Saying “yes” automatically sets up Emacs to have a modern programming
environment for that programming language with smart code completion,
navigation, and refactoring, rich hover information, highlighting,
automatic formatting, snippets, etc. Maybe even open a side window with
a buffer with a short “getting started” tutorial showing the available
keybindings.</li></ol><p>Given enough users, opinionated community-built Emacs “distributions” like
Spacemacs, Doom, and Prelude will do the job of making it easier for
newcomers to get started with typical contemporary tasks: building software
with popular programming languages, writing documents, managing machines,
etc.</p><p>Building and maintaining these “distributions” also becomes much easier
given a more robust, more efficient, and more integrated platform with a
more powerful extension language.</p><p>Having a <a href="https://blog.polaris64.net/post/could-emacs-have-a-set-up-wizard/">wizard</a> showing up in new Emacs installations might be a great
low-hanging fruit way of making Emacs more accessible. Assuming buy-in from
core maintainers, the wizard could even directly reference popular Emacs
“distributions” like the ones mentioned above, so that new users can
kickstart their lives in Emacs.</p><p>The way to attract contributors can also be <em>stated</em> simply: directly improve
the contribution process.</p><p>Easier said than done.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADudzQGvU8">Many</a> have created their Emacs <a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/xemacs-wishlist.html">wishlists</a>. This is mine:</p><ol><li>Improved single-core efficiency</li><li>Improved display efficiency and rendering engine</li><li>Leveraging preemptive parallelism</li><li>Emacs Lisp improvements</li><li>Enhanced stability</li><li>Dealing with non-text</li><li>Improved contribution and development process</li></ol><p>Let’s get into it.</p><h2 id="1-dot-improved-single-core-efficiency">1. Improved single-core efficiency</h2><p>There are two dimensions to this:</p><ul><li>garbage collection efficiency</li><li>code execution efficiency</li></ul><p>For the past one and a half years, <a href="https://twitter.com/Koral%5F001">Andrea Corallo</a>, a compiler engineer,
has been <a href="https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html">working</a> on adding native compilation capabilities to the Emacs
Lisp interpreter. His work is available in a branch in the official Emacs
repository. Folks have been trying it out, and according to the reports
I’m hearing, the results are staggeringly positive. I am <em>very</em> excited
about Andrea’s work, which seems to bring enough improvement to the “code
execution speed” side of the equation to make it a non-issue for now.</p><p>Andrea’s work will also allow for more of Emacs to be implemented in Emacs
Lisp itself (instead of C), which is what most contributors are used to.
This is a great win for maintainability and extensibility: incrementally
having more and more of Emacs be implemented in the language with which
it’s extended.</p><p>The garbage collector is still in much need of improvement. Many resort to
hacks to ameliorate frequent and sometimes long pauses that seem to be
unavoidable while working on large git repositories, fast-scrolling
font-locked Eshell buffers, displaying dynamically updating child frames,
navigating big Org files, and many other tasks.</p><p><span>Also, try this out:</span> <code>(setq garbage-collection-messages t)</code></p><h2 id="2-dot-improved-display-efficiency-and-rendering-engine">2. Improved display efficiency and rendering engine</h2><p>The display implementation in Emacs core is… less than ideal.</p><blockquote><p>GNU Emacs is an old-school C program emulating a 1980s Symbolics Lisp
Machine emulating an old-fashioned Motif-style Xt toolkit emulating a
1970s text terminal emulating a 1960s teletype. Compiling Emacs is a
challenge. Adding modern rendering features to the redisplay engine is a
miracle.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/daniel-colascione/buttery-smooth-emacs/10155313440066102/">Daniel Colascione in “Buttery Smooth Emacs” (2016)</a></p></blockquote><p>It would be great if Emacs did like Neovim and decoupled the editor
runtime from the display engine. This would make it possible for the
community to build powerful <a href="https://neovim.io/news/2020/10/#guis">GUIs</a> without having to change <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/master/src/xdisp.c">Emacs core</a>,
possibly <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/CAO2hHWbUmgirn1gJ4OGbRghhCkOPcEsL=moc82Q-6QO+C=189Q@mail.gmail.com/">using technology</a> <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jPGhC-0003i1-W4@fencepost.gnu.org/">not fully sanctioned</a> by core maintainers.</p><p>Take a look at the screenshots of these Neovim GUIs:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Kethku/neovide">neovide</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/smolck/uivonim">uivonim</a></li></ul><p>They’re powerful, look great, perform well, and more importantly, are
based on industry standard, cross-platform graphics APIs (Vulkan and WebGL
respectively) that get lots of personpower contributions from companies
and individuals alike.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/40303878">Onivim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi</a> text editors could also be sources of inspiration:</p><ul><li>Separating the core runtime from the user interface</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope%5F(data%5Fstructure)">Ropes</a> for faster incremental changes and parallelization of text
operations</li><li>Game-like drawing pipelines</li></ul><h2 id="3-dot-leveraging-preemptive-parallelism">3. Leveraging preemptive parallelism</h2><p>Emacs does not support parallel code execution via multi-core processing.
Code execution happening on any buffer will freeze the whole program,
preventing not only user interaction but other cooperative threads of
execution from making progress as well.</p><p>Adding parallelism to Emacs in a way that automatically makes existing
code run in parallel is about as close to impossible as it can get. What
would be more feasible is including new primitives for parallel execution
that new code could leverage, to build more powerful extensions to Emacs.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacs-ng">Emacs-ng</a> is a recent effort that implements just that: an additive layer
over Emacs that brings not only parallelism, but also asynchronous I/O
capabilities via an embedded <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> runtime, and GPU-based rendering via
<a href="https://github.com/servo/webrender">WebRender</a>. I am <em>super</em> excited about the very fast progress from the folks
working on emacs-ng, and I think the project holds great promise for the
future of Emacs itself.</p><p>There also seems to be advances in the area of immutable data structures
that could be leveraged by the Emacs core, as seen in “<a href="https://public.sinusoid.es/misc/immer/immer-icfp17.pdf">Persistence for the
Masses: RRB-Vectors in a Systems Language</a>”. Persistent data structures
would make building thread-safe parallel code much easier.</p><h2 id="4-dot-enhanced-stability">4. Enhanced stability</h2><p>It is very easy to either freeze Emacs or cause it to run very slowly.
Multiple times a day I have to hit <code>C-g</code> incessantly to bring it back from
being frozen. When that fails, I am sometimes able to get it back with
<code>pkill -SIGUSR2 Emacs</code>. At least once per week I have to <code>pkill -9 Emacs</code>
because it turned completely unresponsive. I suspect doing more work
outside of the main thread might help with this?</p><p>There are many hacks to ameliorate issues caused by long lines, but
they’re still fundamentally there. Advancements in the “display efficiency
and rendering engine” effort would help with this too.</p><p>I recently tried a package that displays pretty icons on completion
prompts, and noticed that it made scrolling through candidates really
slow. Profiling showed that the package was creating thousands of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/elisp/Idle-Timers.html">timers</a>,
which were somehow causing the issue. There are lots of cases like this,
where folks attempt to create something nice, but inevitably have to
resort to <a href="https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el/issues/113">hacks</a> to either achieve acceptable performance, or to be able to
implement the thing at all. Having a more robust/efficient/integrated core
with a more powerful extension language would help here.</p><p>Impressive efforts from folks like Lars Ingebrigtsen who routinely comes
in and <a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2020/10/26/5x10/">obliterates 10% of all reported Emacs bugs</a> also have a sizable
impact. We users should follow the lead and do a better job not only
creating good bug reports but also dipping in our toes and helping out:
fixing bugs, writing tests, and documentation.</p><p>Yuan Fu recently wrote a <a href="https://archive.casouri.cat/note/2020/contributing-to-emacs/">nice guide</a> for contributing to Emacs.</p><h2 id="5-dot-emacs-lisp-improvements">5. Emacs Lisp improvements</h2><p>Emacs Lisp is a much better language than Vimscript. Unfortunately, that’s
not saying much. It’s not a particularly good Lisp and has lots of room
for improvement.</p><blockquote><p>For example, if you want to use a map, you have three choices: you can use
alists, plists or hash maps. There are no namespaces in Emacs Lisp, so for
each of the three data types you get a bunch of functions with weird
names. For alists get is <code>assoc</code> and set is <code>add-to-list</code>, for hash maps get
is <code>gethash</code> and set is <code>puthash</code>, for plists get is <code>plist-get</code> and set is
<code>plist-put.</code> For each of those types it …</p></blockquote></div></div>

          <section><p>Online retailers know a lot about how their customers are navigating their virtual stores. Offline retailers are not so&nbsp;lucky.</p>
<p>Together with consumer behavior experts <a href="https://b-clarity.com/case/100-000-human-interactions-cant-be-wrong-touch-increases-sales/" target="_blank">B:Clarity</a> and a multinational home appliance brand we built a system to help understand customer movement and&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>The system consists of wireless sensors that are installed in electronics stores. A few hundred sensors in each&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>There are two types of&nbsp;sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vibration sensors. That trigger when someone is trying out a&nbsp;product.</li>
<li>Light sensors. Trigger when someone is standing in front of a&nbsp;product.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these sensors, we can see what items are most popular, how it correlates to sales data – and how to take action to improve&nbsp;sales.</p>
<p>But without collecting any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" target="_blank">personally identifiable information</a>.</p>
<p>This is what the sensors look&nbsp;like:</p>

<h2 id="why-monitor-shoppers-">Why monitor&nbsp;shoppers?</h2>
<p>Online retailers and e-commerce has many ways to gain insight into their customers. Examples include seeing the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/behaviour-reports#top-online-store-searches" target="_blank">toplist of searched-for items</a>, and the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/behaviour-reports#top-online-store-searches-with-no-results" target="_blank">toplist of searched-for items with no results</a>.</p>
<p>Physical retailers don’t want to be left&nbsp;behind.</p>
<p>So many different ways to monitor shoppers in physical stores have been&nbsp;developed.</p>
<p>Amazon Go stores extensively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/" target="_blank">use cameras</a> to track everything that happens inside their&nbsp;stores.</p>
<p>Many stores provide free WiFi so that they can <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/wi-fi-tracking-a-data-gold-mine-or-privacy-nightmare/572937/" target="_blank">track their customers</a>.</p>
<p>All these solutions have a big problem:&nbsp;privacy.</p>
<p>Cameras see everything – much more than they need. And this data is collected and stored. Free WiFi hotspots may capture all kinds of&nbsp;traffic.</p>
<p>This is an obvious privacy problem for the&nbsp;shoppers.</p>
<p>But it is not just a problem for the&nbsp;shoppers.</p>
<p>It also creates a major problem for the companies storing the data: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/silicon-valley-terrified-california-privacy-law/" target="_blank">personally identifiable data is a liability</a>.</p>
<p>This is why we chose vibration sensors and light sensors. No liability from owning any personally identifiable&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>With only vibration and light, there simply is nothing there to identify individual&nbsp;shoppers.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-shopper-behavior">Understanding shopper&nbsp;behavior</h2>
<p>As a shopper, you want to find the best products, and – ideally – pay the lowest possible&nbsp;price.</p>
<p>The retailers and producers have slightly different&nbsp;motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands want customer to buy their products, and not their&nbsp;competitors’</li>
<li>Retailers want to sell more&nbsp;products</li>
</ul>
<p>And when the motivations of shoppers, retailers, and brands align, business is made. And the more business, the better for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Understanding customer behavior is key to improving the experience for&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p>The sensors detect when people are looking at items. And they report this immediately, so that we can see in real-time where shoppers&nbsp;are.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-a-wireless-iot-mesh-network-">Why use a wireless IoT mesh&nbsp;network?</h2>
<p>A wireless mesh network is a wireless network that automatically extend its&nbsp;range.</p>
<p>The Thingsquare IoT mesh network solution uses so-called <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/what-is-subghz-networking/" target="_blank">sub-GHz wireless technology</a> that has way better range than traditional WiFi or&nbsp;Bluetooth.</p>
<p>But even with a longer range, it is not always&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Electronics stores can be very large. And there is plenty of metal inside them that hampers the wireless&nbsp;coverage.</p>
<p>A mesh network is the ideal technology in these&nbsp;situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Coverage</strong>. Electronics stores can be huge. With a mesh network, we can cover it&nbsp;all.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>It just works</strong>. No network planning is&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to install</strong>. Just put each device where it should&nbsp;be.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to maintain</strong>. If there are issues with coverage, just add extenders as&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Robustness</strong>. If something changes, the network will automatically adapt and&nbsp;overcome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what the wireless mesh network typically looks&nbsp;like:</p>
<div>
<div data-layout="grid" data-controls="#filterControls" data-animation="quicksand" data-x-gap="32" data-y-gap="32" data-media-queries="[
{&quot;width&quot;: 1500, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 1100, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 800, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 480, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 300, &quot;cols&quot;: 1}
]">
<div>
<p><small>
The IoT mesh network uses range extenders to cover the entire area of the electronics store.
</small>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this deployment, the mesh network used one access point and two extenders. Most device are able to reach the access point directly, but some chose to talk to one of the&nbsp;extenders.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery&nbsp;life</h2>
<p>The sensors are equipped with batteries: one coin-cell battery&nbsp;each.</p>
<p>The Thingsquare IoT mesh system is <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/sensortag-power/" target="_blank">tailored for extreme low-power operation</a>. Extreme low-power operation in this case means that the sensors can go for several months one a single&nbsp;charge.</p>
<p>For example, the sensors are automatically turned off at night, to conserve their precious&nbsp;power.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the Thingsquare system continuously collects power consumption data from each and every&nbsp;sensor.</p>
<p>This data lets us see the exact behavior at any given time: are there any sensors that behave in a way that require their batteries to be replaced earlier? The Thingsquare system knows the answers to this, and alerts us if this would be the&nbsp;case.</p>
<div>
<div data-layout="grid" data-controls="#filterControls" data-animation="quicksand" data-x-gap="32" data-y-gap="32" data-media-queries="[
{&quot;width&quot;: 1500, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 1100, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 800, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 480, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 300, &quot;cols&quot;: 1}
]">
<div>
<p><small>
Each sensor measures and reports a detailed break-down of their power consumption.
</small>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>
<p>The ioT mesh network is connected to the Internet via a 4G modem. The network maintains a stable encrypted connection to the backend system so that the devices always can be&nbsp;reached.</p>
<p>If the Internet connection would go down at any point during the deployment, the devices hold off from reporting their data until the Internet connection is&nbsp;restored.</p>
<p>With this technique, no data is ever&nbsp;lost.</p>

Broadly speaking, it is an attempt to give you an opportunity to take a look at Rome as it really was, by the eyes of humans who lived there in that time. Due to this, we are already paying much attention (and will proceed) to the level of details, adding realistic materials, colors, visual and weather effects. That’s why we are concentrating just on the center of the Rome for now, just to focus on quality and details.</p><p>Now we are planning to add a little additional territory (such as Circus Maximus, Velabrum area), and release our project as a 3d walkthrough application. I hope we will be able to complete it in a year approximately.</p> <img src="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg" data-src="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" data-srcset="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg 1600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-600x338.jpg 600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-768x432.jpg 768w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-400x225.jpg 400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" srcset="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg 1600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-600x338.jpg 600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-768x432.jpg 768w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-400x225.jpg 400w"><p>Boasting some impressive in-video lighting features, the animation focuses on the monumental scale that was flaunted by Rome during its apical architectural stage.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>Pioneered 2000 years ago by Aristotle and popularized most recently by Elon Musk, <em>First Principles</em> is a method of reasoning which involves breaking down a complex problem into its most fundamental parts and reasoning upwards from there.</p>
<p>In his interview with Kevin Rose, Musk says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So the normal way we conduct our lives is, we reason by analogy. We are doing this because it’s like something else that was done, or it is like what other people are doing… with slight iterations on a theme. And it’s … mentally easier to reason by analogy rather than from first principles. First principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world, and what that really means is, you … boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, “okay, what are we sure is true?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given his ubiquitous popularity in the mainstream culture, it is easy to forget that what Musk is doing is literally <em>unearthly</em>! Take a minute and read <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">this page</a> on SpaceX's mission statement. It's hard to fathom how courageous, confident and clear one needs to be in their thinking, to come up with a plan to colonize Mars(!) and saying it publicly without the fear of being ridiculed. How does he do it?</p>
<p>He takes an insanely complicated problem, goes to the bottom of it and comes up with intuitive solutions which people before him never came up with because they reasoned by analogy. Notice how this theme of <em>first principles</em> based problem-solving underlies all of his work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>SpaceX</strong> — Space flight is crazy expensive. Why? Because we use new rockets for every launch. That sounds dumb. Let's find a way to make reusable rockets. To the layman it sounds obvious. But why didn't people before him question these basics? Lack of <em>first principles</em> based thinking.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tesla</strong> — Fuel-based automobiles are bad for the planet. Why can't people switch to electric cars? Because they are not battery efficient, lack performance and are often poorly designed. Boom! Tesla now builds some of the most good looking and fastest cars on the planet.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Boring Company</strong> — There's too much traffic on the road. Why? Human settlements are multiple storeyed. But human transport is still archaic and restricted to one plane. Let's change that by boring underground transportation tunnels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this sounds so damn obvious and it is hard to believe that people never questioned these basic premises in their fields. It is mind-blowing how restrictive reasoning by analogy can be.</p>
<h2 id="first-principles-approach-to-life">First Principles Approach to Life</h2>
<p>I know. <em>First principles</em> seems overly simplistic in theory. But trust me, it can be quite difficult to implement. Now I don't know how to make rockets like Elon but over time I have learned how to use <em>first principles</em> as a strategy for living life.</p>
<p>Living abroad and building your life from scratch in a new country is a great way to identify with these principles. In retrospect, I realise that the most fundamental elements of my life were often the things which I took for granted while living at home. Which included my physical and mental health, my friends and family, and a sense of belonging which your homeland provides.</p>
<p>Lockdown-induced self-introspection made 2020 a year of tremendous personal growth and I realised that I had made a lot of decisions in my personal and professional life which did not allign with my principles. But that's okay. We all get influenced by culture and the people around us. We try to replicate other people's life strategies because we see them working. Once you identify and build your life around your own principles, you quickly become unapologetic and make decisions without seeking external validation.</p>
<p>Imagine your life is a tree and every decision you make branches you out into the world. Now all trees branch out differently so it is futile to imitate the trees around you. Of course, you can get some idea about what kind of decisions lead you where but it is really stupid to shape yourself in somebody else's reflection. The reason why <em>first principles</em> drastically improves your decision making and life satisfaction is because every decision you take, every new branch you create, is strongly attached to your own core. Even if it doesn't work out, you will love it as your own.</p>
<p>As it often happens with people, your principles may change over time and that's okay. You can rebranch your tree gradually but honestly, I do believe that there are some core, non-negotiable principles to live a good life. These can also be a good starting point to create your own list of <em>first principles</em>. Here are three undeniable ones — taking care of your body, maintaining healthy relationships and doing satisfying work which pays the bills. Everytime I find myself in a rut, I reason upwards from here.</p>
<h2 id="first-principles-as-opposed-to-backwards-induction">First Principles as opposed to <em>Backwards Induction</em></h2>
<p>I have never found it useful to set specific goals. An unpopular opinion, I know. A notoriously flawed concept in self-improvement circles is the concept of S.M.A.R.T. goals. It is an acronym for goals which are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. This life strategy is a derivative of <em>Backwards Induction</em> way-of-reasoning where you take the end goal in mind and reason backwards from there. Personally, I've found this strategy to be too restrictive and given my temparament and personality-type, I have always enjoyed some amount of spontaneity in life. I like to diversify my interests, trying different things and adjusting my sails as I move forward making sure that I don't miss the forest for the trees. In Tim Minchin's words, "the disciplined pursuit of short-term goals."</p>
<p>I would rather aim to build systems which are in allignment with my principles. Instead of setting a goal to run a sub-4 hour marathon in 6 months, it is more sustainable to create a system which allows me to become a better runner. This means I run every other day, focus on recovery and nutrition, and push my self everyday without injuring myself. Since I don't care about the specifics, I am never dissapointed even if I fail to reach these arbitary metrics. You might say that every system inherently has a goal, no matter how vague. That is true. But the important point is not to make these goals <em>too</em> specific.</p>
<p>This way, reasoning by <em>first principles</em> clears your head, getting rid of assumptions, external influences and perceived limitations drastically improving life satisfaction.</p>

<p><span>Google made almost all its money from ads. It was a booming business—until it wasn’t. Here’s how things looked right before the most spectacular crash the technology industry had ever seen.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>The crumbling of Google’s cornerstone</span></strong></span><br>
<span>Back when Google was still just an idea, its founders thought that “advertising funded search engines [would] be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.”</span></p>
<p><span>They changed their minds.</span></p>
<p><span>With that change, Google became one of the wealthiest, most powerful companies in history. Search was Google’s golden goose, as well as its only unambiguous win. So when Amazon rapidly surpassed Google as the top product search destination in 2017, Google’s foundations began to falter.</span></p>
<p><span>Amazon was fighting Google on its home turf, and it was winning. Even worse, the people turning to Amazon over Google for their shopping searches were from the most important group for advertisers and the future: young people. Advertisers followed them, and Amazon began to siphon away ad dollars that once went to Google search ads. Google’s mighty engine had started to sputter.</span></p>
<p><span><em>Google realized that it was hard to convince people who were used to getting something for free that they should now pay for it.</em></span></p>
<p><span>A shift from search to discovery also started to take shape in the late 2010s: When shoppers weren’t searching for things directly on Amazon, things were finding them. Advertisers realized that money previously spent on Google’s search ads was better spent either on Amazon ads or native ads in content feeds, like Instagram and Facebook. Google had no engaging content feeds, so it completely missed the wave, just like it had with social media and instant messaging.</span></p>
<p><span>Seeing the signs on the horizon, Google tried unsuccessfully to find revenue in areas other than advertising. Google struggled to make money with its hardware, cloud services, and wildly ambitious “Other Bets” categories.</span></p>
<p><span>For all its efforts, the money Google earned from its nonadvertising ventures only ever accounted for a mere 15% of their revenue. And revenue from Google’s moonshot “Other Bets” didn’t even cover a small fraction of the increasingly massive fines the company started to receive from looming regulators.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The war on ads</strong></span><br>
<span>In late 2015, Apple—Google’s main competitor in the mobile space—added a feature to their devices that allowed users to block ads.</span></p>
<p><span>Devices running iOS were responsible for as much as 75% of Google’s revenue from mobile search ads, which is probably why Google was paying Apple billions of dollars every year to remain the default search engine on Apple devices. By making this move, Apple was simultaneously weighing in decisively on the great ad blocking debate of the 2010s and dealing a substantial blow to the future of online advertising.</span></p>
<p><span>This move from Apple reflected the unprecedented mainstream adoption of ad blocking software happening at the time. Having one of the biggest technology companies on the planet standing behind consumers only emboldened the movement.</span></p>
<p><span>Well over a quarter of desktop and laptop users in the United States were blocking ads by the year 2018. Those users would soon block ads on their mobile devices, too, as mobile ad block usage eclipsed desktop usage in 2017 and rose even faster.</span></p>

<p><span>Mobile ads were one of Google’s biggest areas of growth during its final years of domination, but people started to block mobile ads en masse once they realized that ads and tracking scripts were costing them as much as $23 per month in bandwidth and using up a significant portion of their battery life.</span></p>
<p><span>Research showed that 54% of users reported a lack of trust as their reason for not clicking banner ads, and 33% found them completely intolerable. The average banner ad was clicked on by a dismal 0.06% of viewers, and of those clicks, over 60% were accidental.</span></p>
<p><span>Even those who weren’t blocking ads had trained themselves to ignore them entirely. Researchers dubbed this phenomenon “banner blindness.”</span><br>
<span>The people most likely to block ads were also the most valuable to advertisers: millennials and high earners. Young users are a strong indicator for future trends, and they were heavy users of ad blocking software. Internet users had spoken, and they hated Google’s ads.</span></p>
<p><span>The ad blocking epidemic presented significant threats to Google’s business: People were getting used to using the internet without seeing ads, and Google was losing money every time their ads were blocked.</span></p>
<p><span>In early 2017, Google made the desperate, confusing, and legally questionable decision to add its own form of ad blocker to Chrome, but it did nothing except attract more antitrust regulation. It would quickly become clear to Google that even though ads were getting slightly better, ad blocking numbers would continue to rise.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://hccr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1__L_0UuwYZTraQ6TBxLUwjQ.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="469" srcset="https://www.hccr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1__L_0UuwYZTraQ6TBxLUwjQ.jpeg 500w, https://www.hccr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1__L_0UuwYZTraQ6TBxLUwjQ-300x281.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-srcset="https://www.hccr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1__L_0UuwYZTraQ6TBxLUwjQ.jpeg 500w, https://www.hccr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1__L_0UuwYZTraQ6TBxLUwjQ-300x281.jpeg 300w" data-src="https://hccr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1__L_0UuwYZTraQ6TBxLUwjQ.jpeg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>

<p><span>Later, in 2019, Google tried to make it harder for users to block ads in its then-dominant Chrome browser. All while Google was paying huge sums of money to let its ads through the most popular ad blocking software.</span></p>
<p><span>Google wasn’t willing to acknowledge the problems people had with the system they helped create, and it was clear that the company had no idea what to do when people started rejecting it. Too many people had become accustomed to a web without invasive banner ads following them around and slowing down every site they visited. Internet users had waged a war on ads, and Google was losing.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>An unprofitable behemoth</span></strong></span><br>
<span>A key platform where Google served ads was YouTube, which it bought in 2006 and quickly turned into one of its biggest entities. But even with a sixth of the world visiting this video-sharing behemoth every month, YouTube never became profitable.</span></p>
<p><span>While attempting to coax big brands and advertisers onto the platform in the hopes of finally turning a profit, YouTube misunderstood, alienated, and downright angered the creators and communities that had turned the platform into a global phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span>In an attempt to combat the effect of ad blockers, Google launched an ad-free subscription model in late 2015, but the subscription numbers were underwhelming, and eventually, Google realized that it was hard to convince people who were used to getting something for free that they should now pay for it.</span></p>
<p><span>YouTube ads were interruptive and annoying to users, and the video-sharing site never proved to be as effective for brand awareness advertising as Google needed it to be. Global ad spend continued to move online from traditional media, but it wasn’t going to Google’s platforms.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>The turning tides</span></strong></span><br>
<span>Google’s products were free, innovative, and used by billions of people. In order to get access to these free products, people had to give up their personal data and their valuable attention. Google’s ads weren’t something its users wanted—they were simply a tax for accessing the Google ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span>Google was enticing people into trading their privacy, data, and attention for the convenience of its amazing free products and services, some of which had no good alternatives. However, scandal after scandal after scandal proved that the trade might not be worth it, and people started to question what they were giving up by clicking “I agree.”</span></p>
<p><em><span>Every word uttered to Google Assistant, every action in any of Google’s numerous apps, and every data point about every one of their billions of users was stored and analyzed in the name of more accurate advertising.</span></em></p>
<p><span>And it wasn’t just Google’s users questioning the trade-off. Regulators and decision makers also finally started to understand how free internet products and services made money, and the companies behind them soon faced a long-awaited reckoning.</span></p>
<p><span>With its golden goose getting old, ad blocking rising, public opinion shifting, regulation closing in, and all of its ambitious bets on the future failing to make money, a lot was riding on Google’s next moves.</span></p>
<p><span>It made the wrong ones.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How Google missed the chance to pivot</span></strong><br>
<span>If losing a major portion of their audience and annoying the rest wasn’t bad enough, Google also failed to get ahead of one of the biggest shifts in the internet’s history.</span></p>
<p><span>Google’s strategy since day one could be summed up as “aggregate and advertise,” as George Gilder put it in Life After Google. Every word uttered to Google Assistant, every action in any of Google’s numerous apps, and every data point about every one of their billions of users was stored and analyzed in the name of more accurate advertising.</span></p>
<p><span>Google’s business model was built on the foundational belief that in order to serve ads accurately, it had to collect and analyze as much data as possible from as many people as possible. This belief led the entire advertising industry to turn the web into a monstrosity of tracking and surveillance.</span></p>
<p><span>The holy grail of accurate advertising is perfect targeting and perfect attribution: getting an ad in front of the right people, knowing exactly when and where someone saw an ad, and being able to prove where credit is due when they make a purchase.</span></p>
<p><span>The entire industry was spinning its wheels chasing this vision, but eventually realized that its approach to the problem was completely backward. A vast, seedy, unfathomable landscape of tracking tendrils spanning the entire web would only ever overcomplicate things, ruin the user experience, and enable a staggering amount of ad fraud.</span><br>
<span>True attribution and accurate targeting used to be rocket science, black magic, and nearly impossible.</span></p>
<p><span>The breakthrough was this: If everything from interest matching to ad placement happened inside the user’s device, it would be possible to show the user ads they would actually find …</span></p></div></div>

<center><b>Counterfeiting Stock 2.0</b></center>

<p>
Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.
</p>
<p>
<span>Why is This Important?</span> This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans.
</p>
<p>
The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations.
</p>
<p>
The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed—the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.
</p>
<p>
<span>A Glossary of Illogical Terms</span> — The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Broker Dealer or Prime Broker</b> — The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house — also known as a broker's broker.
</li>
<li><b>Hedge Funds</b> — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.
</li>
<li><b>Market Maker</b> — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting.
</li>
<li><b>Short Seller</b> — An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as “the shorts.”
</li>
<li><b>The Securities and Exchange Commission</b> — The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top–level management is a five–person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.
</li>
<li><b>Depository Trust Clearing Corp</b> — Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later.
</li>
<li><b>Short Sale</b> — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back.
<p>This relatively simple process is perfectly legal—so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.
</p></li>
<li><b>Disclosed Short</b> — When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing. 
</li>
<li><b>Naked Short</b> — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud. 
<p>
Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.
</p></li>
<li><b>Fails–to–Deliver</b> — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.
<p>
Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).
</p></li>
<li><b>Options</b> — The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to sell shares (a “put”). Options are an integral part of short manipulations, the result of SEC promulgated loopholes in Reg SHO. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called “out of the money.” If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.
</li>
<li><b>Naked call</b> — The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list. A share of stock that has a naked call as its borrowed shares is marked as a disclosed short when it is sold, even though nobody in the transaction actually owns a share.
</li>
</ol>

    <div>
        <p>LONDON. <strong>Mr Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, why hasn't AstraZeneca been more specific on detailing the supply problem detected on its European plants? What exactly is the problem? &nbsp;</strong></p>

<div><p>“I think we have been relatively specific with the information. Of course, we are all very disappointed. We would like to produce more. I think we will deliver up to Europe in the month of February a reasonable quantity actually, very similar to what others have delivered on a monthly basis. But of course, it's less than expected and also because our vaccine is easy to use people expected more so we could scale up.&nbsp;Our team is working 24/7 to fix the very much issues of production of the vaccine itself. You have two steps in the production of a vaccine: one is you produce the vaccine itself. We call it a drug substance, the vaccine. Then, when we are finished with it, we move this into different plants where we put the vaccine into vials and we call that the drug product, the final product.&nbsp;For Europe the drugs substance is essentially produced in two plants, one in the Netherlands, one in Belgium. The drug product is actually produced in Italy and Germany. So from a drug product viewpoint, we have full capacity. We have zero problem. The current problems have to do with manufacturing the drugs substance”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
“So maybe I need to give you a little bit of explanation as to how we manufacture those vaccines. Essentially, we have cell cultures, big batches, 1000-litre or 2000-litre batches. We have cell cultures inside those batches and we inject them with the virus, the vaccine, if you will. Then those cells produce the vaccine, it’s a biotechnology protection. Now, some of those batches have very high yield and others have low yield. Particularly in Europe, we had one site with large capacity that experienced yield issues. So it's essentially a question of when you scale up to the level we are scaling up to - &nbsp;something like this that's never been done. We are scaling up to hundreds of millions, billions of doses of vaccines at a very high speed".</p></div>

<div><p>“A year ago, we didn't have a vaccine. When you do that, you have glitches, you have scale-up problems. Therefore, the yield varies from one to three, by the factor of three. The best site we have produces three times more vaccine out of a batch than the lowest producing site. We do this with a series of partners: in the US, those partners are actually approved by BARDA, the US administration, the group that manages those things and manages the capacity”.</p></div><p>
"In the US, we also have issues of yield and essentially our engineers have worked with our partners to identify what the issues are. We believe we have sorted out the issues now. The issues are different, for instance, in Belgium: we believe it was more a question of downstream filtering because when you finish making the vaccine, you have to filter it. When you filter it, you put it into vials.&nbsp;Our partner in Australia for instance also had yield issues. And they have been in the vaccine business for 20 years. But it's complicated, especially in the early phase where you have to really kind of sort out all sorts of issues. We believe we've sorted out those issues, but we are basically two months behind where we wanted to be. We've had also teething issues like this in the UK supply chain.&nbsp;But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So with the UK we have&nbsp; had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced. As for Europe, we are three months behind in fixing those glitches. Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume. We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small”.</p>

<div><p><strong>You say that EU is going to receive a reasonable quantity of doses by February. Could you please quantify this?</strong><br>
"First of all, as soon as we get an approval by EMA, in the next few days, we will be shipping at least three million doses immediately to Europe, then we'll have another shipment about a week later and then the third or fourth week of February. And the target is to deliver 17 million doses by February. So, I am just estimating roughly, that would mean like about 3 million doses for Germany, probably 2,5 million for Italy and something like 2 million for Spain. I don't know exactly what the precise allocation is, but it's based on the population of each country. If you're in Germany, you can vaccinate three million people in one month. It's actually not so bad especially for the people who are the most exposed and most at risk. That's not a small proportion. And if you apply the three month regimen, then in March, you can do the same again or more potentially because we are working hard to increase our goals. It's not as good as we would like to, but it's really it's not so bad”.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>So Europe signed the contract too late, instead of the UK?</strong><br>
“I will not pass judgment on this. But I can only tell you the facts and the facts are that we basically signed an agreement with the UK three months before we did have it with Europe. Now, part of this can be easily explained. When we entered the agreement with Oxford, they had already been working with the UK government on this. So they had a head start. We were able to quite quickly take the UK supply chain and improve it. We had to modify the formula in the process, because Oxford gave us a process that needed to be modified to enable manufacturing at scale.&nbsp;Just think about, we've done all of this in months. Usually, it takes years. We got a manufacturing process that Oxford gave us, which was producing a good vaccine, but not at an industrial scale. It was just able to produce quantities for clinical trials. So then we had to modify the process to turn it into a process that could manufacture billions of doses. At a cost that is reasonable and at a speed that is reasonable".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We had to change all of these. Then we had to do what we call technology transfer. So we go to each partner and we train them on the process. We train them on how to manufacture. And then, you know, some people are new to this process. It's like they learn the process. They don't know how to make the vaccine and they're not as efficient as others".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"So you may have lower productivity. That's why we have a productivity going from one to three. And so, unfortunately, it's really bad luck. Actually, there's nothing mysterious about it. But look, the sites that have the lowest productivity in the network are the sites that are supplying Europe. And quite honestly, I mean, we're not doing it on purpose. I'm European, I have Europe at heart. Our chairman is Swedish, is European. Our CFO is European. Many people in the management are European. So we want to treat Europe as best we can. You know, we do this at no profit, remember? We didn't go into this to try and make money or whatever. We would like to treat Europe as good as possible. I actually do believe we treated Europe fairly". &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
"Now, let me give you another number. Our total capacity globally now is about 100 million doses a month.&nbsp;From February onwards we are able to make 100 million doses a month, that's not small. Most vaccines have 100 million doses a year, that already takes us on a 1,2 billion pace per year. We are going to keep growing. Of course, we are ramping up production and Europe is getting 17 percent of this global production in February for a population that is 5 percent of the world population.&nbsp; Now, from the beginning we took very seriously the approach that Europe took, which we thought was fair and we all took. In fact, the US didn't say that Europe said that. Europe said the vaccine is common good and everybody needs to get access at the same time globally. That's what we are doing. Europe is getting 17 percent of our global supply for a month for 5 percent of the world population. The problem is: 100 million doses is a lot, but we have 7,5 billion people in the world".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We are in the ramp-up phase and basically it will improve, but it takes time. Having said all of this, I'm not looking for excuses, honestly.&nbsp; We take accountability. We want to do better and we're working day and night. Our people in manufacturing, we have hundreds of people, thousands of people now. Many of them didn't take any Christmas vacation. I'm not asking you feel sorry for us but you know, we're doing our very best. But it's a very complicated process and a big scale”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>After the explanation you just gave at the same time it is striking the aggressive way which the EU has responded, even threatning to impose a new control on exports of activity out of Europe. Some are suggesting that you're selling your product to some other countries.&nbsp; </strong><br>
“The suggestion we sell to other countries to make more money is not right because we make no profit everywhere.That's the approach we took and we agreed on that. That’s the agreement we have with Oxford University.&nbsp;It's actually even written in a contract we have with Oxford University: that we will be at no profit. We have slightly different prices from one geographic to the other because the cost of goods may be different. We have a supply chain in Brazil, we have another one in Latin America, another one in South Asia. We have one in Japan. Of course, you know, local costs are different. So you've got slight variations, but more or less, it's about three to four dollars, more or less everywhere.&nbsp;It makes no difference. Zero difference. I understand we all want to be vaccinated. I think the populations of Europe, like everywhere else in the world, have been under so much stress with this pandemic for so long now, for a year or so, that people are tired. And I think the people who didn't want to be vaccinated maybe …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p><u><b><a name="confidence-xor"></a>Notes about <i>xor</i></b></u>. Fuzzy <span color="#0000FF">xor</span> can be defined in two
ways equivalent in crisp logic: (<i>x</i>&amp;<span><i>y</i></span>)&nbsp;∨&nbsp;(<span><i>x</i></span>&amp;<i>y</i>)
and (<i>x</i>∨<i>y</i>)&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;(<i><span>x</span></i>∨<i><span>y</span></i>).
These two definitions stay equivalent when <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> become fuzzy, despite the fact that
<i>x</i>&amp;<span><i>x</i></span> might be
greater than 0 and <i>x</i>∨<span><i>x</i></span>
be less than 1. It can be shown that:
</p><blockquote>
<p>(<i>x</i>&amp;<span><i>x</i></span>)&nbsp;∨&nbsp;(<i>y</i>&amp;<span><i>y</i></span>)
≤
(<i>x</i>&amp;<span><i>y</i></span>)&nbsp;∨&nbsp;(<span><i>x</i></span>&amp;<i>y</i>)

<h2>2. Fuzzy sets</h2>
<p>
<a name="Set"></a><a name="Fuzzy"></a>A fuzzy set mathematically is a function mapping its domain to [0,1]. So a fuzzy 
set A over some domain set D is A:&nbsp;D→[0,1].&nbsp;For any domain value <i>x</i>∈D it 
gives a confidence factor (or else a level of truth) telling how possible is 
that <i>x</i> belongs to A, i.e. A(<i>x</i>) = P<sub>A|{<i>x</i>}</sub> = P<sub><i>x</i>∈A</sub>. 
Customary the membership function of A is distinguished from the set and notated 
as μ<sub>A</sub>(<i>x</i>), but we will not do it. Though the meaning of A(<i>x</i>) 
was defined as a possibility, it is both a necessity that <i>x</i> belongs to A. 
This is because for fuzzy sets we postulate that P<sub>A|{<i>x</i>} </sub>= N<sub>A|{<i>x</i>}</sub> 
= N<sub><i>x</i>∈A</sub>. Which is equivalent to a definition of the fuzzy set 
complement as
<span>A</span>(<i>x</i>) = 1-A(<i>x</i>).
</p><p>
The type <a href="#Set">Set</a> is defined 
in the package
<a href="#Fuzzy">Fuzzy</a>. It represents a fuzzy set over an interval of 
integer numbers. A more natural approach would be to define fuzzy sets with the 
domain of any discrete type. Unfortunately it would make the package generic, 
with the consequence that it would be almost impossible to use it for things 
like fuzzy decision trees. So I chose the following definition of the type <a href="#Set">
Set</a>:<br>
</p><blockquote>
<tt> <span color="#0000FF">   type</span> Set <span color="#0000FF"> is array</span> 
(Integer <span color="#0000FF">range</span> &lt;&gt;)<span color="#0000FF"> of</span> 
Confidence;</tt></blockquote>
<p>
The package
<a href="#Fuzzy">Fuzzy</a> defines various operations on the instances of <a href="#Set">Set</a>.</p><p>

<h3>
2.1. Tests</h3>
<p>
<a href="#Confidence">Confidence</a> of an element can be obtained either by using 
the predefined array indexing operation or by the function Is_In:
</p><blockquote>
  <p><tt><span color="#0000FF">function</span>
  Is_In (<b>Point</b> : Integer; <b> A</b> : Set) <span color="#0000FF"> return</span> 
  Confidence;</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The function Is_In does not raise an exception even if <b>Point</b> is not in <b>
A</b>'Range,&nbsp;in which case it returns 0.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>“There are 10 types of people, those who understand the binary system and everyone else.” — Unknown Author</p><blockquote><p><strong>This is an excerpt from the Full Stack JS course <a href="https://js.coderslang.com/sign-in" target="_blank">CoderslangJS</a>
.</strong></p></blockquote><p>— Good day, Hero! Today you’ll learn with C2H5. He is a robot and our ally in the fight against machines.</p><p>— Thanks for the introduction, Professor. Machines aren’t very different from humans in terms of general thinking, but we have our own characteristics.</p><h2 id="binary-number-system">Binary number system</h2><p>Since you will have to return to the simulation of 2021, we will consider everything in terms of that time. We believe that full-fledged artificial intelligence had not yet been created and you can still stop the apocalypse.</p><p>First, imagine 10 light bulbs. Each of them can be turned on or off.</p><p><a href="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104956_en.svg" target="_blank"><img src="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104956_en.svg" alt=""></a></p><p>Let’s stop here for a second. How many numbers can you represent using these 10 bulbs?</p><p>— <em>Eeeemmm, up to 10?</em></p><p>— We can definitely count up to 10 if we only count the total number of bulbs that are “on”. But do you think we could count to 1000 using the same 10 bulbs?</p><p><em>— No, I think it’s impossible.</em></p><p>— Well, I’ll try to show you that nothing is impossible for machines.</p><p>Try to imagine that each light bulb is not just “on” or “off”, but displays a single digit from 0 to 9.</p><p><a href="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104961_en.svg" target="_blank"><img src="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104961_en.svg" alt=""></a></p><p>Then, we could get all combinations from 0,000,000,000 to 9,999,999,999. Or 10 billion different numbers, including 0, of course.</p><p><em>— Ok, but it’s still unclear how we could count up to 1000 using 10 regular bulbs.</em></p><p>— Now let’s figure out the details. Imagine on our “tube calculator” some random number. For example, 2375. We’ll discard zeros to ease the calculation. To understand that this number is “two thousand three hundred seventy five” you do several operations:</p><blockquote><p>5 * 1 + 7 * 10 + 3 * 100 + 2 * 1000 = 5 + 70 +300 + 2000 = 2375</p></blockquote><p>As you see, <strong>each digit has its own weight</strong>. It is calculated according to the formula:</p><blockquote><p>BASE to the power of POSITION</p></blockquote><p>The BASE is the basis of the numeral system. Humans usually use the numeral system with the base 10. Machines, on the other hand, use a different one with base 2. It’s a lot easier for us to operate with it.</p><p>We start counting positions from the right and the initial position is always 0, so the weight of the first digit is 1, since raising any BASE to the zero power is 1.</p><p>The next “slots” in the decimal system have their own weights of 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc.</p><p>Of course, you don’t count it every time you see a decimal number. But we need an understanding of this formula to move forward.</p><p>— <em>This is quite obvious, but if I remember correctly, there were no numbers in the original task. You’ve only mentioned 2 states - on/off.</em></p><p>— That’s right. Now let’s try not just to count the number of lights that are <strong>on</strong>, also taking into account their position.</p><p>Imagine a sequence of lights like this - 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1</p><p><a href="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104963_en.svg" target="_blank"><img src="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104963_en.svg" alt=""></a></p><p>We’ll start by assigning a weight to each position.</p><p>Position 0 = 2 ^ 0 = 1</p><p>Position 1 = 2 ^ 1 = 2</p><p>Position 2 = 2 ^ 2 = 4</p><p>…</p><p>Position 9 = 2 ^ 9 = 512</p><p>Now, to calculate the final number, we just have to multiply the weight of each position by its value (0 or 1).</p><p>So, 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 8 + 0 * 16 + 1 * 32 + 0 * 64 + 1 * 128 + 0 * 256 + 1 * 512 = 1 + 4 + 8 + 32 + 128 = 173</p><p><a href="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104968_en.svg" target="_blank"><img src="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104968_en.svg" alt=""></a></p><p>— <em>Now it’s clear. It turns out if we turn on all the lights, then we get 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 = 1023?</em></p><p>— That’s right. In a way, this is even easier to calculate, because we either take into account the weight of a certain category or discard it.</p><h2 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h2><p>— If you move closer, then, in fact, both decimal numbers and binary ones exist only in our imagination.</p><p><em>— What do you mean? I can well imagine 12 chairs at the dining table or 40 people standing in line. They can exist not only in my head but also in reality.</em></p><p>— Of course, both people and chairs will exist. But to associate the number 12 in decimal or 10100 in binary with a well-defined number of chairs, we need to agree on how to count them.</p><p>If there were 3 chairs, not 12, then the easiest way would be to show them as 3 fingers on one hand or 3 light bulbs that are <strong>on</strong>. This is the simplest and most obvious way to calculate something. But what if there are 12, 40, 125? We’ll quickly run out of both fingers and the light bulbs.</p><p><a href="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104922.svg" target="_blank"><img src="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104922.svg" alt=""></a></p><p>Therefore, people came up with numeral systems. And the decimal system was not always so widespread. The Romans would have marked the same chairs as <strong>XII</strong> and most likely would not have understood what the inscription <strong>12</strong> means.</p><p>As a matter of fact, everything we talk about is an abstraction. We’ve made it harder to count the number of items, but it’s much easier to operate with large numbers.</p><p><em>— It seems to me that numbers are so common in our lives that no one even perceives it as a complication.</em></p><p>— That’s right. A first grader needs quite some time to calculate the amount of money he needs to buy a kilo of apples and oranges. But adults don’t have this problem, because when you do something very often, it becomes natural.</p><p>Please note that if at some point, instead of the numbers <strong>0, 1, 2 … 9</strong>, people decided to use the letters <strong>a, b, c … k</strong>, then your <strong>12</strong> chairs would turn into <strong>bc</strong> chairs, but the physical chairs themselves would not be affected in any way.</p><p><a href="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104923_en.svg" target="_blank"><img src="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104923_en.svg" alt=""></a></p><h2 id="algorithms-and-pseudocode">Algorithms and Pseudocode</h2><p>— In 2021, the machines were not yet fully autonomous and, mainly, served humans to make their life easier. Routine operations that could have taken months or years for humans to do, were performed by computers in seconds.</p><p>The only difficulty was that the human couldn’t simply say to a computer “<strong>do something good, useful, and important</strong>.” It was necessary to write a program that would do this “something”.</p><p>The good news is that after this program was written, anyone in the world could use it.</p><p><a href="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104924.svg" target="_blank"><img src="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104924.svg" alt=""></a></p><p>As a result, fewer and fewer people were aware of what was happening inside the machines. First, the computer helped the person find the right number in the contact list to order pizza by phone. Then, they began to understand voice commands and started to place orders on their own. Further - to decide which pizzeria to place an order in. And at the end - which route the courier should take.</p><p>The goal of the best programmers of those times was to create a full-fledged artificial intelligence. One that could solve any task, and not just distinguish cats from dogs.</p><p>How it all ended - you already know. At some point, even the creators themselves could no longer predict how the machines would behave. They justified it with the common good and talked about how terrible human life was before the invention of AI.</p><p><a href="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104925.svg" target="_blank"><img src="https://learn.coderslang.com/Group%20104925.svg" alt=""></a></p><p>But in the end, people have become for machines what ants once were for people. They are everywhere, but there is no point in exterminating them. As well as feeling anything about the fact that they will take away a few grains of sugar that have fallen from the kitchen table.</p><p><em>— And do you think that I can really figure out what the best minds have not coped in 2021?</em></p><p>— Otherwise, we wouldn’t be wasting time on your preparation, Hero. Your advantage is the fact that we know exactly how to make a programmer out of you and integrate into the <strong>company that cannot be named</strong>.</p><p>But, let’s not get distracted. Let’s try to figure out how to find a person in the telephone directory. Let his name be John Snow.</p><h3 id="method-1---linear-search">Method 1 - Linear Search</h3><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">open the directory on the first page
look through all entries from top to bottom
<span>if</span> a match is found <span>(</span>John Snow<span>)</span>
    we call the found number
<span>else</span>
    go to the next entry
repeat <span>until</span> we run out of pages
</code></pre></div><p><em>— C2H5, don’t get me wrong, but no one searches like that. Even my grandma will make sure to first to look at the table of contents, find on which page the letter “S” is, and only then will she start the search according to your algorithm.</em></p><p>— You’re right. If you have a table of contents, it’s definitely worth a look. This technique is called <strong>indexing</strong> and is very commonly used in databases.</p><p>But, regardless of how non-optimal the linear search is, it will definitely help us find Peter Vasiliev’s phone number or make sure that it is not in the directory.</p><p>How would you <strong>optimize the linear search algorithm</strong> if you didn’t have indexes (table of contents), but you knew that all records are ordered from A to Z?</p><p><em>— I would probably try to guess on which page the letter “S” is. I would open the directory closer to the beginning, but not on the very first page. If I hadn’t guessed right, I would have tried again, depending on which page I was on.</em></p><p>— It’s a great approach because you assume that the directory has about the same number of surnames for each letter of the alphabet. But this was not mentioned in the initial description. We can theoretically find ourselves in a world where 90% of people have a surname starting with the letter A, then I would suggest opening the directory exactly in the middle. Then, evaluate the accuracy of the hit and go right or left, discarding half of the entries.</p><p>Since I am a robot, I will try to formalize this algorithm for you in “almost” human language.</p><h3 id="method-2---binary-search">Method 2 - Binary Search</h3><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">open the directory in the middle
look where we are
<span>if</span> a match is found <span>(</span>John Snow<span>)</span>
    we call the found number
otherwise
    <span>if</span> surnames with the letter <span>"S"</span> are earlier
        discard the right side of the directory and go to step <span>1</span>
    <span>if</span> surnames with the letter <span>"S"</span> are later
        discard the left side of the directory and go to step <span>1</span>
repeat <span>until</span> pages run out
</code></pre></div><p>As in the case of linear search, we will either find the required entry or make sure that it is not there.</p><blockquote><p>IMPORTANT! Binary search only works in sorted data structures, such as phone books or dictionaries.</p></blockquote><p>It is also much faster than a linear search. And the more elements in the data structure, the stronger the advantage becomes!</p><p>If you imagine that a single iteration (repetition) of the search algorithm takes 1 second and there are 100 entries in our phone book, then a linear search will take 100 seconds in the worst case, or 50 on average, and a binary search will take less than 7!</p><p><em>— That’s quite obvious. Reducing the amount of data to search 2 times after each repetition is very useful.</em></p><p>— But it gets even more interesting …</p></div></article></div></div>

On the one hand, stock markets continue to thrive, and the economy feels poised to come roaring back, fueled by a population vaccinated and ready to work and play with others again. On the other hand, many worry which bull markets might stumble, and which bubbles might burst.</p><p id="046c">Beyond the legitimate handwringing, there’s one economy that will provide steady, consistent opportunities and growth in the coming decade: The Decarbonization Economy. Call this ClimateTech, Cleantech 2.0, or something new, but know this about the transition to an economy free of carbon emissions: it’s big, it’s getting bigger, and it won’t be going away. This new economy is different. We’re not shoehorning sustainability into old systems. We’re redesigning the economy. The scale of this transformation is on par with the digitization economy before it.</p><p id="1612">Andrew, you say, give me a break. We’ve seen this movie before — in fact, I think you were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/technology/14valley.html" rel="noopener"><em>in this movie</em></a>. The Cleantech 1.0 “revolution” turned out to be a dud. The promises were massive, and the results were not. Aren’t you just setting us up to repeat history? Can’t we learn from the past?</p><blockquote><p id="a701">The decarbonization of the global economy is a transformation on par with the digitization of the economy before it.</p></blockquote><p id="fa32"><strong>We <em>can </em>learn from the past — and we are soon to learn that this time is different.</strong> As with many transformations, the visions laid out over a decade ago were powerful, but not ready to scale. Renewable generation was too expensive, batteries weren’t ready to power our vehicles, and much of the world had not felt the sting of climate change. We did the work, but it certainly took longer than we all wanted.</p><h2 id="768d">2000–2021, In Brief</h2><p id="ea54">When I started my journey as a founder in the cleantech world in 2003, “climate change” was a thermostat setting. Al Gore’s documentary <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/" rel="noopener"><em>An Inconvenient Truth</em></a> was three years from release, and oil was at historic low pricing. What a difference a decade (or two) makes. By 2010, climate was moving up the ladder of “most important” issues on polls, solar was much cheaper, and proof points of climate-related start-ups were starting to appear — including <a href="http://www.tesla.com/" rel="noopener">Tesla</a>, <a href="http://www.sunrun.com/" rel="noopener">Sunrun</a>, <a href="https://www.nextracker.com/" rel="noopener">Nextracker</a>, and <a href="http://www.nest.com/" rel="noopener">Nest</a>, which helped reimagine that thermostat.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4200/0*zbZcrpb21UlhotvX.png" width="2100" height="3243" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*zbZcrpb21UlhotvX.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*zbZcrpb21UlhotvX.png 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/0*zbZcrpb21UlhotvX.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>This Lazard data sums up the steady transformation which took place in the last decade, predicted by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Revolution-Publisher-MIT-Press/dp/B004QJYVA6/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=solar+revolution+travis+bradford&amp;qid=1611681942&amp;sr=8-3" rel="noopener">almost </a>no one.</figcaption></figure><p id="df7d">But it wasn’t enough. We didn’t “solve” the existential crisis of climate overnight, and we didn’t create a new fusion device with infinite carbon-free power. Investors used venture dollars for project finance, and mainstream venture just plain missed some of the big winners from FirstSolar to Chinese solar start-ups. So, the attention of tech founders focused elsewhere. All but a resolute few went back to that other transformation of our economy, digitization…and decarbonization was a side-effect, at best (see <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/how-video-meetings-are-helping-reduce-environmental-impact-infographic/" rel="noopener">Zoom</a>).</p><p id="10bf">Fast forward another decade, and we’re back. Early-stage founders, funders, and change-makers are uniting in their commitment to making it work.</p><p id="3f22">But why is this time different? This time is so much broader — we’re talking about all aspects of climate and our economy, not just energy. But beyond that, there are specific drivers of change this time around.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5200/0*uNe1Ojg6nhXXQ2UN.png" width="2600" height="98" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*uNe1Ojg6nhXXQ2UN.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*uNe1Ojg6nhXXQ2UN.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*uNe1Ojg6nhXXQ2UN.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*uNe1Ojg6nhXXQ2UN.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*uNe1Ojg6nhXXQ2UN.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="0012"><strong>Today: Five Key Differences</strong></h2><p id="0e8b">What clear signals make me confident in our ability to create massive value while transforming our global economy, and why today? Here’s my top five.</p><p id="22f5"><strong><em>1. Corporate and Consumer Demand Both Go Clean</em></strong><em><br></em>There’s a <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/retail-social-sustainability-trend/" rel="noopener">perfect storm today</a> of consumers, investors, and corporations all pushing in the same direction. Large multinationals are tripping over each other in an effort to become the leaders in speed (“<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/" rel="noopener">Carbon Neutral by 2030</a>!”) or depth (“<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/" rel="noopener">Carbon <em>Negative </em>by 2030</a>!”). These are not pie-in-the-sky, free-of-charge goals. These ambitions cost money, and take time and focus. Compared to the last go-around, these companies are now tooling up and learning from the past. They have met some of those early goals (<a href="https://sustainability.google/progress/" rel="noopener">see: Google</a>), and know what it takes. Expect to see more mention of “100%” and “Net Neutral” in the coming years. These labels will apply to energy, but also water, agriculture, and mobility. Corporate board rooms are already <a href="https://youtu.be/wj0UrF2T130" rel="noopener">boning up</a> on the differences between scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions because they know the next generation of customers will demand they get it (see #4).</p><p id="ce0f">Consumers are also behaving differently this time around. Whereas before climate change was more in the movies than a lived experience, today they see it — and are increasingly living it — year round.<strong> </strong>The fact that Californians talk about “fire season” now like it’s just part of the calendar is <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/09/climate-change-increases-risk-fires-western-us/" rel="noopener">the tip of the melting iceberg</a>. According to <a href="https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/Business-and-the-Fourth-Wave-of-Environmentalism_2019.pdf" rel="noopener">one survey</a>, 93% of executives believe customers hold them accountable for their environmental impact.</p><p id="df35">The availability of transparent information plays a role here as well. Younger generations leading today’s buying power use the internet to clearly understand their ingredient labels — not just for what they put in their bodies, but what they put on their bodies, feed their pets, and use to build (and clean)<strong> </strong>their homes. They are coming to expect that those ingredient labels also help them understand their carbon and environmental impact.</p><p id="f1cd"><strong><em>2. Cost and Performance</em></strong><em> <br></em>Today, evidence is everywhere that we are in the midst of a complete transformation of carbon-producing economies. Solar costs have dropped by 90% in the last decade alone (and 90% in the decade before that). Wind energy is now cost competitive in most parts of the world. Batteries are powering some of the most popular passenger cars ever made. It took us two decades to get to this point, but the better way is now also the more economical way.</p><p id="89e3">What’s even more exciting is that, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/10/12/9510879/iea-underestimate-renewables" rel="noopener">if history is any guide</a>, we’re still radically underestimating what’s ahead:</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1706/1*syOjrjnKiut146fUr9tuCw.jpeg" width="853" height="759" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*syOjrjnKiut146fUr9tuCw.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1008/1*syOjrjnKiut146fUr9tuCw.jpeg 504w" sizes="504px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*syOjrjnKiut146fUr9tuCw.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1690/1*tp-b8eDBngvE0Fc7ne1MIA.jpeg" width="845" height="763" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*tp-b8eDBngvE0Fc7ne1MIA.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/994/1*tp-b8eDBngvE0Fc7ne1MIA.jpeg 497w" sizes="497px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*tp-b8eDBngvE0Fc7ne1MIA.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>The International Energy Agency has been woefully off in forecasting renewables growth.</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="049f">These charts take a minute to digest, but it’s worth the effort. Solar and wind cost estimates from the IEA have been so far off for so long, it’s staggering. Luckily, there are <a href="https://about.bnef.com/new-energy-outlook/" rel="noopener">better sources</a>.</p><p id="ff8e">If these trends continue to be this far off not only for clean energy, but also for energy storage, things are about to get interesting. With solar, wind, and energy storage as the only obvious choices for generation and land-based mobility, <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/almost-all-new-us-power-plants-in-2021-will-be-carbon-free" rel="noopener">it appears</a> we are at the beginning of radical disruption.</p><p id="6e60"><strong><em>3. Follow the Money</em></strong><em><br></em>While scientists and industry insiders have seen this wave coming for some time, the money has now definitively entered the building. Unlike last time around, this isn’t about loan guarantees or DARPA grants (<a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/what-renewable-energy-and-energy-storage-did-and-didnt-get-from-congress-this-week" rel="noopener">though they’re there too</a>), it’s about every layer of the capital stack. One need look no further than <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tesla+stock+perfomance&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS879US879&amp;oq=tesla+stock+perfomance+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i13i457j0i13l6.5962j1j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="noopener">Tesla’s stock price</a> to see the demand on the electric vehicle (EV) front. <a href="http://www.proterra.com/" rel="noopener">Proterra</a>, our first investment in the EV space over four years ago, announced a <a href="https://digiday.com/media/wtf-is-a-spac/" rel="noopener">SPAC </a>last week, and shared revenue forecasts in the many hundreds of millions. The SPACfest now in full swing around EVs and energy storage is next up. The retail investor demand for future-proof, anti-fragile tech and business models is clear.</p><p id="7f25">Below that, the private money is also showing up. An increasing number of LPs, family offices, and institutional investors understand this transition is happening, and is where alpha returns will be derived.

Of course, corporates are getting in the game as well. You can expect to see all of the Oil Majors convert to “Energy Majors” as many in Europe have <a href="https://orsted.com/en" rel="noopener">already</a> <a href="https://www.fortum.com/" rel="noopener">done</a>.

The Next Generation</em></strong><em><br></em>In addition to demanding clarity on the impact of their purchases, Millennials and Gen Z also want to find impact in their work. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90306556/most-millennials-would-take-a-pay-cut-to-work-at-a-sustainable-company" rel="noopener">According to one survey</a>, 70% of Millennials are more likely to join companies strong in sustainability. This conviction in livelihood and purchasing intent seems only to increase with younger survey respondents — and there is no evidence whatsoever that it will slow down. As we’ve seen in recent elections the world around, the climate issue polls higher and higher with every new cycle. We also see a clear push to do this in a more diverse, inclusive and equitable way. Leadership at the grassroots level is everywhere (see <a href="https://www.edictnow.org/" rel="noopener">Edict</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/familiavc?s=21" rel="noopener">VCFamilia</a>, <a href="http://browningthegreenspace.org/" rel="noopener">Browning the Green Space</a>, <a href="https://www.greentechnoir.com/" rel="noopener">GreenTech Noir</a>, <a href="http://earthincolor.co/" rel="noopener">Earth in Color</a>).</p><p id="2efc"><strong><em>5. Policy and Regulation</em></strong><em><br></em>Consumer behavior and corporate response act as a virtuous cycle of improvement for these industries. That’s the carrot, but there are sticks as well. Governments around the world have offered varying levels of support and pressure in this transition. Chinese mandates, European subsidies, and even the U.S.’s distributed (state-level) efforts — all point to a world clearly moving in the same direction: fewer emissions, and fast. Let’s face it: fearless, consistent leaders like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/franpavley/" rel="noopener">Fran Pavley</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-hochschild-1520106/" rel="noopener">David Hochschild</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-nichols-2b68bb6/" rel="noopener">Mary Nichols</a> stepped up in California for much of the nation (and at times for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/teslas-sale-of-environmental-credits-help-drive-to-profitability.html" rel="noopener">Tesla</a>), while others at the federal level walked.</p><p id="9bfe">While the U.S. movement has relied heavily on state-level efforts to date, there’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/climate/biden-climate-change.html" rel="noopener">real reason to believe</a> that this new administration, coupled with many Republicans who want to support climate action now, will be aggressively playing catch up in the coming years. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/business/economy/fed-climate-network.html" rel="noopener">Even …</a></p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>CRFS is a Google project that aims at running a container without pre-pulling the image first.</p>
<p>The idea is quite smart: an OCI layer (that is basically a compressed tarball), is modified in a way that it is possible to seek content inside of it and access a single file.
It is designed around the stargz (Seekable tar.gz) format. Instead of having a single compressed tar stream, the stargz modifies it to concatenate the gzipped stream of each file. Old clients are still able to handle the stargz’ipped stream as a regular .tar.gz file.</p>
<p>In an attempt to support CRFS with fuse-overlayfs, I’ve worked on adding a plugin system to fuse-overlayfs (<a href="https://github.com/containers/fuse-overlayfs/pull/119">https://github.com/containers/fuse-overlayfs/pull/119</a>). It will make possible to extend it and support different ways to retrieve data from the lower layers.</p>
<p>The second step is a plugin that can handle CRFS, it is still a PoC but seems to work quite nicely: <a href="https://github.com/giuseppe/crfs-plugin">https://github.com/giuseppe/crfs-plugin</a></p>
<p>To create a stargz image, you’d need to use stargzify</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># go get -u github.com/google/crfs/stargz/stargzify</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Once stargzify is installed, an image can be converted as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># stargzify docker.io/fedora docker.io/gscrivano/test:stargz</span>
2019/10/24 20:33:33 pushed blob: sha256:c7155ae298b145d79e75c396ab5cb917023c4fd8b9cf8c7ff2f0332b41ef8651
2019/10/24 20:33:34 pushed blob: sha256:5a419d36bce538fa32fc21cbe11134ccbd70597379d9320f3a32eb6be78e4ad5
2019/10/24 20:33:35 docker.io/gscrivano/test:stargz: digest: sha256:ca6723c15c5b3b0947deef12048ee64126ed237e112cfbde300ce0f4066a4b4d size: <span>428</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The image was pushed to the registry. Let’s create a container:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># mkdir lower upper workdir merged</span>
<span># export DATA=$(echo -n docker://docker.io/gscrivano/test:stargz | base64 -w0)</span>
<span># OPTS=fast_ino=1,plugins=/path/to/crfs-plugin.so,lowerdir=//crfs/$DATA/lower,upperdir=upper,workdir=work</span>
<span># fuse-overlayfs -o $OPTS merged</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The image, passed to fuse-overlayfs encoded in base 64, is mounted at the merged directory.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># ls merged/</span>
bin   dev  home   lib    lost+found  mnt  proc  run   srv   sys  usr
boot  etc  hosts  lib64  media       opt  root  sbin  tmp  var
</code></pre></div><p>To run the container, we can take advantage of the Podman –rootfs feature. It tells Podman to not manage the storage for the container, but to use the specified path as its rootfs.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># podman run --rm -ti --rootfs merged /bin/sh</span>
sh-5.0#
</code></pre></div><p>Now we are in a container where files from the lower layers will be loaded on demand when requested.</p>

<p>First occurrence on <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Winter" title="Eth0:2010 Winter">eth0:2010 Winterlan</a>, the LackRack is the ultimate, low-cost, high shininess solution for your modular datacenter-in-the-living-room. Featuring the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104270">LACK</a> (side table) from Ikea, the LackRack is an easy-to-implement, exact-fit datacenter building block.
It's a little known fact that we have seen Google engineers tinker with Lack tables since way back in 2009.
</p><p>The LackRack will certainly make its appearance again this summer at <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Summer" title="Eth0:2010 Summer">eth0:2010 Summer</a>.
</p>

Its low-cost and perfect fit are great for mounting up to 8 U of 19" hardware, such as switches (see below), or perhaps other 19" gear. It's very easy to assemble, and thanks to the design, they are stable enough to hold (for example) 19" switches and you can put your bottle of Club-Mate on top! Multi-shiny LackRack can also be painted to your specific preferences and the airflow is unprecedented!
</p>
<p>You can find a howto on buying a LackRack on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mrngm.com/eth0/LackRack/">this page</a>. This includes the proof that a 19" switch can indeed be placed in the LackRack in its natural habitat!
</p>

</p><p>However, in order to assemble the LackRack, there are a few prerequisites or tools that are needed:
</p>
<ul><li>1 (or more) LACK side table from Ikea</li>
<li>Screwdriver (whether muscle-driven or motor-driven, with preference of the latter)</li>
<li>Wood screws (they should fit in the rack mounts on your appliance, and not exceed 1" in length)</li>
<li>Spare time</li></ul>
<p>That's all! First, follow the assembly instructions in the Ikea manual in order to assemble the LACK.
After that, the installation of your 19" hardware can begin. When assembling a larger number of LACKs, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/IKEA_Hack_a_Lack/">this link</a> describes a useful tool for fitting the legs to the tabletop.
</p><p>The LackRack is a stackable modular product. Additional elements can be stacked on top easily. Brackets to secure the top element to the bottom one are not included but available from your local non-computer hardware store.
</p>
<ul><li>If you put several LackRacks side by side, the higher levels can be staggered to form a pyramid. This feature is not present in any other of the commercially available rack products.</li></ul>

<p>Installing hardware in your LackRack is easy!
</p>
<ul><li><i>Optional but recommended</i> - Put the table on its side (which one is your decision) or upside down</li>
<li>Mount the hardware between the left and right leg
<ul><li>If you mount the first item, it is recommended to install it against the table top for good fit. This happens automatically if you have the LackRack upside down, except in zero gravity environments.</li></ul></li>
<li>Screw all the screws that fit in the rack mount in the left and right leg (for stability).
<ul><li>With deep units, a Z-shaped bracket may be advisable to secure the rear of the unit against the underside of the tabletop.</li></ul></li>
<li>&nbsp;???</li>
<li>Profit! (note how <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rackable.com/">lackable.com</a> has been bought by sgi recently)</li></ul>
<h2><span id="Note">Note</span></h2>
<p>Current LACK tables have hollow legs; only the top 5 cm (2") is solid. Fitting equipment below the solid section may require the use of cavity plugs, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fischer-international.com/en/products/cavity-fixings/board-fixing/metal-cavity-fixing-hm/519772-hm-5-x-37-s">these</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Goodies">Goodies</span></h2>
<ul><li>You can put food and/or drink on your rack.</li>
<li>You can put a small lamp on top of the rack to see your hardware and/or better find the aforementioned food and drink.</li>
<li>The table can be painted in a color of your preference, or decorated in various ways. The eth0 Design team can advise, for a fee, how to optimally decorate the rack to suit your environment.
<ul><li>That means, no more dull black/gray racks!</li>
<li>Or you can put <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lack2.jpg" title="File:Lack2.jpg">stickers of your favorite event</a> on them.</li></ul></li>
<li>It's easy to colour-code your datacentre: e.g. <span>red</span> for critical services, <span>grey</span> for office automation, <span>green</span> for file-servers, <span>black</span> for systems and network management.</li>

<ul><li>Q: Does the LackRack provide redundant power supply?
<ul><li>A: Only if you add it yourself</li></ul></li>
<li>Q: Can I put my (coffee) mug on top and don't have to worry about it if I spill liquid on the LackRack?
<ul><li>A: You can spill coffee on the LackRack, since it can be cleaned quite easily. However, if you have appliances <b>in</b> the LackRack, there is a chance that these appliances cannot handle the coffee (or any other liquid). You should take precautions in order to protect your appliances</li></ul></li></ul>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/catalog/products/00095036">Ikea LACK coffee table</a>: almost twice as deep, and comes with a shelf. Its size allows both short ends to be used as rack space simultaneously. It's interesting to note that Ikea photographed it from the side; an uncommon artistic approach to 19" server rack photography.
It provides for 8 U of hardware: 4 on either side of the shelf.
</p><p>Following ICT tradition, the Enterprise Edition is more than three times as expensive, while providing less stability than two of the regular products combined.

<p>It is clear that Ikea has strived to keep many of their products
rack compatible since so many of them are capable of housing 19"
equipment. See <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/List_of_IkeaRacks" title="List of IkeaRacks">List_of_IkeaRacks</a>

In case you aren’t familiar with the term “data warehouse”, it’s basically a database that centralizes your data to be used for analysis. There are many databases you can choose from, for example in Simon Willison’s talk, he uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. I chose <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a> because I’m familiar with it and so far I have liked what Ive seen. Some features that make it stand out for me are things like <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel.html">time travel</a>, <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/undrop-table.html">undrop table</a>, a rich set of <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/intro-summary-operators-functions.html">functions</a>, among many others.</p><p>Ok great, so we now have an empty database to start with. But a database is only useful when there is data in it to query. So we must choose which datasets to pull into our freshly minted database. I’m going to start with bringing in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> data because I’m a big fan of the site and it has an actual <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a> which means we wont have to be scraping HTML. I’m also going to bring in stock data into the warehouse to see if we can get any stock information out of Hacker News. Finally we’ll analyze the stock market and correlate stocks to the latest GameStop stock craze.</p><p>The first part of the plan will be to get the Hacker News data loaded into Snowflake.

This script can be run without user intervention and will keep the data up-to-date. Using Python to write the ELT gave me more flexibility to fix some things that I saw as issues. For example, the script starts N * 4 (where N is the number of logical cpus) jobs and only produces N * 4 files instead of 1 file per item. This approach will avoid having to do an expensive file combination step at the end. I also added some awesome progress bars to the script so that I knew how many requests remain thanks to <a href="https://github.com/alphatwirl/atpbar/issues/21#issuecomment-766468695">Tai Sakuma</a>.</p><p>Running this script from my laptop (a Dell 9370 Developer Edition with 8 logical cores) and spotty Wi-Fi, script extracts items from the API at about 130 items/second. This is slower than extracting from a c5a.8xlarge machine, but at least my laptop isn’t charging me $1.232/hour for using it. And my script has the benefit of not having to combine millions of tiny files at the end. Let’s test my incremental loading script out on an ec2 instance to see how it really compares with my naive approach.</p><h2>Downloading incremental data from Hacker News using my script</h2></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611883239126_31321"><div><pre><code>$ time { poetry run python main.py ; }

<p><em>Update: large parts of this story may, in fact, be fiction. See the addendum at the end for details.</em></p>
<p>Film rights are a strange and complex thing, especially when it comes to existing properties. The contracts for these things can involve a labyrinthine series of clauses and negotiations, where the owners of the original property want to include cut-off clauses that will enable them to claw back the rights and sell them again, possibly for much more money if the adaptation has been a success, the artistic creator wants to hold on to some level of creative control and the film studio wants to ensure that neither of those things happens. We’ve seen assorted shenanigans at work across the board – the <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2018/08/30/big-bond-themes-and-secret-agent-cover-versions/">James Bond</a> copyright snafu that saw the film rights for <strong>Casino Royale</strong> owned and exploited by another company than the one that made the official series, and perhaps most famously in terms of contractual obligations, the first <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> movie, made as a low-budget throwaway affair simply to ensure that the film rights stayed with Constantin Film, who was not quite ready to make a ‘proper’ version of the story but who saw the potential in the property and didn’t want to let it go.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most absurd of these contractual obligation projects came with <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, which was adapted into a TV series that ran for four seasons – which would suggest a major hit show by 1970s television standards, except for the fact that it never aired. Not a single episode beyond the pilot was shown on TV anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> was a major hit in 1974 and remains one of the most beloved Hollywood comedies – well, perhaps not with Millenials and Generation Z, given the film’s rather liberal use of the sort of racist language that is now strictly forbidden, even in context. Mel Brooks’ comedy western mocked American racism brutally – perhaps a little too brutally in the use of one particular word, which is bandied about throughout the film. It was a different time.</p>

<p>Brooks was on fire as a filmmaker in 1974, and there was every reason to expect <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> to be a massive hit, as indeed it was. Having dealt with studios enough by this point, Brooks knew that they might want to take the project away from him and produce sequels – the story essentially opened itself up for on-going narratives. And so he came up with a cunning plan. The contracts for the film stated that there could only be film sequels if a TV series follow-up was made within six months. Brooks and his legal team were pretty certain that the film was too profane and vulgar to ever be adapted as a TV series. I mean, what could they do? Strip it back to its most basic elements while throwing out everything that made the film what it was?</p>
<p>Well, that was precisely what happened. In 1977, Warner Brothers announced plans for a sequel film – in fact, a series of sequels – to <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, and when Brooks and his lawyers waved the contract at them, they pulled their ace card – a four-season series based on the original film that had gone into production very quickly in 1974. As Brooks explained, <em>“Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another Blazing Saddles, and I say, ‘No. You don’t have the right to do that.’ They say, ‘Yes we do, we’ve been making a TV series and still control the rights.’ What TV series? I haven’t seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it.”</em></p>
<p>You have to almost admire Warner Brothers’ gall here, and – oddly – their belief in <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>. Not only did they rush a series into production in 1974, but they kept it in production – because the contract only allowed a new movie within six months of the last <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> project – for four years until they finally had a movie ready. TV shows might be cheaper than films, but nevertheless, imagine how much they had to spend, making four seasons of a show just to hold onto the film rights.</p>
<p>In fact, the pilot episode of <strong>Black Bart</strong>, as the series is called, was shown once in 1975 on CBS, with no one even noticing. Well, why would they? As well as changing the title (because the contract also failed to state that any TV series be <em>called</em> <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>), Brooks wasn’t credited, with Andrew Bergman, who originally came up with the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> idea listed as creator. The show starred Louis Gossett Jr as Sheriff Bart, continuing his battles against both criminals and racists, while the other film characters were replaced with similar, but not identical characters to avoid crediting Brooks. Both the cast – including Gerrit Graham – and the characters are lightweight versions of the originals, the humour is almost non-existent and the laugh track just hammers home how unfunny the show is. And yet it is a professional work, and arguably no less forced than several other sitcoms of the era. So the question is: why didn’t they just put in a bit more effort and then show the damn thing instead of paying everyone to shoot twenty-four episodes that would sit, unseen, in the Warner Brothers vaults?</p>

<p>Presumably, the answer is that a TV show – even a good TV show – would have diluted the appeal of another film. The 1970s were a different time (we mentioned that, right?) and there was less crossover of film and TV – sure, some films – like <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2020/09/27/go-ape-the-planet-of-the-apes-book-and-comics-of-the-1970s/"><strong>Planet of the Apes</strong></a> – were adapted into TV shows, but those shows were rarely successful and were seen as having essentially killed off any chance of audiences then going to the cinema to watch a movie version. If anything, <strong>Black Bart</strong> might have served as a sign of just how bad a Mel Brooks-free version of <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> could be. So instead of putting any effort into making a decent TV series based on the property (and there’s certainly the potential there), Warner Brothers simply put the least possible effort into making something that would still legally stand up as a TV show that could, in theory, be broadcast – and then buried it.</p>
<p>What the cast and crew thought of all this is hard to gauge – Gossett has talked about the weirdness of it all, but you have to wonder just how anyone managed to drum up any enthusiasm once it became clear that the show would never air. Ironically, the plans for a <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> sequel ultimately went nowhere – by 1979, it was clear that the moment had passed and audience tastes had changed. The sequel was shelved, and the series was finally cancelled. The pilot episode has since turned up on the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> DVD and blu-ray, but the other episodes have yet to be seen. It’s entirely possible that they were never even completed beyond the ones shown to Brooks, and may have been trashed. A pity, as we’ll never know if it accidentally improved.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> We feel it’s important to point out that some sources are claiming since we originally posted this that the entire story – with the exception of the<strong> Black Bart</strong> pilot, which definitely exists and is perhaps a weird enough thing in itself – is in fact a spoof that has somehow become accepted as reality – ‘fake news’, as I believe it is known. There are several sources online claiming that this story is authentic; others claiming that it is satire (links appear in the comments). Unless Mel Brooks – or perhaps Louis Gossett – wants to come clean on the actual facts, it perhaps remains a mystery. Stranger-than-fiction may, or may not, be actual fiction, and isn’t that depressing when it’s a story as good as this? As Tony Wilson said (or possibly didn’t say, there’s the rub), <em>“when&nbsp;you have to choose between the truth and the legend, choose the legend.”</em></p>

<p>I have been engaging with WSB (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/r/WallStreetBets</a>) since 2014.</p>
<p>Every regular person on WSB understands it’s a game. You can loose it all, make it big, sometimes both in the same day — it’s all a game. The most accurate assessment of WSB culture was clearly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the influx of new users may change the community, prior to January 15, 2021 the above was indeed an accurate description.</p>

<p>Honestly, this world feels like we are in a simulation. The company GameStop appears to be poised to bring down the entire financial system — stopping the game.</p>
<p>The infinity squeeze appears to be coming, what is an infinity squeeze you ask? It’s a really massive short squeeze:</p>
<blockquote><p>A short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses. Their scramble to buy only adds to the upward pressure on the stock’s price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Short positions can technically lead to infinite losses. Simply put, if I open a short position for $10 and the share price drops 10%, I make $1. However, if the stock price increases say 10,000% I now owe $1,000.</p>
<p>In the case of GameStop, the situation appears dire. At one point the short positions were 140% of available shares of the market. This means that more shares were lent out than were available on float, i.e. shorts were resold / lent several times. At this point, several things are happening[<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsaleclosed.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those holding short positions are paying ridiculously high interest rates</li>
<li>If the short positions were forced to close, it would cause a major loss to multiple hedge funds (tens of billions total &amp; bankrupcies)</li>
<li>Due to the level of shorting, exiting the short positions would be excessively expensive and cause a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short squeeze</a></li>
<li>There is less GameStop stock available for purchase</li>
<li>The price of GameStop stock is rising</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it appears to me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short holders cannot exit their positions without going bankrupt</li>
<li>Short holders are being hit by high interest rates</li>
<li>Closing other positions in the stock market should help them cover the interest rates</li>
<li>Best option for short position holders is is to wait &amp; pray the stock price drops</li>
<li>What happens if not enough people are willing to sell?</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I believe all of this will suck all the liquidity from the stock market. Either those shorting suffer the loss and close their positions or wait as the stock continues to stay high… in either case hundreds of billions of dollars is leaving the market.</p>
<p>How did we get here?</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Short Positions</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to this story I’ll come back an fill in, but the gist is this — In mid-January 2021 GameStop was <em>extremely</em> shorted.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3832" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3832"><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17.png" alt="" width="424" height="417" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-300x295.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-300x295.png 300w"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3832">Courtesy of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo Finance</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The massive short position and didn’t go unnoticed, WSB had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201222153244/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing it for months</a>. That being said, the massive spikes in purchases did not start until January 12:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png" alt="" width="916" height="411" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png 916w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-300x135.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-768x345.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png 916w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-300x135.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-768x345.png 768w"></a></p>
<p>What happened at that time? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210118091858/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxeq23/gme_yolo_update_jan_14_2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YOLO updates</a> definitely started at that time and stocks started to rise. Once the stocks started to rise, I believe institutions and WSB itself started piling into GameStop. The stock started to move and if they could get in they could make a boat load. It’s important to remember WSB is often visited by hedge fund mangers, CEOs, day traders big and small, etc. It’s not always the little guy(s). When they piled in, the price started to rise further.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Let’s Make Money</h3>
<p>As they purchased, I personally believe some short sellers managed to exit their positions (about 7m shares, per Yahoo Finance data)</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png" alt="" width="424" height="417" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted-300x295.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted-300x295.png 300w"></a></p>
<p>What this indicates to me is that many of those holding short positions did not realize what was about to happen. They kept holding believing this was a classic pump-and-dump. Even WSB at the time didn’t not necessarily think about much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210115023914/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">besides making money</a>. I know I even purchased call options during this week, particularly when the new data came out January 15, 2021. To me, it became clear the stock was about to rocket.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Let’s Stick it to the Man</h3>
<p>In light of the massive number of short position(s) open in January 15, 2021, WSB realized they could (a) make money and (b) stick it to the hedge funds. Frankly, WSB have been waging a war on short selling for years. With GameStop they had a company with relatively few shares&nbsp; in float (47m), a low market cap, basically something that purchases would have an outsized impact.</p>
<p>I’m not 100% sure this was intentional, but as people started buying and holding waiting for the squeeze the stock started to rise.The rising stock both led to discussions on news outlets and the stock started going viral on social media platforms outside of WSB – further raising the going rate for a share of GameStop.</p>
<p>Those holding short positions did not want to sell as they’d lose money, so they were searching for capital to cover their leveraged positions. Citadel and Point72 partners appears to have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come to at least one short sellers aid</a>. This showed they were weak and further emboldened the WSB folks – “Let’s make some money on the hedge funds behalf”</p>
<p>Purchases from Jan 19 to Jan 23, 2021 and the stock price increased exponentially as it went viral:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png" alt="" width="507" height="423" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png 507w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17-300x250.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png 507w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17-300x250.png 300w"></a></p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – The Rebellion</h3>
<p>On January 27, 2021 across the board buying for GameStop was <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/money/2021/01/27/robinhood-td-ameritrade-other-brokerages-have-tech-problems-at-market-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restricted (along with multiple other stocks) across various trading platforms</a>. This effectively forced purchase volume lower and as users of these platforms could only sell it drove down the share price. This likely startled many GameStop shareholds and many liquidated their positions, letting the short sellers exit some of their positions. Through January 29, 2021 the ability to purchase in an unrestricted manner has not been restored.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Personally, I’m of the opinion that there was not enough shares to go around and likely these platforms colluded to drive down the stock price. What’s more interesting is how few people sold. As of January 29, 2021 the price of a GameStop share was back at $325. This has led to some very VERY strong backlash and I know I’ll be joining a lawsuit at some point (if not filing my own), as this collusion cost me tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>One essay that particularly struck me was made on WSB: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210130034124/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB</a></p>
<p>I recommend reading the comments on this essay to really get an under standing of what’s happening. Look at the charts. This is personal now. The market manipulation is obvious and people want revenge. For the current events, for 2008, for the entire corrupt system. They want to send a message. This is a protest.</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg" alt="" width="474" height="567" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg 474w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH-251x300.jpg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg 474w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH-251x300.jpg 251w"></a>Many retail investors will hold until the bitter end.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – End Game</h3>
<p>So what happens next?</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting on January 27-29 people were trying to transfer funds off Robinhood and the other platforms which disabled purchasing of GameStop shares.</li>
<li>Come the <span>first week of February</span> these assets will be again available and can be used to purchase GameStop shares.</li>
<li>Everyone saw much fewer shares being traded Friday</li>
<li>Everyone is talking with their families</li>
<li>People are going to purchase more GameStop shares &amp; hold</li>
<li>I expect many are going to pull their assets out of the stock market</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some unknowns, for instance have the short positions been closed? Have there been backroom deals to stave off the infinity squeeze?</p>
<p>If neither of those assumptions above hold, then what happens when the price rises further and there’s not enough shares for sale?</p>
<p>Hedge funds either bleed out as they pay the massive interest rates on holding those short positions or they will close their short positions causing an infinity squeeze (GameStop shares will be priced in the thousands). In either case hundreds of billions would likely leave the market.</p>
<h3>Conclusion – The Black Hole</h3>
<p>It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nash Equilibrium</a>, essentially the share holders have every reason to ask the maximum amount they can get for a share of GameStop (i.e. make money). If for some reason these GameStop share holders are unwilling to sell at a low rate, then these hedge funds stand to lose hundreds of billions and will go bankrupt (slowly via interest payments or quickly via short squeeze). To try and pay for their debts, they’ll have to sell off market wide and the entire market collapses.</p>
<p>There are three ways to alleviate the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>GameStop issues a massive number of new shares</li>
<li>Market manipulation (such as Robinood and friends only enabling selling – of course that didn’t work last time)</li>
<li>Government settles the matter by confiscating shares</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I view government involvement as inevitable. They could settle everyone accounts fairly by giving everyone the current share price or what they bought it for, which every is higher. That being said, I suspect the more likely course of action is some flat rate $100/share or something to that effect. In either case, if they don’t get involved, I suspect the system really will collapse.</p>
<p>Unless of course, I am wrong. I am not a financial expert and nothing in this article should be taken as advice.</p>
<p>It’s completely possible I’m inaccurately reading the situation and those shorting GameStop have already exited their position(s) and GameStop is currently just in a classic bubble.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In December last year I was able to sit for the coveted Certified Kubernetes Administrator and Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exams, and clear them both after some preparation.</p>

<p>This post is meant to share my exam experience, and all the materials used.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Read the exam questions carefully.</li>
  <li>Know imperative commands with <code>kubectl</code> like the back of your hand.</li>
  <li>Get comfortable looking things up on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes.io</a>.</li>
  <li>Build a bookmark folder in Chrome with relevant pages in kubernetes.io: you can use it during the exam!</li>
  <li>Seriously, read the damn questions carefully.</li>
  <li>Practice, practice and practice more.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-exams">The exams</h3>
<p>The exam for any of these Kubernetes certifications consists in solving a set of tasks, in a 2 hour terminal session.</p>

<p>There are 17 scenarios/questions for CKA, and 19 for CKAD.
The whole time, a proctor is watching and listening to you via webcam and microphone, and seeing the content of your screens (you can use more than one).
You communicate with the proctor only via a live chat application which is part of the PSI interface for the exam.</p>

<p>At the beginning they will ask you to show your ID, and then you will need to show them your working area from the webcam.
You will need to show your desk, and the room youâ€™re in.
Ensure that nothing written is visibile on the walls, and that you are the only person in the room.</p>

<p>Once the exam starts, the proctor may ask you every once in a while to show your hands to the webcam.
Donâ€™t bother asking questions about the exam itself, chances are the proctor really doesnâ€™t know about the subject and is only there to ensure you donâ€™t cheat.
You will need to share your screens for the proctor to see.
If you have 2 screens you can have the exam terminal on one, and the tab with k8s docs on the other.</p>

<p>In the terminal itself, you are given 6 or so k8s clusters, and you will need to switch between them.
You will always have a command printed at the beginning of each question, for easy copy paste:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl config use-context bla
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Make sure to <strong>use it</strong>!</p>

<p>Do not be fooled by the fact that you are able to search documentation during the exam.
The tasks that you will be given are often complex ones; time is of the essence! If you waste it while reading up docs you will not be able to complete all of the tasks in time.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="cka">CKA</h2>
<p>I will start with the CKA, as it is the first exam I attempted.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p>The CKA ensures we have the skillset to setup and maintain a Kubernetes cluster, and manage it by using best practices.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>As this exam is aimed at the Systems administrator/devops engineer, some linux as well as infrastructure skills are expected, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge of Linux OS.</li>
  <li>Being comfortable on the terminal.</li>
  <li>Knowing how to quickly edit files with text editors like Vi/Vim.</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of networking concepts.</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of TLS encryption concepts.</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of docker and containerization concepts.</li>
</ul>

<p>A deep dive is done on Kubernetes concepts and architecture during the indicated courses.</p>

<h3 id="study-plan">Study plan</h3>
<p>I began studying around the end of September 2020, by purchasing Mumshad Mannambethâ€™s excellent Udemy course for both CKA and CKAD, both on sale at the time.
That was a major source of material for me, as the courses included access to Katacoda/Kodekloud practice labs, and access to a Slack community where the trainer and other exam-takers participated.
The videos of Mumshadâ€™s course are very well done, each in the 5-10 minute range in length, slowly and clearly explaining each concept.
I would get to practice that concept later with labs provided by Mumshadâ€™s platform, KodeKloud.</p>

<p>The course itself has a section later on where we must manually install a Kubernetes cluster from scratch on a local vagrant setup, based on <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way">Kelsey Hightowerâ€™s excellent Kubernetes the Hard way project</a> (the original project leverages infrastructure on Google Cloud instead).
During the same course, we get to setup another cluster by using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/">kubeadm</a>, which is part of the exam curriculum.</p>

<p>I would say that before taking the exam, I spent an average of about 1 hour every day watching the course videos and playing around with the labs (around 2 hours or more during weekends), for a couple months;
I took care of understanding every concept presented in the videos, and verified my knowledge with the labs and on a local cluster where I spent some practice time on, on top of study time.
I also re-did all of the course labs multiple times until I knew almost all of the answers by heart, and could get around them easily.</p>

<p>When something was unclear, the slack communities on kodekloud and kubernetes were always very helpful, always answering all of my questions, no matter how dumb I thought they were :)</p>

<p>I made sure to know <code>kubectl</code> imperative commands like the back of my hand, and building a library of bookmarks in my browser with relevant pages ready, as we are allowed an extra tab with the documentation during the exam.</p>

<p>After 2 months of that, I felt like I was ready.</p>

<h3 id="cka-exam-attempt-1">CKA Exam attempt #1</h3>
<p>I booked the exam for end of November, on a Saturday morning at 8AM, and sat for it in the guest room of my home.
The exam setup time with the proctor went pretty smoothly, and I was able to start on time.</p>

<p>I was not so confident by the end of the two hours. After 36 hours I got the news that I failed that attempt with 60% (minimum passing grade is 66%).
What went wrong for me was that I did not read/understand one specific question, which was related to ETCD backup and restore (part of the official curriculum); because of this, I ended up performing a task that effectively made one of the exam clusters unavailable.</p>

<p>Looking back, I am quite sure I invalidated several correct answers due to this mistake, which resulted in the score.
The method of how to backup/restore an ETCD cluster was also not entirely clear to me at the time, so I was not 100% sure of what I was doing.</p>

<p>Clearly I overestimated my knowledge, and depended too much on memorizing certain commands on one study platform, instead of being completely confident in all concepts and commands applied.</p>

<h3 id="new-study-plan">New study plan</h3>
<p>Enter <a href="https://killer.sh/">killer.sh</a>.
A CKA/CKAD/CKS exam simulator created by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimwuestkamp/">Kim Wuestkampf</a>.</p>

<p>For CKA, the simulator offered 25 HARD questions to be done in 2 hours, with guided and comprehensive answers made available after the alotted time.
Such answers also offered different ways to do things, for maximized learning experience.</p>

<p>This alternative platform helped a lot in understanding things that werenâ€™t clear to me, and to practice more varied scenarios.
Completing a killer.sh simulator in under two hours gives good confidence in being able to tackle the real exam.</p>

<h3 id="cka-exam-attempt-2">CKA Exam attempt #2</h3>
<p>I booked the exam one week after getting the results of the previous one.
The exam setup experience was again pretty smooth and I was up and ready to go 10 minutes before the start time.</p>

<p>I felt pretty confident the whole time and finished up all of the questions around 1 hour and 10 minutes later.</p>

<p>The results came around 36 hours after the end of the exam, in an email.
Score was a pass with 85% :)!
As it is not possible to see the actual answers, to this day I donâ€™t really donâ€™t know what I got wrong, but am still satisfied with the result.</p>

<h2 id="ckad">CKAD</h2>
<p>I took the CKAD exam while the knowledge of the previous training was still fresh, so I felt like I had an easier time with this one.</p>

<h3 id="objectives-1">Objectives</h3>
<p>To be able to efficiently design and implement working kubernetes production workloads.</p>

<h3 id="requirements-1">Requirements</h3>
<p>Not so much system administration knowledge, but more focus on k8s concepts, architecture and best practices.
Actual programming experience is not required for the exam (although in â€œreal lifeâ€� it will probably not hurt either ;) ).</p>

<h3 id="study-plan-1">Study plan</h3>
<p>I booked the CKAD exam roughly for 3 weeks after passing the CKA.
In those 3 weeks, I took my time and spent again around 30min to 1 hour a day on Mumshadâ€™s course and labs.</p>

<p>When exam time was closer, I booked two sessions on killer.sh and focused on practicing there.
I challenged myself by finishing all the questions under 2 hours, and afterwards going through slowly through the answers section on the site.
This was very helpful and allowed me to learn different, more effective approaches.</p>

<h3 id="ckad-exam-attempt-1">CKAD Exam attempt #1</h3>
<p>I once again took the exam from the guest room in my home.</p>

<p>This time the exam setup with the proctor wasnâ€™t so smooth.
The connection from my end and theirs wasnâ€™t great, and we kept getting disconnected from the session. Webcam images werenâ€™t so clear so they had to ask me to show identification more than once. It took about 40 minutes to start the actual exam, and that did get me a bit stressed out.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I felt comfortable and finished all the questions in about 1 hour and a half.
36 hours later, I got the email with the good news of a pass with 83%.
Doing the CKA before really helped with the whole experience.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>From my experience, I would say that the hardest exam was the one for CKA, as it didnâ€™t just go through the new knowledge of k8s concepts, but also on existing understanding of systems administration.
I felt like doing CKAD immediately afterwards made it a bit easier, as the knowledge was still fresh.</p>

<p>The CKAD questions however were much more time consuming, in the sense that one task would require to perform several smaller tasks quickly, building a workload and making sure everything works together.</p>

<p>All in all, I feel the time trying to tackle these certifications was well spent; since the exams are performance based, they are fair in what they expect …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Google recently blocked the Matrix based chat app Element from the Play Store sighting sexual content on the platform. It’s really hard to define the explanation because WhatsApp, Telegram users of other chat clients also share the same content. Telegram is also known to host groups sharing pirated content as well.</p>
<p>This post is not going to bash Google on the ban of Element. It’s about how Google can win the chat app </p>
<p>Chat apps have been hot for the past couple of years. When I initially Tweeted that chat apps are the new social network, 6-7 years ago (I wish if I can find that tweet, but I can’t seem to find it, maybe it was lost when I deleted all my tweets sometime ago), I remember how people laughed replying how can that even possible, but now as Facebook is on the decline, chat apps are the goto place to hang out with friends.</p>
<p>Google currently doesn’t have a house in the chat app race. Google tried with several chat applications, like Ello, Hangout, Google Talk, none of them took off. Even though Ello looked promising, and was integrated into Android, people never jumped the ship to Ello. And since Google now allowing several chat/video platforms like Hangout, Meet etc, Google’s direction in communication platform seems big vague.</p>
<p>Google also has had a poor history with social networking, Google does not have social in their DNA, it feels like they are engineering, technology first in their approach, while Facebook feels more social first than anything else.</p>
<p>However, after seeing this ban I feel what Google should have a horse in the chat app race, and it should be a matrix/element based chat client. Allow me to explain,</p>
<p>Google should embrace an open protocol like Matrix and build a chat client on top of it, yes it’s against their pattern of hoarding data, and usage of open protocol.</p>
<p>But Google was able to win the email, the email protocol is an open protocol, anyone can implement it, anyone can use any client they want, but still Google was able to create the most popular email service available out their, and even monetise it. </p>
<p>Before Google started gmail, services like hotmail only allowed 200mb of storage, I remember Yahoo deleting my email account because I didn’t login for 6 months (I was still schooling at that time, and didn’t use email much), and not to mention Yahoo, and hotmail had atrocious ads on their email service. But google changed all that, they gave a better UI, more storage, and even a better ad experience.</p>
<p>So what makes then incapable of using an open chat protocol and build a great experience around it? With engineers and money to back a project like that Google can build a good chat service around an open chat protocol.</p>
<p>Even ads might not be a thing, Google can still provide enterprise chat service to organisations, powered by their data servers. They can even keep their source closed if they want to, like they are doing with Gmail, but an open source client would be great.</p>
<p>And Google’s backing for a open chat platform will make people interested about it, and even more people will use it just because it’s from Google. People will be able to use their own clients like Element, or another Matrix client, still and users can build a network greater than a centralised chat service, like we use gmail in our mail app to chat with someone else with a different email provider. </p>
<p>And the bottom line is Facebook, Telegram, Signal, and other chat platforms are going on a race without Google, all providing a centralised experience, with the exception of Signal, who is providing a semi-centralised experience. So even if you can’t beat them, why not try to destroy them all with an open chat protocol?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Shell script and AWK are very complementary languages.  AWK was designed from
its very beginnings at Bell Labs as a pattern-action language for short
programs, ideally one or two lines long.  It was intended to be used on the
Unix shell interactive command line, or in shell scripts.  Its feature set
filled out some functionality that shell script at the time lacked, and often
still lacks, as is the case with floating point numbers; it thereby
(indirectly) brings much of the C language’s expressive power to the shell.</p>

<p>It’s therefore both common and reasonable to see AWK one-liners in shell
scripts for data processing where doing the same in shell is unwieldy or
impossible, especially when floating point operations or data delimiting are
involved.  While AWK’s full power is in general tragically underused, most
shell script users and developers know about one of its most useful properties:
selecting a single column from whitespace-delimited data.  Sometimes,
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cut.1p.html"><code>cut(1)</code></a> doesn’t, uh, cut it.</p>

<p>In order for one language to cooperate with another usefully via embedded
programs in this way, data of some sort needs to be passed between them at
runtime, and here there are a few traps with syntax that may catch out unwary
shell programmers.  We’ll go through a simple example showing the problems, and
demonstrate a few potential solutions.</p>

<h2>Easy: Fixed data</h2>

<p>Embedded AWK programs in shell scripts work great when you already know
<em>before</em> runtime what you want your patterns for the pattern-action pairs to
be.  Suppose our company has a vendor-supplied program that returns temperature
sensor data for the server room, and we want to run some commands for any and
all rows registering over a certain threshold temperature.  The output for the
existing <code>server-room-temps</code> command might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ server-room-temps
ID  Location    Temperature_C
1   hot_aisle_1 27.9
2   hot_aisle_2 30.3
3   cold_aisle_1    26.0
4   cold_aisle_2    25.2
5   outer       23.9
</code></pre>

<p>The task for the monitoring script is simple: get a list of all the locations
where the temperature is above 28°C.  If there are any such locations, we need
to email the administrator the full list.  Easy!  It looks like every
introductory AWK example you’ve ever seen—it could be straight out of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AWK-Programming-Language-Alfred-Aho/dp/020107981X">the
book</a>.  Let’s type it up on the shell to test it:</p>

<pre><code>$ server-room-temps | awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; 28 {print $2}'
hot_aisle_2
</code></pre>

<p>That looks good.  The script might end up looking something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
alerts=/var/cache/temps/alerts
server-room-temps |
    awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; 28 {print $2}' &gt; "$alerts" || exit
if [ -s "$alerts" ] ; then
    mail -s 'Temperature alert' sysadmin &lt; "$alerts"
fi
</code></pre>

<p>So, after writing the alerts data file, we test if with <code>[ -s ... ]</code> to see
whether it’s got any data in it.  If it does, we send it all to the
administrator with <code>mail(1)</code>.  Done!</p>

<p>We set that running every few minutes with <code>cron(8)</code> or <code>systemd.timer(5)</code>, and
we have a nice stop-gap solution until the lazy systems administrator gets
around to fixing the Nagios server.  He’s probably just off playing
<a href="https://www.adom.de/home/index.html">ADOM</a> again…</p>

<h2>Hard: runtime data</h2>

<p>A few weeks later, our sysadmin still hasn’t got the Nagios server running,
because his high elf wizard is about to hit level 50, and there’s a new request
from the boss: can we adjust the script so that it accepts the cutoff
temperature data as an argument, and other departments can use it?  Sure, why
not.  Let’s mock that up, with a threshold of, let’s say, 25.5°C.</p>

<pre><code>$ server-room-temps &gt; test-data
$ threshold=25.5
$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; $threshold {print $2}' test-data
hot_aisle_1
hot_aisle_2
</code></pre>

<p>Wait, that’s not right.  There are <em>three</em> lines with temperatures over 25.5°C,
not two.  Where’s <code>cold_aisle_1</code>?</p>

<p>Looking at the code more carefully, you realize that you assumed your shell
variable would be accessible from within the AWK program, when of course, it
isn’t; AWK’s variables are independent of shell variables.  You don’t know why
the hell it’s showing those two rows, though…</p>

<p>Maybe we need double quotes?</p>

<pre><code>$ awk "NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; $threshold {print $2}" test-data
awk: cmd. line:1: NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp;  &gt; 25.5 {print}

<p>Hmm.  Nope.  Maybe we need to expand the variable inside the quotes?</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; "$threshold" {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
cold-aisle-2
outer
</code></pre>

<p>That’s not right, either.  It seems to have printed <em>all</em> the locations, as if
it didn’t test the threshold at all.</p>

<p>Maybe it should be <em>outside</em> the single quotes?</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '$threshold' {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>The results look right, now … ah, but wait, we still need to <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes">quote it to
stop spaces expanding</a>…</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '"$threshold"' {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, that works.  Let’s submit it to the security team and go to lunch.</p>

<h3>Caught out</h3>

<p>To your surprise, the script is rejected.  The security officer says you have
an unescaped variable that allows arbitrary code execution.  What?  Where?
It’s just AWK, not SQL…!</p>

<p>To your horror, the security officer demonstrates:</p>

<pre><code>$ threshold='0;{system("echo rm -fr /*");exit}'
$ echo 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '"$threshold"' {print $2}'
NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; 0;{system("echo rm -fr /*");exit} {print $2}
$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '"$threshold"' {print $2}' test-data
rm -fr /bin /boot /dev /etc /home /initrd.img ...
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, hell… if that were installed, and someone were able to set <code>threshold</code> to
an arbitrary value, they could execute <em>any</em> AWK code, and thereby shell
script, that they wanted to.  It’s <em>AWK injection</em>!  How embarrassing—good
thing that was never going to run as <code>root</code> (…right?)  Back to the drawing
board …</p>

<h3>Validating the data</h3>

<p>One approach that might come readily to mind is to ensure that no unexpected
characters appear in the value.  We could use a <code>case</code> statement before
interpolating the variable into the AWK program to check it contains no
characters outside digits and a decimal:</p>

<pre><code>case $threshold in
    *[!0-9.]*) exit 2 ;;
esac
</code></pre>

<p>That works just fine, and it’s appropriate to do some data validation at the
opening of the script, anyway.  It’s certainly better than leaving it as it
was.  But we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">learned this lesson</a> with PHP in the 90s; you don’t just
filter on characters, or slap in some backslashes—that’s missing the point.
Ideally, we need to safely pass the data into the AWK process <em>without</em> ever
parsing it as AWK code, sanitized or nay, so the situation doesn’t arise in the
first place.</p>

<h3>Environment variables</h3>

<p>The shell and your embedded AWK program may not share the shell’s local
variables, but they <em>do</em> share environment variables, accessible in AWK’s
<code>ENVIRON</code> array.  So, passing the threshold in as an environment variable
works:</p>

<pre><code>$ THRESHOLD=25.5
$ export THRESHOLD
$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; ENVIRON["THRESHOLD"] {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>Or, to be a little cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>$ THRESHOLD=25.5 \
    awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; ENVIRON["THRESHOLD"] {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>This is already much better.  AWK will parse our data <em>only</em> as a variable, and
won’t try to execute anything within it.  The only snag with this method is
picking a name; make sure that you don’t overwrite another, more important
environment variable, like <code>PATH</code>, or <code>LANG</code>…</p>

<h3>Another argument</h3>

<p>Passing the data as another <em>argument</em> and then reading it out of the <code>ARGV</code>
array works, too:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'BEGIN{ARGC--} NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; ARGV[2] {print $2}' test-data 25.5
</code></pre>

<p>This method is also safe from arbitrary code execution, but it’s still somewhat
awkward because it requires us to decrease the argument count <code>ARGC</code> by one so
that AWK doesn’t try to process a file named “25.5” and end up upset when it’s
not there.  AWK arguments can mean whatever you need them to mean, but unless
told otherwise, AWK generally assumes they are filenames, and will attempt to
iterate through them for lines of data to chew on.</p>

<p>Here’s another way that’s very similar; we read the threshold from the second
argument, and then blank it out in the <code>ARGV</code> array:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'BEGIN{threshold=ARGV[2];ARGV[2]=""}
    NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' test-data 25.5
</code></pre>

<p>AWK won’t treat the second argument as a filename, because it’s blank by the
time it processes it.</p>

<h3>Pre-assigned variables</h3>

<p>There are two lesser-known syntaxes for passing data into AWK that allow you
safely to assign variables at runtime.  The first is to use the <code>-v</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk -v threshold="$threshold" \
    'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' \
    test-data
</code></pre>

<p>Another, perhaps even more obscure, is to set them as arguments before the
filename data, using the <code>var=value</code> syntax:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' \
    threshold="$threshold" test-data
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in both cases, we still <em>quote</em> the <code>$threshold</code> expansion; this is
because the shell is expanding the value before we pass it in.</p>

<p>The difference between these two syntaxes is when the variable assignment
occurs.  With <code>-v</code>, the assignment happens straight away, before reading any
data from the input sources, as if it were in the <code>BEGIN</code> block of the program.
With the argument form, it happens when the program’s data processing reaches
that argument.  The upshot of that is that you could test several files with
several different temperatures in one hit, if you wanted to:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' \
    threshold=25.5 test-data-1 threshold=26.0 test-data-2
</code></pre>

<p>Both of these assignment syntaxes are standardized in <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/awk.1p.html">POSIX <code>awk</code></a>.</p>

<p>These are my preferred methods for passing runtime data; they require no
argument count munging, avoid the possibility of trampling on existing
environment variables, use AWK’s own variable and expression syntax, and most
importantly, the chances of anyone reading the script being able to grasp
what’s going on are higher.  You can thereby avoid a mess of quoting and
back-ticking that often plagues these sorts of embedded programs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1565793939038_266584"><div><p>The human genome is an incredible thing. Six billion letters of DNA – that’s more than two metres of DNA in every single cell – containing all the genes that enable a single cell to grow into a fully-formed, fully functioning person. </p><p>So when the first draft sequence of the human genome was published in 2001, researchers around the world were eager to discover exactly how many genes must be packed into our glorious genome.</p><p>The answer was a big surprise.</p><p>Many people thought that it must take at least a hundred thousand genes to make a human – with a sweepstake on offer to the person who made the closest guess to the final number – yet the human genome turns out to contain only 20,000 or so genes (roughly the same number of genes as a fruit fly or nematode worm).</p><p>This seems remarkably low to make an organism with as much dazzling complexity as a human being.  Even more perplexingly, the genes that we do have make up less than two per cent of all that DNA. So what’s the rest?</p><p>To find out, we need to go back in time to 1972.</p><p>That’s when geneticist Susumu Ohno published a paper entitled “So much ‘junk’ DNA in our genome” in an obscure scientific journal, the Brookhaven Symposia in Biology, in which he mused upon a mathematical problem.</p><p>By that point, scientists had already measured how much DNA was present in bacteria and figured out that these little bugs must contain a few thousand genes. They also knew that a single human cell contained at least 750 times as much DNA.</p><p>Ohno did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation – if the number of genes in any genome was directly proportional to the amount of DNA, then humans should have….. three million genes, more or less.</p><p>But, as he pointed out in his paper, ‘lowly lungfish and salamanders’ can have 36 times more DNA in their cells than is present in ours, suggesting that they should have…. A hundred million genes.</p><p>He didn’t believe it. What would a slimy salamander need with all those genes? Therefore, Ohno concluded, the vast majority of the human genome must be junk. And, correspondingly, varying proportions of other organisms’ genomes must be junk too. And once the Human Genome project revealed that the vast majority of our genome doesn’t seem to contain actual genes, it looked like he was right.</p><p>The function of this remaining 98% of the human genome - sometimes called ‘junk DNA’ but more accurately referred to as non-coding DNA – is a hotly debated topic in the world of genetics, fought out within the dignified pages of journals and the more febrile atmosphere of scientific conferences.</p><p>An absolutely massive study published in 2012, known as ENCODE, suggested that around 80% of the human genome was functional – namely, that it did something important for the proper functioning of our cells and bodies. Just under 10 per cent is thought to be control switches responsible for turning genes on and off at the right time and in the right place, while the rest does all manner of things, from producing little pieces of RNA that control gene activity to organising the three-dimensional structure of the DNA inside a cell.</p><p>Others were unconvinced. For example, evolutionary geneticist Chris Ponting suggests that less than 10% of the human genome is functional, based on how much has been strongly preserved through evolutionary time and must therefore be very important.</p><p>It’s against this backdrop we bring in the Onion Test, devised by T. Ryan Gregory and posted on his blog in April 2007. It was later formalised as a scientific paper that he published in 2014, together with Alexander Palazzo.</p><p>Put simply, the Onion Test goes like this.</p><p>The onion in your vegetable drawer has five times more DNA than humans. So if you’re a researcher who thinks that non-coding DNA has a particular function in the genome, can you explain why an onion needs about five times more of it than a human to do the same thing?</p><p>Unpeeling this idea a bit further, Gregory points out that some species of onions have around double the amount of DNA as your regular onions, while others have less than half. Yet they’re pretty much the same and have the same number of genes, so why would they need double or half the amount of non-coding DNA?</p><p>This argument works for all kinds of species, from Ohno’s lowly salamanders with their giant genomes containing roughly the same set of genes as other vertebrates, including humans, to the biggest genome discovered to date, which belongs to the Japanese canopy flower, Paris Japonica, with around 150 time more DNA in its genome than a human.</p><p>Then there’s the poisonous Fugu pufferfish – often eaten (very carefully!) as a delicacy in Japan.  They have remarkably compact genomes, roughly an eighth of the size of our own yet containing almost exactly the same repertoire of genes and very little junk.</p><p>Perhaps our obsession with finding function for all the junk in our genome comes from a desire to think that humans are something special in the biological world – certainly more special than an onion.</p><p> But in the words of the grumpy geneticist Dan Graur, who I interviewed for my book Herding Hemingway’s Cats in which I dig into the junk in our genetic trunk,  “Either you have to assume that humans are the pinnacle of creation –that everything is functional and those organisms with more DNA than us have junk DNA but we don’t. Or you have to assume that humans are a regular organism that has junk DNA just like everything else.”</p><p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2007/04/onion-test/" target="_blank">T.

    <div>
      
      <div><p>Hi all,</p><p>At 2021-01-29 at 21:35 UTC Google suspended Element from the Play Store without warning or notification. &nbsp;We submitted an appeal asking for clarification at 23:18, and at 05:31 received a generic update from the Google Play Policy team citing that the app has been removed due to content which contravenes their terms of use, and asking us to “make the necessary changes to [our] app” and “upload a new app using a new package name and a new app name”.</p><p>As of 11:44 UTC we’ve submitted a detailed appeal to reiterate that Element is a generic chat app for connecting to the global Matrix communication network, just as Chrome is a generic web browser for connecting to the Web - and just as Google does not control the content on the Web, Element does not control the content on Matrix.</p><p>We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce. We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content.</p><p>In order to enforce our terms of use on the Matrix servers we run as Element, we have a formal Trust and Safety team hired full-time who are dedicated to investigating and tracking abuse reports sent to <a href="https://element.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e68784939583a68b8792948f9ec8899481"><span data-cfemail="d1b0b3a4a2b491bcb0a5a3b8a9ffbea3b6">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or reported from the app. &nbsp;The team takes appropriate action on a ticket by ticket basis - deactivating abusive accounts and blocking chatrooms from our servers which contravene our terms of use, and building tooling to help enforce the terms of use on the servers we run.</p><p>Managing abuse is an ongoing activity, and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">Matrix is expanding massively at the moment</a>. We are expanding Element’s Trust and Safety team to match that growth, focusing on improving our anti-abuse mechanisms, and we are also constantly expanding the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation/">moderation tools</a> we provide to the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re also continuing to work on decentralised reputation as a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/">scalable solution to empower other users to combat abuse</a> for the wider Matrix network - effectively bringing control back to users and empowering communities to remain safe online.</p><p>Element and Matrix are used by the French, German, UK and US governments, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/29/this-week-in-matrix-2021-01-29#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">countless universities</a>, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world - we can only apologise for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this.</p><p>We’re currently waiting for an update to Google and will keep this blog post updated as the situation develops. &nbsp;We look forward to resolving the problem and getting the app back in the store shortly.</p><p>-- The Element Team</p><p>Update: reminder that in the interim you can download a (slightly outdated) version of Element Android from F-Droid at <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app</a>. &nbsp;We're also looking into running our own F-Droid repository going forwards so the most recent build is always available there.</p><p>UPDATE: At 2021-01-30 23:17 UTC we received a call from a VP at Google who apologised for the bad communication from Google and explained the situation, which related to some extremely abusive content which was accessible on the default matrix.org homeserver. &nbsp;Our Trust and Safety team had already identified and acted on this content to enforce the server's terms of use, and so we've explained how Element and Matrix works, established a channel for communication over any future moderation concerns, and expect the app to be restored shortly.</p><p>UPDATE: The app is restored as of 2021-01-31 00:30 UTC. &nbsp;Huge thanks to everyone for your patience and support while we sorted this out, and to the wider Element team who spent their Saturday on this. &nbsp;Thanks also to Google for being transparent and apologetic and the rapid resolution once we'd established contact.</p></div>

<p>SKiDL is a module that allows you to compactly describe the interconnection of 
electronic circuits and components using Python.
The resulting Python program performs electrical rules checking
for common mistakes and outputs a netlist that serves as input to
a PCB layout tool.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at a “normal” design flow in <a href="https://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/images/schematic-process-flow.png" alt="Schematic-based PCB design flow"></p>

<p>Here, you start off in a <em>schematic editor</em> (for KiCad, that’s EESCHEMA) and
draw a schematic. From that, EESCHEMA generates
a <em>netlist file</em> that lists what components are used and how their pins are interconnected.
Then you’ll use a <em>PCB layout tool</em> (like KiCad’s PCBNEW) to arrange the part footprints
and draw the wire traces that connect the pins as specified in the netlist.
Once that is done, PCBNEW outputs a set of <em>Gerber files</em> that are sent to a
<em>PCB fabricator</em> who will create a physical PCB and ship it to you.
Then you’ll post a picture of them on Twitter and promptly dump them
in a drawer for a few years because you got bored with the project.</p>

<p>In the SKiDL-based design flow, you use a <em>text editor</em> to create a <em>Python code file</em>
that employs the SKiDL library to describe interconnections of components.
This code file is executed by a <em>Python interpreter</em> and a netlist file is output.
From there, the design flow is identical to the schematic-based one
(including dumping the PCBs in a drawer).</p>

<p><img src="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/images/skidl-process-flow.png" alt="Schematic-based PCB design flow"></p>

<p>So, why would you <em>want</em> to use SKiDL?
Here are some of the features SKiDL brings to electronic design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requires only a text editor and Python.</li>
  <li>Has a powerful, flexible syntax (because it <em>is</em> Python).</li>
  <li>Permits compact descriptions of electronic circuits (think about <em>not</em> tracing
signals through a multi-page schematic).</li>

<p>As a very simple example, the SKiDL program below describes a circuit that
takes an input voltage, divides it by three, and outputs it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>skidl</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>

<span># Create input &amp; output voltages and ground reference.
</span><span>vin</span><span>,</span> <span>vout</span><span>,</span> <span>gnd</span> <span>=</span> <span>Net</span><span>(</span><span>'VI'</span><span>),</span> <span>Net</span><span>(</span><span>'VO'</span><span>),</span> <span>Net</span><span>(</span><span>'GND'</span><span>)</span>

<span># Create two resistors.
</span><span>r1</span><span>,</span> <span>r2</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>Part</span><span>(</span><span>"Device"</span><span>,</span> <span>'R'</span><span>,</span> <span>TEMPLATE</span><span>,</span> <span>footprint</span><span>=</span><span>'Resistor_SMD.pretty:R_0805_2012Metric'</span><span>)</span>
<span>r1</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>'1K'</span>   <span># Set upper resistor value.

</span>
<span># Connect the nets and resistors.
</span><span>vin</span> <span>+=</span> <span>r1</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>      <span># Connect the input to the upper resistor.
</span><span>gnd</span> <span>+=</span> <span>r2</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>      <span># Connect the lower resistor to ground.
</span><span>vout</span> <span>+=</span> <span>r1</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span> <span>r2</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span># Output comes from the connection of the two resistors.
</span>
<span># Or you could do it with a single line of code:
# vin &amp;&amp; r1 &amp;&amp; vout &amp;&amp; r2 &amp;&amp; gnd
</span>
<span># Output the netlist to a file.
</span><span>generate_netlist</span><span>()</span>

<p>SKiDL is pure Python so it’s easy to install:</p>



<p>To give SKiDL some part libraries to work with,
you’ll also need to install <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>.
Then, you’ll need to set an environment variable so SKiDL can find the libraries.
For Windows, do this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR=C:\Program Files\KiCad\share\kicad\kicad-symbols
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And for linux-type OSes, define the environment variable in your <code>.bashrc</code> like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>export KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR="/Library/Application Support/kicad/kicad-symbols"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>These paths are OS-dependent</strong>, so launch KiCAD and click <code>Preferences-&gt;Configure Paths</code>
to reveal the needed paths.</p>



<p>This is the minimum that you need to know to design electronic circuitry
using SKiDL:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to get access to SKiDL.</li>
  <li>How to find and instantiate a component (or <em>part</em>).</li>
  <li>How to connect <em>pins</em> of the parts to each other using <em>nets</em>.</li>
  <li>How to run an ERC on the circuit.</li>
  <li>How to generate a <em>netlist</em> for the circuit that serves as input to a PCB layout tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll demonstrate these steps using SKiDL in an interactive Python session,
but normally the statements that are shown would be entered into a file and
executed as a Python script.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-skidl">Accessing SKiDL</h2>

<p>To use skidl in a project, just place the following at the top of your file:</p>



<p>But for this tutorial, I’ll just import everything:</p>



<h2 id="finding-parts">Finding Parts</h2>

<h3 id="command-line-searching">Command-line Searching</h3>

<p>SKiDL provides a convenience function for searching for parts called
(naturally) <code>search</code>.
For example, if you needed an operational amplifier, then the following command would
pull up some likely candidates:</p>

  </p>


<p>A great deal of effort has been expended on figuring out what makes a
programming language “good” (or, more accurately, <em>popular</em>).</p>

<p>What I’m about to propose is really just conjecture, but I think the conclusions
drawable from it are amusingly accurate.</p>

<h2 id="the-theory">The Theory</h2>

<p><em>The popularity of a given programming language can be described accurately
as if the language were a file on a Unix filesystem, with <strong>read</strong>, <strong>write</strong>,
and <strong>execute</strong> bits. A language with all three “bits” set is more likely to
be popular than a language with two or less.</em></p>

<p>That alone is fairly meaningless, so I’ll detail exactly what is meant by
“readability”, “writability”, and “executability”.</p>

<h2 id="readability">Readability</h2>

<p>What does it mean for a programming language to be readable? That’s an
inflammatory question.</p>

<p>At the risk of being overly simplistic and broad, I’ll say that a language’s
readability is largely a function of 3 characteristics:</p>

<h3 id="similarity-to-other-popular-languages-or-overall-styles">Similarity to other popular languages, or overall styles.</h3>

<p>To a certain extent, this characteristic can be simplified to a single question:</p>

<p><em>“How similar is it to C?”</em></p>

<p>For the last 50 years, the vast majority of programming has been done
in procedural fashion, in languages with syntaxes directly derived from
or heavily inspired by ALGOL and C. Even languages that aren’t directly
procedural (read: anything remotely object-oriented) regularly borrow
constructions from their ALGOL-derived cousins.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that ALGOL-like syntaxes are objectively <em>good</em>, just that
their universal familiarity has a tangible effect on how we approach <em>new</em>
languages.</p>

<p>For example, how do you feel about these function calling syntaxes?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>(1): foo(bar, baz, quux)
(2): foo bar baz quux
(3): foo bar withBaz: baz withQuux: quux
(4): [quux;baz;bar | foo]
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re like me, <code>(1)</code> is the most immediately understandable - it’s standard
function-with-arguments-separated-by-commas-in-parentheses-style. <code>(2)</code> might
also be fairly recognizable, if you’re used to working in a shell - it’s
utility-with-stringy-arguments-separated-by-whitespace-style. <code>(3)</code> will feel
familiar to Smalltalk programmers - the
receiver-object-taking-a-message-and-keyword-arguments-style. Finally, <code>(4)</code>
should feel relatively foreign to everybody - the argument list is reversed to
reflect the structure of the stack.</p>

<p>Without getting into which one of these styles is objectively best (I wouldn’t
be able to tell you), it’s apparent to most people that <code>(1)</code> is the most
<em>readable</em> simply by virtue of being so common. If I see <code>foo(bar, baz, quux)</code>
in a language I’ve never used before, I can be <em>relatively</em> confident that it
will behave like the other languages I’ve seen it in. The principle would be
the same, even if we lived in a world where Smalltalk or Lisp styles were
overwhelmingly popular.</p>

<h3 id="apparent-meaning">Apparent meaning.</h3>

<p>If you had (or have) never written a line of code in your life, which one of
these lines is most apparent in meaning? It’s okay if neither is apparent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>(1): foobar[0]
(2): foobar.first
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Although <code>(1)</code> is what I learned first and is significantly more common, I find
<code>(2)</code> much more apparent. Compared to <code>(1)</code>, which requires that I know that
arrays are (usually) zero-based and accessed with <code>[]</code>, <code>(2)</code> only requires
that I recognize what I want (getting the first element of <code>foobar</code>) and
the general pattern for “doing things” from the line’s surroundings (calling a
method on an object with <code>.</code>).</p>

<p>What about this pair?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>(1): foo = bar * baz + quux
(2): = foo + * bar baz quux
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>(2)</code> is conceptually cleaner (no memorization of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">PEMDAS</a> required), but it’s
also significantly less apparent to someone who’s already gone through
basic arithmetic with infix notation.</p>

<p>These are simple examples, but I think that they demonstrate a truth in
language design that we’re often not willing to admit, namely that precedent
and apparency matter more than conceptual purity. It’s nice to think of
radically new languages the reimagine common operations in</p>

<h3 id="complexity-of-mental-representation">Complexity of mental representation.</h3>

<p>This ties closely into apparent meaning, although it’s slightly different.</p>

<p>Consider each of the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>for</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>foobar</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>foobar</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>baz</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>



<p>In both examples, I call <code>baz</code> on every element in the <code>foobar</code> array.</p>

<p>However, in the first one, I have to keep track of an index variable (<code>i</code>), a
loop condition and iteration (<code>i &lt; foobar.length; i++</code>), and a new scope (<code>{}</code>).</p>

<p>In the second one, I take advantage of a little bit of magic in the form of
an <code>each</code> method and a <code>:baz</code> symbol to reduce <em>N</em> operations to a single line.
I don’t have to worry about my index variable, the correctness of my condition,
or my scope.</p>

<p>Although <code>(1)</code> is probably more immediately <em>apparent</em> and much more similar
to currently popular styles, it also requires me to maintain a mental
representation of <em>details irrelevant to what I’m actually trying to
accomplish</em>. I don’t want (or need) to know <em>how</em> each element is accessed or
that there are <code>foobar.length</code> elements, I just want to apply <code>baz</code>.</p>

<h2 id="writability">Writability</h2>

<p>A programming language’s writability is closely related to its readability.
The readability of a language refers to analyzing idiomatic programs written by
<em>everybody</em>, while the writability of a language refers to an <em>individual’s</em>
ability to <em>produce</em> idiomatic programs.</p>

<p>My thoughts on writability fall into a few already well-defined categories:</p>

<h3 id="pola">POLA</h3>

<p>POLA stands for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">Principle of Least Astonishment</a>.</p>

<p>It’s hard to think of a language that is uniformly unastonishing (in a good
way!), but I often point to Ruby as one that <em>can</em> be unastonishing.</p>

<p>Ruby’s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html">Array</a> class is a good
example of this. Compare the following code snippets:</p>

<h4 id="testing-an-array-for-emptiness">Testing an array for emptiness</h4>

<p>Python:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>foobar</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>not</span> <span>foobar</span> <span># =&gt; True
# OR
</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>foobar</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span># =&gt; True
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Java:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre><span>foobar</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>

<span>foobar</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>// =&gt; true</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>In both examples, the Ruby solution is fairly unastonishing. Predicates are
trailed by “<code>?</code>”, and are single English words corresponding to their behavior.</p>

<p>The Python examples tend to be equally short, but not as unastonishing.
<code>not foobar</code> relies on empty arrays being considered falsey (just be careful
with tuples!). Checking the length is not particularly astonishing (aside from
<code>len()</code> being called from the global namespace), but “the size of <code>foobar</code> is
zero” is an awfully roundabout way of saying “<code>foobar</code> is empty”.</p>

<p>The first Java example is about as short and astonishing as its Python
counterpart. The second one, on the other hand, is absolutely insane. It
could be shortened by using a helper like <code>Arrays.asList(foobar).contains(6)</code>,
except that this is invalid (primitives and Java generics don’t mix) and
also completely astonishing (an <code>Arrays</code> class? <code>asList</code>?).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">There’s more than one way to do it</a>
is a longstanding Perl principle. People don’t often think of Perl when it
comes to <em>readability</em>, but I would argue that it is one of the most
<em>writable</em> languages (perhaps even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-only_language">write-only</a>).</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<h4 id="a-read-loop-that-capitalizes-input-and-spits-it-back">A read-loop that capitalizes input and spits it back</h4>

<p>In C, this would involve buffering <code>stdin</code> in a loop, converting each character
to its uppercase equivalent (don’t forget Unicode!), and printing them back out.
The process in Java would be similar.</p>

<p>In Perl:</p>



<p>a little more explicitly (and off of the command line):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>print</span> <span>uc</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>even more explicit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>my</span> <span>$line</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>STDIN</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>print</span> <span>uc</span><span>(</span><span>$line</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>and so on:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>my</span> <span>$line</span> <span>=</span> <span>readline</span><span>(</span><span>*STDIN</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>print</span> <span>uc</span><span>(</span><span>$line</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Although this may seem like a shortcut to terse and unreadable code, it
<em>is</em> a legitimate reason to like a language (and enjoy writing in it). Perl
provides an astounding number of primitives and shortcuts for common operations
(<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html">look at all of these operators!</a>), making
quick scripting painless and straightforward.</p>

<p>(By the way, the Ruby version: <code>ruby -pe '$_.upcase!'</code>).</p>

<h2 id="executability">Executability</h2>

<p>This is probably the murkiest of the three “bits”.</p>

<p>Let’s clarify it:</p>

<h3 id="ease-of-setup">Ease of setup</h3>

<p>Let’s say I found a cool program written in “Etaoin”. How am I going to run it?</p>

<p>If Etaoin is compiled and the developer was kind enough to provide a package
or installer, I’d probably just download their package and let my system take
care of the little details. The is the <strong>best case scenario</strong>.</p>

<p>But what if Etaoin is interpreted? Well, the developer <em>might</em> bundle the
interpreter into a package, but this would be a bit overkill. It would probably
be better to install Etaoin discretely, a process that involves either a package
or manual compilation, depending on Etaoin’s popularity.</p>

<p>Once I’ve got the interpreter, what about the program’s dependencies? Does
Etaoin have a package manager? Are the dependencies available through it? Are
they compatible with my release of the language? Am I going to need other
languages and tools to build them?</p>

<p>Whenever I see a new language or an interesting project written in a new
language, these are the very first questions I ask. It’s a lot harder to
justify installing a relatively simple program If it requires me to manually
build an interpreter and dependencies, solely by virtue of being written in an
uncommon language.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not a completely fair or accurate characterization. It’s a
little ridiculous to place the onus of “executability” solely upon package
maintainers.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-the-system">Integration with the system</h3>

<p>Now that I have Etaoin all set up, it’s time to run this cool program.</p>

<p>But wait, Etaoin programs run in a virtual machine that needs to be invoked:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

Unfortunately it doesn't. Apparently two signals from the power supply was permanently in low state, BUS DC LO L and BUS AC LO L. These are active low signals and in its' low state the inhibits the clock generation of the main CPU.</p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">The schematics above describes the 5V regulator of the H777 power supply. The blue marked area is a current source circuit which is fed by incoming raw DC and which charges a 50uF capacitor which thus creates a nice ramp signal. A resistor ladder circuit and a number of comparators generate the BUS DC LO L, BUS AC LO L and an internal signal which causes the clock signal to the main PWM switch. The voltage over the capacitor never exceeded 20.4 V which was not enough to get the two of the comparators to change polarity. It seems like to much current is consumed from the current source. The capacitor was replaced, but no difference. But the current source was not only connected to the capacitor. It was also connected to the red marked area which is a crow bar circuit. If any of the main switch transistors would fail a 38 V raw DC would be the result on the output. Not very good. Therefore there is a zener diode and a couple of thyristors which fires off if the output voltage exceeded 5.6 VDC. This will also short circuit the current source, effectively stopping all activities in&nbsp; power supply. The problem seemed to be that even under normal circumstances 1.5 mA was consumed by leakage in the thyristor even though hasn't fired. Apparently all thyristors have leakages but not this much.<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/U0GunMu.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Thyristor" height="389" src="http://i.imgur.com/U0GunMu.png" width="400"></a></p><p>Change of thyristor to a modern BT145 resulted in a fully functional power supply!</p><p><span>Testing the CPU</span></p><p>All cables were connected and the power was switched on. No smoke leaked anywhere which was a good sign. But the RUN lamp were just flashing briefly. Pressing INIT switch on the console only gave a short blink of the RUN lamp. Not very promising.</p><p>A check with the oscilloscope on the main clock signal of then CPU board showed that is starts up does 8 cycles, the stops for a couple micro seconds then does three more cycles, yet another stop and the three cycles and then nothing.</p><p><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1200 x 961)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1200 x 961)"></span></p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/O3QASBs.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="8 micro cycles" src="http://i.imgur.com/O3QASBs.png"></a></p><br>From the picture above one can deduce that the cycle time is closer to 250 ns rather than 260 ns&nbsp; specified in "Computer Engineering". However using a delay line in a feedback loop may not be that accurate. 4 MHz is a quite impressive speed at least in the mid seventies. </span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Further than this is probably not possible using an oscilloscope only. For that purpose I have gotten this little USB connected tool:<br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">But to cover the entire machine with address and data bus one would need four of these. Luckily at this point in time I was offered to buy a HP1664A logic analyser at an affordable price!<br></span></p><div><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><b>Logic&nbsp;analyser&nbsp;fault tracing</b></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">After some initial problems which was caused by mixed-up signals and also forgetting that the machine is active low I got some good traces from the analyser:<br></span></p><div><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/SPIxi1B.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="micro code" src="http://i.imgur.com/SPIxi1B.png"></a></p><p>The picture above shows the output of the micro address pipeline register. So it actually shows the second micro step as the first micro-step. But this is actually the correct sequence comparing to this <a href="http://vaxhaven.com/images/1/11/EK-KD11D-TM-PRE.pdf">document</a>. </p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vCoTm8v.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Address bus and databus" src="http://i.imgur.com/vCoTm8v.png"></a></p><br>The interesting with this trace is that the CPU output addresses 24 and the 26 on the address bus. On the data bus it then receives 165020 which is the to be PC to start execution at after power fail, this is also the first address of the diagnostics program of the M9312. But looking at the address the CPU subsequently outputs on the address bus it is 167020. For some reason bit 10 has became high! Measuring more closely on a bus receiver chip, DS8641 shows that even though the input is at 3.31 V the output is a 3.78 V! This seems to be wrong!</span></p><p><span><span face="verdana, sans-serif">It is alive</span></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><b><br></b>This is the little evil thing:<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XojS9FU.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="DS8641" height="320" src="http://i.imgur.com/XojS9FU.png" width="319"></a></p><br>Unfortunately DS8641 is not a very common IC. It is especially adapted to Digital open collector buses. I ordered some from a seller on Ebay located in China but since the delivery time is quite long I resorted to desoldered an IC from another board and replaced the faulty chip on the CPU board.<p>This time the result was much better:</p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/soZUSxo.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Waiting for TX ready" src="http://i.imgur.com/soZUSxo.png"></a></p><br>However it ends up spinning waiting for TX ready bit of the console serial port to become ready.

In fact, they are commonly used as the standard approach, despite that they are a perilous area full of dicey pitfalls. Especially regarding how these linear combinations make your algorithm hard to tune.</p><p>Therefore, in this post we hope to lay out the following arguments:</p><ul><li>A lot of problems in machine learning should be treated as multi-objective problems, while they currently are not.</li><li>This lack of multi-objective treatment leads to difficulties in tuning the hyper-parameters for these machine learning algorithms.</li><li>It is nigh on impossible to detect when these problems are occurring, making it tricky to work around them.</li><li>There are methods to solve this which might be slightly involved, but do not require more than a few lines of code. <a href="https://engraved.ghost.io/how-we-can-make-machine-learning-algorithms-tunable">One of these methods is laid out in a follow-up blog post.</a></li></ul><p>Nothing of this article is novel. You might already be aware of everything we wanted to say. However, we have the impression that most machine learning curricula do not discuss optimisation methods very well (I know mine did not), and consequently, gradient descent is being treated as the one method to solve all problems. And the general message is that if an algorithm does not work for your problem, you need to spend more time tuning the hyper-parameters to your problem. </p><p><a href="https://engraved.ghost.io/how-we-can-make-machine-learning-algorithms-tunable">In the next blog post, a solution is introduced</a>, based on the NIPS’88 paper which introduced the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers.</p><p>So we hope that this blogpost can remove some confusion on how to handle this issue in a more foundational and principled way. And hey, maybe it can make you spend less time tuning your algorithms, and more time making research progress.</p><h2 id="linear-combinations-of-losses-are-everywhere">Linear combinations of losses are everywhere</h2><p>While there are single-objective problems, it is common for these objectives to be given additional regularisation. We have picked a selection of such optimisation objectives from across the field of machine learning field.</p><p>First off, we have the regularisers, weight decay and lasso. It is obvious that when you add these regularisations, you effectively have created a multi-objective loss for your problem. After all, what you really care about, is that both the original loss \(L_0\) and the regulariser loss are kept low. And you will tune the balance between the two using a \(\lambda\) parameter.</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = L_0(\theta) + \lambda \sum \left| \theta \right| $$</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = L_0(\theta) + \lambda \sum \theta^2 $$</p><p>As a consequence, losses found in e.g. VAE’s are effectively multi-objective, with a first objective to maximally cover the data, and a second objective to stay close to the prior distribution. In this case, occasionally KL annealing is used to introduce a tunable parameter \(\beta\) to help handle the multi-objectiveness of this loss.</p><p>$$ L(\theta) =\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z | x )} \left[ \log p_\theta ( x | z) \right] &nbsp;- \beta D_{KL} \left( q_\phi ( z | x) \| p(z) \right) $$</p><p>Also in reinforcement learning, you can see this multi-objectiveness. Not only is it common for many environments to simply sum rewards received for obtaining partial goals. The policy loss is usually also a linear combination of losses. Take as an example here the losses on the policy for PPO, SAC and MPO, entropy regularized methods with their tunable parameter <strong><em>α</em></strong>.</p><p>$$ L(\pi) = - \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)} \left[ r(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \mathcal{H}(\cdot , s_t)\right]$$</p><p>$$ L(\pi) = - \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)} \left[ \mathbb{E}_\pi\left(Q(s_t, a_t)\right) - \alpha D_{KL} \left( q \| \pi \right) \right]$$</p><p>Finally, the GAN-loss is of course a sum between the discriminator and the generator loss:</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = - \mathbb{E}_x \left[ \log D_\theta(x)\right] - \mathbb{E}_z \left[ \log ( 1- D_\theta(G_\theta(z))\right]$$</p><p>All of these losses have something in common, they are effectively trying to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously, and argue that the optimum is found in balancing these often contradicting forces. In some cases, the sum is more ad hoc and a hyper-parameter is introduced to weigh the parts against each other. In some cases, there are clear theoretical foundations on why the losses are combined this way, and no hyper-parameter is used for tuning the balance between the parts. </p><blockquote>In this post, we hope to show you this approach of combining losses may sound appealing, but that this linear combination is actually precarious and treacherous. The balancing act is often more like a tightrope walk.</blockquote><p>Let us consider a simple case, where we are trying to optimise for such a linear combination of losses. We take the approach of optimising the total loss, which is a sum of losses. We optimise this with gradient descent, and we observe the following behaviour.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/953U2daXgDAO_97ugiYVEKnbK69gZVKUmlY9hNpCqtYlTso-XFw8WQ-dWRcBNeNtx7KNvXi1bM5mB8cfmnjXUMg4gU6fp5LvADys1WtoWIW-mqiJt1Uzu-Lw8VceNfQeLLQa9IZa" alt=""></figure><p>Our code in Jax would look something like this:</p><pre><code>def loss(θ):
  return loss_1(θ) + loss_2(θ)
loss_derivative = grad(loss)
for gradient_step in range(200):
  gradient = loss_derivative(θ)
  θ = θ - 0.02 * gradient</code></pre><p>As is usually the case, we are not immediately happy about the tradeoff between the two losses. So we introduce a scaling coefficient <strong><em>α</em></strong> on the second loss and run the following code:</p><pre><code>def loss(θ, α):
  return loss_1(θ) + α*loss_2(θ)
loss_derivative = grad(loss)
for gradient_step in range(200):
  gradient = loss_derivative(θ, α=0.5)
  θ = θ - 0.02 * gradient
</code></pre><p>The behaviour we hope to see is that when tuning this <strong><em>α</em></strong>, we can choose the trade-off between the two losses and select the point we are most happy with for our application. We effectively will go on a hyper-parameter tuning loop, manually select an <strong><em>α</em></strong>, run the optimisation process, decide we would like the second loss to be lower, tune our <strong><em>α</em></strong> up accordingly and repeat the whole optimisation process. After several iterations, we settle for the solution we found and continue writing our papers.</p><p>However, that is not what is always happening. The actual behaviour we sometimes observe for our problem looks like the one below.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iZlk4MRVx7JYgLbaqIv-jH8zZGSc78Jj-aqk_YWy5e80tf_hgMMaBn41yRFR2rpRFGE8vuRGWjljGZ6Ri8XbyDhZbAQbSCX-putykGEpxgmcuPTmrQH1VHKpaKfjra3AG4u-x9K7" alt=""></figure><blockquote>It seems that no matter how we finetune our <strong><em>α</em></strong>-parameter, we cannot make a good trade-off between our two losses. </blockquote><p>We see two clusters of solutions, one where the first loss is ignored, and one where the second loss is ignored. However, both of these solutions are not useful for most applications. Most of the time, a point where the two losses were more balanced is a more preferred solution.</p><p>In fact, this diagram of the two losses over the course of training is barely ever plotted, so the dynamics illustrated in this figure often goes unobserved. We just look at the training curve plotting the total loss, and we might conclude that this hyper-parameter needs more time tuning, as it seems to be really sensitive. Alternatively, we could settle for an approach of early stopping to make the numbers in the paper work. After all, reviewers love data efficiency.</p><p>Where did it go wrong though? <strong>Why does this method sometimes work, and why does it sometimes fail to give you a tunable parameter?</strong> For that, we need to look deeper into the difference between the two figures.</p><p>Both figures are generated for the same problem, using the same losses and are optimising these losses using the same optimisation method. So none of these aspects are to blame for the difference. The thing which has changed between these problems is the model. In other words, the effect the model parameters <strong><em>θ</em></strong> have on the output of the model is different.</p><p>Therefore, let us <em>cheat</em> and visualise something which is normally not visualisable, the Pareto front for both of our optimisations. This is the set of all solutions achievable by our model, which are not dominated by any other solution. In other words, it is the set of achievable losses, where there is no point where <em>all</em> of the losses are better. No matter how you choose to trade off between the two losses, your preferred solution always lies on the Pareto front. By tuning the hyper-parameter of your loss, you usually hope to merely find a different point on that same front.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6qA_NcRMUK8mWT3j3-t_bPl-oZkwg5Q9lWcOgBn9IB3qF_yQ7p1dyH6eq_DtKpTGeACMsLE-YfiIY9DH3yhF7swsmMFGMjNwI_oHdKKbNTuO0M8a_oDZQTUhKGcEuAfTpomqHX-M" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kVqsudO8-j48MEsdlaZgDgc22jMO9myzwdbTTWQ-KufWjuXqIr9gNHKrgV-fRzTb5gMgDnO-sFp1z_lS3UhX3wjwXHRowiaO7Vp04ZaYEAthw7y6wyN3zltH3o0wgB5ZbTDjRuRb" alt=""></figure><p>The difference between the two Pareto fronts is what is causing the tuning to turn out well for the first case, but to fail horribly after changing our model. It turns out that when the Pareto front is convex, we can achieve all possible trade-offs by tuning our <strong><em>α</em></strong>-parameter. However, when the Pareto front is concave, that approach does not seem to work well anymore.</p><h2 id="why-does-gradient-descent-optimisation-fail-for-concave-pareto-fronts">Why does gradient descent optimisation fail for concave Pareto fronts?</h2><p>We can illustrate why that is the case, by looking at the total loss in the third dimension, the loss which is actually optimised with gradient descent. In the following figure, we visualise the plane of total loss in relation to each of the losses. While we actually descend on this plane using the gradient with respect to the parameters, each gradient descent step we take will also necessarily go downwards on this plane. You can imagine the gradient descent optimisation process as putting a spherical pebble on that plane, letting it wobble down under gravity and wait until it comes to a halt.</p><p>The point where the optimisation process halts is the result of the optimisation process, here indicated by a star. As you can see in the following figure, no matter how you wobble down the plane, you will always end up in the optimum.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/U43_rJCiufKMSZ4gtci5kTQ2DRIH_r8WyvFi0aFV0wjpxXTNSFnMzR8a9DHvBc_ONbi0rEIBfXRQXUSxAcriZDGBNWVRhMQ-ifaIXdgeNf1K6cEIeXzMjYZUk94EWMH_bOBzvhOa" alt=""></figure><p>By tuning <strong><em>α</em></strong>, this space stays a plane. After all, by changing <strong><em>α</em></strong>, we are only changing the tilt of this plane. As you can see, &nbsp;in the convex case any solution on the Pareto curve can be achieved by tuning <strong><em>α</em></strong>. A little more <strong><em>α</em></strong> pulls the star to the left, a little less <strong><em>α</em></strong> pushes the star to the right. Every starting point of the optimisation process will converge on the same solution, and that is true for all values of <strong><em>α</em></strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://engraved.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/visualising_the_convex_case.mp4.hq.gif" alt=""></figure><p>However, if we take a look at the differently modeled problem with a concave Pareto front, it becomes apparent where …</p></div></section></div></div></div>

<p>Ever since .Net v4, in all versions including the last classic .Net version v4.8, the built-in browser detection accessible in the Request.Browser (a HttpBrowserCapabilities object) has a serious flaw which will bite you as soon as your site gets several visitors per minute.</p>



<p>What happens, if you rely on this object, is that users will randomly report having their browser mis-identified.</p>



<p>This post shows why it happens and how to solve it. The issue is also easy to reproduce locally, worth a few fun minutes. If you are so inclined, the problem also lends itself to a DoS attack.</p>



<p>Even though this problem seems only to affect classic .Net (not .Net Core), there is a huge number of running web apps out there, and still new being developed, on this framework.</p>



<p>We have a website relying on some of the later browser features, so we are using browser detection to tell users with older browsers to upgrade, since we absolutely need these features. It works fine for a while, then randomly, users with recent browser versions are suddenly told they need to upgrade. Once this occures it typically lasts for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>To reproduce, create an asp.net project (web forms, MVC, doesn’t really matter) with this code in a .aspx file:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;script language="c#" runat="server"&gt;
public void Page_Load(){
    Response.Write(Request.Browser.Browser 
    + " v" + Request.Browser.MajorVersion);
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>Visit this page, locally or on a server, and you get for instance <code>Chrome v88</code>. So far, so good.</p>



<p>The browser is classified from the User-Agent HTTP header. My Chrome sends this: <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.104 Safari/537.36</code></p>



<p>Now, quickly change the <code>Chrome/88</code> in the middle of the string to <code>Chrome/86</code> (or any other number) and retry. For instance in Curl:</p>



<pre><code>curl http://localhost:58571 -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4324.104 Safari/537.36"</code></pre>



<p>Still v88? How strange… Let’s refresh a few times. Still v88. Let’s think for a minute…hmm…refresh again. Gone! Now, at last, it shows v86! </p>



<p>I had to look into the <a href="https://referencesource.microsoft.com/System.Web/Configuration/HttpCapabilitiesEvaluator.cs.html#https://referencesource.microsoft.com/System.Web/Configuration/HttpCapabilitiesEvaluator.cs.html,3774a0750f8cc853,references">offending source code</a> from the .Net framework.</p>



<p>What happens is, for performance, the result of the browser classification is stored in a hash-table with the User-Agent string as the key. But not the entire string, no, that would have saved us a lot of headache, no, the key is just the first 64 characters (source line 46).</p>



<p>The Chrome version number is located at position 90 and thus not part of the key at all. To add to the frustration, the cache has a sliding-window (source line 247,304, 369) 1 minute expiry (source line 147). This means: as long as the cache key is read at least once a minute, it stays. Hilarity ensues.</p>



<p>The fix is straight-forward, put this in your <code>web.config</code></p>



<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;browserCaps userAgentCacheKeyLength="512" /&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Why 512? It turns out that .Net caps the User-Agent string at 512 characters  to avoid resource attacks (source line 188). I imagine someone at Microsoft deciding that 512 characters ought to be enough for anybody.</p>



<h2>Denial-of-Service implication</h2>



<p>Without this line in your web.config, your site is also vulnerable to a DoS attack if you, like us, rely on browser identification to enable some functionality. An attacker would wait for low-traffic hours, typically the middle of the night, to issue requests with the first 64 bytes looking like the most commonly used User-Agents on the web, but the rest of the string tweaked with low version numbers or other content to lead the browser capabilities to think “it’s an older browser, sir, but it checks out”.</p>



<p>As long as one request per User Agent is issued per minute, these are permanently mis-identified. An exceptionally low-cost and low-effort DoS attack.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, it was announced that <a href="http://www.ashfordstpeters.nhs.uk/latest-news/2610-covid-busting-nasal-spray-begins-uk-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK trials were beginning of a nasal spray proven to kill 99.9% of the coronavirus</a> that causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19</a>. The idea, broadly, is that you’d use the spray first thing in the morning, during the day after social interactions, and then again in the evening — and it would prevent the virus from taking hold and making you ill.</p>
<p>Awesome, right? Simple, cheap, portable. Sort of like cleaning your teeth regularly: prevention rather than cure. Combined with a <a href="https://wellcome.org/news/what-different-types-covid-19-vaccine-are-there" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine</a>, particularly for anyone at high risk such as those in healthcare settings, it could put a stop to the whole thing — and might also turn out to be effective on other, less deadly but still annoying, viruses.</p>
<p>But, I hear you ask, what is it? Because if I’m going to squirt something up my nose several times a day, I have questions…</p>

<p>Fair enough. It’s actually, mostly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitric oxide</a>, which has the chemical formula NO.</p>
<p>Yes, there are plenty of wordplay options here. The researchers have already jammed the letters NO into their company name, and done the acronym thing, to get <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/sanotize-trials-nasal-spray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaNOtize Nitric Oxide Nasal Spray</a> (NONS). If the trials are successful, it’s probably only a matter of time before we get: “Say NO to coronavirus!” marketing. (Any ad agencies reading this, I’m claiming copyright.)</p>
<p>But that aside, unless you’re a chemist you might be thinking about some half-remembered chemical names and frowning at this point. Isn’t that… used in rocket fuel? Or… wait… isn’t that… the nasty smoggy stuff that causes lung problems?</p>
<p>Ah, well, there are several nitrogen oxides. Let me summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>NO is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen monoxide or nitric oxide</a> — that’s what we’re talking about here.</li>
<li>NO<sub>2</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen dioxide</a> — forms when combustion happens in air, and it’s the one that’s brown and smells horrible, and is probably most associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smog#Photochemical_smog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photochemical smog&nbsp;</a>(although atmospheric NO has a significant role there, too).</li>
<li>N<sub>2</sub>O is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrous oxide</a>, sometimes just “nitrous” — that’s the one that’s also called laughing gas and is used as an anaesthetic, and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_use_of_nitrous_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recreationally</a>,” as well as being used to increase the power output of engines.</li>
<li>NO<sub>3</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate_radical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen trioxide</a> — this is a radical, with an unpaired electron. It’s unstable, but it is important in ozone chemistry.</li>
<li>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen tetroxide or dinitrogen tetroxide</a> — this is important because it forms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide#Structure_and_properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an equilibrium with NO<sub>2</sub></a> so the two can be thought of an interconvertible, and also because it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide#Use_as_a_rocket_propellant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used as a rocket propellent</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other nitrogen oxides</a>, not to mention ions — but let’s not spend all day on this. Nitrogen forms this confusing hodgepodge of oxides because it has five electrons in its outermost shell (it’s in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/nitrogen-group-element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group 15</a> of the periodic table) and because there’s not much difference in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronegativities</a> of oxygen and nitrogen. So essentially, it can share electrons with oxygen to form bonds in a number of different ways to obtain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration#Noble_gas_configuration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stable, full outer shell</a>.</p>
<p>For any students reading this, I’m sorry. You… pretty much just have to remember these. Yes, I know. That’s why experienced chemists so often use the shorthand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOx </a>— we just can’t be bothered keeping all the names straight. (Okay, before someone shouts at me, actually NOx is handy because we’re often talking about more than one oxide at a time, and it allows us to easily express that.)</p>
<p>Back to NO. It’s a colourless gas, and it has an unpaired electron, which makes it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free radical</a>. And… here we go again. Aren’t we supposed to eat lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antioxidant-</a>rich fruit and vegetables to mop up free radicals? They’re bad, aren’t they?</p>

<p>Yes and no. Free radicals are reactive species which damage cells and can cause illness and ageing. Too much exposure to free radicals causes something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oxidative stress</a>, which is definitely bad. But. It turns out that nitrogen oxide is an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaseous_signaling_molecule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signalling molecule</a>, that is, a molecule which is the body uses to send chemical signals from one place to another. In particular, nitrogen oxide “tells” the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide#Biological_functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smooth muscle around blood vessels to relax</a>, causing those blood vessels to dilate, and increasing blood flow. Viagra (aka <a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil">Sildenafil</a>) uses the nitric oxide pathway, and I think we all know what that does, don’t we? Good.</p>
<p>Nitric oxide has also been shown to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17170603/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce blood pressure</a>, which is generally considered a good thing — <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/low-blood-pressure-hypotension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to a point, obviously</a>. This is why you can buy lots of so-called <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitric oxide supplements</a>, which, since nitrogen oxide is a gas at room temperature, don’t actually contain nitric oxide on its own. Rather, they’re a mixture of amino acids and other things that supposedly help the body to <em>make</em> NO. But it might be cheaper, and healthier, to eat plenty of beetroot or drink beetroot juice, since there’s evidence that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29370244/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does the same sort of thing</a>.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dose makes the poison</a>. Too <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide#Occupational_safety_and_health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much nitric oxide is definitely problematic</a>, but administered in the right way and in appropriate doses, it’s extremely safe.</p>
<p>It’s suggested that the nitric oxide in the <a href="https://sanotize.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaNOtize</a> nasal spray destroys the virus and also helps to stop viral replication within cells. Plus, it <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocks the receptors</a> that the virus uses to enter cells in the first place. Essentially, it locks the doors and rains down fire on the potential intruders — nice work.</p>
<p>You only need to use the spray occasionally, because developing a COVID-19 infection isn’t instant. First the virus gets into your nose, then it attaches to cells, then it replicates, and <em>then</em> it sheds into your lungs. There are timescales involved here — so long as the spray is used every so often it should do the trick.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that this should, theoretically, work on other strains — where the current vaccines may not. So it could provide a very important stopgap when vaccination isn’t immediately available.</p>

<p>All sounds fabulous, doesn’t it? It might be, but, we’re in the early stages with this. Clinical trials <a href="http://www.ashfordstpeters.nhs.uk/latest-news/2610-covid-busting-nasal-spray-begins-uk-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have now started in the UK</a>, are already in <a href="https://sanotize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SaNOtize_HC_USU_release_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase II in Canada</a> and have been approved to start in the USA. Researchers are hopeful, but we need to wait for the evidence.</p>
<p>So in the meantime, <a href="https://twitter.com/chronicleflask/status/1283015334732103682" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wear a mask</a>, <a href="https://chronicleflask.com/2020/03/26/cleaning-chemistry-awesome-soap/">wash your hands,</a> and take a vaccine if you’re offered one. Stay safe out there!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://www.vim.org/"><img alt="Vim logo, GNU General Public License v2 or Later" data-original-height="240" data-original-width="240" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Vimlogo.svg/240px-Vimlogo.svg.png" width="320"></a></p>

<p>Many tools come and go as our software and devices change - or we get bored and want to try something new and shiny. One of the few exceptions for me has been the <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim text editor</a>, which I use for programming, emails, and writing every day. In this post I want to share why Vim is remarkable but more generally why learning a text editor is a great investment.</p>

        <p>It may not be obvious why text editors are useful tools. Many programs, like web browsers, email clients, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">integrated development environments (IDEs)</a>, have built-in text editing functionality. Why use a separate text editor? Text editors go deep. They are much more powerful than text boxes in browsers and email clients while being more general than IDEs. While IDEs often have excellent programming language-specific functionality, they are rarely used for other text editing tasks like writing emails or documents because they are specialized tools. Text editors strike a good balance of powerful editing and support for programming without being boxed into a narrow use-case.</p>

        <p>Getting started with a text editor is easy. Vim implements the arcane <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi editor</a> user interface but has many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcTu2VkAIIWzD2kicFNHN2c35XQCeZdsv">videos</a>, <a href="http://vimsheet.com/">cheatsheets</a>, and <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorial">tutorials</a> that make it fun to try. Really getting familiar with the features and customizing the editor to your own needs takes time though. This is true for any popular text editor because the number of settings, extensions, or plugins available can be huge. However, once you are familiar with a text editor you will have a powerful tool that can be used for most tasks involving writing or manipulating text. The time investment will pay off as you use the editor for todo lists, emails, documentation, programming, configuration files, and more.</p>

        <p>This explains why I've found Vim a useful and enduring tool that I use daily. But what makes it a particularly strong text editor compared to the other options? Text editors go in and out of fashion all the time. I remember many that attracted attention for a time but then faded away. Vim has remained popular and I think there are a few reasons for that.</p>

            <p><b>Powerful text editing plus IDE-like functionality.</b> The vi user interface is actually a language of text editing operators. The keys you press aren't just keyboard shortcuts, they are like a bytecode (!) for a text manipulation CPU that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete">Turing-complete</a>. Years ago I wrote vi macros that solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem">stable marriage problem</a> to demonstrate this. For many geeks this alone might be enough to convince you to learn Vim! But on top of this crazy text editing power Vim also has IDE-like functionality including syntax highlighting, completion, code search and navigation, compiler error navigation, and diffing. There is a large collection of plugins and scripts if you want to extend Vim's functionality even further.</p>

  <p><b>Vim is ubiquitous.</b> It runs on all major operating systems but furthermore it is found on devices from tiny Wi-Fi routers to the largest servers. It has a GUI but also a terminal interface if you are connecting to a remote machine over SSH. I always find it strange when I see people use their editor of choice on their laptop but then use another, less-familiar editor when connecting to remote machines. Learn Vim and you can use it everywhere!</p>

  <p><b>Keyboard-friendly.</b> Constantly moving my hand between the mouse and keyboard is tiring and distracting. Vim has excellent keyboard support and many things can be done without leaving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_row#Home_row">home row</a> on the keyboard, including navigating, inserting, and deleting text. I find there is no need to use the arrow keys, mouse, or anything that is hard to reach.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a powerful text editor that you can use for many years then I recommend Vim. It's also worth looking at Emacs, which has a different angle but is also a good time investment. Looking back on 17 years of using Vim, I'm happy I stopped switching between language-specific IDEs and instead found a text editor capable of handling all tasks.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3><p>Your stuff needs a home (yes, even in the "serverless" world. LOL). My personal preferences are <a href="https://azure.com/">Azure</a>, <a href="https://m.do.co/c/c844c6492d23">Digital Ocean</a> <em>(affiliate link)</em>, or <a href="https://scaleway.com/">Scaleway</a>. They each offer enough compute, networking options, storage, and basic services to build out proofs-of-concept or whatever you might need.</p><p>Another honorable mention here is <a href="https://hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. They offer a good level of hardware, service and price.</p><h3 id="the-virtual-machines">The Virtual Machines</h3><p>For those side projects and many enterprise applications, <strong>scale is not an issue</strong>. That means that I will not serve thousands of simultaneous users or handling terabytes of data. Therefore I can get by on the smaller offerings – usually under $20/month. Even Azure (the most expensive of the three) offer their burstable VMs. Generally I like to go with <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/development/">Scaleway's Developer line of servers</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Notice that Kubernetes is missing from my stack? When scale is not an issue then you don't need Kubernetes.</strong></em></p><h3 id="docker-just-plain-docker-">Docker. Just plain Docker.</h3><p>I do not rely on the OS vendor (Ubuntu) to make sure that I run the latest Docker on new VMs. Therefore I use the nice little <code>curl|bash</code> technique.</p><pre><code>curl -s https://get.docker.com | sudo bash</code></pre><p>This cure one-liner will get the best and most recent version for your machine running.</p><h3 id="traefik-for-reverse-proxy">Traefik for Reverse Proxy</h3><p>Traefik has been a God-send since I found it. Nginx is great, but it was not built for the Docker universe. Traefik has two killer features that have saved me hours upon hours:</p><ol><li>Automatic TLS with LetsEncrypt. Literally set-it-and-forget-it. With the right API keys and DNS provider you can also do verification with DNS.</li><li>Automatic no-reload configuration using docker labels. When you spin up new services Traefik will pickup the changes automatically because it listens to all Docker-related events. This makes it incredibly convenient to add, remove, or merge services as needed without any hassle.</li></ol><p>My only comment on Traefik is that there is a bit of a learning curve. You have to decide how you want to configure it (config file, command line options, yaml, or docker labels, or use a combination!)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Another note here: I have already <a href="https://www.simplecto.com/traefik-2-0-docker-and-letsencrypt/" title="Traefik 2 production ready configurations">published my production configuations for Traefik</a> here.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="postgres-for-database">Postgres for Database</h3><p>Tried and True, PostgreSQL has never let me down. I usually attach one of these containers to a project that needs it without any difficulty. I simply spin up the container, bind the ports, and then bind the data volume to my host disk. Done and Done.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="dockercomposeyml">docker-compose.yml</h3>
<pre><code>version: '3.1'

services:

  db:
    container_name: postgres
    hostname: postgres
    image: postgres:11
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secretsonly
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - 5432:5432

</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="dockerized-django-for-web">Dockerized Django for Web</h3><p>Docker deploys nicely in a container, and I have been doing it for a few years now. The benefits of matching your development environment to your production one cannot be overstated, and I have Docker to thank for that.</p><p>Edit: 2021, I've got a reference Django project up that I use as my template for new projects: <a href="https://github.com/simplecto/django-reference-implementation">https://github.com/simplecto/django-reference-implementation</a></p><h3 id="django-commands-for-asynchronous-tasks">Django commands for Asynchronous tasks</h3><p>Also, for asynchronous tasks I simply use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-management-commands/">custom Django commands</a> which are a part of the standard framework. The pattern here is a simple <code>while</code> loop with a <code>sleep()</code> period. It polls the database for relevant actions and then does it's thing. &nbsp;</p><p>Edit: 2021 - This has paid off in a big way. I have been running a website screenshot project for over a year now with this pattern. It takes about 1500 website screenshots per day. All of it is scheduled and managed by a Django command.</p><p>That project lives here: https://github.com/simplecto/screenshots</p><h3 id="intercoolerjs-because-who-needs-the-complexity">IntercoolerJS, because who needs the complexity?</h3><p>I have a lot to say about this, but that will have to go into a series of posts. The tldr; here that I use this lovely little javascript library along with jQuery (<em>yeah, it is 2020, and I still use jQuery</em>) to make parts of my applications <em>feel</em> like single-page-apps but not really.</p><p>IntercoolerJS keeps that old-school "Ajax" (remember that word) goodness and allows me to update the DOM with HTML from the backend. It is seamless, smooth, and really convenient for things like logins and small form updates.</p><p>I strongly suggest you check it out: <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">Learn more about IntercoolerJS</a></p><p>Edit 2021: The creator has released <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>, the successor to IntercoolerJS.</p><h3 id="sentry-to-catch-production-errors">Sentry to catch production errors</h3><p>I make mistakes. Lots of mistakes--but there is no need to show them to my users, right? Sentry gives me an easy and convenient way to capture production bugs as they happen. Some cool things about them:</p><ol><li>Open source-ish (<a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry">relicensed here</a>), so you can host yourself if that is your thing.</li><li>Easy few lines added to your <code>settings.py</code> file in Django and that is it.</li><li>Tight integration to your Git repos and Issue tracking systems for full production defect traceability.</li></ol><p>Another nice thing is that you can disable it for development.</p><p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Check out Sentry here</a>.</p><h3 id="bitbucket-pipelines-for-ci-cd">Bitbucket Pipelines for CI/CD</h3><p>Edit: 2021 - I no longer use CI/CD for deployment of my one-man projects. It is too much tooling and complexity. I simply run tests with PyCharm and ship directly to production from my development machine.</p><p>There are so many CI/CD offerings out there today, but I have been happy with Bitbucket's offering called Pipelines. They offer you a few hundred minutes free every month with the option to top-up as needed for a small fee. I have rarely had problems, and I really enjoy their YAML configuraiton / directive files. </p><p>Using the <code>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</code> file I have been able to do full end-to-end testing by spinning up multiple docker containers, loading the databases, and running hundreds of test in just a few minutes. This was key in speeding things up in our team and enabling 5+ pushes to production per day.</p><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Checkout Bitbucket here</a>.</p><h3 id="zerotier-for-vpn-control-plane">ZeroTier for VPN/Control Plane</h3><p>Finally, we come to the bit of tech that is largely optional but nice to have. &nbsp;Zerotier is a unique kind of network/VPN that I use to link all my personal machines. It works though firewalls (at home, in office) and offers an easy 1 minute setup.</p><p>Using ZeroTier in my last company we were able to remove the SSH Jump Servers which caused a headache in terms of key management and shared bandwidth on a single machine.</p><p>Zerotier work on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, and iPhone, so you are pretty much covered.</p><p>The one downside to ZeroTier is that I don't entirely understand how it works. It is a lot like MacOS or iPhone in that it "just works" as expected and I rarely (never) have problems. That is a strength from a user experience perspective but a WTF? from a CTO perspective. </p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Hopefully this deeper-dive will prompt some interest and curiosity about Docker, Django, Traefik, and especially IntercoolerJS. It is simple, easy to work with, and allows you to grow out of it when the time comes.</p><p>Edit 2021 - As you can see not a lot has changed. I've been able to add more code to my public repositories that flesh out the ideas expressed here over a year ago.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One way that some states are combating emissions is by selling a fixed number of pollution permits to power plants. Currently, governments reduce the number or pollution permits by 3% each year to force power plants to find cleaner ways to operate (more efficient power plants, renewable energy, etc.)&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Kotoo allows individuals to help lower emissions faster because permits Kotoo buys become unavailable to power plants, forcing them to reduce their emissions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Imagine the government has a concert venue and it’s throwing a renewable energy benefit concert by a band called Carbon Dioxide (CO2). All the power plants have attended the CO2 concert for decades. Some people want power plants to attend a concert by a new band called Renewable Energy so they buy and shred the tickets to the CO2 concert so that the power plants can’t attend. Since the power plants can’t do without music - they go to the Renewable Energy concert instead. They learn that Renewable Energy is so good (it’s cheaper!) that they never go back to the Carbon Dioxide concert. Eventually all the seats in Carbon Dioxide concert are empty so the band stops playing and shredding tickets is no longer needed.</span></p>

<p><span>While the Renewable Energy fans could just go to the RE concert - buying out the CO2 tickets still builds renewable energy since it’s a benefit concert while also preventing CO2 from being emitted. It ultimately converts old CO2 enthusiasts rather than waiting for Renewable Energy to become so dominant it overtakes CO2.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><a href="https://info.kotoo.earth/hc/en-us/articles/360058439833" target="_self">Why powerplants are the key to climate change</a></span></p>


<p><strong>Details</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Another way to think about emissions is by thinking about fuel because emissions are directly related to fuel burned.* But some powerplants get more electricity out of a given amount of fuel - just like how different cars go different distances on the same amount of fuel. So we can think about power plant emissions just like how you might think about gas mileage - some go further than others but the ones that are more efficient are more expensive.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Let’s say that there was a fixed amount of fuel available every three months. Every three months, everyone shows up to buy the fuel but there's only a set amount available. Since people want more fuel than is available - the government sets up an auction and sells it to the highest bidders.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>People who have less efficient, and therefore cheaper, equipment have more money for fuel but they need to buy more of it. And those that have more efficient equipment need less and may save money even though their equipment cost them more up front.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Over time, the amount of fuel available decreases so if the amount of fuel people require doesn’t change, then the fuel gets more expensive. However, the more expensive the fuel, the more it makes sense for people to upgrade to more efficient machines to save money on fuel or run the risk of not being able to operate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The beauty of this is that everyone can choose an upgrade system that works for them on a time horizon that makes sense for them regardless of what type of fuel they need. And there is more than one option, here are a few:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>they can stop making electricity</span></li>
<li><span>they can operate their power plant more efficiently with the fuel they have</span></li>
<li><span>they can pay for upgrades to their plant to make their fuel go further. This costs money up front but saves them money when they have to buy less fuel.</span></li>
<li><span>they can build a fuel free power plant (aka renewable energy) which also costs money but saves them money on fuel</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Lastly, while all this is happening, the money raised from the auction are spent building new fuel free powerplants and helping people use less electricity - so those that need the fuel are also building a future in which no fuel is needed.</span></p>

<p><span>Kotoo allows individual people to drive this change faster by showing up to the auction and buying permits that we don’t plan to use. This makes less fuel available and increases the price. As prices increase, power plants will save more and more money by making one of the 4 choices above. And as prices increase more and more money is available to build fuel free powerplants.</span></p>

<p><span>*For a certain type of fuel, it is mostly true that a gallon of that fuel will always make the same emissions. Combustion nerds (aka the author) know that it is possible to burn fuels in dirty and clean ways but the analogy holds because technology to burn fuel more cleanly usually costs more money because it is newer. It is also true that different types of fuels create dramatically different amounts of emissions (coal is twice as dirty as natural gas) but more fuel always means more emissions and outside of this analogy, the price is set by emissions so it’s robust to how fuel is burned and what type of fuel is being burned</span></p>

<a href="#comments">17 comments</a></p><p>I start each of my <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/">weekly reviews</a> by re-reading one of my favorite essays of life advice—a different one each week. It’s useful for a few different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It helps me get into the right reflective frame of mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best essays are dense enough with useful advice that I find new interesting bits every time I read them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much good advice is <a href="https://tjcx.me/posts/defense-self-help/" target="_blank">easy to understand, but hard to implement</a>. So to get the most benefit from it, you should find whatever version of it most resonates you and then <em>re-read it frequently</em> to keep yourself on track.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve collected my favorite essays for re-reading below. I’ll keep this updated as I find more great essays, and I’d welcome other contributions—please suggest your own favorites in the comments!</p>
<p>There's a lot of essays here! If you'd like, I can email you one essay every weekend, so you can read it before your weekly review:

<p>Paul Graham, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html" target="_blank">Life is Short</a>. Inspire yourself never to waste time on bullshit again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it’s impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.</p>
<p>Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?</p>
<p>It has for me. It means arguments of the form “Life is too short for x” have great force. It’s not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It’s not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.</p>
<p>When I ask myself what I’ve found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is “bullshit.” I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It’s almost the definition of bullshit that it’s the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There’s something fake about it. It’s the junk food of experience. [1]</p>
<p>If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that’s bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people’s mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve found that unless I’m vigilant, the amount of bullshit in my life only ever increases. Rereading <em>Life is Short</em> every so often gives me a kick in the pants to figure out what <em>really</em> matters and how to get the bullshit levels back down.</p>
<hr>
<p>Derek Sivers, <a href="https://sivers.org/kimo" target="_blank">There is no speed limit</a>, in which he learns a semester’s worth of music theory in an afternoon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within a minute, he started quizzing me. “If the 5-chord with the flat-7 has that tri-tone, then so does another flat-7 chord. Which one?”</p>
<p>“Uh… the flat-2 chord?”</p>
<p>“Right! So that’s a substitute chord. Any flat-7 chord can be substituted with the other flat-7 that shares the same tri-tone. So reharmonize all the chords you can in this chart. Go.”</p>
<p>The pace was intense, and I loved it. Finally, someone was challenging me — keeping me in over my head — encouraging and expecting me to pull myself up quickly. I was learning so fast, it felt like the adrenaline rush you get while playing a video game. He tossed every fact at me and made me prove that I got it.</p>
<p>In our three-hour lesson that morning, he taught me a full semester of Berklee’s harmony courses.</p>

<p>This was one of the major inspirations for <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/">Be impatient</a>. Every time I reread it, I think of at least one thing where I’m setting myself a speed limit for no reason!</p>
<hr>
<p>Sam Altman, <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful" target="_blank">How To Be Successful</a>. Sam might have observed more successful people more closely than anyone else on the planet, and the advice is as good as you’d expect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus is a force multiplier on work.</p>
<p>Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.</p>
<p>… To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are lots of different points here, so this one especially bears rereading!</p>
<hr>
<p>R. W. Hamming, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/bookshelf/hamming.html" target="_blank">You and your research</a>. Hamming observed almost as many great scientists as Sam Altman did founders. He had some interesting conclusions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first I asked what were the important problems in chemistry, then what important problems they were working on, or problems that might lead to important results. One day I asked, “if what they were working on was not important, and was not likely to lead to important things, they why were they working on them?” After that I had to eat with the engineers!</p>
<p>About four months later, my friend stopped me in the hall and remarked that my question had bothered him. He had spent the summer thinking about the important problems in his area, and while had had not changed his research he thought it was well worth the effort. I thanked him and kept walking. A few weeks later I noticed that he was made head of the department. Many years later he became a member of the National Academy of Engineering. The one person who could hear the question went on to do important things and all the others—so far as I know—did not do anything worth public attention.</p>
<p>… Some people work with their doors open in clear view of those who pass by, while others carefully protect themselves from interruptions. Those with the door open get less work done each day, but those with their door closed tend not know what to work on, nor are they apt to hear the clues to the missing piece to one of their “list” problems. I cannot prove that the open door produces the open mind, or the other way around. I only can observe the correlation. I suspect that each reinforces the other, that an open door will more likely lead you and important problems than will a closed door.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>There is another trait that took me many years to notice, and that is the ability to tolerate ambiguity. Most people want to believe what they learn is the truth: there are a few people who doubt everything. If you believe too much then you are not likely to find the essentially new view that transforms a field, and if you doubt too much you will not be able to do much at all. It is a fine balance between believing what you learn and at the same time doubting things. Great steps forward usually involve a change of viewpoint to outside the standard ones in the field.</p>
<p>While you are leaning things you need to think about them and examine them from many sides. By connecting them in many ways with what you already know…. you can later retrieve them in unusual situations. It took me a long time to realize that each time I learned something I should put “hooks” on it. This is another face of the extra effort, the studying more deeply, the going the extra mile, that seems to be characteristic of great scientists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hamming is an unusual combination of (a) a great scientist himself, (b) curious and thoughtful about what makes others great, and (c) honest and open about his observations (it seems).</p>

<p>Anonymous, <a href="https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/" target="_blank">Becoming a Magician</a>—on how to become a person that your current self would perceive as magical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The description was about five or six handwritten pages long, and at the time, it was a manifestation of desperate longing to be somewhere other than where I was, someone who felt free and cared for. At the time I saw that description as basically an impossibility; my life could never be so amazing in reality.</p>
<p>Fast forward about seven or ten years and I rediscovered the description when I was moving old notebooks and journals from one dusty storage spot to another. As I read through it, I discovered that 90% of the statements I had made in that description were true (or true in spirit). … It was incredible to me, despite all the changes that had happened in my life since when I wrote the passage, that I had basically become the person whose life I had dreamed of living as a teenager.</p>
<p>That’s pretty fucking cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>And then came Sanatan Dinda. An Indian visual artist from Kolkata, he didn’t even make the finals the first year he competed, and the next year he placed second with a style that broke half a dozen of the implicit rules of ‘good artwork’ at the competition. … [T]he third year he came he won the entire competition by something like ten percent of the total awarded points over the next artist in second place.</p>
<p>… The thing that confused me though was this – I could not work out how he did it. Like, I had zero mental model of how he created that piece in the same timeframe we all had; how he came up with it, designed it, practiced it. Even though he placed first and I placed fifth and logically we both existed on a scale of ‘competence at bodypainting’ it seemed like the skills required were completely different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exercise they suggest is a really useful activity for weekly (or monthly or yearly) reviews. Highly recommended!</p>

		<p>Philosophically, Replit and Rails are incredibly aligned. We both exist to remove excessive configuration and complexity that stands in the way of building things. However, for a long time, it bothered me that Replit didn't work well with Rails because we focus on small and lightweight projects. Recently, our infrastructure has gotten much more powerful, and I decided to give Rails another spin. It turns out it's not only possible to do Rails on Replit; it's quite a delightful experience. It takes less than 30 seconds from starting a project to seeing the welcome screen:</p>

<p>There is no magic under the hood. You can view the <a href="https://repl.it/@templates/Rails">template here</a>. I merely followed the getting started guide on the rails site and had to do only a couple of modifications to make the development website show up in the iframe on Replit (detailed in the readme file).</p>
<p>Give it a spin, and let me know what you think!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<div><p>The first batch of the repaired Raspberry Pi’s have been sold! If you missed out on this, don’t worry! There are more to come as I repair them. </p><p>I sold a total of 27 Raspberry Pi’s, 3 people cancelled their orders as they somehow thought these were Raspberry Pi 4’s?! I will relist these  during the week along with a few freshly repaired devices with upgraded SD card slots.</p></div>



<p>After ebay fees and P&amp;P the total was £400 which I have donated to the Raspberry Pi Foundation as can be seen below, more will be coming in a future post to show what this money will go towards. </p>

<h2>Replacing and Upgrading Damaged SD Card Slots</h2>



<p>A large amount of the Pi’s had damaged SD card slots, the original slots are made of plastic which was fairly brittle in 2012 when they were released and they really haven’t aged well! </p>

<p>As can be seen on this image the slots have crumbled meaning they no longer hold an SD card. I managed to source the original SD card slots although the seller wanted £2 each for them which just wasn’t worthwhile. I managed to source upgraded metal SD card slots for £0.14p each on aliexpress here: <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012711993.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012711993.html</a></p>



<div><p>Removing the old SD card slot was easy, using a pair of snips I cut as much of the plastic away as possible leaving only the pins to remove. I did this using a soldering iron rather than hot air. </p><p>Installing the new SD card slot was equally as easy, the new slots don’t have the SD card detection switch built in meaning that the detection pads need to be bridged with Solder as can be seen in the image below:</p></div>

<p>Overall this was a very easy repair, I will post some detailed guides or maybe even videos on the repairs once I get through some of the backlog so don’t worry if this repair wasn’t in-depth enough for you. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>This SD card slots arriving from China allows me to repair a further 30 of the damaged Raspberry Pi’s which will be for sale soon – Remember that the profits from these sales goes to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. </p><p>The pace will be slowing down a little once this batch of repairs are complete as I have some upcoming hardware reviews I need to prepare for which will be showcased in future posts. </p></div>



<p>As always please leave a comment and share your thoughts on the repair process. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> has taken a step further to prosecute the US government on the investment ban which resists Americans from investing in the Chinese smartphone maker.</p>
<p>The U.S. Defense and Treasury Departments, is making move to take out the Xiaomi from a list of companies having affiliation with China’s military.</p>
<p>Early in the January, former US President, Donald Trump, had included the company on the Pentagon blacklist which prevents Americans from investing in the tech company. Trump had accused Xiaomi that it has strong ties with the Chinese military. This allegation was later denied. Xiaomi had tried to convince that it is not a “Communist Chinese Military Company”.</p>
<p>Now, in spite of the fact that Trump has been relieved of his office as the president, the investment ban still continues.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-xiaomi-complaint/chinas-xiaomi-files-legal-complaint-against-u-s-defense-treasury-ban-idUSKBN29Z01A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuter</a>, in the complaint, which was addressed to the new Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, Xiaomi has expressed their grief by calling the judgment “unlawful and unconstitutional” and stressed that the company was not being controlled by the China army.</p>
<p>Challenging the ban, Xiaomi has taken the step to sue the US government. An application has now been in the bid to reverse the ban order.</p>
<p>Xiaomi had stressed, in their court filling, should the ban continues the company will face “imminent, severe, and irreparable harm”.</p>
<p>The court filing read:<br>
<em>“This action has challenges the Trump Administration’s unlawful designation on January 14, 2021, of Plaintiff Xiaomi, a consumer electronics company, as a Communist Chinese military company (“CCMC”) subject to Executive Order 13959. As a result of that designation, U.S. persons will no longer be able to purchase publicly traded Xiaomi securities or derivatives of those securities as of March 15, 2021, and must divest their holdings by January 14, 2022. As explained below, the designation of Xiaomi as a CCMC (the “Designation”) is unlawful and should be enjoined. By failing to provide a reasoned explanation for the Designation, and by making a designation decision that necessarily runs counter to any accurate evidence before the agencies, the Departments of Defense and Treasury engaged in arbitrary and capricious decision making, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”),”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>“As relevant here, the Order prohibits transactions by any U.S. persons in publicly traded securities of certain companies that the Department of Defense, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, designates as a “Communist Chinese military company.” President Trump amended Executive Order 13959 on January 13, 2021. Exec. Order No. 13974, 86 Fed. Reg. 4875 (Jan. 13, 2021) (attached as Ex. B). As amended, the Order provides that the prohibitions on transactions of CCMC securities or derivatives of those securities by U.S. persons take effect 60 days after a company is designated,”</em></p>
<p>Xiaomi had earlier disclosed that it been complying with US law and made a confirmation that it’s not owned, controlled or in affiliation with the Chinese military.</p>
<p>More than 70% of the Xiaomi’s voting rights, were held by the co-founders, Lin Bin and Lei Jun, and not owned or controlled by any individual or entity associated with the military.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, I will attempt to convince you that 'awk' is a great tool to learn for solving one-off text manipulation and analysis problems. &nbsp;After learning awk, you'll immediately be accepted into the "10x engineer's club" and be cured of your imposter syndrome. &nbsp;From now on, your typical team meetings will go something like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Manager</strong>: &nbsp;"Hey, let's make a well-informed data-driven decision about which product to focus on selling. &nbsp;Do we have any numbers on which product(s) make the most profit in total?".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>All 1x Engineers in the room</strong> (<em>speaking together in a synchronized monotone voice</em>): "Nah, we'd have to write an ETL job to import the .csv files and write many Java Classes. &nbsp;It would take at least 4 weeks.".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>You</strong>: "I just spent 30 seconds writing an awk one-liner to calculate the profit for each product. &nbsp;Here is the list sorted from highest to lowest."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Manager</strong>: "Thanks. I value your expertise, and have a great appreciation for your contributions to this company."</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awk is a command-line tool that can be used for processing text files line by line. &nbsp;The 'awk' command could be compared to the 'grep' or 'sed' commands. &nbsp;In fact, many of the basic use cases for 'grep' or 'sed' can actually be solved in a nearly identically way by awk. &nbsp;Therefore, an important question worth asking is: &nbsp;If some of the use cases for awk are replicated by 'sed' or 'grep', why would you ever want to use awk? &nbsp;The answer is that awk is a fully-fledged programming language. &nbsp;The 'grep' command is specifically designed for searching, and the 'sed' command is specifically designed for replacing. &nbsp;Awk is able to do both at the same time, but even more importantly, 'awk' gives you access to things that a 'real' programming language has, like math or logic operations, formatted printing, arrays, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you may wonder, if 'awk' acts like a 'real' programming language, why not stick to another established 'real' programming language like Python? &nbsp;The answer is that 'awk' was specifically designed to serve in this middle-ground area of 'sort of command-line' and 'sort of programming language'. &nbsp;It's definitely possible to insert Python into the middle of a shell pipe (with python -c), but it quickly gets pretty messy. &nbsp;Awk, on the other hand, is much better suited for the task, and it includes a <em>lot</em> of default assumptions that make it very terse (but also intimidating to beginners).</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a specific example of a problem that 'awk' can solve, but 'grep' or 'sed' can't. &nbsp;The following file 'temps.csv' contains a list of temperature values:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
78.1	F
23.1	C
25.7	C
76.3	F
77.3	F
24.2	C
79.3	F
27.9	C
75.1	F
25.9	C
79.0	F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these temperature values are stated in Celsius, while other are stated in Fahrenheit. &nbsp;In a case like this, you might want to normalize these values to use the same unit so that you can graph them, or compute an average etc. &nbsp;You can do exactly that with the following 'awk' command:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print ($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1)"\tC"}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives the following output:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
25.6111	C
23.1	C
25.7	C
24.6111	C
25.1667	C
24.2	C
26.2778	C
27.9	C
23.9444	C
25.9	C
26.1111	C
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand how this awk command works, let's work on re-building it from scratch. &nbsp;Here is a much simpler awk command that shows how it will automatically parse and split up the two columns for us so we can work with them separately:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives the following output:</p>

<p><code><pre>First column item: temp Second column item: unit
First column item: 26.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 78.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 23.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 25.7 Second column item: C
First column item: 76.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 77.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 24.2 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 27.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 75.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 25.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.0 Second column item: F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the columns in the original file are separated by white-space, the awk command will automatically split up the 'columns' and make them accessible inside the '$1' and '$2' variables. &nbsp;As you can see, our last example simply prints these out without doing any kind of logic on them. &nbsp;This stuff inside the {...} characters is called the 'action' statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By default (on my machine), awk will attempt to run every single 'action' statement on every line of the file. &nbsp;In our case, we don't actually want our special print statement to run on every line of the file. &nbsp;In particular, we don't want to make changes to the first line, since it's just the list of column headers. &nbsp;We can add the requirement that our special print statement should only occur on 'record number greater than 1', or 'NR&gt;1'. &nbsp;'NR' stands for Number of Record:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR&gt;1{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this won't print out the header <em>at all</em>. &nbsp;To print out the first line without changing it, we can add the statement 'NR==1;' to our awk command. &nbsp;The 'NR==1' part means "Only do this on the record #1", and the ';' part is an empty statement which defaults to printing out the current line without changing it:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the output from this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp unit
First column item: 26.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 78.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 23.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 25.7 Second column item: C
First column item: 76.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 77.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 24.2 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 27.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 75.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 25.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.0 Second column item: F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we're almost back at the full command that we started off with. &nbsp;We just need to add the temperature normalizing part. &nbsp;The logic/math for normalizing to Celsius units would look something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>if<span>(</span><span>$2</span><span>==</span><span>"</span><span>F</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span>{</span>
  <span>print</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>$1</span>-32<span>)</span> / <span>1</span>.<span>8</span> 
<span>}</span><span>else</span><span>{</span>
  <span>print</span><span> </span><span>$1</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or, we could re-write this using the ternary operator as the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>print</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>$2</span><span>==</span><span>"</span><span>F</span><span>"</span><span> ? </span><span>(</span><span>$1</span><span>-32</span><span>)</span><span> / </span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span> : </span><span>$1</span><span>)</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substituting this back into our print statement gives us the full solution that was introduced previously:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print ($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1)"\tC"}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final output that was shown before was not very nice to look at since most of the converted Fahrenheit values had way too many digits after the decimal place. &nbsp;To fix this, we can use the more sophisticated 'printf' to do a formatted print operation and make the output look even better:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f\t%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which outputs the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
25.6	C
23.1	C
25.7	C
24.6	C
25.2	C
24.2	C
26.3	C
27.9	C
23.9	C
25.9	C
26.1	C
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to split up the columns in each line, awk needs to know what the 'field separator' is. &nbsp;The default field separator can be different on different systems or different implementations of awk, but you can often assume it to be 'white-space' for some definition of white-space. &nbsp;You can also explicitly specify it using the '-F' flag. &nbsp;For example, here is the same awk command we just used, but using a comma for the field separator:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f,%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and here it is again with an explicitly specified tab character:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f\t%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field separators can even be regular expressions:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>col1-481-col2-981-col3</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>-[0-9]{3}-</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>{print $1" "$2" "$3}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputs the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>col1 col2 col3
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>False.</strong> &nbsp;Awk is extremely <em>easy</em> to learn. &nbsp;The reason that it <em>seems</em> so hard to learn is because awk has so many implicit defaults, but nobody ever seems to explain this fact.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can think of every awk command as a collection of 'if statements' that run against every line in the file. &nbsp;The syntax of every awk command looks pretty close to something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>if(PATTERN1){...print something...} if(PATTERN2){...print something...} ...</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the one exception beging that the 'if' keyword is never actually written out since it's assumed to be there by default (if you do write it, you'll get a syntax error). &nbsp;Therefore, the overall syntax for every awk command (that doesn't rely on defaults) is pretty much this:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>(PATTERN1){...Action 1...} (PATTERN2){...Action 2...} ...</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above command, the 'PATTERN1' or 'PATTERN2' is the trigger you want to cause the stuff inside the '{' '}' characters to actually execute. &nbsp;Here are a few examples of commonly used patterns:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>hello</span><span>\n</span><span>world</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>(NR==2){print $0}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will output:</p>

<p><code><pre>world
</pre></code>


<code><pre>

<span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>hello</span><span>\n</span><span>there</span><span>\n</span><span>world</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>($0 ~ /l/){print $0}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will output:</p>

<p><code><pre>hello
world
</pre></code>


<code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>acb def</span><span>\n</span><span>something else</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>(length($1) &gt; 5){print $2}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will output:</p>

<p><code><pre>else
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provides some context on what you can do in the 'pattern' part, but what about the 'action' part? &nbsp;Well, you can use your imagination since that's where awk becomes a fully fledged programming language. &nbsp;Here is an example awk command that will iterate over every character in the 3rd column on the 4th line and print out each character on a different line:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>a a a a</span><span>\n</span><span>a a a a</span><span>\n</span><span>a a a a</span><span>\n</span><span>a a hello_there a</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>(NR==4){</span>
<span>  n_chrs = split($3, individual_characters, "")</span>
<span>  for (i=1; i &lt;= n_chrs; i++){</span>
<span>    printf("Here is character number %d : %c\n", i, …</span></pre></code></p></div></div></div>

			<p><em>In this piece, author Jessica Flanigan makes the case that UBI is a better solution than raising the minimum wage, because UBI reaches all workers, paid and unpaid, and would also provide all workers the bargaining power to better choose where and how they want to work. — Scott Santens, Editor, BIT</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm?source=post_page---------------------------">latest jobs report from the BLS</a> reports a sudden acceleration of an ongoing trend of job growth, and unemployment in the US is now around 3.7 percent. Despite these impressive job numbers, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/10/04/if-real-wages-arent-rising-how-is-household-income-going-up/?source=post_page---------------------------">real wages remain low</a> for American workers. Perhaps in light of this, The U.S. House of Representatives passed the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democratic-push-to-raise-minimum-wage-opens-rift-over-amount-of-hike/2019/04/12/05711400-5d2d-11e9-98d4-844088d135f2_story.html?utm_term=.70a79b170fa0&amp;source=post_page---------------------------">Raise the Wage Act</a> this week, which reflects the goal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_for_$15?source=post_page---------------------------">Fight for $15</a> campaign: increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour.</p>
<p>The idea polls well. A <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/426780-poll-a-majority-of-voters-want-a-15-minimum-wage?source=post_page---------------------------">majority of voters</a> support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour as well. And most <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-embrace-a-15-minimum-wage?source=post_page---------------------------">2020 Democratic presidential candidates</a>, including Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, support a $15 federal minimum wage too.</p>
<p>And it may seem that conditions are perfect for changing the federal minimum wage — unemployment is low, and the idea has a lot of support. But it’s worth thinking about proposals for a $15 federal minimum wage not only in light of Americans’ current economic circumstances but also in light of projected changes to the workforce going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>A higher minimum wage may benefit people who have jobs, but it doesn’t make life easier for people who aren’t workers. This is what makes the idea of a Universal Basic Income or Negative Income Tax a more promising route. Essentially, if we are interested in helping those most in need, we should focus on policies that put cash in all people’s pockets instead of just the pockets of hourly employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the advantage of these programs over a $15 minimum wage is that they benefit all citizens and do not disproportionately benefit workers and burden employers. And unlike other costly redistributive policies such as student loan forgiveness and universal healthcare, UBI is better suited to reflect each person’s distinctive circumstances, preferences, and personal values. Below, I outline several reasons why more people should consider the UBI as a viable public policy.</p>
<p>Considering the UBI over the Fight for $15</p>
<p>Overall, the UBI does not rely on maintaining our current economic order in the way that policies that focus on benefiting workers do. This is an advantage because the economy is very likely going to change radically in the next century. Though today’s workers are <a href="http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2019-06-05-49-Of-Workers-Believe-AI-And-Automation-Will-Have-No-Impact-On-Their-Job?source=post_page---------------------------">not very concerned</a> about automation, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17524822/robot-automation-job-threat-what-happens-next?source=post_page---------------------------">economists</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/06/automation-destroy-millions-jobs-change?source=post_page---------------------------">policy experts</a> argue that they should be.</p>
<p>Even if new technology does not cause significant job losses, workplace transformations associated with new technology are likely to have significant <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/04/18/will-robots-and-ai-take-your-job-the-economic-and-political-consequences-of-automation/?source=post_page---------------------------">political and economic consequences</a>. Tying the provision of public benefits to participation in the workforce needlessly raises the stakes of any policy that could change the composition of the workforce, and therefore increases the political and economic risks associated with automation. Moreover, the UBI doesn’t limit its benefits to people who are engaged in paid employment. This has four benefits that a higher minimum wage does not.</p>
<p>First, a UBI would benefit people who do valuable unpaid labor, such as childcare and eldercare, as well as people who are employees.</p>
<p>Second, a UBI would not interfere with workers’ and employers’ freedom to set the terms and conditions of their labor. If it is possible to benefit low-income Americans without restricting their freedom to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment relationships, officials should favor the less restrictive policies.</p>
<p>Third, a UBI would not tie people to their employers. This means that a basic income would potentially enable more economic mobility, enhance workers’ bargaining power, and enable people to stop working if they need to leave the workforce due to disability or caregiving obligations.</p>
<p>Fourth, policies that do not tie assistance to employment would not disproportionately burden employers. The debate over minimum wage increases is often framed as if employers are failing to benefit workers sufficiently. But low-wage work often helps low-skill workers more than anyone else. Without these employment opportunities, they would be even less capable of meeting their basic needs. If the justification for a higher minimum wage is that everyone should be able to support themselves, why should employers bear the full cost of meeting that goal? In contrast, a basic income enables citizens to share the cost of supporting a social safety net rather than treating employers as the only way to achieve it.</p>
<p>A significant benefit of a UBI, in contrast to other recent entitlement reforms such as student loan forgiveness and universal healthcare, is that it doesn’t tell people how to spend it. People have different values, but in-kind benefits assume that all people have the same interest in healthcare or being debt-free. This may be broadly true, but there are tradeoffs. Given the cost of these programs, it’s fair to ask whether people would be better off if we just gave them the money instead. But evidence from developing countries suggests that<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/opinion/let-them-eat-cash.html?source=post_page---------------------------"> cash does help people better than alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>As I see it, the main challenge to a Basic Income proposal is affordability. Estimates vary, and some argue that a UBI would be <a href="https://socialprotection-humanrights.org/resource/universal-basic-income-proposals-in-light-of-ilo-standards-key-issues-and-global-costing-ess-%e2%94%80-working-paper-no-62/?source=post_page---------------------------">catastrophically</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2015/05/23/basically-unaffordable?source=post_page---------------------------">expensive</a> whereas others suggest that it is “<a href="https://medium.com/basic-income/basic-income-is-easily-affordable-8389995528b3?source=post_page---------------------------">easily affordable</a>.” Plausibly, while a UBI would save on administrative costs, it does seem that funding sustainable UBI could require making some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/06/04/of-course-we-can-afford-a-universal-basic-income-do-we-want-one-though/?source=post_page---------------------------#50c7d99f323c">hard choices</a> about other social programs such as healthcare, education, and defense.</p>
<p>The UBI and Social Security</p>
<p>UBI may seem like a radical idea, but there’s a precedent for it in America. Elderly people already receive what is effectively a basic income through Social Security. Some of them continue to work, while others use their basic income (and retirement savings) to pay their bills so that they can focus on spending time with loved ones or pursuing new hobbies. Some elderly people are disabled, and Social Security enables them to leave the workforce.</p>
<p>Yet older voters <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/435278-poll-most-voters-oppose-a-universal-basic-income-programs?source=post_page---------------------------">consistently</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/375587-gallup-poll-americans-split-on-giving-a-universal-basic-income-to-workers?source=post_page---------------------------">oppose</a> Universal Basic Income proposals while younger voters are in favor of it. Even more curiously, older voters <a href="https://www.pollingreport.com/social.htm?source=post_page---------------------------">consistently</a> <a href="https://socialsecurityworks.org/2019/03/26/social-security-polling/?source=post_page---------------------------">oppose</a> cuts to their basic income, Social Security. The difficult position for older voters is that the reasons for opposing a basic income are also reasons to oppose social security. And those who support Social Security should support a basic income as well. Those who oppose the UBI should rethink their support for Social Security. If anything, the case for a UBI is stronger than the case for Social Security because as it is currently structured, <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html?source=post_page---------------------------">Social Security may be a slightly regressive policy</a>, in part <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-mortality-social-security-20180912-story.html?source=post_page---------------------------">because wealthy people live longer.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2014/09/political-authority-and-the-basic-income/?source=post_page---------------------------">Elsewhere</a>, I have argued in favor of a basic income because it is a kind of compensation for the injustices associated with our existing property system. In contrast, minimum wage requirements only compound the injustices of the current system by doubling down on the idea that elevates paid employment over other kinds of potentially valuable work, discourages opportunities for low-skilled workers, and leaves non-workers out of the social safety net. A basic income is more respectful of people’s freedom, more sensitive to recipients’ values, and better suited for a rapidly changing economy.</p>

                            <div>
                                
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The original version of this post highlighted the disadvantages of using a fixed key frame interval. I’ve since learned that this problem can be avoided using intra refresh in the H264 stream.</p>



<p>Streaming media. specifically video, is a fickle beast. This will be a short post, but it will cover everything you need to know to stream media using FFmpeg to WebRTC clients. This technique has many applications, such as streaming synchronized videos to users. </p>



<h2>Setting up the input</h2>



<p>Before inputting a file into FFmpeg, we need to pass a few flags:</p>



<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg \
  -v info \
  -fflags +genpts \
  -protocol_whitelist pipe,tls,file,http,https,tcp,rtp \</code></pre>



<p>These flags set the log level to info, generate pts if they’re missing, and sets up the protocols we can use. Next we need to provide the input to FFmpeg.</p>



<pre><code>-i in.mp4</code></pre>



<p>In this example, a file name <code>in.mp4</code> is used, but a http(s) URL could also be used. This command starts playback at the beginning of the input file. If you want to start playback in the middle of the input file, then you can add the <code>-ss &lt;time in secs&gt;</code> flag <strong>before</strong> <code>-i</code>.</p>



<h2>Video arguments</h2>



<p>Now the video needs to be converted to an appropriate format for streaming. The format is specific to the application, but common codecs are H264, VP8, and VP9. This example uses H264 due to its ubiquitous support.</p>



<pre><code>-vf realtime,scale=w=min(iw\,1280):h=-2 \
-map 0:v:0 \
-c:v libx264 \
-x264-params intra-refresh=1,fast-pskip=0
-threads 3 \
-profile:v baseline \
-level:v 3.1 \
-pix_fmt yuv420p \
-tune zerolatency \
-minrate 500K \
-maxrate 1.3M \
-bufsize 500K \</code></pre>



<p><code>-vf</code> specifies the video filters to apply. Here, two filters are applied. The first is <code>realtime</code>, which causes playback to happen in real time, which is necessary for streaming. This filter is similar to the <code>-re</code> flag, but works much better with the start time flag (<code>-ss</code>). The second filter scales the video width to a maximum of 1280 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio. This is important to keep the bitrate appropriate for real time streaming. </p>



<p>The <code>intra-refresh</code> parameter allows users to consume the video stream mid-way through by providing enough metadata over multiple inter frames to decode a full frame. The <code>fast-pskip=0</code>is required for <code>intra-refresh</code> to work if the source video files contains very few frames, which can happen if the video displays static images for long periods of time. There may be another way around this, but I’m not aware of it. </p>



<p>Another important parameter is the <code>-threads 3</code> flag. FFmpeg will use many threads by the default. Normally, this is good because it produces the final result as fast as possible. For real time encoding, however, using a large number of threads has some overhead that can slow down real time output. Using many threads is also a bad idea if you’re running multiple instances of FFmpeg concurrently.</p>



<p>The next two parametrs <code>-profile:v</code> and <code>-level:v</code> specify the profile and level to use for the encoding. These are specific to H264. WebRTC clients can only decode certain profiles and levels, so these need to match the specific configuration of the application. These roughly correspond to the profile-level-id of <code>42e01f</code>. </p>



<p>The pixel format is set to <code>yuv420p</code> using the <code>-pix_fmt</code> flag. This is required as this is the only pixel format supported by WebRTC. <code>-tune zerolatency</code> tunes the encoder for low latency streaming.</p>



<p>Next up are the bitrate parameters. When streaming media, the bitrate should be as low as possible while maintaining the desired quality. This ensures all clients can consume the video in real time. Omitting the <code>-minrate</code> parameter can cause FFmpeg to produce output with an unnecessarily high bitrate. Setting the <code>-maxrate</code> is equally important. A DSL connection can only pull down around 2 Mbps. In order for users to watch the video, they must be able to download it in real time, so the maximum bitrate has to be lower than the slowest connection among your users. Another consideration is that the streaming video might not be the only bandwidth consuming task on the user’s network.</p>



<h2>Audio arguments</h2>



<p>The audio arguments are much simpler.</p>



<pre><code>-af arealtime \
-map 0:a:0 \
-c:a libopus \
-ab 128k \
-ac 2 \
-ar 48000 \</code></pre>



<p>The main thing to note here is that the <code>arealtime</code> filter is used, which is similar to the <code>realtime</code> filter, but for audio.</p>



<h2>Output arguments</h2>



<p>The output can be piped to an RTP endpoint using the <code>tee</code> psuedomuxer. Unfortunately, FFmpeg does not support multiplexing over RTP, so you’ll need two separate RTP endpoints, one for the video stream and one for the audio stream. </p>



<pre><code>-f tee \
[select=a:f=rtp:ssrc=1111:payload_type=&lt;audio-payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;audio-ip&gt;:&lt;audio-port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;audio-rtcpport&gt;|[select=v:f=rtp:ssrc=2222:payload_type=&lt;video-payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;video-ip&gt;:&lt;video-port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;video-rtcpport&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Now you can stream video over RTP! The full command is</p>



<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg \
  -v info \
  -fflags +genpts \
  -protocol_whitelist pipe,tls,file,http,https,tcp,rtp \
  -i in.mp4
  -vf realtime,scale=w=min(iw\,1280):h=-2 \
  -map 0:v:0 \
  -c:v libx264 \
  -x264-params intra-refresh=1,fast-pskip=0
  -threads 3 \
  -profile:v baseline \
  -level:v 3.1 \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -tune zerolatency \
  -minrate 500K \
  -maxrate 1.3M \
  -bufsize 500K \
  -af arealtime \
  -map 0:a:0 \
  -c:a libopus \
  -ab 128k \
  -ac 2 \
  -ar 48000 \
  -f tee \
  [select=a:f=rtp:ssrc=1111:payload_type=&lt;payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;rtcpport&gt;|[select=v:f=rtp:ssrc=2222:payload_type=&lt;payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;rtcpport&gt;</code></pre>

  </p>


<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I recently switched my home office to a 2-by-4K HiDPI setup, like so:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hidpi-setup.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hidpi-setup.jpg" alt="A picture of my home office."></a></p>

<p>As part of that switch, I needed to configure parts of my Linux environment (which was originally
stock Ubuntu, but is now <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> with a heavily customized userspace) to function
correctly on HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>This post will document most of the changes I applied. Hopefully others will find it useful for
their own HiDPI setups.</p>

<h2 id="90-of-the-way-x11-resources">90% of the way: X11 resources</h2>

<p>As it turns out, there’s a (nearly) one-stop location for configuring the default DPI for
X11 applications: the <code>Xft.dpi</code> setting.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to configure X11, but I personally use an <code>~/.Xresources</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>Xft</span>.<span>dpi</span>: <span>163</span>
<span># not used directly; more on this later
</span><span>janus</span>.<span>fractionalDpi</span>: <span>1</span>.<span>63</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code>163</code> and <code>1.63</code> are my DPI and its fractional form, respectively.</p>

<p>On my system, <code>~/.Xresources</code> gets loaded into the X resource database automatically by some
magic that I never configured. However, if yours doesn’t (or you use a different resource file),
you can always tell i3 (or your WM of choice) to load it explicitly with <code>xrdb</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in <code>~/.config/i3/config</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>exec</span> <span>--no-startup-id</span> xrdb ~/.Xresources
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With just this, about 90% of my applications (including GTK based ones, like Firefox) scaled
correctly and were usable without any font or custom scaling changes. Not bad for a single line!</p>

<h2 id="per-application-fixes">Per-application fixes</h2>

<h3 id="spotify">Spotify</h3>

<p>Spotify’s Linux application is a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/">CEF</a>
shell. For reasons that are unclear to me, it doesn’t respect <code>Xft.dpi</code> while normal Chromium
(via <code>snap</code> or <code>apt</code>) does.</p>

<p>To get it to scale correctly, I needed to pass <code>--force-device-scale-factor=1.63</code> to it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>spotify <span>--force-device-scale-factor</span><span>=</span>1.63
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, it became clear to me that the fractional form of my DPI would be nice to set in
as few places as possible, to avoid duplication. Hence the <code>janus.fractionalDpi</code><sup id="fnref:hostname" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hostname">1</a></sup> above,
and
<a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/spotify">this little <code>spotify</code> wrapper</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span># see the actual script linked above for some program-finding stupidity</span>
<span>real_spotify</span><span>=</span>/snap/bin/spotify

<span># grab the correct fractional DPI from the X resource DB</span>
<span>dpi</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>xrdb <span>-query</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>hostname</span><span>)</span><span>.fractionalDpi"</span> | <span>cut</span> <span>-f2</span><span>)</span>
<span>"</span><span>${</span><span>real_spotify</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>--force-device-scale-factor</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dpi</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> as my primary editor. As far as I can tell
it doesn’t use either GTK or Qt (or any other open-source GUI framework), which is probably why
it doesn’t respect <code>Xft.dpi</code>.</p>

<p>To get Sublime Text to scale correctly, I had to set <code>ui_scale</code> to the appropriate fractional DPI
in my user preferences (<code>~/.config/sublime-text-3/Preferences.sublime-settings</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"ui_scale"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.63</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some lingering pain points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sublime Text’s input is noticeably laggy when the UI is scaled. It’s not so laggy as to be
unusable, but it’s definitely noticeable even if you aren’t sensitive to latencies (I’m not).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mousing between Sublime Text and other windows causes noticeable stutter/hiccuping during
video playback. I haven’t dug into the X events yet, but my guess is that it’s got some kind
of pessimistic (and serial) <code>XFlush</code> or <code>XSync</code> that takes a decent bit of time on a larger window
buffer. It doesn’t happen with smaller windows (either floating or fixed).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="open-broadcaster-software-obs">Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)</h3>

<p>I haven’t used it recently, but I used to use <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> to stream myself
working on open source projects.</p>

<p>When I switched monitors, I noticed that the embedded preview window for my scenes had stopped
working. OBS <em>itself</em> was still fully functional and the <em>separate</em> preview window still worked,
but the embedded preview was always filled in with black pixels.</p>

<p>After a decent bit of hair-pulling, I found a Qt environment variable that “fixed” it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR</span><span>=</span>0 obs
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I still don’t understand why that fixed it, but now my OBS is scaled correctly <strong>and</strong> has a
functional preview embed. I also posted this fix to the
<a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/bug-fix-black-preview-embed-window-on-linux-w-hidpi-monitors.135041/">OBS forum</a>.</p>

<h3 id="feh">feh</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/derf/feh"><code>feh</code></a> as my image viewer. By default, it seems to use
a bitmap font that’s incredibly small on HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>To fix it, I modified by default theme to use my distro supplied Ubuntu Roman-face font in
14pt.</p>

<p>In <code>~/.config/feh/themes</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>feh <span>--borderless</span> <span>--scale-down</span> <span>--conversion-timeout</span> 1 <span>\</span>
  <span>--fontpath</span> /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu <span>--menu-font</span> Ubuntu-R/14
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>One thing I haven’t figured out: when I open some higher-resolution images in <code>feh</code>, they’re
occasionally shifted to the right with transparent pixels where some of the image should be.
Clicking and dragging inside the image window causes it to re-render correctly, as does
resizing the window. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying.</p>

<h3 id="dunst">dunst</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://dunst-project.org/"><code>dunst</code></a> as my notification daemon.</p>

<p>It didn’t <strong>need</strong> any HiDPI-specific configuration, but I took the opportunity to make its
notifications slightly more readable on these newer displays.</p>

<p>In <code>~/.config/dunst/dunstrc</code> (among many other settings):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>monitor</span> = <span>0</span>
<span>follow</span> = <span>mouse</span>
<span>geometry</span> = <span>"600x120-30+20"</span>
<span>icon_position</span> = <span>left</span>
<span>max_icon_size</span> = <span>64</span>
<span>icon_path</span> = /<span>usr</span>/<span>share</span>/<span>icons</span>/<span>gnome</span>/<span>64</span><span>x64</span>/<span>status</span>/:/<span>usr</span>/<span>share</span>/<span>icons</span>/<span>gnome</span>/<span>64</span><span>x64</span>/<span>devices</span>/
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="other-bits">Other bits</h2>

<h3 id="mouse-acceleration">Mouse acceleration</h3>

<p>My new displays are individually larger and significantly more dense than my previous ones, making
my mouse feel sluggish. I originally configured my mouse acceleration with
<a href="https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man1/xset.1.html"><code>xset</code></a>, but at some point my
system switched to <code>libinput</code> and <code>libinput</code>-based inputs apparently don’t respect <code>xset</code> anymore
(or never did?). Sigh.</p>

<p>The fix is to use <code>xinput</code> instead, with either symbolic names or XIDs for the device and setting
being controlled. For example, this is what I use to set my mouse’s acceleration to the maximum
(<code>1.0</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>xinput <span>--set-prop</span> <span>"USB Optical Mouse"</span> <span>"libinput Accel Speed"</span> 1.0
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your device and setting names may vary, of course, as may their value ranges (mine happened to be
<code>0.0</code> to <code>1.0</code>). You can use <code>xinput</code> on its own to list the names and XIDs of your devices;
<code>xinput list-props &lt;XID-or-name&gt;</code> can be used to dump a particular device’s properties and
their current values.</p>

<h3 id="i3-workspaces">i3 workspaces</h3>

<p>I use i3’s <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html">layout saving/restoring</a> functionality
to automatically load all of my workspaces and their applications when I log in.</p>

<p>Those layouts are stored in a (relaxed) JSON format via <code>i3-save-tree</code>, and contain hardcoded
coordinates. To update them for my new monitors, I just had to recreate each of my workspaces
once on my new monitors and dump them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span># for each workspace (1A, 1B, ...)</span>
i3-save-tree <span>--workspace</span> 1A <span>&gt;</span> ~/.config/i3/workspaces/1A.json
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…and then fix them up manually to enable the appropriate application swallowing rules.</p>

<h3 id="hexchat">HexChat</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/index.html">HexChat</a> for IRC.</p>

<p>HexChat’s config file includes individual offsets for each of the sub-panes in the GUI,
which means that it breaks badly if you change your monitor dimensions. I couldn’t figure out
how to fix them, so I ended up deleting my main <code>~/.config/hexchat/hexchat.conf</code> entirely and
recreating my preferred layout from memory. YMMV.</p>

<h3 id="system-icons">System icons</h3>

<p>I didn’t have to make any changes with respect to my system icon sizes, which is <em>probably</em>
because I actually see very few icons during normal i3 usage. Once again, YMMV.</p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Switching from a set of 3 FHD monitors to two 4K HiDPI ones was <em>relatively</em> painless. The
problems that I had, unsurprisingly, were primarily with the few proprietary applications I use
needing to be spoon-feed DPI information in their own ways — every other problem was
either a bug (OBS + Qt) or a matter of more general reconfiguration.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody" role="main"><p>A reflection on Ram Dass’ 1971 classic, <em>Be Here Now</em>, and the book’s connection to information and our state of being.</p>

<p>Like many who walk the hallways of elite institutions, Ram Dass’ life intersected with influential mid-century thinkers and doers. His most famous collaborator might have been Timothy Leary in the early 1960s. Their landmark studies of psychedelic drugs lead to his dismissal from Harvard in 1963.</p>
<p>Ram Dass’ association with David Padwa is of more immediate interest to me. Padwa established a company called Basic Systems and became a millionaire by the time he met the young author in the late 1960s.<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>From David Padwa’s <a href="http://www.cuke.com/people/padwa.htm">Curriculum Vitae</a>: “1960-1965. Founder and CEO of Basic Systems Inc.&nbsp;Principal offices in Cambridge, New York, Chicago, Pasadena, and Washington, DC. Firm specialized in educational and curricular technologies as well as the provision of systems integration services in education and training markets. In 1964 Xerox Corporation acquired Basic Systems; continued as division executive at Xerox and Director of Planning for educational markets.”</span></span> Basic Systems automated employee training and student education, often integrating into an institution’s existing computer infrastructure.</p>
<p>The company caught the eye of Xerox Corporation and was soon acquired. It fit nicely with Xerox’s growing digital portfolio. As the copier company sought to establish the office of the future, it would soon acquire the influential minicomputer manufacturer <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/minicomputers/11/340">Scientific Data Systems</a> and establish the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://schmud.de/img/2020-12-16-be-here-now/karateka-2.png" alt="Karateka Atari 7800 (1988)"> <em>Karateka</em> Atari 7800 (1988) <i></i> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/images/thing/77183/karateka-1984">Board Game Geek</a>
</figure>
<p>Padwa founded Basic Systems with the influential psychologist Francis Mechner. I was first exposed to Francis Mechner as a child playing <em>Karateka</em> (1984) on my Atari 7800<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>The original version was written by Jordan Mechner and published by Broderbund in 1984. The Atari 7800 version was written by Jack Sandberg, Sr.&nbsp;at Ibid Inc.&nbsp;and published by Atari in 1987.</span></span> and then later <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) on my family’s PC. Francis Mechner was the composer for these games, both written by his son <a href="http://jordanmechner.com/">Jordan Mechner</a>. The elder Mechner is something of a renaissance man: starting several successful businesses, speaking five languages, publishing cross-disciplinary theoretical insights, performing as a concert pianist, and achieving a 5-dan rating in Go.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Padwa and Mechner’s company also published the <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=TnVYAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">original edition</a> of “Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess” in 1966. The best-selling book is still in print today.</span></span></p>
<p>These characters provide a sampling of the environment that nurtured Ram Dass. He would soon leave these comforts to join Padwa and his Land Rover on a road trip from Tehran to India in search of a spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>Ram Dass ultimately stayed in India for some time (as did Padwa’s Land Rover), leading to the insights that birthed the book <em>Be Here Now</em>. This book’s influence is without question. It was a significant contributor to the American counterculture movement and a starting point for many Western practitioners of Buddhism and Yoga.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://schmud.de/img/2020-12-16-be-here-now/be-here-now.webp" alt="Be Here Now by Ram Dass (1971)"> <em>Be Here Now</em> by Ram Dass (1971) <i></i> <a href="https://www.gardenfairyco.com/product/be-here-now-ram-dass">Garden Fairy Co.</a>
</figure>
<p>Ram Dass spends the first part of the book describing his journey. It involves a dive into the world of psychedelic drugs and their benefits and limitations. His experience essentially opens him up to Eastern mysticism. He finds surprisingly few charlatans on the road through Central Asia and India. The book’s pivotal guru broadens Ram Dass’ mind through a process of “no teaching” because “his lessons aroused in me just affirmation… as if I knew it all already.”</p>
<p>The author strikes an important difference between <em>teacher</em> and <em>guru</em>. “A teacher points the way” while “a guru is the way.” Ram Dass’ awakening, and this book, is the result of the guru’s care.</p>
<p>This leads to a beautifully illustrated but overtly dogmatic section where Ram Dass attempts wake the reader up. The writer’s intention is rooted in Buddhism’s long practice of shifting the practitioner’s habitual and unquestioned perception of the world.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>The guru offers a few clever turns of phrases in this effort, “If a pickpocket meets a saint, he sees only his pockets” and “If you wear shoe leather, the whole earth is covered with leather.”</span></span> Ram Dass’ spiritual youth feels most pronounced here. He doesn’t have the language of a guru or a teacher; it is the voice of an enthusiastic lecturer who is convinced that he has uncovered the Truth.</p>
<p>The final section of the book is a collection of quotes and techniques divided into various “ingredients for a sacred life” such as <em>Sleeping</em>, <em>Truth</em>, <em>Time and Space</em>, <em>Pranayam</em>, etc…. It is pleasant reading.</p>
<p>Ram Dass makes it clear that there can be no <em>knower</em> if one truly wants to <em>know</em> the wisdom contained in <em>Be Here Now</em>; the rational mind that separates <em>subject</em> from <em>object</em> is an illusion.<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>(Loc. 4594, 4613)</span></span> This illusion is driven by an attachment to the self as special and wholly separate from everything else.</p>

<figure>

</figure>
<p>Deep within the cartridge of <em>Karateka</em> on the Atari 7800 are a list of instructions that drive the machine. But the programmer did mix in one human-readable message with the computer code: “Mommy and Me Are One.” This bizarre statement is unique to the Atari 7800 cartridge. It does not appear in other versions. It never appears on screen. It is only visible to those who are looking at the code contained within.<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>“<a href="https://www.digitpress.com/eastereggs/78karateka.htm">Digital Press Easter Eggs: Karateka</a>”, <em>digitpress.com</em>, 2010.</span></span></p>
<p>The phrase is almost certainly related to a paper published by Lloyd Silverman and Joel Weinberger in a 1985 edition of <em>American Psychologist</em> entitled “<a href="https://content.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.40.12.1296">Mommy and I Are One: Implications For Psychotherapy</a>”. The authors assert that the titular message can help motivate people even when stated subliminally.</p>
<p>Countless studies have attempted to demonstrate the benefits of “oneness.” In the case of the mother, oneness is self-evident. We were all physically connected at one point. And deep within us exists a DNA code that has been directly passed from mother to child for millennia. This is the ancient information that sets the foundation for consciousness.</p>
<p>The reality of a consciousness larger than ourselves is at the root of <em>Be Here Now.</em> But rather than establish a God or a single methodology, Ram Dass continually asserts that the ego blinds us to the grand web of connections that pervade our everyday experience. The way to lift the veil is to simply practice living in the moment. Or as Suzuki Roshi is quoted, “a Zen student must learn to waste time conscientiously.”<span><label for="sn-6"></label><span>(Loc. 4728)</span></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/russia">Russia</a>‘s parliament, is looking at placing fines on individuals and companies in the country who use Western-based satellite Internet services. The bill, if passed into law, is to avoid access to the Internet using <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/spacex">SpaceX</a>‘s Starlink service, OneWeb, or other network means aside Russian satellite constellations under development.</p>
<p>in the Russian edition of Popular Mechanics</p>
<p>According to a recent report , the proposed fines is ranging from 10-30 thousand rubles ($135-$405) for ordinary users, and from 500 thousand to 1 million rubles ($6,750 to $13,500) for companies who make use of the Western satellite services.</p>
<p>In response to the news, Elon Musk has responded to the tweet with “We’re just trying to get people to Mars. Help would be appreciated”</p>
<p>Members of the Duma believe that accessing the Internet freely would skip the country’s System of Operational Search Measures, which is monitoring Internet usage and mobile communications..<br>
Being part of the Russia’s strict control on media and communications, all Russian Internet traffic are compelled to navigate via a Russian communications provider.</p>
<p>Russia may, over time, however, block Starlink service. Dmitry Rogozin, Russia;s Space chief sees SpaceX as a chief competitor in spaceflight.</p>
<p>Starlink, Rogozin had said in August 2020 that it’s part of “a rather marauding, strong, high-technology policy of the United States, which makes use of Shock and Awe so as to improve, ahead of other, their military interests.</p>
<p>The ban on OneWeb is rather funny, with the notion that the company uses the Russian Soyuz rocket to launch almost all of its fist constellation into orbit. Every month, OneWeb satellite launches are planned, mainly from spaceports in Baikonur, Kazahkstan, and Vostochny, Russia. OneWeb is effectively assisting to shore the striving Russian launch industry in a period when SpaceX is undersell the country on commercial launch agreements.</p>
<p>Russia has it in plan to design its own satellite internet constellation, Sfera. While its affordability is yet to stand, it is most likely to be launched in 2024, according to IntelliNews. Expected cost of the project is about 1.5 trillion rubles (around $20 billion), it would supposedly allow the Russia to effectively monitor domestic internet traffic,</p>

          <div>
            <p>PostgreSQL comes with a plethora of configuration options, but changing the
default settings of some of these options drastically improves the observability
of your PostgreSQL server. You’ll want to set and configure these options before
issues crop up in production, as they can provide information essential to
understanding and resolving those issues.</p>

<p>Read on to learn more about the settings and extensions that expose metrics and
information about the inner workings of your PostgreSQL server.</p>

<h3 id="log-line-prefix">Log Line Prefix</h3>

<p>The <em>log_line_prefix</em> configuration option determines what PostgreSQL writes at
the beginning of each log line. The default depends on the specific Linux
distribution or managed solution that you’re using, but more often than not it
does not include a few items that can prove very useful in tracking down
misbehaving clients. Try this <em>log_line_prefix</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_line_prefix</span> <span>=</span> <span>'%m [%p] %a %u %d %h '</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It includes the timestamp (<em>%m</em>), the PID of the backend process (<em>%p</em>), the
application name (<em>%a</em>) of the client, the username which the client has connected
with (<em>%u</em>), the database which the client has connected to (<em>%d</em>) and the
hostname or IP where the connection is coming from (<em>%h</em>). This results in log
lines like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="none">2021-01-30 05:06:03.675 UTC [73] psql postgres bench 172.17.0.1 ERROR:  relation "pgbench_akkounts" does not exist at character 15
2021-01-30 05:06:03.675 UTC [73] psql postgres bench 172.17.0.1 STATEMENT:  select * from pgbench_akkounts;</code></pre></figure>

<p>which are much more useful than the default. You can see that a client connected
from <em>172.17.0.1</em> as user <em>postgres</em> to database <em>bench</em>, and the application
was <em>psql</em>. Definitely an improvement over the default option, which shows
only this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 05:13:22.630 UTC [63] ERROR:  relation "pgbench_akkounts" does not exist at character 15
2021-01-30 05:13:22.630 UTC [63] STATEMENT:  select * from pgbench_akkounts;</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="logging-slow-queries">Logging Slow Queries</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL can be configured to log queries that take more than a set amount
of time to execute. These go into the same log file; there is no separate
slow query log file as in MySQL.</p>

<p>To log statements that take more than 1 second to execute, use the
<em>log_min_duration_statement</em> option like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_min_duration_statement</span> <span>=</span> <span>1s</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that <em>log_min_duration_statement</em> will consider all statements (including
for example, long-running admin statements like <em>REINDEX TABLE</em>) and not just
queries (<em>SELECT</em>). Here are some log entries produced by this option:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 08:42:57.473 UTC [62] psql postgres postgres 172.17.0.1 LOG:  duration: 1016.283 ms  statement: select pg_sleep(1);
2021-01-30 08:52:00.541 UTC [62] psql postgres postgres 172.17.0.1 LOG:  duration: 1118.277 ms  statement: select pg_sleep(1.1);</code></pre></figure>

<p>If this results in too many logs of similar statements, you can tell Postgres to
log only a percentage of it, using:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_min_duration_statement</span> <span>=</span> <span>-1</span>
<span>log_min_duration_sample</span> <span>=</span> <span>1s</span>
<span>log_statement_sample_rate</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.25</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This logs only 25% of the statements that become eligible for logging (the ones
that took more than 1 second to execute). The log output is the same as before.
There is no way to know how many eligible statements were not logged.</p>

<p>To log all statements, along with the time taken to execute them, use the
<em>log_statement</em> option instead:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_statement</span> <span>=</span> <span>mod</span>
<span>log_duration</span> <span>=</span> <span>on</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The ‘mod’ option tells Postgres to log DDLs and data-modifying statements. This
results in logs like these:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 08:35:08.985 UTC [64] pgbench postgres bench 172.17.0.1 LOG:  statement: insert into pgbench_tellers(tid,bid,tbalance) values (10,1,0)
2021-01-30 08:35:08.985 UTC [64] pgbench postgres bench 172.17.0.1 LOG:  duration: 0.241 ms</code></pre></figure>

<p>Be warned that it is <em>not</em> possible to sample statement logging enabled this way,
all statements will be logged, and you’ll end up with tons of log entries.</p>

<h3 id="logging-locks-and-deadlocks">Logging Locks and Deadlocks</h3>

<p>Queries can wait too long to acquire a lock. Typically, an upper limit on how
long to wait is set using the option <em>lock_timeout</em>, usually at the client side.
If a query has been waiting this long to acquire a lock, Postgres will cancel
the execution of this query and log an error:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 09:35:52.415 UTC [67] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 ERROR:  canceling statement due to lock timeout
2021-01-30 09:35:52.415 UTC [67] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 STATEMENT:  cluster t;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s say you want to set a lock timeout of 1 minute, but log queries that
wait for locks for more than, say 30 seconds. You can do this using:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_lock_waits</span> <span>=</span> <span>on</span>
<span>deadlock_timeout</span> <span>=</span> <span>30s</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will create logs like this:</p>

<p>The use of <em>deadlock_timeout</em> is not a typo: it is the value that the lock wait
logging mechanism uses. Ideally, there should have been something like <em>log_min_duration_lock_wait</em>,
but unfortunately, that is not the case.</p>

<p>In case of actual deadlocks, Postgres will abort the deadlocked transactions
after <em>deadlock_timeout</em> duration, and will log the offending statements. No
explicit configuration is necessary.</p>

<h3 id="logging-autovacuums">Logging Autovacuums</h3>

<p>The autovacuum process kicks in when Postgres determines the data in a table
has changed sufficiently to warrant a vacuum and analyze. To keep an eye on
this process, enable the logging of autovacuum runs:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_autovacuum_min_duration</span> <span>=</span> <span>250ms</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here is a sample entry that was caused by excessive changes to one table:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 10:23:33.201 UTC [63]     LOG:  automatic vacuum of table "postgres.public.t": index scans: 0
        pages: 0 removed, 95 remain, 0 skipped due to pins, 0 skipped frozen
        tuples: 8991 removed, 10000 remain, 0 are dead but not yet removable, oldest xmin: 492
        buffer usage: 215 hits, 4 misses, 4 dirtied
        avg read rate: 1.885 MB/s, avg write rate: 1.885 MB/s
        system usage: CPU: user: 0.01 s, system: 0.00 s, elapsed: 0.01 s
        WAL usage: 244 records, 1 full page images, 67984 bytes
2021-01-30 10:23:33.222 UTC [63]     LOG:  automatic analyze of table "postgres.public.t" system usage: CPU: user: 0.01 s, system: 0.00 s, elapsed: 0.01 s</code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that autovacuum will typically trigger an analyze after the vacuum, and
this will also be logged.</p>

<p>These logs will help you figure out how best to tune the autovacuum parameters,
and will help in investigating if and when autovacuum is not being as effective
as you thought it would be.</p>

<h3 id="logging-checkpoints">Logging Checkpoints</h3>

<p>Checkpointing is the process of pushing WAL-logged changes into the actual files
that back tables. Ideally checkpoints should occur at regular-and-not-too-frequent
intervals, as it is a CPU and disk intensive process. For various reasons,
checkpoints are also forced to happen before the next scheduled time, and this
results in reduced query performance.</p>

<p>To keep an eye on checkpoint frequency and efficiency, enable logging of
checkpoints:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_checkpoints</span> <span>=</span> <span>on</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This tells PostgreSQL to log the following whenever a checkpoint occurs:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 10:05:57.085 UTC [56]     LOG:  checkpoint starting: immediate force wait
2021-01-30 10:05:57.159 UTC [56]     LOG:  checkpoint complete: wrote 0 buffers (0.0%); 0 WAL file(s) added, 0 removed, 0 recycled; write=0.000 s, sync=0.000 s, total=0.074 s; sync files=0, longest=0.000 s, average=0.000 s; distance=0 kB, estimate=0 kB</code></pre></figure>

<p>The first line contains the flags that backend passed to the checkpointer. You
can see that the “force” caused a checkpoint even though there were no pending
changes to checkpoint. If “immediate” had not been specified, the checkpointer
would have checkpointed up to <em>checkpoint_completion_target</em>.</p>

<h3 id="other-server-side-settings">Other Server-Side Settings</h3>

<p>There are a couple of other settings that you can turn on in your PostgreSQL
configuration that will help with diagnosing issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>track_io_timing</em> - setting this to <em>on</em> lets you see the time spent in
disk I/O for each query (combined with pg_stat_statements extension
described below). See <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html#GUC-TRACK-IO-TIMING">the docs</a>
about a caveat to turning this on, but should be safe on nearly any modern
Linux. Seeing a query’s disk I/O cost is impossible without turning this on.</li>
  <li><em>track_commit_timestamp</em> - setting this to <em>on</em> can be useful in debugging
replication lags and other replication-related …</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

In fact, they are commonly used as the standard approach, despite that they are a perilous area full of dicey pitfalls. Especially regarding how these linear combinations make your algorithm hard to tune.</p><p>Therefore, in this post we hope to lay out the following arguments:</p><ul><li>A lot of problems in machine learning should be treated as multi-objective problems, while they currently are not.</li><li>This lack of multi-objective treatment leads to difficulties in tuning the hyper-parameters for these machine learning algorithms.</li><li>It is nigh on impossible to detect when these problems are occurring, making it tricky to work around them.</li><li>There are methods to solve this which might be slightly involved, but do not require more than a few lines of code. <a href="https://engraved.ghost.io/how-we-can-make-machine-learning-algorithms-tunable">One of these methods is laid out in a follow-up blog post.</a></li></ul><p>Nothing of this article is novel. You might already be aware of everything we wanted to say. However, we have the impression that most machine learning curricula do not discuss optimisation methods very well (I know mine did not), and consequently, gradient descent is being treated as the one method to solve all problems. And the general message is that if an algorithm does not work for your problem, you need to spend more time tuning the hyper-parameters to your problem. </p><p><a href="https://engraved.ghost.io/how-we-can-make-machine-learning-algorithms-tunable">In the next blog post, a solution is introduced</a>, based on the NIPS’88 paper which introduced the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers.</p><p>So we hope that this blogpost can remove some confusion on how to handle this issue in a more foundational and principled way. And hey, maybe it can make you spend less time tuning your algorithms, and more time making research progress.</p><h2 id="linear-combinations-of-losses-are-everywhere">Linear combinations of losses are everywhere</h2><p>While there are single-objective problems, it is common for these objectives to be given additional regularisation. We have picked a selection of such optimisation objectives from across the field of machine learning field.</p><p>First off, we have the regularisers, weight decay and lasso. It is obvious that when you add these regularisations, you effectively have created a multi-objective loss for your problem. After all, what you really care about, is that both the original loss \(L_0\) and the regulariser loss are kept low. And you will tune the balance between the two using a \(\lambda\) parameter.</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = L_0(\theta) + \lambda \sum \left| \theta \right| $$</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = L_0(\theta) + \lambda \sum \theta^2 $$</p><p>As a consequence, losses found in e.g. VAE’s are effectively multi-objective, with a first objective to maximally cover the data, and a second objective to stay close to the prior distribution. In this case, occasionally KL annealing is used to introduce a tunable parameter \(\beta\) to help handle the multi-objectiveness of this loss.</p><p>$$ L(\theta) =\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z | x )} \left[ \log p_\theta ( x | z) \right] &nbsp;- \beta D_{KL} \left( q_\phi ( z | x) \| p(z) \right) $$</p><p>Also in reinforcement learning, you can see this multi-objectiveness. Not only is it common for many environments to simply sum rewards received for obtaining partial goals. The policy loss is usually also a linear combination of losses. Take as an example here the losses on the policy for PPO, SAC and MPO, entropy regularized methods with their tunable parameter <strong><em>α</em></strong>.</p><p>$$ L(\pi) = - \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)} \left[ r(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \mathcal{H}(\cdot , s_t)\right]$$</p><p>$$ L(\pi) = - \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)} \left[ \mathbb{E}_\pi\left(Q(s_t, a_t)\right) - \alpha D_{KL} \left( q \| \pi \right) \right]$$</p><p>Finally, the GAN-loss is of course a sum between the discriminator and the generator loss:</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = - \mathbb{E}_x \left[ \log D_\theta(x)\right] - \mathbb{E}_z \left[ \log ( 1- D_\theta(G_\theta(z))\right]$$</p><p>All of these losses have something in common, they are effectively trying to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously, and argue that the optimum is found in balancing these often contradicting forces. In some cases, the sum is more ad hoc and a hyper-parameter is introduced to weigh the parts against each other. In some cases, there are clear theoretical foundations on why the losses are combined this way, and no hyper-parameter is used for tuning the balance between the parts. </p><blockquote>In this post, we hope to show you this approach of combining losses may sound appealing, but that this linear combination is actually precarious and treacherous. The balancing act is often more like a tightrope walk.</blockquote><p>Let us consider a simple case, where we are trying to optimise for such a linear combination of losses. We take the approach of optimising the total loss, which is a sum of losses. We optimise this with gradient descent, and we observe the following behaviour.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/953U2daXgDAO_97ugiYVEKnbK69gZVKUmlY9hNpCqtYlTso-XFw8WQ-dWRcBNeNtx7KNvXi1bM5mB8cfmnjXUMg4gU6fp5LvADys1WtoWIW-mqiJt1Uzu-Lw8VceNfQeLLQa9IZa" alt=""></figure><p>Our code in Jax would look something like this:</p><pre><code>def loss(θ):
  return loss_1(θ) + loss_2(θ)
loss_derivative = grad(loss)
for gradient_step in range(200):
  gradient = loss_derivative(θ)
  θ = θ - 0.02 * gradient</code></pre><p>As is usually the case, we are not immediately happy about the tradeoff between the two losses. So we introduce a scaling coefficient <strong><em>α</em></strong> on the second loss and run the following code:</p><pre><code>def loss(θ, α):
  return loss_1(θ) + α*loss_2(θ)
loss_derivative = grad(loss)
for gradient_step in range(200):
  gradient = loss_derivative(θ, α=0.5)
  θ = θ - 0.02 * gradient
</code></pre><p>The behaviour we hope to see is that when tuning this <strong><em>α</em></strong>, we can choose the trade-off between the two losses and select the point we are most happy with for our application. We effectively will go on a hyper-parameter tuning loop, manually select an <strong><em>α</em></strong>, run the optimisation process, decide we would like the second loss to be lower, tune our <strong><em>α</em></strong> up accordingly and repeat the whole optimisation process. After several iterations, we settle for the solution we found and continue writing our papers.</p><p>However, that is not what is always happening. The actual behaviour we sometimes observe for our problem looks like the one below.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iZlk4MRVx7JYgLbaqIv-jH8zZGSc78Jj-aqk_YWy5e80tf_hgMMaBn41yRFR2rpRFGE8vuRGWjljGZ6Ri8XbyDhZbAQbSCX-putykGEpxgmcuPTmrQH1VHKpaKfjra3AG4u-x9K7" alt=""></figure><blockquote>It seems that no matter how we finetune our <strong><em>α</em></strong>-parameter, we cannot make a good trade-off between our two losses. </blockquote><p>We see two clusters of solutions, one where the first loss is ignored, and one where the second loss is ignored. However, both of these solutions are not useful for most applications. Most of the time, a point where the two losses were more balanced is a more preferred solution.</p><p>In fact, this diagram of the two losses over the course of training is barely ever plotted, so the dynamics illustrated in this figure often goes unobserved. We just look at the training curve plotting the total loss, and we might conclude that this hyper-parameter needs more time tuning, as it seems to be really sensitive. Alternatively, we could settle for an approach of early stopping to make the numbers in the paper work. After all, reviewers love data efficiency.</p><p>Where did it go wrong though? <strong>Why does this method sometimes work, and why does it sometimes fail to give you a tunable parameter?</strong> For that, we need to look deeper into the difference between the two figures.</p><p>Both figures are generated for the same problem, using the same losses and are optimising these losses using the same optimisation method. So none of these aspects are to blame for the difference. The thing which has changed between these problems is the model. In other words, the effect the model parameters <strong><em>θ</em></strong> have on the output of the model is different.</p><p>Therefore, let us <em>cheat</em> and visualise something which is normally not visualisable, the Pareto front for both of our optimisations. This is the set of all solutions achievable by our model, which are not dominated by any other solution. In other words, it is the set of achievable losses, where there is no point where <em>all</em> of the losses are better. No matter how you choose to trade off between the two losses, your preferred solution always lies on the Pareto front. By tuning the hyper-parameter of your loss, you usually hope to merely find a different point on that same front.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6qA_NcRMUK8mWT3j3-t_bPl-oZkwg5Q9lWcOgBn9IB3qF_yQ7p1dyH6eq_DtKpTGeACMsLE-YfiIY9DH3yhF7swsmMFGMjNwI_oHdKKbNTuO0M8a_oDZQTUhKGcEuAfTpomqHX-M" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kVqsudO8-j48MEsdlaZgDgc22jMO9myzwdbTTWQ-KufWjuXqIr9gNHKrgV-fRzTb5gMgDnO-sFp1z_lS3UhX3wjwXHRowiaO7Vp04ZaYEAthw7y6wyN3zltH3o0wgB5ZbTDjRuRb" alt=""></figure><p>The difference between the two Pareto fronts is what is causing the tuning to turn out well for the first case, but to fail horribly after changing our model. It turns out that when the Pareto front is convex, we can achieve all possible trade-offs by tuning our <strong><em>α</em></strong>-parameter. However, when the Pareto front is concave, that approach does not seem to work well anymore.</p><h2 id="why-does-gradient-descent-optimisation-fail-for-concave-pareto-fronts">Why does gradient descent optimisation fail for concave Pareto fronts?</h2><p>We can illustrate why that is the case, by looking at the total loss in the third dimension, the loss which is actually optimised with gradient descent. In the following figure, we visualise the plane of total loss in relation to each of the losses. While we actually descend on this plane using the gradient with respect to the parameters, each gradient descent step we take will also necessarily go downwards on this plane. You can imagine the gradient descent optimisation process as putting a spherical pebble on that plane, letting it wobble down under gravity and wait until it comes to a halt.</p><p>The point where the optimisation process halts is the result of the optimisation process, here indicated by a star. As you can see in the following figure, no matter how you wobble down the plane, you will always end up in the optimum.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/U43_rJCiufKMSZ4gtci5kTQ2DRIH_r8WyvFi0aFV0wjpxXTNSFnMzR8a9DHvBc_ONbi0rEIBfXRQXUSxAcriZDGBNWVRhMQ-ifaIXdgeNf1K6cEIeXzMjYZUk94EWMH_bOBzvhOa" alt=""></figure><p>By tuning <strong><em>α</em></strong>, this space stays a plane. After all, by changing <strong><em>α</em></strong>, we are only changing the tilt of this plane. As you can see, &nbsp;in the convex case any solution on the Pareto curve can be achieved by tuning <strong><em>α</em></strong>. A little more <strong><em>α</em></strong> pulls the star to the left, a little less <strong><em>α</em></strong> pushes the star to the right. Every starting point of the optimisation process will converge on the same solution, and that is true for all values of <strong><em>α</em></strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://engraved.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/visualising_the_convex_case.mp4.hq.gif" alt=""></figure><p>However, if we take a look at the differently modeled problem with a concave Pareto front, it becomes apparent where …</p></div></section></div></div></div>

<p>Before and during FOSDEM 2020, I agreed with the people (developers, supporters, managers) of the UBports Foundation to package the Unity8 Operating Environment for Debian. Since 27th Feb 2020, Unity8 has now become Lomiri.</p>

<p>Things got delayed a little recently as my main developer contact on the upstream side was on sick leave for a while. Fortunately, he has now fully recovered and work is getting back on track.</p>

<h3>Recent Uploads to Debian related to Lomiri</h3>

<p>Over the past 3 months I worked on the following bits and pieces regarding Lomiri in Debian:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work on DEB package qtmir.</li>
<li>Revisit upstream status of lomiri-ui-toolkit (and remind upstream on open issues to be resolved).</li>
<li>Debug googletest / cmake-extras build failures in qtmir DEB package.</li>
<li>Prepare MR!2 für cmake-extras upstream, upload cmake-extras 1.5-3 to Debian unstable.</li>
<li>Upload qtmir to unstable/NEW, submit patches upstream.</li>
<li>Upload to unstable as NEW: ayatana-indicator-bluetooth.</li>
<li>Upload to unstable: qtmir 0.6.1-2.</li>
<li>Upload to unstable: cmake-extras 1.5-5.</li>
<li>More debugging on googletest / cmake-extras.</li>
<li>Qt5.15 transition in Debian, various uploads.</li>
<li>Upload unstable: cmake-extras 1.5-6.</li>
<li>Debug and fix libqtdbustest / libqtdbusmock failures in Debian.</li>
<li>Get in touch with RAOF (on IRC, from the Mir Team) on possible fixes of Mir FTBFS in Debian (after a Mesa upload).</li>
<li>Upload to unstable: mir 1.8.0+dfsg1-11 (fix FTBFS).</li>
<li>Fix dbus-cpp autopkgtests.</li>
<li>Fix Mir FTBFS after Boost 1.74 transition.</li>
<li>Fix FTBFS in unit tests in lomiri-url-dispatcher.</li>
<li>Drop autopilot dependency from DEB package qtmir.</li>
<li>Heads-Up Meeting with Marius Gripsgard (discussion next steps).</li>
</ul>

<p>The next projects / packages ahead are lomiri-ui-toolkit, integrating changes required for Lomiri into Ayatana Indicators and then moving on with several other, smaller packages.</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>Many big thanks go to Marius and Dalton for their work on the UBports project and being always available for questions, feedback, etc.</p>

<p>Thanks to Florian Leeber for being my point of contact for topcis regarding my cooperation with the UBports Foundation.</p> </div></div>]]>

    <div>
      
      <div><p>Hi all,</p><p>At 2021-01-29 at 21:35 UTC Google suspended Element from the Play Store without warning or notification. &nbsp;We submitted an appeal asking for clarification at 23:18, and at 05:31 received a generic update from the Google Play Policy team citing that the app has been removed due to content which contravenes their terms of use, and asking us to “make the necessary changes to [our] app” and “upload a new app using a new package name and a new app name”.</p><p>As of 11:44 UTC we’ve submitted a detailed appeal to reiterate that Element is a generic chat app for connecting to the global Matrix communication network, just as Chrome is a generic web browser for connecting to the Web - and just as Google does not control the content on the Web, Element does not control the content on Matrix.</p><p>We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce. We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content.</p><p>In order to enforce our terms of use on the Matrix servers we run as Element, we have a formal Trust and Safety team hired full-time who are dedicated to investigating and tracking abuse reports sent to <a href="https://element.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e68784939583a68b8792948f9ec8899481"><span data-cfemail="d1b0b3a4a2b491bcb0a5a3b8a9ffbea3b6">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or reported from the app. &nbsp;The team takes appropriate action on a ticket by ticket basis - deactivating abusive accounts and blocking chatrooms from our servers which contravene our terms of use, and building tooling to help enforce the terms of use on the servers we run.</p><p>Managing abuse is an ongoing activity, and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">Matrix is expanding massively at the moment</a>. We are expanding Element’s Trust and Safety team to match that growth, focusing on improving our anti-abuse mechanisms, and we are also constantly expanding the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation/">moderation tools</a> we provide to the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re also continuing to work on decentralised reputation as a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/">scalable solution to empower other users to combat abuse</a> for the wider Matrix network - effectively bringing control back to users and empowering communities to remain safe online.</p><p>Element and Matrix are used by the French, German, UK and US governments, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/29/this-week-in-matrix-2021-01-29#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">countless universities</a>, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world - we can only apologise for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this.</p><p>We’re currently waiting for an update to Google and will keep this blog post updated as the situation develops. &nbsp;We look forward to resolving the problem and getting the app back in the store shortly.</p><p>-- The Element Team</p><p>Update: reminder that in the interim you can download a (slightly outdated) version of Element Android from F-Droid at <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app</a>. &nbsp;We're also looking into running our own F-Droid repository going forwards so the most recent build is always available there.</p><p>UPDATE: At 2021-01-30 23:17 UTC we received a call from a VP at Google who apologised for the bad communication from Google and explained the situation, which related to some extremely abusive content which was accessible on the default matrix.org homeserver. &nbsp;Our Trust and Safety team had already identified and acted on this content to enforce the server's terms of use, and so we've explained how Element and Matrix works, established a channel for communication over any future moderation concerns, and expect the app to be restored shortly.</p><p>UPDATE: The app is restored as of 2021-01-31 00:30 UTC. &nbsp;Huge thanks to everyone for your patience and support while we sorted this out, and to the wider Element team who spent their Saturday on this. &nbsp;Thanks also to Google for being transparent and apologetic and the rapid resolution once we'd established contact.</p></div>

the barrier to entry but in this case I have found there are some
limitations with starting out from scratch on <a href="https://codesandbox.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codesandbox.io</a> which
doesn’t make this possible.</p><p>I have made a guide on getting set up for web development with
<a href="http://scottspence.com/2018/12/24/wsl-bootstrap-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Web-Dev Bootstrap</a> and covered the same process in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAsdQuQ-1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu as
well</a>.</p><p>Ok? Time to get started!</p><h2 id="hello-world"><a href="#hello-world" aria-label="hello world permalink"></a>Hello World</h2><p>Kick this off with the Gatsby ‘hello world’, you’ll need to initialise
the project with:</p><p>I suggest that you commit this code to a git repository, so you should
start with a <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>touch</span><span> .gitignore</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"# Project dependencies</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>.cache</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>node_modules</span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span># Build directory</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>public</span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span># Other</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>.DS_Store</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>yarn-error.log"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> .gitignore</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok now is a good time to do a <code>git init</code> and if you’re using VSCode
you’ll see the changes reflected in the sidebar.</p><h3 id="basic-hello-world"><a href="#basic-hello-world" aria-label="basic hello world permalink"></a>basic hello world</h3><p>Ok a Gatsby hello world, get started with the bare minimum! Install
the following:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> gatsby react react-dom</span></p></pre></div></div><p>You’re going to need to create a pages directory and add an index
file. You can do that in the terminal by typing the following:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>mkdir</span><span> -p src/pages</span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> src/pages/index.js</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok, now you can commence the hello word incantation! In the newly
created <code>index.js</code> enter the following:</p><div><div data-language="jsx"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hello World</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now you need to add the Gatsby develop script to the <code>package.json</code>
file, <code>-p</code> specifies what port you want to run the project on and <code>-o</code>
opens a new tab on your default browser, so in this case
<code>localhost:9988</code>:</p><div><div data-language="json"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>"dev"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gatsby develop -p 9988 -o"</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok it’s time to run the code! From the terminal type the npm script
command you just created:</p><blockquote><p>Note I’m using Yarn for installing all my dependencies and running
scripts, if you prefer you can use npm just bear in mind that the
content on here uses yarn, so swap out commands where needed</p></blockquote><p>And with that the “Hello World” incantation is complete 🧙!</p><h2 id="add-content"><a href="#add-content" aria-label="add content permalink"></a>Add content</h2><p>Ok, now you have the base your blog you’re going to want to add some
content, first up we’re going to get the convention out of the way.
For this how-to, the date format will be a logical way, the most
logical way for a date format is <strong>YYYYMMDD</strong>, fight me!</p><p>So you’re going to structure your posts content in years, in each one
of those you’re going to have another folder relating to the post with
the (correct) date format for the beginning of the file followed by
the title of the post. You could drill into this further if you like
by separating out months and days depending on the volume of posts
going this may be a good approach. In this case and in the examples
provided the convention detailed will be used.</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>mkdir</span><span> -p posts/2019/</span><span>{</span><span>2019</span><span>-06-01-hello-world,2019-06-10-second-post,2019-06-20-third-post</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-01-hello-world/index.mdx</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-10-second-post/index.mdx</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-20-third-post/index.mdx</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok that’s your posts set up now you need to add some content to them,
each file you have in here should have frontmatter. Frontmatter is a
way to assign properties to the contents, in this case a <code>title</code>,
published <code>date</code> and a <code>published</code> flag (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>).</p><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Hello World - from mdx!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-01</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>#</span><span> h1 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>My first post!!</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>##</span><span> h2 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>###</span><span> h3 Heading</span></p></pre></div></div><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Second Post!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-10</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>This is my second post!</span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>####</span><span> h4 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>#####</span><span> h5 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>######</span><span> h6 Heading</span></p></pre></div></div><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Third Post!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-20</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>This is my third post!</span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>&gt;</span><span> with a block quote!</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="gatsby-config-api"><a href="#gatsby-config-api" aria-label="gatsby config api permalink"></a>Gatsby config API</h2><p>Ok, now you’re going to configure Gatsby so that it can read your
super awesome content you just created. So, first up you need to
create a <code>gatsby-config.js</code> file, in the terminal create the file:</p><h2 id="plugins"><a href="#plugins" aria-label="plugins permalink"></a>Plugins</h2><p>And now you can add the plugins Gatsby needs to use for sourcing and
displaying the the files you just created.</p><h3 id="gatsby-source-filesystem"><a href="#gatsby-source-filesystem" aria-label="gatsby source filesystem permalink"></a>Gatsby source filesystem</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-source-filesystem</a> collects the files on the local
filesystem for use in Gatsby once configured.</p><h3 id="gatsby-plugin-mdx"><a href="#gatsby-plugin-mdx" aria-label="gatsby plugin mdx permalink"></a>Gatsby plugin MDX</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-plugin-mdx</a> is what will be allowing us to write JSX in

<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-plugin-mdx</a> have done for us. You can now go to the Gatsby
GraphQL GraphiQL explorer and check out the data:</p><div><div data-language="graphql"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  allMdx </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    nodes </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      frontmatter </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>        title</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>        date</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="site-metadata"><a href="#site-metadata" aria-label="site metadata permalink"></a>Site Metadata</h2><p>When you want to reuse common pieces of data across the site (for
example, your site title), you can store that data in <code>siteMetadata</code>,
you touched on this when defining the <code>gatsby-config.js</code>, now you’re
going to separate this out from the <code>module.exports</code>, why? It will be
nicer to reason about once the config is filled with plugins. At the
top of <code>gatsby-config.js</code> add a new object variable for the site
metadata:</p><div><div data-language="js"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> siteMetadata </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>The Localhost Blog</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  description</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>This is my coding blog where I write about my coding journey.</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now query the Site Metadata with GraphQL.</p><div><div data-language="graphql"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  site </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    siteMetadata </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      title</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      description</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="site-metadata-hook"><a href="#site-metadata-hook" aria-label="site metadata hook permalink"></a>Site metadata hook</h2><p>Ok, so, that’s cool n’ all but how am I meant to use it? Well do some
of the code stuff and make a React hook so you can get your site data
in any component you need it.</p><p>Create a folder to keep all your hooks in and create a file for our
hook, in the terminal do:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>mkdir</span><span> src/hooks</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> src/hooks/useSiteMetadata.js</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok, and in your newly created file were going to use the Gatsby
<code>useStaticQuery</code> hook to make your own hook:</p><div><div data-language="js"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> graphql</span><span>,</span><span> useStaticQuery </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'gatsby'</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useSiteMetadata</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> site </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useStaticQuery</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    graphql</span><span>`</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>      query SITE_METADATA_QUERY {</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>        site {</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>          siteMetadata {</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>            title</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>            description</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>          }</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>        }</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>      }</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>    </span><span>`</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> site</span><span>.</span><span>siteMetadata</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now you can use this hook anywhere in your site, so do that now in

              <h5>
                Do you get annoyed every time your roommate slams the doors?
                Does it wake you up every morning? How can you avoid this?
              </h5>
              <h3>First thing to do</h3>
              <p>
                 Try to talk with your roommate and explain to him that this bothers you.
                 Talk to him without tension and in a clear and calm way. It is
                 recommended to catch your roommate in a good mood. if he is sad
                 or has had a hard day he is more likely to take the problem more personally
                 and not understand that it is actually a small thing that bothers you.
                 If you are different in personality, take a step back and try to take it
                as nicely as possible and explain it without getting upset. He may not know
                that he is doing this and he will realize that it is an annoying thing that
                he is not consciously doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i></i>Try to avoid phrases like:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>It is very annoying that you are slamming the door!</li>
                <li>if I woke you up every day knocking on the door, would you like it !?</li>
                <li>I don't know how you can slam the doors like that!</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                 <i></i> Try to approach your roommate with a phrase like:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Hi! I had such a hard day, how was yours?
                  I know you woke up at 6 that I heard when you closed the door.
                  I thought it sounded really loud and I woke up instantly.
                  Maybe we should put some sticky pads on the furniture to make it
                  less noisy or trying to close it more carefully not to wake up each other.
                </p>
              </blockquote>

              <h3>Other ways to prevent noise are:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Try sticky furniture pads
                  <br>
                  - not completely, but it will dampen the sound
                  <br>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Make a set of rules from the beginning that includes 'don't slam the doors' and stick the paper it on the main wall
                  <br>
                  - The advantage of this is that you can't get upset on a paper that has some rules. ‘Don’t slam the doors’ from a human being may sound annoying but reading it will not bother you

<p>
"Luck Surface Area" is a turn of phrase that popped out my mouth during a discussion
episode of <a href="http://www.techzinglive.com/">TechZing</a> a few months back and
is something I've been meaning to write
about ever since but never got around to actually doing. However, thanks to
<a href="http://page99test.wordpress.com/about/">Lance Jones</a>
who referenced the concept in a recent <a href="http://page99test.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/making-the-front-page-of-hn-without-even-trying/">blog post</a> I have finally been spurred into
action.
</p>
<p>
If there's one thing I've discovered in recent years it's this. The amount of
serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly
proportional to the degree to which you do something you're passionate about
combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.
It's a simple concept, but an extremely powerful one because what it implies is
that you can directly control the amount of luck you receive. In other words,
you make your own luck.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works. When you pour energy into a passion, you develop an expertise
and an expertise of any kind is valuable. But quite often that value can actually
be magnified by the number people who are made aware of it. The reason is that
when people become aware of your expertise, some percentage of them will take
action to capture that value, but quite often it will be in a way you would never
have predicted. Maybe they'll want to hire you, or partner with you, or invest in
you, or who knows what. But in whatever way it happens, it will be serendipitous.
</p>
<p>
But it's not just the expertise that's important, the very passion that created
the expertise has value in its own right. This is because people want to be excited
about things and passion is infectious. When you do something you're excited about
you will naturally pull others into your orbit. And the more people with whom you
share your passion, the more who will be pulled into your orbit.
</p>
<p>
To satisfy my mathematically oriented brain I've gone one step further and formalized
the concept into the equation L = D * T, where L is luck, D is doing and T is telling.
This demonstrates clearly that the more you do and the more people you tell about it,
the larger your Luck Surface Area will become. And while I like equations, it's the
graphical representation that really brings the concept home.

    <p>Stories, not people, rule our world. We’re always telling ourselves a story about how the world works, and this makes stories very powerful.</p>

<p>For example, consider this story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>An American couple crash their car, die, and ascend to Heaven. God meets them, and they ask “What were the real results of the 2020 election, and who was behind the fraud?”
</p><p>
God says, “There was no fraud, my children. Biden won fair and square.” After a few seconds of stunned silence, the husband turns to the wife and whispers, “This goes higher up than we thought.”</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does the couple’s political belief supercede God?</p>

<p>Somewhere down the line, what was an entertaining story became something people believed in. This matters because the stories we tell ourselves change how we view the world.</p>

<p>The unreasonable impact of stories confused me. How can a story have so much power?! For the past year, I’ve explored this question, and stumbled upon some surprising connections.</p>

<p>This post explores these connections and what they mean for you: from how stories create beliefs, to lessons from master storytellers about what to be wary of, ending with four powerful stories that have shaped humanity.</p>

<p>Along the way, we’ll also figure out why our couple in Heaven think as they do.</p>

<h2 id="the-belief-hypothesis-spectrum-of-stories">The Belief-Hypothesis Spectrum of Stories</h2>

<p>Consider two stories. Story One is about the economy - how we’re doing great, or not so great, this year. Story Two is about Alice, a rabbit, and a rabbithole.</p>

<p>Which story are you more likely to believe?</p>

<p>Ask young kids, and they’ll probably connect with Alice and the rabbit. The economy? That’s too abstract - sounds like someone created it out of thin air.</p>

<p>While you might believe the story of the economy more, little kids might believe the story of Alice in Wonderland more.</p>

<p>So, we believe in some stories more than others. This degree of belief changes the nature of stories so much so that each kind of story has its own name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stories we believe in are beliefs</li>
  <li>Stories we don’t believe in are lies, or fiction</li>
  <li>Stories we’re not sure about are hypotheses</li>
</ul>

<p>An interesting question to ask here is ‘How do we start believing in stories? How does a story move from fiction to belief?’</p>

<p>Everything starts as a story created by someone. Some call it fiction, others call it lies, some others call it belief, and a small minority calls it a hypothesis.</p>

<p>For many of us, an oft-repeated story, spoken by people we love or admire, becomes a belief.</p>

<p>However, a small minority believes a different story. Their story says not to believe any story just because someone we love or admire said it. Evidence reigns supreme. This is the story of science and rationality.</p>

<p>Sometimes, stories materialise a little too easily. If a boss is scolding an employee, others can make up stories - hypotheses - about why this might be the case. When they finally hear from the employee, some, or maybe all stories become false, and the current story, as told by the employee, becomes the leading belief.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The most common way of creating new stories though, is using templates we’ve heard before. More familiar stories give us more confidence in what’s going on.</p>

<p>For example, in the above example, consider three colleagues making up the story of what happened.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Colleague 1: “He talked to aliens without reporting them”</li>
  <li>Colleague 2: “He banged the bosses’ wife”</li>
  <li>Colleague 3: “He made a mistake on the report”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first colleague’s story is wildly imaginative (and hard for us to take seriously), while the second and third  are templates we’ve seen before. Given the boss isn’t going bat-shit crazy, it’s probably the second colleague’s story, and not the third’s.</p>

<p>Stories might have seemed invisible beforehand, but they’re our primary sense-making tool to understand the world.</p>

<h2 id="mental-models-are-stories">Mental Models are Stories</h2>

<p><a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-Simplistic-explanation-to-Mental-Models.html">Mental models</a> are frameworks and heuristics that help explain the world. Sound familiar? They are stories we repeatedly tell ourselves.</p>

<p>This gives a second dimension to stories. If the X axis is degree of belief, the Y axis is degree of explaining-power.</p>

<p>Remember how we prefer stories we’ve heard before, fitting them into templates? The templates are our mental models. They are things we’ve seen happen.</p>

<p>All models are necessarily a simplification of real life - the map isn’t the territory, which means you lose some information when you create the model. The quality of the model depends on what kind of information you lose.</p>

<p>If a map of roads in your country removes all information about trees and their varieties, you’ll probably still find the map useful. However, if you’re a forester, this map is all but useless for you.</p>

<p>Hence, all models are wrong, yet some remain useful.</p>

<p>Stories are also a simplification of real life. Further, simple stories are easy to tell, easy to understand, and easy to spread. Complicated stories don’t go too far.</p>

<p>Bill Gates, on the story of his success, echoes the same sentiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Steve [Jobs] and I will always get more credit than we deserve, because otherwise the story gets too complicated.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember our couple in Heaven contesting the election results? They have a single story in their mind with no room for alternatives: The elections were rigged. They don’t have a story to help them test out new stories. They stick to their own story, until they find a new more powerful story to replace it.</p>

<p>Since mental models are stories, meta-mental models apply to stories too. This leads to interesting implications.</p>

<p>For example, a famous meta-mental model goes: “to the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Applied to stories, “to a man with a single story, everything fits into the same story.”</p>

<p>What can our couple in Heaven do about this?</p>

<p>The above example hints at another interesting implication: we can use stories to counteract other stories.</p>

<p>Cognitive biases are stories about human psychology. In the face of pressure, poor mental hygiene, or a great sounding story, we end up making catastrophic mistakes.</p>

<p>For example, availability bias is a story professing that what comes to mind first is usually not the complete picture.</p>

<p>This story is counteracting other stories.</p>

<p>It’s  fighting simple stories that are top of mind. It’s a story telling you to beware of stories that have been designed to be so simple (and thus necessarily wrong) that they stay on top of your mind.</p>

<p>If the biases are cancer, learning the story to beware of them is chemotherapy.</p>

<h2 id="stories-are-a-vehicle-for-change">Stories are a Vehicle for Change</h2>

<p>A big question we haven’t yet touched upon is ‘Why do we tell stories?’</p>

<p>Stories move people. A story that moves us, compels us to change. It may not be enough to effect change, but it’s a necessary ingredient.</p>

<p>For example, people donate more to charity when they hear a story about one death, instead of a statistic about how many people died.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifiable Victim Effect</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Telling new stories isn’t just for generating new hypotheses, but for eventually changing your mind, and forming new beliefs.</p>

<p>This third dimension of stories is how effective they are at driving action.</p>

<p>Because of this potency, advertising leads with stories instead of raw facts.</p>

<p>Not just advertisers - news channels do this too. A lot of news is telling new stories for you to believe. Depending on the news channel, there can be zero, or a lot of evidence supporting their stories. And, without a story to counteract these stories, you’ll either believe what they’re saying, without checking the evidence, or completely discard it, based on who is telling the story.</p>

<p>That’s exactly why kids believe everything they’re told when they’re small. They haven’t learned a story that says “Judge for yourself what is true - other people often tell lies to further their own agendas.”</p>

<p>There are three ways to counteract a new story that we’ve already seen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Story of Science - the hunt for evidence</li>
  <li>The power of believing in only a single story - or the man with a hammer</li>
  <li>Learning about cognitive biases</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most effective statisticians are the ones who aren’t afraid to tell a story.  - <a href="https://seths.blog/2019/04/an-anecdote-and-a-statistical-analysis-walk-into-a-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Godin</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third meta-story has lots of heuristics, and lots of literature to explore.</p>

<p>Specific to advertisers, salesmen, and news channels telling you a story, one good way to counter their story is learning why you’re being told a story. If the storyteller has something to gain, and they’re a master storyteller, they’ll be able to move you to action quickly. Beware their motives for telling you a story.</p>

<p>All the warnings aside, if you can harness this power yourself - you can tell yourself compelling stories - then you can effect change in yourself. That’s something we’ll explore soon, too.</p>

<h2 id="stories-create-blindspots">Stories Create Blindspots</h2>

<p>Just like how all models are wrong, and some are useful; all stories are wrong, some are useful. It’s very easy to make useless stories sound useful.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://seths.blog/2020/07/our-top-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Godin</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you talk about your last job, your last vacation, the things that happened when you were 12…<br>
What do you lead with?<br>
Do you lead with, “I broke my ankle that summer and rarely got out” or is it, “I stuck with my reading regimen and read all of Shakespeare.”<br>
Because both are true.<br>
The top story is the one that informs our narrative, and our narrative changes our future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A story is a lens that is prone to framing: how you frame the story changes its focus. This creates blindspots.</p>

<p>Stories are never going to be the …</p></div></div>

<p>The following presents a fast algorithm for volume computation of a simple, closed, triangulated 3D mesh. This assumption is a consequence of the divergence theorem. Further extensions may generalise to other meshes as well, although that is presently out of scope.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of volume as the triple integral over a region of the constant one:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∭</mo><mi>R</mi></msub><mn>1</mn><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V = \iiint_R 1 \mathrm{d}V</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Let <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{F}</annotation></semantics></math> be a function in <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mstyle mathvariant="double-struck"><mi>ℝ</mi></mstyle><mn>3</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{R}^3</annotation></semantics></math> such that its divergence is equal to one. For the purposes of this paper, we choose:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>&gt;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = &lt;x, 0, 0&gt;</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>It can easily be verified that</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>v</mi></mstyle><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>z</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{div} \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial z} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∭</mo><mi>R</mi></msub><mn>1</mn><mi>d</mi><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∭</mo><mi>R</mi></msub><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>v</mi></mstyle><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V = \iiint_R 1 dV = \iiint_R \mathrm{div} \mathbf{F}(x, y, z) \mathrm{d}V</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>By the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the surface integral:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∬</mo><mi>S</mi></msub><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐒</mi></mstyle></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V = \iint_S \mathbf{F}(x, y, z) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>This surface integral, defined over the surface S of the 3D mesh, is equal to the sum of its piecewise triangle parts.

<h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance analysis</h2>
<p>The final algorithm contains no numerical integration nor differentiation. In contrast to common naive algorithms for volume, which are equivalent to rendering the mesh and then sampling the render, an expensive operation, there is only a single loop in this algorithm, over the triangles. Thus, this algorithm for volume computation is O(n) to the number of the triangles. Furthermore, the per-triangle calculation is similarly efficient: given the natural expansion of the cross product, the inner part contains seven additions and three multiplications. On the outside of the loop is only a single multiplication. Thus, for a mesh of <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> triangles, the algorithm requires <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>8</mn><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">8n - 1</annotation></semantics></math> additions and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3</mn><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3n + 1</annotation></semantics></math> multiplications, or <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>11</mn><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">11n</annotation></semantics></math> floating point operations. This is <em>very</em> fast.</p>
<p>For a ballpark number, if volume needs to be calculated every frame in a high-performance 60 frames per second application, without the aid of a GPU, only using the CPU capabilities of a <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/55862/what-is-the-performance-and-the-performance-per-watt-of-raspberry-pi-3-in-gflops">$35 Raspberry Pi</a>, around 30 million triangles could be measured every frame.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The vector calculus exam is soon, and I need to study. Plus, who doesn’t love 3D graphics?!</p>
<p><del>I would be (pleasantly) surprised if the algorithm is novel.</del> Further research <em>after</em> posting reveals the paper <a href="http://chenlab.ece.cornell.edu/Publication/Cha/icip01_Cha.pdf">Efficient Feature Extraction for 2D/3D Objects in Mesh Representation</a> by Cha Zheng and Tsuhan Chen, which appears to describe the same algorithm, although the derivation is different. It was fun while it lasted!</p>

<h2>Status Update</h2>



<p>It's been a bit since I've posted, but things are chugging along! I keep the Roadmap/Changelog pretty up to date as things are merged into the next release, so keep an eye on those pages if you're curious where we are and haven't seen a post in a while.</p>



<p>I am happy to say that since my last post we have solved a lot of content/client side challenges and have either a working proof of concept or framework in place to handle the following:</p>



<ul><li>Support for non humanoid NPCs</li><li>Ability to switch between zone servers (I.e. "zoning" into a new location) while keeping your character state synchronized in the world.</li><li>Shared wardrobe models that can be used by most, if not all humanoids. These can be mapped to NPCs statically or dynamically rendered based on the equipment being worn.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png 397w, https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-208x300.png 208w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px"><figcaption>Preview of the wardrobe system. In this case, a matching robe &amp; coif are equipped by my player.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the near future I am planning on releasing a simplified version of our framework which handles the mapping/rendering of armor as it is equipped/removed, as well as a way to define an entire wardrobe collection for NPCs regardless of what they have equipped.</p>



<p>Given that we're abstracting the Unity Multipurpose Avatar (a free) plugin, the hope is to share some code that others could copy/reuse to jump start their wardrobe/equipment system. This won't actually integrate with a database, but will give a clear picture on how you could manage/scale for an MMORPG.</p>



<p>I should have the above example ready in just a couple weeks here, but in the meantime.. I'm going to post a quick overview of the challenges we faced when getting a character to switch between zones.</p>



<h2>Synchronization Challenges</h2>



<p>So lets dig into the process of moving a player between zones. If you have been following along with our other posts, you should be aware that the world state is hosted/maintained by a single server.  Then, each zone is hosted by its own independent server, maintaining its own state separate from the world. Therefore, certain state changes which occur on the zone need to be propagated up to the world and vice versa.</p>



<p><em>For the sake of clarity, when referring to the "bind" location of the player, that is the zone, position, and direction they load upon dying (or can teleport to if they are a spell caster).</em></p>



<p>Before this change we did implement one aspect of zoning: reloading upon death. If your character died, the current zone server would persist your bind location as your current location in the database. Then, the character would (in a hard-coded manner) load the same exact zone, but upon load would use the new position which had been persisted by the zone just moments before.</p>



<p>We had built the death event in this way last year in preparation for changing zones. By handling deaths as an actual zone change, we'd hopefully have most of the code ready for when we get to changing between different zones. However, after we tried fitting in movement between two different zones... the issues with our previous design began to show.</p>



<h4>Previous Implementation</h4>



<ol><li>Player dies in the zone</li><li>Zone server creates a corpse and moves all player items/coins to said corpse. Updates position/direction/zone of the player to his or her bind location. These are persisted in the database. </li><li>Zone server alerts connected clients, letting them know of the death</li><li>Player who died contacts zone server to "leave" the zone</li><li>Zone server unloads the player, saving their state in the database.<ul><li>(Alternatively) if the player disconnected, they will be unloaded after a few minutes. At which point, their new state is persisted.</li></ul></li><li>Player requests a new "Zone Change" token from the world server. The <strong>player</strong> was specifying the zone they wanted to connect to in this case. (The zone in which they had died in, because we did not support changing zones yet)</li><li>Player requests to enter the zone for their bind, providing the "Zone Change" token.</li><li>Zone server calls the world server to validate the above token. If valid, the player is loaded from the database into the zone's memory.</li><li>Zone informs all of the connected clients that a player has entered the zone</li><li>Player continues process for loading the zone (terrain/audio/weather assets, each character individually from the zone server, etc.) </li></ol>



<p>Now there are a boatload of issues with the above. To list a few:</p>



<ul><li>The player is specifying the zone they want to go to, rather than simply being told.</li><li>World server wasn't validating whether a zone change is valid for a player. For example, a player who is far away from a portal shouldn't be able to use it to zone. A player shouldn't be able to "hop" 5-6 zones at once unless they happened to be bound there (or were teleported by a wizard/druid).</li><li>The player would leave the current zone before seeing if they could get a "Zone Change" token from the world server. This is OK for deaths, but does not work for normal zone changes. What if the target zone server is down for an extended period? Well, you've already disconnected from your current zone -- and with no zone left to connect to you would crash.</li></ul>



<h4>New Implementation</h4>



<p>So how does the zone change flow actually look like now? Lets look at the death case.</p>



<ol><li>Player dies in a zone</li><li>Zone server creates a corpse and moves all player items/coins to said corpse. Updates position/direction/zone of the player to his or her bind location. These are persisted in the database in case the player crashes.</li><li>Zone server informs the <strong>world server</strong> that the player has died.</li><li>Zone server alerts connected player clients/authoritative client, letting them know of the death.</li><li>Player who died contacts the <strong>world server</strong> first this time, informing the world server that it is requesting a zone change token for a particular reason of death.</li><li>World server checks whether the player is in fact dead (which it learned of in step 3). If true, the world creates a "Simple Zone Change" token and <strong>caches it</strong> locally, along with the player's target zone/location. The target zone host is returned to the player client, so they know which socket servers to connect to next.</li><li>Player calls the <strong>current zone</strong> they're in with the "Simple Zone Change" token to inform them that they're disconnecting.</li><li><strong>Current zone</strong> calls the world server, providing the zone change token, to inform them that the player is now leaving. </li><li>World server uses the zone change token provided from the zone server to lookup the player's target zone / location. The player's state is updated in the world at this point (required for the non death case).</li><li>World server returns back to the zone server an <strong>"Upgraded Zone Change"</strong> token.</li><li>Unless there was a failure validating the token, the zone will finally unload the player -- persisting all changes (except for their zone/position) in the database. Note that this step is required for the <strong>non death case</strong>. Death persistence happens in step 2.</li><li>Zone server returns the "Upgraded Zone Change" token to the player client.</li><li>Player client finally connects to the target zone host that it was provided in step 6, this time providing the "Upgraded Zone Change" token.</li><li>Target zone server calls the world server with the upgraded token. If valid, the world server will inform the player's party/guild members of the zone update, remove the token, and update their state as no longer dead.</li><li>If the target zone server receives back a success from the world, the player is loaded from the database into the zone's memory.</li><li>Zone informs all of the connected clients that a player has entered the zone </li><li>Player continues process for loading the zone (terrain/audio/weather assets, each character individually from the zone server, etc.)</li></ol>



<p>Although this process became a lot more intricate, I was really motivated after seeing cheating programs for EverQuest which would allow you to  instantly zone from any position, as long as the target zone was connected (including bind locations, for example). I wanted to be sure our game servers could authoritatively check that the player is entering a new zone legally, as best I could.</p>



<p>Note that I've primarily discussed the death case, but how do we generically change zones in an authoritative manner?</p>



<p>For this we created a new entity to track throughout servers/clients: "ZoneLinks". A zone link is really just the definition between two zones that are connected, including the position in the world where the links are located as well as other metadata to represent how the player's direction will be calculated after zoning.</p>



<p>Finally, on step 5 of the new flow -- rather than the player requesting a zone change token from the world for a reason of death, the player will request the zone change token for a reason of "ZoneLink". Additionally, the player only provides the zone link ID they are triggering. This allows for the server to decide/enforce which target zone the player will go to, as well as to lookup and see whether the player is truly within range of the zone boundary.</p>



<p>Although not important to the flow, we currently support "Proximity" link triggers on the client and "Clickable" link triggers on the client. A clickable link trigger can be assigned to a GameObject in unity so that whenever clicked it will trigger, whereas a proximity link trigger is simply an invisible game object w/ a collider (triggering when a player walks through it).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/proximity-zone-link.gif" alt=""><figcaption> Proof of concept / demonstration of proximity based zone links working. (These two zones wont really have a connection) </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you look closely in the above, you should be able to see most of the new features we've added since the last post. For example, the NPCs are wearing armor -- and in this case it is a static wardrobe collection for that type of NPC -- whereas the sword they are wielding is coming from is actually equipped.</p>



<p>And with that.. I'll leave you guys until the next update.</p>

<p><span><b>TL;DR</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Here’s the game. Flip a coin. You win 50% of your net worth on heads, but only lose 40% on tails. How many times should you play?</li>
<li>Despite the apparently favourable odds, chances are you’ll eventually go bust. Why?</li>
<li>This is because of the path-dependency of time. Because of the fallacious ergodicity assumption.</li>
<li>Ergodicity is when the ensemble-average equals the time-average. For instance, when 10 people doing something once produces the same result as 1 person doing it 10 times.</li>
<li>Essentially, ergodicity lets you conveniently convert time into a space equivalent.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For non-ergodic systems, the aggregate’s performance is a misleading indicator of individual performance. As a whole, the average might look like it’s winning, despite majority of individuals losing.</li>
<li>The Kelly criterion allows us to optimize our bet size to maximize long-term winnings.</li>
<li>While most financial systems are non-ergodic, the foundations of classical economic theory rests on fallacious ergodic assumptions – from DCF valuations to the way we measure GDP growth.</li>
<li>Putting these ergodicity concepts to practical use, I’ve now increased the weighting I give to non-recoverable risks.</li>

<p>You’re probably familiar with these common mistakes in interpreting data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at <strong>average</strong> when you should be looking at <strong>median.</strong> <span>e.g. for personal income distributions</span></li>
<li>Looking at <strong>aggregates</strong> rather than more <strong>granular</strong> <strong>segments.</strong> <span>e.g. sales increased 10% this year, but all of it came from a new business line, while the core businesses remained flat</span></li>
<li>Mistaking <strong>non-linear</strong> outcomes to be <strong>linear</strong> ones <span>e.g. cumulative number of COVID-19 cases</span></li>
</ul>
<p>But you’re probably less familiar with the <strong>ergodicity assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly prevalent in systems, but generally poorly understood and barely known.</p>
<p>Much like Black Swans, <a href="https://neurabites.com/antifragility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antifragility, non-linearity, and optionality</a>, it’s another concept that Nassim Taleb has raised his voice on. But this one has received far less attention than others.</p>

<h3><span><strong>1. Going bust despite favourable odds</strong></span></h3>
<p><span><b>1.1. Definition</b></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A process is said to be <strong>ergodic</strong>&nbsp;if the <strong>ensemble</strong>-average and <strong>time</strong>-average is <strong>equivalent</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more formal definition from Ole Peters from his <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0732-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dec-19 Nature journal article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ergodic hypothesis is a key analytical device of equilibrium statistical mechanics. It underlies the assumption that the <strong>time</strong> <strong>average</strong> and the <strong>expectation</strong> <strong>value</strong> of an observable are the same. Where it is valid, dynamical descriptions can often be replaced with much simpler probabilistic ones — time is essentially eliminated from the models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A mouthful right? Let’s park the definition here for now, and take baby steps with a more digestible example.</p>

<p><span><b>1.2. Rigged coin flip game</b></span></p>
<p>Flip a coin. If heads, your net wealth is <strong>increased by 50%</strong>. If tails, your net wealth is <strong>decreased by 40%</strong>.</p>
<p>Would you play? If so, how many times?</p>
<p>At first glance it seems like the game is rigged in your favour. We expect an equal number of heads and tails in the long run. Given you are paid more from each head than you are penalised for on each tail, you should just play as many times as possible right? Besides, even if you end up on a losing streak, you don’t ever lose all your money, you only lose 40% of whatever you were on. You can win it back with the favourable payoffs. Right?</p>
<p>Well, here’s a simulation of what could happen if you played 50 times.</p>

<ul>
<li>Horizontal axis is time.</li>
<li>Vertical axis is net worth, a function of time.</li>
<li>N=1 means we’re looking at the outcome for 1 individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be a trend here. We were expecting an upward gradient given the favourable odds. But we end up at a loss. Strange. Maybe this guy was unlucky?</p>
<p>Let’s extend the simulation for this one individual into 1,000 rounds.</p>

<p>Looks like they’re stuck at zero. This is surprisingly given the favourable odds. We expected the math to offset the unlucky first 50 rounds. Is this guy just really unlucky?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The green line shows the <strong>average</strong> y-values (wealth) for 100 players at each x-value (time). Again, no clear trend.</p>
<p>Simulate for 10,000 players (red line) and we start to see a trend. On average, this group of 10,000 players is sitting on a nice ~10x profit.</p>
<p>Simulate a million concurrent players, and the trend is more apparent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, a logarithmic axis shows this more clearly.</p>

<p>The average wealth of a million people increases exponentially as they play this game. <span>(Recall from all the March COVID-19 graphs that a linear increase on logarithmic axis means exponential growth. It’s a neat trick to distinguish exponential growth from mere very fast growth.)</span></p>
<p>This trend persists as we extend time to 1,000 rounds and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But wait. This doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Earlier, we showed that for an <strong>individual</strong> player, wealth trends to <strong>zero&nbsp;</strong>over time.</p>
<p>But for the <strong>aggregate</strong> of individuals, wealth trends <strong>exponentially upwards</strong> over time.</p>
<p>How can many things that trend to zero sum up to exponential growth?</p>
<p>Answer: <strong>there’s a few really lucky bastards that distort the average.</strong></p>
<p>A more technical answer: <strong>ergodicity</strong>. Or more specifically, a false assumption of ergodicity for this non-ergodic game.</p>

<p>Let’s take a deeper dive and explore some scenarios for an individual starting with $100.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1</strong>: 2 scenarios</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Some observations.</p>
<p>(i) In aggregate, payout is favourable to the players since average wealth is consistently above starting value of $100. This is the ensemble-average.</p>
<p>(ii) But this asymmetric payoff is only favourable on the <strong>ensemble dimension</strong> (taking the aggregate and dividing it by number of players). The pay-off structure is not favourable to an individual on the <strong>temporal </strong>(time) <strong>dimension</strong>. On an individual level, people are actually more likely to lose the longer they play. Gambler’s ruin. Thus, looking at ensemble returns is a poor indicator of individual returns.</p>
<p>So as the game goes on: the house loses money as they’re paying out more than they receive, while more people become losers, and just a lucky few get obscenely rich. <span>(For context, the winnings from 100 consecutive heads, $4.1 x 10<sup>19</sup> is taking the global GDP of ~$100t and multiplying it by 400k years. So all of the wealth we’re creating today multiplied by longer than Homo sapiens’ existence. The probability of 1 in 2<sup>100 </sup>is even more ludicrous.)</span></p>
<p>There’s many variations to the example we explored: e.g. a triple-or-nothing coin flip. We get similar results except instead of decaying to zero, people go completely bust and end the game there, while some extremely lucky get fanatically rich.</p>

<p><span><b>1.3. Back to ergodicity</b></span></p>
<p>Recall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A process is said to be <strong>ergodic</strong>&nbsp;if the <strong>ensemble</strong>-average and <strong>time</strong>-average is <strong>equivalent</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, simulating an individual playing 10,000 rounds gives a drastically different result to simulating 10,000 individuals playing 1 round.</p>
<p>The trajectory of an individual over a long time (time-average) gives a different result to the aggregate of many individual’s trajectories at an instant in time (ensemble-average, aka. space-average).<span>&nbsp;(Note: we can substitute ‘average’ in this statement with expectation value/outcome/probability/pay-off.)</span></p>
<p>What accounts for this difference is the <strong>path-dependent property of time</strong>. This distinction between the ensemble …</p></div></div>

		A running tally of how the pandemic has been increasing inequity at a fantastic rate.	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>By Chuck Collins</strong> /<a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/"> Inequality.org</a></p>



<p>The collective wealth of all U.S. billionaires has increased over $1.1 trillion since mid-March 2020, a nearly 40% leap during the past 10 months of national emergency. This wealth windfall could pay for all the relief for working families contained in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-propose-1-9-trillion-covid-19-package-11610661977" target="_blank">$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package</a>&nbsp;proposed by President Biden, while leaving the nation’s richest households no worse off than they were before COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>The combined fortune of the nation’s 660 billionaires as of Monday, January 18, 2021 was $4.1 trillion, up 38.6% from their collective net worth of just under $3 trillion on March 18, 2020, the rough start of the pandemic, based on&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;data compiled in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGeUxuE-Z2OyNKu54JQIffS1v588iUvV6yd6D2vH6Vc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this report&nbsp;</a>by the Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). There have been 46 newly minted billionaires since the beginning of the pandemic, when&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/tale-two-crises-billionaires-gain-workers-feel-pandemic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were 614</a>.</p>



<p>At $4.1 trillion, the total wealth of America’s 660 billionaires is two-thirds higher than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.4 trillion in total wealth</a>&nbsp;held by the bottom half of the population,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">165 million Americans</a>.</p>



<p>March 18 is used as the unofficial beginning of the pandemic because by then most<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;federal</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions responding to the virus were in place. Moreover, March 18 was also the publication date of Forbes’ annual billionaires report in 2020. It provided a detailed baseline that ATF and IPS have been comparing periodically with real-time data from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. This methodology has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The $1.1 trillion wealth gain by 660 U.S. billionaires since March 2020 could pay for:</strong></p>



<ul><li>All of the relief for working families contained in President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, which includes $1,400 in direct payments to individuals, $400-a-week supplements to unemployment benefits, and an expanded child tax credit. (See table below)</li><li>A stimulus check of more than $3,400 for every one of the roughly&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank">331 million people in the United States</a>. A family of four would receive over $13,000.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/530913-gop-senator-blocks-bill-for-12k-stimulus-checks-for-second-time" target="_blank">Republicans in Congress resisted</a>&nbsp;sending families stimulus checks most of last year, claiming we couldn’t afford them.</li></ul>

<p>The stock market surge and lock-down economy have been a boon to tech monopolies and helped create multiple U.S. “centi-billionaires.” Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates were each worth more than $100 billion on Jan. 18. Prior to this year, Bezos had been the only U.S. centi-billionaire, reaching that peak in 2018. Bezos and other billionaires have seen particularly astonishing increases in wealth over the past 10 months:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Elon Musk’s</strong>&nbsp;wealth grew by over $154 billion, from $24.6 billion on March 18 to $179.2 billion on Jan. 18, a nearly eight-fold increase, boosted by his&nbsp;<strong>Tesla</strong>&nbsp;The boost in wealth of the SpaceX founder over the past 10 months is more than twice that of any other billionaire.

<p>Tax reform that ensures the wealthy pay their fair share—the principle&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/joe-bidens-tax-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Biden tax plan</a>&nbsp;is built on—would transform a good chunk of those huge billionaire gains into public revenue to help heal a hurting nation. But getting at that big boost in billionaire fortunes is not as simple as raising tax rates: tax rules let the rich delay, diminish and even ultimately avoid any tax on the growth in their wealth. What’s needed is structural change to how wealth is taxed.</p>



<p>The most direct approach is an annual wealth tax on the biggest fortunes, proposed by Senators&nbsp;<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bernie Sanders</a>, among others. Another option is the annual taxation of investment gains on stocks and other tradable assets, an idea advanced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-unveils-proposal-to-fix-broken-tax-code-equalize-treatment-of-wages-and-wealth-protect-social-security-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Senate Finance Committee chair, Ron Wyden</a>. Even under the current discounted tax rates for investment income, if Wyden’s plan had been in effect in 2020, America’s billionaires would be paying hundreds of billions of dollars in extra taxes this spring thanks to their gargantuan pandemic profits last year.</p>

<h4><strong>December 9, 2020 Update</strong></h4>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLbVmE3QyBh06GFFYkUv7eEWvz8DInZam4dx5vyLtT8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a>&nbsp;by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), the collective wealth of America’s 651 billionaires has jumped by over $1 trillion since roughly the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to a total of $4 trillion at market close on Monday, December 7, 2020. Combined, just the top 10 billionaires are now worth more than $1 trillion.</p>



<p>Their wealth growth since March is more than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/03/what-is-in-congressional-bailout-deal-stimulus-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$908 billion in pandemic relief</a>&nbsp;proposed by a bipartisan group of members of Congress, which is likely to be the package that moves forward for a vote in the next week, but has been stalled over Republican concerns that it is too costly.</p>



<p>The total net worth of the nation’s 651 billionaires rose from $2.95 trillion on March 18—the rough start of the pandemic shutdowns—to $4.01 trillion on Dec. 7, a leap of 36%, based on an analysis of&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;magazines research on billionaires. By around March 18 most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions in response to the virus were in place.</p>



<p>Forbes’ annual global billionaires report was published March 18, and ATF and IPS collected the real-time data on Dec. 7 from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. The methodology of this analysis has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>. The ATF-IPS analysis also looks at wealth growth since February 2019—the date of Forbes’ immediately previous annual billionaires report published well before the start of the pandemic and resulting market gyrations.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="background"><a href="#background">→</a>Background</h2><p>I recently got the chance to completely reset my Windows 10 machine, and took advantage of the
opportunity to create a dev environment I would love. These were my high-level goals:</p><ul><li>Make WSL my primary dev environment</li><li>Use VSCode as my primary editor</li><li>Have a beautiful terminal</li></ul><h2 id="wsl-%26-vscode"><a href="#wsl-%26-vscode">→</a>WSL &amp; VSCode</h2><p>To achieve this, I started by installing WSL 2. I went with an Ubuntu distro because that's what
I've had the most experience with in the past. You can find instructions on installing WSL and/or
upgrading it to WSL 2 in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">official
docs</a>.</p><p>Next I installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack">Remote Development extension
pack</a>
which is where things start to get fun. With this extension pack installed, you can edit files in
the WSL filesystem seamlessly with VSCode.</p><h2 id="windows-terminal"><a href="#windows-terminal">→</a>Windows Terminal</h2><p>To get my beautiful terminal going, I installed <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/">Windows
Terminal</a> (WT), which is an
awesome new terminal experience for Windows from Microsoft.</p><p>Although I wanted WSL to be my primary dev environment, I still wanted working in Windows to be a
nice experience as well, so I wanted to make sure my PowerShell terminal was great too. To get that
going, I also installed the latest <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-powershell-7-0/">PowerShell
7</a>.</p><p>Now it was time to setup my WT profiles. By default, WT creates a profile for WSL, PowerShell, cmd,
and Azure Cloud Shell. I'm not interested in using cmd or Azure Cloud Shell, and I'm going to be
using PowerShell 7 instead of PowerShell, so I disabled all but the WSL shell. To do this, simply
add the <code>"hidden": true</code> property to the profiles in the WT settings file (click the dropdown in the
header bar and then Settings or <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd></span>).</p><h3 id="powershell-wt-profile"><a href="#powershell-wt-profile">→</a>PowerShell WT Profile</h3><p>Now to create my PowerShell 7 profile, I added the following object to the profiles array:</p><pre data-language="json" data-index="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"guid"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>{346d54ee-6282-41c7-846a-0a2fa38ff66b}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"name"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>PowerShell</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"commandline"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>pwsh.exe</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"icon"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>%SystemRoot%</span><span>\\</span><span>Installer</span><span>\\</span><span>{8B844F39-E6EE-486B-BE85-96A485AE2B96}</span><span>\\</span><span>PowerShellExe.ico</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"startingDirectory"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>D:</span><span>\\</span><span>code</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>A few things to note:</p><ul><li>To generate a GUID, you can use the <a href="https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx">Online GUID
Generator</a> website</li><li>I am using the <code>pwsh.exe</code> command instead of <code>powershell.exe</code> to use PowerShell 7</li><li>Follow these steps to find the icon path on your system:<ol><li>Open your Start menu and search for PowerShell 7</li><li>Right click on the app and click "Open file location"</li><li>In the file explorer that opens, right click the shortcut and click "Properties"</li><li>On the "Shortcut" tab, click the "Change Icon..." button and copy the file path</li></ol></li><li>I like to set the starting directory to be where I keep all my projects, and ideally this is near
the root of a drive to keep file paths as short as possible</li></ul><h3 id="ubuntu-wt-profile"><a href="#ubuntu-wt-profile">→</a>Ubuntu WT Profile</h3><p>Since I want to make WSL my primary environment, I moved its profile object to the top of the list
so that it will appear first in the new tab dropdown. Then I replaced the top-level <code>defaultProfile</code>
property with the WSL profile's <code>guid</code> property to make it the profile that is opened automatically
when WT launches.</p><p>Similarly to PowerShell, I wanted the starting directory to be <code>~/code</code>. If you try setting that
directly in the WT configuration, you'll find it doesn't work because WT doesn't know how to resolve
it. You can use an absolute path to get there instead, and you need to use a Windows file path that
WT can understand. You can access a WSL distro's file system from Windows using <code>\\wsl$\&lt;distro&gt;</code>, so, I added this property to the Ubuntu profile object: <code>"startingDirectory": "\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\blake\\code"</code> (where <code>Ubuntu</code> should be replaced with the name of your WSL
distro and <code>blake</code> with your WSL username).</p><h3 id="wt-theme"><a href="#wt-theme">→</a>WT Theme</h3><p>Finally, I wanted to get a new theme for my WT. I decided I would like to use the same colour scheme
as I was using for VSCode at the time, which was the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl">Night
Owl</a> theme. So (naturally), <a href="https://chimerical.ca/posts/generate-windows-terminal-scheme">I
created</a> a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blake-mealey.generate-wt-scheme">VSCode
plugin</a> to
automatically generate a WT theme.</p><p>Here's what my terminal looks like with the Night Owl theme:</p><p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p><h2 id="shell-profiles"><a href="#shell-profiles">→</a>Shell Profiles</h2><p>Next up I wanted to get my shell profiles started. We'll iterate on these more later on. Your shell
profile is a script that gets run when the terminal starts which can be used to configure the
current environment. For PowerShell, this will be a PowerShell script and for WSL it will be a bash
script.</p><h3 id="powershell-profile"><a href="#powershell-profile">→</a>PowerShell Profile</h3><p>Let's start with PowerShell again. You can run <code>echo $PROFILE</code> to see if a profile script already
exists. For me it did, and it was located at
<code>C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</code>. If it doesn't exist for you,
it's not a big deal. It seems that PowerShell looks in a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/understanding-the-six-powershell-profiles/">variety of
places</a> and you
can just create a script in the appropriate place and it should work. Here's what I added to my
profile script:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="1"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value nano</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name edit </span><span>-</span><span>Value editor</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>profile_alias</span><span> { editor $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name profile </span><span>-</span><span>Value profile_alias</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>reload_alias</span><span> { </span><span>&amp;</span><span> $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name reload </span><span>-</span><span>Value reload_alias</span></span></code></pre><p>Let's break this down a bit. First of all, I am creating a couple aliases (<code>editor</code> and <code>edit</code>) for
my in-terminal editor. I prefer to use a terminal editor instead of a GUI editor because it reduces
context switching when working in the terminal, and is much faster to load the file to make a quick
edit. That said, if you wanted to use VSCode, you could replace <code>nano</code> with <code>code</code>.</p><p>The reason I create an alias for my editor command is so that I can change the editor at any time
and not have to change my muscle memory to use the new command. It also means I can create more
aliases that open the editor without having to change all of them if I change my editor.</p><p>Next, I add the <code>profile</code> alias which opens the profile script in my editor (the <code>editor</code> alias is
already coming in handy!). This is great because now I don't need to remember where my profile is
ever again, I can just run <code>profile</code> and can start editing it right away. I also add a <code>reload</code>
alias which simply reloads the shell using the profile script. This lets me use my changes to the
profile script without having to create a new terminal instance.</p><h3 id="bash-profile"><a href="#bash-profile">→</a>Bash Profile</h3><p>Now let's do the same thing for bash. In bash, the profile is a bash script located at <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
By default it contains a lot of stuff already, so I like to add my changes to the bottom of the
script. Here's what I added:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="2"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>nano</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> editor=</span><span>"</span><span>$EDITOR</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> edit=</span><span>"</span><span>editor</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> PROFILE=</span><span>"</span><span>~/.bashrc</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> profile=</span><span>"</span><span>editor </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> reload=</span><span>"</span><span>source </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> explorer=</span><span>"</span><span>explorer.exe</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><p>This is very similar to the PowerShell script. First, we create an <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
Some Linux programs respect the <code>EDITOR</code> variable, so it's a good idea to set it if you want more
programs to know which editor you want to use. Then we use <code>EDITOR</code> to create our <code>editor</code> and
<code>edit</code> aliases just like before.</p><p>Then, I add the same <code>profile</code> and <code>reload</code> aliases to edit and reload the profile script.</p><p>Finally, I added another alias which maps <code>explorer</code> to <code>explorer.exe</code> which makes it the same
command for opening the Windows File Explorer in WSL as in PowerShell.</p><h2 id="terminal-editor"><a href="#terminal-editor">→</a>Terminal Editor</h2><p>Let's revisit our terminal editor. I started with nano because it's a pretty intuitive and easy to
use editor for terminals. I don't have a lot of terminal editor experience, so I'm not very handy
with Vim, and even nano can be a bit awkward to use.</p><p>So, I did a bit of research to see if there were any editors that had more similar keyboard
shortcuts and navigation to a modern GUI text editor, like VSCode. I found
<a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> which is available cross-platform, which is perfect!</p><h3 id="powershell-editor"><a href="#powershell-editor">→</a>PowerShell Editor</h3><p>Let's install it. In PowerShell, it's most easily installed via <a href="https://scoop.sh/">scoop</a> or
<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>. If you don't have either installed yet I'd highly recommend
you do, as it makes installing programs in Windows a much easier experience. I'm going to use scoop
for the purposes of this guide. With scoop installed, simply run <code>scoop install micro</code>. Now you can
run <code>micro</code> to edit your files.</p><p>Let's update our profile script to use it:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="3"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value micro</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="ubuntu-editor"><a href="#ubuntu-editor">→</a>Ubuntu Editor</h3><p>To install on Ubuntu, we can run the install script from the micro website:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="4"><code><span><span>curl https://getmic.ro </span><span>|</span><span> bash</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can update our bash profile to use it:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="5"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>micro</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="micro-theme"><a href="#micro-theme">→</a>Micro Theme</h3><p>One issue you might notice once you start editing in micro is that it's theme clashes with your WT
theme. One option could be to port your WT theme to micro, but this is quite a bit of work. I found
using the built-in <code>simple</code> theme uses your terminal theme's background colour and seems to fit
quite well for me.</p><p>To do this, you'll have to configure micro for PowerShell and WSL separately. To configure it, open
micro, press <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span> to open the command prompt, then enter the command <code>set colorscheme simple</code>.</p><h2 id="terminal-prompt"><a href="#terminal-prompt">→</a>Terminal Prompt</h2><p>Finally, to make our terminal really pretty, we need to customize the prompt. There's lots of
options out there for this, but the most popular one seems to be
<a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> for Bash and
<a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">oh-my-posh</a> for PowerShell. I'm not a huge fan of
these because in my experience they slow down the terminal to a point which makes me frustrated to
use them, and since they are separate solutions for each environment they must be configured separately.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://starship.rs/">Starship</a>, a "blazing-fast," cross-platform alternative with a
delightfully simple prompt and some awesome customization (with the promise of even more coming in

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><label>Feb 7, 2019</label><h2>Reflecting on My Failure to Build a Billion-Dollar Company</h2><p>In 2011, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to work on what I thought would be my life’s work.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just had an idea for my first billion-dollar company. Tomorrow, I start building it.</p>— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/54072049395712000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2011</a></blockquote> <p>I thought Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that.</p><p>Needless to say, that didn’t happen.</p><p>Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.</p><p>It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.</p><h2>A weekend project turned VC-backed startup</h2><p>The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor. I didn’t want to become a serial entrepreneur and risk disappointing yet another customer base.</p><p>We decided to become profitable at any cost. The next year was not fun: I shrunk the company from twenty employees to five. We struggled to find a new tenant for our $25,000/month office. We focused all of our remaining resources on launching a premium service.</p><p>In June 2015, a few months before our layoffs, our financials looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $89,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $17,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $364,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: -$351,000</strong></li></ul><p>A year later, in June 2016, our monthly numbers looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $176,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $42,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $32,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: +$10,000</strong></li></ul><p>It hurt, but it meant creators would keep getting paid. It also meant that we were in control of our own destiny.</p><h2>From skeleton crew to lifestyle business</h2><p>It got worse from there.</p><p>Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one.</p><p>I was basically alone. I didn’t have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco was full of startups raising gobs of money, building amazing teams, and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires. Meanwhile, I was running a “measly” lifestyle business. It wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking.</p><p>Now, I understand some people would dream to be in that position. But at the time, I just felt trapped. I couldn’t stop, but there was only so much I could do as an army of one.</p><p>For years, my only metric of success was building a billion-dollar company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal.</p><p>I shut off the rest of the world. I didn’t tell my mom about the layoffs — she had to read the article and tweets herself to find out. My friends were worried, but I assured them I was neither depressed nor suicidal. I left San Francisco for long stretches at a time, thinking that some travel would give me adequate distance. It only made me more lonely.</p><p>Every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad’s support queries. I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to ask for help from former Gumroad engineers. They were all employed by then, but they always found time to help. Once all things Gumroad were taken care of, I tried to go to the gym, and if I had the willpower, work on a side project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed.</p><p>To me, happiness is about an expectation of positive change. Every year before 2016, there …</p></div></div>
