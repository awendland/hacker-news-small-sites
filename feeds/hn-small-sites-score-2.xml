September 9, 2020 | https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>These are the five most annoying inaccessible web elements I face as a blind screen reader user every day, and how to fix them.
</span>
					</p><div>
						<p><span>For blind and visually impaired people like me, accessibility is the difference between us being able to use a website and clicking off it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>How screen readers work</h2>
<p><span>Screen readers allow blind and visually impaired people to use computers, phones and tablets independently. Most screen readers use software, and a Text To Speech (TTS) engine, which is what converts the text from the screen reader into speech. Screen readers convert the text displayed on screen into a format that blind users can process.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read out loud everything that’s on the screen and allow people to navigate using touch gestures and shortcut keys. They also work with other output devices such as a braille display.</span></p>
<p><span>As a screen reader user, here are the most common issues I encounter on a daily basis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Unlabelled links and buttons</h2>
<p><span>Screen reader users rely on links and buttons to navigate around a website and to find the information we need. If links and buttons are not labelled correctly or if at all, then it makes it difficult for screen reader users to find the information they need. Ultimately, unlabelled links make it much harder to navigate the website easily, quickly and independently.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when linking to an about page, ‘click here’ doesn’t give any clue as to where it leads to, but ‘find out more about who we are’ is clear.</span></p>
<p><span>If links and buttons are labelled correctly, screen readers can read the label out loud. It means that blind and visually impaired people don’t have to press the link or button without knowing where it will take them.</span></p>
<p><span>As well as unlabelled elements, links and buttons that do not have a clear description are also really frustrating. They must have a clear description of where they will lead to when pressed, rather than ‘click here’. Never make your users guess where a link will take them or force them into a trial-and-error situation. This makes for tedious user experience.</span></p>
<h2>No image descriptions</h2>
<p><span>This is probably the most common issue I encounter when browsing the web.&nbsp;</span><span>Using image descriptions is essential for accessibility. Image descriptions are also known as alt text (alternative text) which is a written description of an image.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read image descriptions out loud. This means that blind and visually impaired people can understand the content of the image in an accessible way.&nbsp;</span><span>If images do not have alt text, then screen readers will simply say “image” or “graphic” which gives no context or meaning.</span></p>
<p><span>Images often convey valuable information. It’s therefore important that people with a visual impairment can access this information as well.&nbsp;</span><span>Alt text should be clearly written and give an accurate description of the image.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://bighack.org/how-to-write-better-alt-text-descriptions-for-accessibility/">our tips for writing better alt text</a> to ensure your images are fully accessible.</strong></p>
<h2>Poor use of headings</h2>
<p><span>For quick and easy navigation, many screen reader users navigate using various elements on the page such as headings. They are a great way to find the information we need quickly and effectively. Especially when they follow a logical heading structure with H1s, H2s and H3s helping to prioritise the content.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" alt="Logical heading structure begins with Heading 1, with Heading 2 sitting beneath heading 1. Heading 3 sits within heading 2 and so on." width="1958" height="1236" srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1958px) 100vw, 1958px" data-srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>If websites don’t use headings, it means screen reader users are unable to use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the webpage this way. If that’s the case, we have to resort to tabbing or arrowing through a long web page to find the information we need.</span></p>
<p>Headings also help to break up the web content visually and improve readability. Other elements that screen reader users use to navigate webpages include links, lists or landmarks.</p>
<h2>Inaccessible web forms</h2>
<p><span>Most websites use forms in one way or another. Whether it’s to help you search for a product or to get in touch through a contact form. However, when these forms are not labelled, or not labelled correctly, it means we cannot use them.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a search box is not labelled, it means screen reader users have no idea of the purpose of that box. It means people who use screen readers cannot access the same functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact forms are an effective way for customers to get in touch with your brand or business. And as a screen reader user, there’s nothing more frustrating than these forms being labelled incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially CAPTCHA checkout requirements. Without an option to hear the audio, it’s not accessible. It means we are unable to fill in the form independently. I often have to enlist help from a sighted person, but this isn’t possible for everyone.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2>Auto-playing audio and video</h2>
<p><span>Most people will know how annoying it is to load a web page with noisy adverts that start playing suddenly. But for screen reader users, it can be even more alarming. When video or audio starts playing automatically, it can drown out the voice of the screen reader. This makes it harder to find the pause or stop buttons.</span></p>
<p><span>(And if these buttons are unlabelled, then it’s practically impossible for me to stop the video quickly which causes extra frustration.) If I’m unable to stop the sound or video, I normally click off.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution? Make sure there’s no auto-playing video or audio when your website loads. If you really want to use video, make sure the audio is muted and the user can pause, stop or hide the media player.</span></p>
<p><span>These issues may seem small to sighted users. But they’re the difference between me being able to use a website independently or not. And they make a huge difference when implemented correctly.</span></p>

08 September 2020
</p>
<p>In the information security field, we have developed lots of thoughts that can’t be discussed (or rarely discussed):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never roll your own crypto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use TLS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security by obscurity is bad</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And goes like this. Most of them are very generally correct. However, I started to think that people are telling those because everyone is telling them. And, most of the people are actually not thinking about exceptional cases. In this post, I will raise my objection against the idea of “Security by obscurity is bad”.</p>
<h2 id="risk-defense-in-depth-and-swiss-cheese">Risk, Defense in Depth and Swiss Cheese</h2>
<p>One of the main goal of defensive security is reducing the risk for the target business. According to the OWASP’s methodology, the risk of an issue is calculated with the formula below:</p>
<p><code>Risk = Likelihood * Impact</code></p>

<p>According to this formula, a Remote Code Execution issue poses more risk than a Cross Site Scripting one since the RCE causes more impact. This is easy. But what about the likelihood metric. According to the OWASP, likelihood refers that:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>At the highest level, this is a rough measure of how likely this particular vulnerability is to be uncovered and exploited by an attacker
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, if we can reduce the likelihood, we can reduce the overall risk. That’s good. It’s actually very similar to a very common idea called “Defense in Depth”. It’s also referred as “Swiss Cheese Model”</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Swiss_cheese_model.svg" alt="Swiss Cheese"></p>
<p>According to this model, you need to build your defense mechanisms in a layered model so that even the attackers pass the first one, they will get caught on the others.</p>
<h2 id="security-by-obscurity">Security by Obscurity</h2>
<p>So let’s talk about security by obscurity. It’s a bad idea to use it as a single layer of defense. If the attacker passes it, there is nothing else to protect you. But it’s actually would be good to use it as an “additional” layer of defense. Because it has a low implementation cost and it usually works well.</p>
<p>Let’s think about a couple of scenarios here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a server that runs the SSH with it’s default port <code>22</code> and my credentials are: <code>root:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s almost 100% since the hackers are conducting brute force attacks to the services with common credentials globally.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>22</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we have eliminated the global brute forcers since we are not using a common username. The likelihood and risk are reduced. However, we still have to deal with targeted attackers. A targeted attacker can guess the username as <code>utku</code> since it’s my name.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>64323</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we changed the default port number. Does it help? Firstly, we’ve eliminated the global brute forcers again since they scan only the common ports. What about the others? To find this out, I did a small survey on my Twitter to find out people’s port scan behaviors.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm trying to prove a point for my new article. I need your answers for the question below. (please be honest)</p><p>-When you do a port scan with nmap to find open ports on the target, are you specify a custom port range to scan all 65,535 ports? (with -p0-65535 parameter)</p></div>— Utku Şen (@utkusen) <a href="https://twitter.com/utkusen/status/1303021175556145154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>As you can see here, lots of people tend to scan the default/most popular ports only. So, if you switch your port from 22 to 64323, you will eliminate some of them. You will reduce the likelihood and risk.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for software vulnerabilities as well. If a vulnerability found in the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, everybody will scan for the port 3389 globally. You can reduce your risk just by changing the default port.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h2>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to use the same methodology in other fields other than changing the defaults. For example, the following ideas might be a good idea for some specific cases (not always)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Obfuscating codes:</strong> Of course, it’s common knowledge. Hackers are people too. If you obfuscate your code well, they will need to spend more time to find issues. They may give up eventually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using random variable names for a web application:</strong> Instead of using clear variable names, you can switch them with random strings. It might help just like the code obfuscation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Symmetric Encryption in the Database:</strong> When you write data to the database, use a function like <code>encryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. Likewise, when you read data, use a function like <code>decryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. If the attacker can read your backend code, obviously he/she can decrypt your database. But if there is an issue that allows an attacker to read data from the database, but not the backend code (like SQL Injection), the gathered data won’t be helpful for the attacker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-life-applications">Real Life Applications</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is widely used in physical/real-life security. For example, the president goes from point A to point B with his 30 cars convoy. But he’s not sitting on his own presidential car so that the attacker won’t target him easily. He can be in any car and it reduces the risk of an attack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/04/00/14330600-0-image-a-38_1559605545988.jpg" alt="President"></p>
<p>Camouflaged animals are using security by obscurity as well. Obscurity reduces the likelihood of being killed. Therefore, they gained this ability in the evolutionary process.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uuuploads/animal-camouflage/animal-camouflage-4.jpg" alt="Animal"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is not enough by itself. You should always enforce the best practices. However, if you can reduce the risk with zero cost, you should do that. Obscurity is a good layer of security.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A physicist loses half the value of their physics knowledge in just four years whereas
an English professor would take over 25 years to lose half the value of the
knowledge they had at the beginning of their career [1]. These estimates are
taken form a paper written in 1982 so software engineers obviously weren’t
included. But it begs the question… What would the half-life of the value of a
software engineer’s knowledge be? I suspect it’s somewhere between the physicist’s
and the English professor’s because a software engineer’s knowledge is a combination
of eternal computer science/engineering principles and ephemeral technologies that
drift in and out of popularity over time.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-that-doesnt-expire">Knowledge that doesn’t expire</h2>
<p>Software engineers with a traditional computer science background learn things
that never expire with age: data structures, algorithms, compilers,
distributed systems, etc. But most of us don’t work with these concepts
directly. Abstractions and frameworks are built on top of these well studied
ideas so we don’t have to get into the nitty-gritty details on the job
(at least most of the time). Examples are the C++ standard library which
implements optimized sorting for arrays, and Apache Spark which provides fault
tolerant cluster computing out of the box.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-that-does-expire">Knowledge that does expire</h2>
<p>The unavoidable ephemeral knowledge one accumulates during their career comes in
many forms and this isn’t an exhaustive list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A vogue framework or programming paradigm that falls out of favor in a couple of years.</li>
  <li>Domain knowledge in a rapidly evolving industry/field.</li>
  <li>Knowledge of proprietry technology: e.g. internal tools at your company.</li>
</ol>

<p>Knowledge of this kind can quickly transition from zealous adoption to every company who
uses said knowledge trying to sunset everything they’ve built with it.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>I’m inclined to say I use ephemeral knowledge more than eternal knowledge to perform
my job. And then there’s the added pressure in our industry of always having to learn
new and useful things.</p>

<p>A theoretical physicist who spends a great deal of time mastering a theory and
the mathematical techniques behind it, only to see that theory rendered obsolete
by a new and improved theory several years later, is analogous to a software
engineer who spends a great deal of time mastering a web development framework,
learning its intricacies and gotcha’s, only to see that framework rendered
obsolete by a new framework several years later, leaving no more demand for
that knowledge in the labor market.</p>

<p>I relate to the physicist more than the English professor. What do you think?</p>

Since its inception back at the start of the century, the demand for this medium-sized, energy and space-efficient, the memory storage device has been growing at a fast rate. Therefore, to meet the market requirements, the SDA was set up as a non-profit organization to promote and create SD Card standards. There are various topics related to the SD card such as the different device families, speed classes, smart cards, card security and so on and it is used in various markets like digital cameras, personal computers, and embedded systems. Some of the standard variations include SD, SDHC, SDXC, SD-ultra high speed etc. The microSD is the miniaturized SD memory card format with a small form factor and is widely used in various electronic devices.<br>
What we are going to learn is the use of SD cards in an embedded system. To be specific, we will be dealing with the use of SD cards in small embedded systems.</p><h2>Circuit&nbsp;and Interfacing</h2><p>SD card has a native host interface apart from the SPI mode for communicating with master devices. The native interface uses four lines for data transfer where the microcontroller has SD card controller module and it needs separate license to use it. Since the SPI is a widely used protocol and it is available in most low-cost microcontrollers, the SPI mode is the widely used interface in low cost embedded systems. The working voltage range of SD family is 2.7V to 3.6V and this is indicated in the operation condition register (OCR).</p><p><img src="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2000px-SD_Pins.svg_-1.png" alt="2000px-sd_pins-svg" width="214" height="292"></p><div id="attachment_2345"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2345" src="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card.png" alt="sd-card" width="371" height="229" srcset="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-200x124.png 200w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-300x185.png 300w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-400x247.png 400w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-600x371.png 600w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-768x475.png 768w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-800x495.png 800w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px"><p id="caption-attachment-2345">SD Card pinout</p></div><div id="attachment_2347"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2347" src="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2.png" alt="sd-card-2" width="381" height="213" srcset="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-200x112.png 200w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-300x168.png 300w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-400x223.png 400w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-600x335.png 600w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-768x429.png 768w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-800x447.png 800w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px"><p id="caption-attachment-2347">MicroSD Card pinout</p></div><p>Most micro-controllers use the SPI communication protocol to interface with the SD cards. The SD cards have a microcontroller that shows their availability to the master controller(microcontroller). The micro-controller sees the SD card as an addressable sector on which read/write functions are possible. Once the microcontroller is in the SPI mode, communication between the master and the slave is done via 4 pins viz. clock, chip select, data in and data out. It should be kept in mind that throughout the communication between the two devices, the micro-controller will be sending out the clock.<br>
Most development boards have a dedicated SD card slot. But to understand the connections, let us analyze this fairly simple circuit.</p><div id="openl-1850019108"><div data-animationoffset="100%"><div><div data-link="https://openlabpro.com/online-courses/pic-microcontroller/" data-link-target="_self" data-animationoffset="100%"><div>From the very basic I/O control to the advaced SD Card interfacing, this course covers what you need to get started in Embedded Systems.<div><div><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/362065141?autoplay=0&amp;autopause=0" width="600" height="360" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo362065141" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"></iframe></div></div></div><a href="https://openlabpro.com/online-courses/pic-microcontroller/" target="_self">Learn more about the course</a></div></div></div></div><h3>Circuit</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit.png" alt="sd-card-circuit" width="506" height="284" srcset="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-200x113.png 200w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-400x225.png 400w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-600x338.png 600w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-800x450.png 800w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px"></p><p>If the logic level of the microcontroller is different than the SD card, level shifter needs to be used for converting the line voltages.<br>
The MISO (master in serial out) pin should be connected to the SDI (serial data in) pin on the microcontroller.<br>
The MOSI (master out serial in) pin should be connected to the SDO (serial data out) pin on the microcontroller.<br>
The SCK (serial clock) pin should be connected to the SCK (serial clock) pin on the microcontroller.<br>
The CS (chip select) pin should be connected to the corresponding CS pin on the microcontroller or on any digital I/O pin on the microcontroller. A common ground is provided.</p><p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: While connecting the power supply, make sure that the supply is drawn from a 3.3V supply as a 5V supply would see your card go up in smoke.</p><h3>Interfacing</h3><p>Once the connections are set up, we are ready to interface our hardware with the software.<br>
Set the directions of each of the four pins correctly. While activating the SPI mode, an ideal configuration should be, mode(0,0) and the phase with input sampled at the middle of data out. Also, the clock frequency should be set in the range of 100 kHz and 400 kHz prior to initializing the card. Once the initialization is done, the clock can be set to a more desired frequency.</p><h2>SD Commands</h2><p>Next comes the tricky part, initializing the SD card and performing the raw data communication. A systematic approach to programming the software would make the task pretty easy.<br>
But first, it is important to learn how the micro-controller activates the SD card. There are a fixed set of commands and responses, which must be followed to create a command to response structure in our program. The data is transmitted in a byte-oriented format with a definite length.<br>
The following table shows the necessary<b> commands</b> to the card and the corresponding response from the card.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3.png" alt="sd-card-3" width="507" height="1118" srcset="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-136x300.png 136w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-200x441.png 200w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-400x882.png 400w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-464x1024.png 464w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-600x1323.png 600w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-768x1694.png 768w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-800x1765.png 800w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-1200x2647.png 1200w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3.png 1274w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px"></p><p>Every command has a constant length of 6 bytes.<br>
The first byte is the addition of the command number and the number 64.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
For CMD0: command number 0 + 64 = 64 = 0x40 in hexadecimal.<br>
For CMD1: command number 1 + 64 = 65 = 0x41 in hexadecimal.<br>
And so on.<br>
This is followed by a set of four bytes which are known as the arguments. These arguments usually contain the address of a data or the length of a block.<br>
The last byte is the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) Byte. Most commands in the SPI mode does not require a check byte if the CRC feature isn’t enabled. For some commands like CMD0, the CRC is 0x95 and in most cases, a 0xFF is sent. Enabling the CRC requires you to send the correct check byte from the micro-controller. So, ensure whether the CRC feature is enabled or disabled.<br>
A <b>command frame</b> looks like this-</p><p><img src="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-800x267.png" alt="Interfacing Microcontrollers with SD Card - Command frame" width="800" height="267" srcset="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-200x67.png 200w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-300x100.png 300w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-400x133.png 400w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-600x200.png 600w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-768x256.png 768w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-800x267.png 800w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-1024x342.png 1024w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-1200x400.png 1200w, https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p><p>The card will receive a command when the DO pin (Data Out) is driven high as shown above. The CS pin (Chip Select) must be driven high to low before sending the command and must be kept low during the process. The time between a command and its response is known as the command response time (NCR). As mentioned earlier, regarding the clock pulses from the micro-controller, the corresponding response byte sent back from the card to the microcontroller should be driven by the serial clock pulses of the micro-controller. There is a chance that the response byte from the card might get skipped by the microcontroller due to the absence of a driving clock pulse. Hence it is necessary to make sure that an 8-Bit clock pulse is sent to the Card soon after the Command Frame is sent (Refer the <b>TECHNICAL NOTE </b>below). Also while receiving a Byte from the card, the DI pin (Data In) must be driven high.</p><p>Furthermore, let us analyze the different<b> types of responses</b> that we get from the card and what they mean.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Response_Color-1.jpg" alt="response_color" width="568" height="289"></p><p>An R1 response, 0x01 means that the command sent prior to the response has resulted in the card going into an idle state.<br>
A response byte 0x00 means that the command has been accepted and the card will be waiting for the proposed event to take place. If any other bits in an R1 response is set, it is the result of an error and it’ll be down to the factor mentioned in each R1 response bit in the figure.</p><h2>Initializing&nbsp;the SD Card</h2><p>Now, as far as sending the commands are concerned, there is an order in which they must be sent. Only the commands, CMD0, CMD1, ACMD41, CMD58 and CMD59 will be accepted when the card is in its idle state. Sending any other command will likely to yield an illegal response.</p><p><b>TECHNICAL NOTE</b>: After interfacing the card, the micro-controller must always send a set of bytes, which we will refer to as dummy bytes. One dummy byte is 0xFF. These dummy bytes have a simple yet significant purpose. Prior to the initialization, the card must know the frequency at which the data is being sent. By sending around 75 dummy bits approximately (dummy byte * 10 times = 80 bits), the card will be ready for communication. Also even after every command is sent, it is a good practice to send at least one dummy byte. A logical explanation for this is that communication is driven by the clock pulse of the micro-controller. The clock pulse is sent only when the data buffer is filled. After every response is sent and prior to the next command or between command and response, the SCK will stop generating pulses due to an empty data buffer. To ensure the continual transmission of clock pulses between every command, fill the data buffer with a junk value such as a dummy byte. To create a dummy byte function with the number of loops as the argument.</p><p>The<b> first command</b> to be sent to the card is the <b>CMD0</b> command. The structure of every other command-response should be based on this model.</p><ul><li>Drive the DO pin high.</li><li>Drive the CS pin from high to low.</li><li>Send a dummy byte.</li><li>Then send the following 6-byte command continuously<br>
First byte: 0x40<br>
Next four bytes: 0x00000000<br>
CRC byte: 0x95</li></ul><ul><li>Send another dummy byte or as many as required, to generate the SCK giving time for the SD card to respond to the command request.</li><li>Wait for the receive flag bit to set and then read the response from the SD card or create a loop to read the response a few number of times. The response should reach back within the command to response (Ncr) time. Or else, something must be wrong.</li></ul><ul><li>The desired response is 0x01, meaning the card is in the idle state and we are good to go.</li></ul><p>Send the <b>CMD8</b> command next to check the version of your SD card.<br>
The difference in the 6-byte commands are<br>
First byte: 0x48<br>
Next four bytes: 0x000001AA<br>
CRC byte: 0x87</p><p>We are looking for two possibilities in our response byte. Either 0x01 or 0x05.</p><p>A 0x01 response means that you have a version 2 SD card. The 0x01 response is followed by the 4 bytes 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0xAA in the order of their transmission from the SD card which is, in fact, the argument you send in your command.</p><p>If the response is 0x05, it means the card is a version 1 or an MMC card. If the card is actually a version 2 SD card, then this response is the result of an illegal command. Also, the card is now in the idle state.</p><p>Once the above two commands (CMD0 and CMD8) are done, it is safe to say that our SD Card is working in good condition and ready for data Read/Write.<br>
Additionally, just to ensure whether the SD Card is functioning in the correct working voltage, send the <b>CMD58</b> Command.</p><p>Next, we must initiate the i<b>nitialization</b> process. For this send a <b>CMD1</b> command and wait for response 0x00, meaning the idle state bit is cleared.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Several times in my career, I’ve joined a team whose work was already well
under way, where I had a massive knowledge deficit, and didn’t have
pre-existing relationships. None of those excuses relieved me from the pressure
I felt to establish myself and contribute. Over time, I realized that the
natural instinct to push for early impact leads many incoming leaders into
challenging relationships as they expose their knowledge deficit and waste
time. So, I developed an algorithm that has helped me ramp up quickly — and
in several cases — have an impact in a relatively short period of time, while
minimizing collateral damage.</p>
<p>The first step is to find someone on the team and ask for 30 minutes with them.
In that meeting you have a simple agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first 25 minutes: ask them to tell you everything they think you
should know. Take copious notes. Only stop them to ask about things you don’t
understand. Always stop them to ask about things you don’t understand.</li>
<li>For the next 3 minutes: ask about the biggest challenges the team has right
now.</li>
<li>In the final 2 minutes: ask who else you should talk to. Write down every
name they give you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat the above process for every name you’re given. Don’t stop until there
are no new names.</p>
<p>The sum of the answers from the first 25 mins will not give you a complete
picture of the team’s work. That will take months to develop. But they will
give you a framework for integrating new information more quickly, which will
speed up how fast you ramp. It will also heavily over index on the areas of
work under active discussion, which will help you dive in productively to the
most critical discussions immediately. The nature of what people choose to
discuss is a very valuable signal about the problems the team face, as it may
be about the work, the organization, or process. Finally, it will give you a
sense of the language and terminology that can very often be a barrier to
working smoothly with teams.</p>
<p>The answers from the second question give you a cheat sheet on how to impress
the team with early positive impact. Some of the things you’ll hear will take
time to fix, such as “we need a bigger team” or “our infrastructure isn’t
scaling.” Those are important and it will be good for the team to hear you
internalize those challenges. But a surprising number of the issues you’ll
hear repeatedly will be things you can easily help with, like “we waste a
bunch of time in meetings every week” or “we need a dedicated conference
room.” I start with the latter as quickly as I can because those are the
types of things teams often neglect to prioritize, in spite of a compounding
negative impact on progress.</p>
<p>The third question will give you a valuable map of influence in the
organization. The more often names show up and the context in which they show
up tends to provide a very different map of
the organization than the one in the <a href="http://boz.com/articles/damn-the-org-chart.html">org chart</a>.</p>
<p>For all the value I just described, the greatest value in this process isn’t
in the answers — it is in the asking. Taking these meetings and listening
shows proper respect for the team that’s in place. It can be hard to remember,
but while you may be insecure about taking a new role because you feel like
you’re at a disadvantage, the people you’re speaking with may also be unsure
about you taking that role and what it means for them. Demonstrating mutual
respect builds the trust required to make progress.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Hey there!</p>
<p>I wanted to learn more about Pandas, a Python library for data analysis, so I decided to embark on a mini-project to experiment with it. If you use Reddit, you’ve probably seen a chain of comments like below:</p>
<p><img src="https://sshawarma.github.io/reddit-comment-chain.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Clearly, you can see that there’s a pattern in the number of upvotes. Every reply to the parent comment receives less upvotes compared to the previous reply. It would be interesting to create a bar graph, comparing the number of upvotes the parent comment received, the number of upvotes the first reply received, the number of upvotes the second reply received, …, the number of upvotes the <code>nth</code> reply received. Using Reddit’s API and Pandas, I implemented a program that would do just that. You can find it on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sshawarma/comment_analyzer">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, we need to import the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> praw
<span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd
<span>import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span>as</span> plt
<span>import</span> sys
<span>import</span> math
<span>from</span> concurrent.futures <span>import</span> ThreadPoolExecutor
</code></pre></div><p>PRAW is a Python wrapper for Reddit’s API. <code>matplotlib</code> is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. These imports will become clearer as we move on.</p>
<p>Next, we need to define authenticate to Reddit’s API. PRAW allows us to do this pretty easily with OAuth2:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Authenticate using our client secret</span>
<span>def</span> <span>authenticate</span>():
    <span>with</span> open(<span>'client_secret.txt'</span>, <span>'r'</span>) <span>as</span> f:
        data <span>=</span> f<span>.</span>read()<span>.</span>split()
        CLIENT_ID <span>=</span> data[<span>0</span>]
        CLIENT_SECRET <span>=</span> data[<span>1</span>]

    <span>return</span> praw<span>.</span>Reddit(client_id<span>=</span>CLIENT_ID,
                    client_secret<span>=</span>CLIENT_SECRET,
                    user_agent<span>=</span>USER_AGENT)
</code></pre></div><p>In this case, the client ID and client secret is stored in a file (called <code>client_secret.txt</code>). We read this and return an instance of PRAW’s <code>Reddit</code> class, which allows us to interact with Reddit’s APIs.</p>
<p>Now, we break down what we have to do in logical chunks. First, we need to get a list of submissions, so that we can look at the comments under each post. PRAW allows us to get a list of the hottest submissions from r/all, which is basically an amalgamation of a bunch of submissions from different subreddits:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>get_submission_upvotes</span>(reddit, m, n):
    upvotes_list <span>=</span> []
    submissions <span>=</span> list(reddit<span>.</span>subreddit(<span>'all'</span>)<span>.</span>hot(limit<span>=</span>m))
    <span>with</span> ThreadPoolExecutor() <span>as</span> executor:
        futures <span>=</span> [executor<span>.</span>submit(count_upvotes, submissions[i], n) <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, m)]
        [upvotes_list<span>.</span>append(future<span>.</span>result()) <span>for</span> future <span>in</span> futures]
    <span>return</span> upvotes_list
</code></pre></div><p>The reason we use <code>concurrent.futures</code> is because, depending on the length of the comment chain we are examining, we might end up taking very long to collect upvotes on one submission but a very short time to collect upvotes on another submission (we will see what the <code>count_upvotes</code> function does next). Here, <code>m</code> represents the number of submissions to look at and <code>n</code> represents the number of comments in a comment chain to examine.</p>
<p>Next, we need to count the number of upvotes of each comment in a comment chain in each submission. This can be done as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>count_upvotes</span>(submission, n):
    upvotes <span>=</span> []
    submission<span>.</span>comments<span>.</span>replace_more(limit<span>=</span><span>0</span>)

    count <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    comment <span>=</span> submission<span>.</span>comments[<span>0</span>]
    <span>while</span> count <span>&lt;</span> n:
        upvotes<span>.</span>append(comment<span>.</span>score)
        count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
        <span>if</span> len(comment<span>.</span>replies) <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:
            comment <span>=</span> comment<span>.</span>replies[<span>0</span>]
        <span>else</span>:
            <span>break</span>

    <span>while</span> len(upvotes) <span>&lt;</span> n:
        upvotes<span>.</span>append(float(<span>'nan'</span>))
    <span>return</span> upvotes
</code></pre></div><p>In essence, we get the top comment and keep examining each reply until we have gotten <code>n</code> comments or until the comment chain ends (to get more comment chains of length <code>n</code>, we can increase <code>m</code>). If the comment chain ends prematurely, we add <code>nan</code> (Not a Number) to indicate that no data was collected for the particular reply in the comment chain because that reply did not exist (the comment chain ended, so there were no more upvotes to count).</p>
<p>After counting the upvotes of each comment in the top comment chain, we only have to process the data. First, we compute the average number of upvotes for the top comments, the 1st reply, the 2nd reply, etc:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>compute_data</span>(upvotes_list):
    avg_upvotes <span>=</span> []
    <span>for</span> col <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, len(upvotes_list[<span>0</span>])):
        avg <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span>
        n <span>=</span> len(upvotes_list)
        <span>for</span> row <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, len(upvotes_list)):
            <span>if</span> math<span>.</span>isnan(upvotes_list[row][col]) <span>==</span> False:
                avg <span>+=</span> upvotes_list[row][col]
            <span>else</span>:
                n <span>-=</span> <span>1</span>
        <span>if</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:
            avg_upvotes<span>.</span>append(avg <span>/</span> n)
        <span>else</span>:
            avg_upvotes<span>.</span>append(<span>0</span>)
    <span>return</span> avg_upvotes
</code></pre></div><p>We return a list called <code>avg_upvotes</code>, which contains the average number of upvotes for the top comment, first reply, second reply, etc. We now convert this list into a bar graph:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>render_data</span>(avg_upvotes, n):
    <span># Solution from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9647202/ordinal-numbers-replacement</span>
    ordinal <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> n: <span>"</span><span>%d%s</span><span>"</span> <span>%</span> (n,<span>"tsnrhtdd"</span>[(n<span>//</span><span>10</span><span>%</span><span>10</span><span>!=</span><span>1</span>)<span>*</span>(n<span>%</span><span>10</span><span>&lt;</span><span>4</span>)<span>*</span>n<span>%</span><span>10</span>::<span>4</span>])
    x <span>=</span> [str(ordinal(i)) <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, n)]
    df <span>=</span> pd<span>.</span>DataFrame({<span>'Comment Reply Number'</span>: x, <span>'Average Upvotes'</span>: avg_upvotes})
    df<span>.</span>plot<span>.</span>bar(x<span>=</span><span>'Comment Reply Number'</span>, y<span>=</span><span>'Average Upvotes'</span>, rot<span>=</span><span>0</span>, legend<span>=</span>False)
    plt<span>.</span>xlabel(<span>'Comment Reply Number'</span>)
    plt<span>.</span>ylabel(<span>'Average Upvotes'</span>)
    plt<span>.</span>xticks(size<span>=</span><span>4</span>)
    plt<span>.</span>yticks(size<span>=</span><span>4</span>)
    plt<span>.</span>show()
</code></pre></div><p>Now all we have to do is put it together:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>if</span> __name__ <span>==</span> <span>'__main__'</span>:
    <span>if</span> len(sys<span>.</span>argv) <span>&lt;</span> <span>3</span>:
        <span>print</span>(<span>'./comment_analyzer.py [number of submissions to analyze] [number of comments]'</span>)
        exit()
    m <span>=</span> int(sys<span>.</span>argv[<span>1</span>])
    n <span>=</span> int(sys<span>.</span>argv[<span>2</span>])
    reddit <span>=</span> authenticate()
    upvotes_list <span>=</span> get_submission_upvotes(reddit, m, n)
    avg_upvotes <span>=</span> compute_data(upvotes_list)
    render_data(avg_upvotes, n)
</code></pre></div><p>The program takes two parameters: the number of submissions to look at and the “depth” of the comment chain we have to look at.</p>
<p>Running the program (assuming you have the necessary libraries installed with Python 3.6+), you get a bar graph like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://sshawarma.github.io/pandas.png" alt="a right-skewed bar graph"></p>
<p>(The “0th” comment represents the top comment).</p>
<p>The above graph allows us to visualize the distribution of upvotes on comments on Reddit. Clearly, the distribution is right-skewed: the number of upvotes diminish as we get deeper down the reply chain. This is to be expected, since the top comment tends to be seen first.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you can see how tools like Pandas and PRAW allow us to collect data and visualize it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="0ea0c8ae-8333-a516-8908-f86a85ef9373"><blockquote>One of my key goals this month is to make sure we're not burning ourselves out. We've got a lot of priorities but there's no need to stretch ourselves thin and run the risk of longer-term issues.<p>- Jean Vincent (CTO, Lytehouse)</p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Unhealthy working patterns can build up over time and create longer-term issues. </p><p>In this article, we'll be showing you signs of burnout debt - and how to recognize it before it's too late.</p><p>‍</p><h3>What is 'Burnout Debt'</h3><p>Symptoms of burnout can slowly grow on a team. As sprints go on it's easy to overlook the signs that build up over time. We refer to this build up as 'burnout debt'.</p><p>You should treat burnout debt in the same way we treat technical debt. Identify it early and take measures to reduce longer-term negative effects.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Signs of 'Burnout Debt'</h3><ol role="list"><li>Unhealthy Working Patterns</li><li>High Workloads</li><li>Spikes in Weekend Activity</li></ol><p>‍</p><h3>Sign #1: &nbsp;Unhealthy Working Patterns</h3><p>One key factor in burnout is overwork. It's important we help our teams manage their workloads and reduce burnout. If your team feels the need to work late nights and weekends - it's time to have a conversation about workloads.</p><p>This team for example consistently works late nights and weekends. This is a strong signal that your team is overworking and may approach burnout. We'll see the effect of this below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5f593cd3ba2ac780cf72cc15_unsustainable-working-patterns.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Sign #2: Unusually High Workloads</h3><p>Spikes in workload can be early warning signs of burnout.</p><p>The team below was under tight deadlines - working nights and weekends. You can a large spike in Throughput followed by immediate burnout which lasted ~3 months.</p><p>This is a typical situation. We take on too much work and burn out. The following weeks remain unproductive. As leaders it's our job to make sure our teams have a more sustainable, manageable workload.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5f593cecff346bf77d54af02_unusually-high-workload.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Sign #3: Spikes in Weekend Activity</h3><p>Large spikes in weekend activity can be an incredibly high signal for overworked. Are your current tasks too much to handle in a week? Did we poorly estimate that workload? Is the workload unmanageable?</p><p>As engineering leaders we have to protect our team from situations like that which can cause long term effects to team morale, culture, and overall productivity. As we saw in the image above, the effects of burnout can be long lasting and in some cases can lead to the highest cost for an engineering team - turnover.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5f593d086702304230624666_high-weekend-activity.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Is your team accumulating 'burnout debt'?</h3><p>Just like technical debt, burnout debt silently builds up in the background. As it accumulates it not only gets harder to resolve but it's impact becomes more severe.</p><p>When left unchecked 'burnout debt' impacts team culture, creates an environment of overwork, and degrades trust among the team. At an individual level it decreases satisfaction, happiness, and productivity while boiling up to team-wide frustration, low morale, and high turnover.</p><p>So.. Is your team affected by burnout debt?</p><p>‍</p><h3>What should I do about it?</h3><p>It’s important to identify these signs early so you can intervene. Luckily, there are ways to identify and resolve burnout debt.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Make it a ritual</h5><p>The first step is having conversations around workload and sustainability. Make it a recurring ritual. At Haystack we bring this up every week. We're constantly adjusting workloads and introducing new, challenging work - to combat burnout.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Get data-driven</h5><p>As engineers, we often feel productive (and happy) when we're pushing new features. There's a certain rush to grabbing a coffee, throwing on some headphones, and getting that #todo closed out - even if it takes staying up late to do it.</p><p>Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to see or address burnout debt.

Notice that the quasirandom distributions appear less regular than a lattice but do not have as many ‘clumps’ or ‘gaps’ as the random distribution.</figcaption></figure><p>The methods of creating fully deterministic low discrepancy quasirandom sequences in one dimension are extremely well studied, and generally solved.&nbsp; In this post, I focus almost solely on open (infinite) sequences, first in one dimension and then extending to higher dimensions. The fundamental advantage of open sequences (that is, extensible in $n$ is that if the resultant errors based on a finite number of terms is too large, the sequence can be extended without discarding all the previously calculated points. There are many methods to construct open sequences. One way to categorise the different types is by the method of constructing their basis (hyper)-parameters:</p><ul><li>irrational fractions: Kronecker, Richtmyer, Ramshaw</li><li>(co)prime numbers: Van der Corput, Halton, Faure</li><li>Irreducible Polynomials : Niederreiter</li><li>Primitive polynomials: Sobol’</li></ul><p>For brevity, this post generally focuses on comparing this new additive <strong>recurrence</strong> $R$-sequence, which falls into the first category as it is a recurrence method based on irrational numbers (often called Kronecker,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidistribution_theorem">Weyl</a>&nbsp; or Richtmyer sequences) which are rank 1 lattices, and the Halton sequence, which is based on the canonical one-dimensional van der Corput sequence. The canonical Kronecker Recurrence sequence is defined as: $$R_1(\alpha): \;\; t_n = \{s_0 + n \alpha\}, \quad n=1,2,3,…$$ where $\alpha $ is any irrational number. Note that the notation $ \{x\}$ indicates the fractional part of $x$. In computing, this function is more commonly expressed in the following way $$R_1(\alpha): \;\; t_n = s_0 + n \alpha \; (\textrm{mod} \; 1); \quad n=1,2,3,…$$ For $s_0 = 0$, the first few terms of the sequence, $R(\phi)$ are: $$t_n = 0.618, \; 0.236, \; 0.854, \; 0.472, \; 0.090, \; 0.708, \; 0.327, \; 0.944, \; 0.562, \; 0.180,\; 798,\; 416, \; 0.034, \; 0.652, \; 0.271, \; 0.888,…$$</p><p>It is important to note that the value of $s_0$ does not affect the overall characteristics of the sequence, and in nearly all cases is set to zero. However, especially in computing the option of $s \neq 0$ offers an additional degree of freedom that is often useful. If $s \neq 0$, the sequence is often called a ‘shifted lattice sequence.</p><p>The value of \( \alpha \) that gives the lowest possible discrepancy is achieved if&nbsp; \( \alpha = 1/\phi \), where \( \phi \) is the golden ratio. That is, $$ \phi \equiv \frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2} \simeq 1.61803398875… ; $$ It is interesting to note that there are an infinite number of other values of&nbsp; $\alpha$ that also achieve optimal discrepancy, and they are all related via the Moebius transformation $$ \alpha’ = \frac{p\alpha+q}{r\alpha+s} \quad \textrm{for all integers} \; p,q,r,s \quad \textrm{such that} |ps-qr|=1 $$ We now compare this recurrence method to the well known van der Corput reverse-radix sequences [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Corput_sequence">van der Corput, 1935</a>] . The van der Corput sequences are actually a family of sequences, each defined by a unique hyper-parameter,&nbsp;<span id="MathJax-Element-15-Frame" tabindex="0"><span id="MathJax-Span-163"><span id="MathJax-Span-164"><span id="MathJax-Span-165">b</span></span></span></span>.&nbsp;The first few terms of the sequence for b=2 are: $$t_n^{[2]} =&nbsp; \frac{1}{2},&nbsp;\frac{1}{4},\frac{3}{4},&nbsp;\frac{1}{8},&nbsp;\frac{5}{8},&nbsp; \frac{3}{8},&nbsp;\frac{7}{8}, \frac{1}{16},\frac{9}{16},\frac{5}{16},\frac{13}{16}, \frac{3}{16}, \frac{11}{16}, \frac{7}{16}, \frac{15}{16},…$$ The following section compares the general characteristics and effectiveness of each of these sequences. Consider the task of evaluating the definite integral $$ A = \int_0^1 f(x) \textrm{d}x $$ We may approximate this by: $$ A&nbsp; \simeq A_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i),&nbsp; \quad x_i \in [0,1] $$</p><ul><li>If the \( \{x_i\} \) are equal to&nbsp; \(i/n\), this is the <strong>rectangle</strong> rule;</li><li>If the \( \{x_i\} \) are chosen randomly, this is the <strong>Monte Carlo method</strong>; and</li><li>If the \( \{x_i\} \) are elements of a low discrepancy sequence, this is the <strong>quasi-Monte Carlo method</strong>.</li></ul><p>The following graph shows the typical error curves \( s_n = |A-A_n| \) for approximating a definite integral associated with the function, \( f(x) = \textrm{exp}(\frac{-x^2}{2}), \; x \in [0,1]&nbsp; \) with: (i) <span>quasi-random points based on the additive recurrence, where&nbsp; \( \alpha = 1/\phi \), (blue);&nbsp;</span>(ii) <span>quasi-random points based on the van der Corput sequence, (orange)</span>;&nbsp;(iii) <span><span>randomly selected points, (green)</span><span><span>;&nbsp;(iv) <span>Sobol sequence (red).</span></span></span></span> <span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>It shows that for \(n=10^6\) points, the random sampling approach results in an error of \( \simeq 10^{-4}\), the van der Corput sequence results in an error of&nbsp;\( \simeq 10^{-6}\), whilst the \(R(\phi)\)-sequence results in an error of&nbsp;\( \simeq 10^{-7}\), which is \(\sim\)10x better than the van der Corput error and \(\sim\) 1000x better than (uniform) random sampling.</p><figure id="attachment_624" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-624"><img loading="lazy" src="http://extremelearning.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Numerical-integration-1D-v2.webp" alt="" width="960" height="609" srcset="http://extremelearning.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Numerical-integration-1D-v2.webp 960w, http://extremelearning.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Numerical-integration-1D-v2-300x190.webp 300w, http://extremelearning.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Numerical-integration-1D-v2-768x487.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-624">Figure 2. Comparison of 1-dimensional Numerical integration using various Quasirandom Monte Carlo methods. Note smaller is better. The new $R_2$ sequence (blue) and the Sobol (red) are clearly the best.</figcaption></figure><p>Several things from this figure are worth noting:</p><ul><li>it is consistent with the knowledge that the errors based on uniform random sampling asymptotically decrease by $ 1/\sqrt{n} $, whereas error curves based on both quasi-random sequences tend to&nbsp; $1/n $.</li><li>The results for the $R_1(\phi)$-sequence&nbsp; (blue) and Sobol (red) are the best.</li><li>It shows that the van der Corput sequence offers good, but incredibly consistent results for integration problems!</li><li>It shows that, for all values of $n$, the $R_1(\phi)$-sequence produces results better than the van der Corput sequence.</li></ul><blockquote><p><span> The new $R_1$ sequence, which is the Kronecker sequence using the Golden ratio,&nbsp; is one of the best choices for one-dimensional Quasirandom Monte Carlo (QMC) integration methods</span></p></blockquote><p>It should also be noted that although \(\alpha = \phi\) theoretically offers the provably optimal option, \(\sqrt{2}\) and is very close to optimal, and almost any other irrational value of \(\alpha\) provides excellent error curves for one-dimensional integration. This is why, \(\alpha = \sqrt{p} \) for any prime is very commonly used.&nbsp; Furthermore, from a computing perspective, selecting a random value in the interval&nbsp; $ \alpha \in [0,1] $ is with almost certainty going to be (within machine precision) an irrational number, and therefore a solid choice for a low discrepancy sequence. For visual clarity, the above figure does not show the results the Niederreiter sequence as the results&nbsp; are virtually indistinguishable to that of the the Sobol and $R$ sequences.&nbsp; The Neiderreiter and Sobol sequences (along with their optimized parameter selection) that were used in this post were calculated via Mathematica using what is documented as “closed, proprietary and fully optimized generators provided in Intel’s MKL library”.</p><p>Most current methods to construct higher dimension low discrepancy simply combine (in a component-wise manner), \(d\) one-dimensional sequences together. For brevity, this post mainly focuses on describing the Halton sequence [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halton_sequence">Halton, 1960</a>] , Sobol sequence and the \(d-\)dimensional Kronecker sequence.</p><p>The Halton sequence is constructed simply by using \(d\) different one-dimensional van de Corput sequence each with a base that is relatively prime to all the others. That is, pairwise co-prime. By far, the most frequent selection, due to its obvious simplicity and sensibility, is to select the first \(d\) primes. The distribution of the first 625 points defined by the (2,3)-Halton sequence is show in figure 1. Although many two-dimensional Halton sequences are excellent sources for low discrepancy sequences, it is also well known that many are highly problematic and do not exhibit low discrepancies. For example, figure 3 shows that the (11,13)-Halton sequence produces highly visible lines. Much effort has gone into methods of selecting which pairs of ( \(p_1, p_2) \) are exemplars and which ones are problematic. This issue is even more problematic in higher dimensions.</p><p>Kronecker recurrence methods generally suffer even greater challenges when generalizing to higher dimensions. That is, although using \( \alpha = \sqrt{p}&nbsp; \) produces excellent …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>Silcon Labs EFM8: Fantastic value and ease-of-use from the only 8-bit part with a totally-free cross-platform vendor ecosystem</h4><p>The <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/silicon-labs-efm8/">EFM8</a> was the fastest 8-bit part in my round-up, and admittedly, my favorite 8-bit architecture to develop with overall. What these parts lack in brains they make up for in brawns — 14-bit ADCs, 12-bit DACs, lots of timers, and a 72 MHz core clock speed that gives you timing options not found in any other part in the round-up.</p><p>Plus, this is the only 8-bit part with a totally-free, cross-platform, vendor-provided ecosystem. Let that sink in.</p><p>Keil C51 is a silly compiler, but Silicon Labs does an excellent job hiding it under the hood — even when running its Eclipse-based Simplicity Studio on Linux or macOS.</p><p>Simplicity Configurator is the lightest-weight code generator in our round-up, using only 534 bytes of flash to house the entire DMX-512 receiver project. It was one of the easiest to use, and seemed to strike a good balance between abstraction, performance, and ease of use.</p><p>Debugging speeds are snappy with a J-Link debugger, but at $35, the official Silicon Labs USB Debug Adapter is one of the cheapest first-party debugger in the round-up, and clones of the hardware are even cheaper.</p><p>And call me old-fashioned, but I think the 8051 definitely has a place in 2017 — especially among hobbyists and students, where its bit-addressable memory, easy-to-use peripherals, and fuse-free configuration help get students comfortable with microcontrollers quickly.</p><h4>Microchip megaAVR &amp; tinyAVR 1-Series: Different strokes for different folks — still with the best 8-bit toolchain available</h4><p>The <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/atmel-microchip-megaavr/">megaAVR</a> came in surprisingly flat for me: especially when compared with its lower-cost, new sibling, the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/atmel-microchip-tinyavr-1-series/">tinyAVR 1-Series</a>.</p><p>There’s no comparison when it comes to price: tinyAVR has incredible value — packing in a nice assortment of timers, analog peripherals (including a DAC), and a new 20 MHz internal oscillator — while costing 20-40% less than the megaAVR.</p><p>While the megaAVR has a perplexing debugging experience that requires two completely different interfaces and protocols to work with the part, the new one-wire UPDI interface the tinyAVR sports worked flawlessly in my testing.</p><p>But that’s the crux of the problem for the tinyAVR — by shedding many of its megaAVR roots, Microchip ended up with a wonderful microcontroller that will be challenging to use for a large base of Atmel fans: indie developers and hobbyists who use low-cost, open-source programmers (which don’t support the UPDI interface).</p><p>While the tinyAVR wasn’t the fastest part in the round-up (even among 8-bitters), it was the most efficient – both in terms of active-mode power and clock efficiency. Amazingly, the AVR only uses about twice as many instructions as 16- and 32-bit parts when performing 16-bit math.</p><p>Unfortunately, the AVR system as a whole is not without its issues. The Windows-only Atmel Studio is still buggy (especially with older megaAVR devices and AVR Dragon stuff in my tests), and there isn’t an under-$50 low-cost debugger available (other than hacking apart Xplained Mini dev boards).</p><p>In many ways, there seems to be a tacit demarcation Atmel creates between its hobbyist/indie developers, and the professional shops that use Atmel parts.</p><p>As a professional embedded developer, I most definitely have access to Windows computers, and I have no problem blowing a few billable hours’ worth of pay on a $140 debugger.</p><p>But even as popular as Atmel is among hobbyists, Atmel has largely stayed out of this space directly. Instead, they’ve secured small-volume AVR sales by relying on the open-source community to build their own tools for themselves: turning out a slew of hardware and software used to program the megaAVR devices.</p><p>While I applaud the efforts of these developers, these tools are inferior to Atmel’s. Their programming speeds are terrible, they don’t support the new tinyAVR 1-Series devices, and they have absolutely no debug capability.</p><p>Having said that, both the megaAVR and tinyAVR have the best toolchain available for 8-bit MCU development. The part supports a full, end-to-end Makefile-based GCC toolchain.</p><p>If you love printf() debugging, would never touch a proprietary toolchain, and hate IDEs, megaAVR and old tinyAVR parts are definitely for you. The older ones are still available in DIP packages, and as you probably know, there are a ton of low-cost programmers available across the world. The online community is massive, and as clunky as I find Atmel START to be, I have to applaud its support for Makefile-based project generation.</p><p>Consequently, the megaAVR remains the most open-source 8-bit microcontroller on the market — by a long shot.</p><p>But I’d really like to see Microchip provide a PicKit-priced debugger with UPDI support — and allow off-board debugging the way their PIC Curiosity Boards do.</p><p>I also hope these open-source projects can add UPDI support to their tools, so that hobbyists and indie developers can start integrating the tinyAVR into their projects — it’s a much better part, and if you’re an AVR user with access to Atmel Studio, you really ought to buy an Xplained Mini board and take it for a spin.</p><h4>STM32F0: A low-cost, no-nonsense part with arguably the best Arm development ecosystem tested</h4><p><a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/st-stm32f0/">The STM32F0</a> was the lowest-power Arm microcontroller in the round-up, and also one of the easiest to use. STM32CubeMX doesn’t generate the most compact code on Arm (that honor belongs to Cypress PSoC Creator and Infineon DAVE), but it has a snappy interface, and the generated code is easy enough to manipulate for your own goals.</p><p>I love the nearly-stock Eclipse-based environment that System Workbench for STM32 provides, and the ST-Link and excellent Discovery/Nucleo boards seals the deal for me.</p><p>Most pros have used ST parts in their work, but for all these reasons, any hobbyist looking at moving to Arm should probably pick up a dev board from this ecosystem, too. ST has a huge market footprint, so there’s tons of resources online — aimed at both hobbyists and professionals.</p><h4>SAM D10: Killer performance &amp; peripherals, but with runtime library hiccups</h4><p>The Microchip/Atmel <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/atmel-microchip-sam-d10/">SAM D10</a> (and the broader D11/D20/D21 ecosystem) has good value (considering their analog portfolio includes a DAC, and they have good timing options), and the SAM D10 was the most efficient part tested when running at full speed.</p><p>Professionals will like the easy-to-use, well-documented header files, and hobbyists will appreciate the 1.27mm-pitch SOIC package options and GCC compilers that come with the Arm ecosystem. But before I grab this part for a project, Microchip really needs to fix the extremely slow, bloated peripheral library, and update their code-gen tool to do proper error-checking of clock and peripheral configurations.</p><p>As it is, whenever I use Atmel START on the D10, I want to STOP almost immediately. And there are no current, stand-alone peripheral drivers that Microchip has released for this part, so unless you want to do register programming from scratch, you’ll be relying on third-party, open-source projects — like Alex Taradov’s <a href="https://github.com/ataradov/mcu-starter-projects">code examples</a>.</p><h4>Infineon XMC1100: Interesting peripheral perks make this Cortex-M0 stand out</h4><p>The most interesting Arm chip was, without a doubt, the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/infineon-xmc1100/">Infineon XMC1100</a> — and I think professionals who may be wary of getting out of the ST/NXP/Atmel Arm ecosystem need to take a second look at these XMC1000 (and XMC4000) parts.</p><p>The timer options are amazingly flexible, and you can squeeze fantastic performance out of the USIC module.</p><p>I’m going to go out on a limb and recommend that serious hobbyists who are building motor / lighting control projects look into these parts, too. DAVE makes setting up these complex peripherals painless, and the 38-pin TSSOP chips will be substantially easier to solder than the 0.5mm QFNs and QFPs you usually end up with in these pin counts.</p><p>Like many of the parts reviewed here, the biggest problem for hobbyists and indie developers is the tiny online communities and lack of GitHub repos with open-source projects that use these chips. My advice — be bold, and post in the forums. Infineon employees monitor and usually respond within a day or so.</p><h4>PIC16: Tons of peripherals with a slower, power-efficient core</h4><p>When you compare the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/microchip-pic16-five-digit-enhanced/">PIC16</a> with other 8-bit parts out there, it’s obviously a part built for low-power applications, and not processing power. And while the development ecosystem is workable, there are other parts more friendlier pathways — especially for smaller shops, hobbyists, and students who need extremely low-cost tools (and free software).</p><p>To add fuel to the PIC-vs-AVR debate, my testing found that a 32 MHz PIC16 is roughly equivalent to an AVR part running at 1.4 MHz (in terms of math performance), and 9 MHz (in terms of bit-shuffling performance).</p><p>Having said that, the DMX-512 receiver seems a perfect match for the PIC16, and that’s where it looks best in my testing: the PIC16 was the lowest-power 8-bit part in my testing.</p><p>It’s also full of timers and digital logic-oriented peripherals that make it suitable for funky special-purpose projects that require some crafty use of configurable logic and and the numerically-controlled oscillator — these peripherals help offload the (relatively slow) CPU, at the expense of requiring more developer familiarity with the device and these peripherals.</p><p>The usual Microchip gotchas apply: clunky IDE, expensive compilers, and expensive debuggers.</p><p>The usual Microchip advantages apply: huge online community, seemingly infinite product lifetime guarantees, and DIP, SOIC, QFP, and QFN package availability.</p><h4>PIC24: An expensive MSP430 wannabe that doesn’t hit the mark</h4><p>The <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/microchip-pic24/">PIC24</a> is nearly forgettable. In the biquad test, it’s marginally faster than the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/renesas-rl-78/">Renesas RL-78</a> but uses almost three times as much power. In the DMX-512 test, both the RL-78 and MSP430 beat it, too. It was also one of the least-endowed parts in the round-up (which really just means it’s expensive — higher-end PIC24 parts have no shortage …</p></div></div>

<p>About six years ago I started learning Unity in my spare time, going through several official and unofficial tutorials. One was a simple tutorial on how to create a wire chain through physics. After its completion, I added a simple platform and a sphere. When arrow keys were pressed the sphere was torqued, and on spacebar press a vertical force was added to sphere, which caused it to jump. I was at awe. Unity’s physics were accessible and felt natural out of the box. Not only that, but a rough working scene could be quickly setup by gluing some basic concepts.</p>


<p>Wire chain and sphere physics</p>

<p>An idea started to bubble up about around this simple project: staying as long as possible on top of a platform. Antagonists, materialized in the form of various hazards, were added in order to coerce (directly or indirectly) the player off the platform. Frequency and power of these hazards increased over time, raising the probability of reaching the level’s finishing state. From this starting point, more elements were added, such as interactable platform edge blocks, destroyable floor tiles, backdrops, user interface and basic sound effects.</p>

<p>Two versions resulted from this. The first ad supported version was available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockbyte.survivalball">Android mobile</a> devices only, having one playable level in single-player mode. Afterwards, a new adless version was released for <a href="https://www.ouya.tv/game/Survival-Ball/">OUYA</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockbyte.survivalltv">Android TV</a> and Kongregate, featuring a new versus mode.</p>


<p>Game prototype version for OUYA, Android TV and Kongregate</p>



<p>I went to work on other projects after the prototype’s launch, but the feedback provided from gamers was kept in the back of my mind in the meanwhile. Several ideas eventually piled up for a new, improved version of the game, and about two years ago they were first brought to fruition. First at night after work, then full-time until completion.</p>

<p>Laying out a solid base was was essential in the beginning of the project, specially concept wise. Pre-production, if you will. Surviving on top of a platform was the root idea, but was there latitude for perpendicular ideas? Multiplayer mode? Versus or Cooperative? Online or local only? Powerups? Which player movements would be available, only jump? Progressive difficulty (the player does not choose the difficulty level) or bucket based difficulty (e.g. easy, normal, hard)? What will be the direction of visual style, audio, and code architecture? How many levels? What is the player’s motivation play these levels?</p>

<h2 id="root-ideas-and-game-modes">Root ideas and game modes</h2>

<p>Less is more when it comes to the game’s root ideas, and surviving on top of a platform seemed like a good premise. This idea was dissected and questioned thoroughly during the initial phase of development, in order to make sure it was well sustained. Other ideas such as going as high as possible or objective based levels were considered, but set aside in the initial stage of the project. They were not completely scrapped, such that both survival/time based and objective based levels would later cohabitate throughout the game’s development.</p>

<p>Assuming survival as the most important root idea, a question came up: survive what? It could be either you against the world, or you against other player(s), or a combination of both. The latter two options would prompt the need of a multiplayer versus mode and/or player AI, and the former one would naturally accommodate a single player and/or cooperation mode.</p>

<p>Allowing for a local multiplayer mode would be something desirable, since I had a personal bias towards games that physically join a group of friends in the same place. Also, online multiplayer was set aside due to the added entropy and complexity associated with it. </p>

<p>As for cooperative (co-op) games, there is usually an increased inclusion factor due to the wealth of opportunities to strike a balance between experienced and less experienced players, translating to less chances of frustration caused by huge proficiency gaps.</p>

<p>Given the above points, solo and local co-op modes were chosen to be included in the game.</p>

<h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>

<p>Again, having in mind that less is more, a progressive difficulty mode (where the player does not choose the difficulty level) was strived for, instead of a bucket based approach (e.g. easy, normal, hard). Choosing a difficulty level when starting a simple game like this one, forces the player to commit to a given difficulty level at start, and accepting that decision. The responsibility is on the player. Often happens to me that when I choose a difficulty level like “easy” or “normal”, I keep wondering throughout the game if I am really good at that game, or am I just being thrown softballs. Progressive difficulty resolves that problem immediately, but it falls on the developer shoulders to craft the game in such a way that all difficulty ranges are covered just right.</p>

<p>Progression would be 2-fold: each level would start in an accessible way, but would gradually get more difficult as time passes. On the other hand, each level would be more challenging than the last one during the campaign. </p>

<h2 id="control-and-movement">Control and movement</h2>

<p>There was the need to have offensive manuevers against hazards, and to provide mid-air control to the player. Two new movements were added to the already existing jump and double jump movements: dash and stomp. Dash provided mid-air control and allowed the player to interact with the world’s objects and attack hazards. Stomp, inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, allowed for button interaction, and mid-air stop and plunge for precise vertical landings.</p>

<p>With this set of movements, the player was able to gain full control over the ball. Easy to learn, hard to master. Additionally, it suppressed the need for aerial control via directional controls, which would be less physically coherent and could quench some of the fun of gaining control proficiency.  </p>

<h2 id="powerups">Powerups</h2>

<p>An assumption was made that powerups would be distributed randomly, either by items scattered throughout the level or by other means. Powerups were not used because of these four reasons: </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Added game design complexity</strong> - every new powerup would increase the realm of possible scenarios during a game session, which would increase the difficulty of striking good game balance.</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - simplicity was held at high value during development, and powerups would probably require the usage of a new button to trigger the power, more UI elements and new concepts for the player to grasp.</li>
  <li><strong>Skill based gameplay</strong> - the game aimed to be purely skill based. Since the randomized nature of hazards already abducted some of this intent, having powerups attributed by chance would further decrease the player’s perception that the level was completed by his/her own merit.</li>
  <li><strong>They could be used as crutches</strong> - powerups are outstanding when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollcage_(video_game)">used</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_8">properly</a>, but can also be abused to cover up design flaws. Having a no-powerup limitation forced me think in alternative ways to make the game more interesting, a challenge I was drawn to. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visual-aesthetics">Visual Aesthetics</h2>

<p>Defining the game’s visual appearance early on was quite important, since it would influence the reasoning behind 3D models, textures, UI, colors, mood and even audio. The two most influential references were <a href="https://material.io/archive/guidelines/">Material Design (first version)</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/540840/Lara_Croft_GO/">Lara Croft GO</a>.</p>

<p>Coming from an Android development background, I was exposed to Material Design, which is a visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design. Its principles go beyond mobile UI development, and span to a swath of different form factors and use cases. I personally found it beautiful and applyed its principles throughout the game’s aesthetics, both in UI, but also in the overall style of the game. This influenced the game to have a simple, clean and coherent style.</p>

<p>Lara Croft GO is a beautiful game. The charming colors and elegant (yet simple) style made an impression on me. While building up the game’s aesthetics, I consulted several screenshots of Lara Croft GO and attempted to transpose its most pleasant design elements into Survival Ball.</p>

<p><img src="https://lopespm.github.io/files/sb_making_game/lara_croft_go_0.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="codebase">Codebase</h2>

<p>The prototype was a literal extension of the initial <a href="#prototype">wire chain and ball physics experiment</a>, and features were added at the same time I learned Unity’s ropes. This, added to rapid prototyping and little to no code architecture planning, resulted in a codebase that was entangled, difficult to follow and hard to extend.</p>

<p>The new version was built from scratch and several arquitectures were explored in the beginning of the project, until one was found to fit the game best. The chosen approach followed these principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each level had a single entry point, the game controller, which orquestrated the different actors.</li>
  <li>The game controller contained all top level parameters. Sub-parametrization was facilitated via <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html">Scriptable Objects</a>. For example, the PlayerController had PlayerParameters (which was a scriptable object) exposed on the game controller. The PlayerParameters could in turn have sub-parameters, if needed.</li>
  <li>Dynamic objects, such as the player, hazards and interactable level parts should be created programmatically whenever possible.</li>
  <li>The initial scene stage should only have static or decorative objects.</li>
  <li>Object …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>While working on another piece, I came upon the question of how much time is spent at traffic lights, for which there is not a well-sourced answer. I posted to Twitter and got some useful replies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Transport Twitter: What percent of total travel time is spent stopped at traffic lights? Empirical results please.</p>
<p>— David M. Levinson (@trnsprtst) <a href="https://twitter.com/trnsprtst/status/967547973788827648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With that and some additional digging, I attempt to answer the question.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: Your Mileage May Vary. This depends on your origin and destination and path and mode and time of day and local traffic signal policies and street design. <a href="https://twitter.com/tvanvuren">Tom VanVuren</a> notes: “Much of the impact is in slow moving queues, rather than waiting for the signal cycle to complete. I expect you can make this number smaller than 10% (time at the stop line) or larger than 50% (time affected by traffic lights).” For simplicity, I am considering vehicles that would be stopped if they could either move at the desired speed or must stop (i.e. they are subject to “vertical” or “stacking” queues), but clearly measurement will depend on assumption. Still, there must be a system average. I had heard the number 20% bandied about, which feels right, but let’s first begin with some thought experiment, then look for some empirical results. We take different modes in turn.</p>

<h2><strong>Thought Experiments</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Thought Experiment&nbsp;</strong><strong>1 A</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine an urban grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume 10 signalized intersections per km.</li>
<li>Assume a travel speed of 60 km/h when in motion. (This is probably too high with so many intersections and no platooning, but we are imagining here that you would not be stopping.)</li>
<li>Time to traverse 1 km=1 minute + signal delay. &nbsp;(Some of the distance traversal time overlaps some of the signal delay time, but we will imagine a stacking queue, rather than one that has physical distance for simplicity, we can correct this later if it matters.)</li>
<li>Assume each intersection has only 2 phases.</li>
<li>Assume fixed time signals at each intersection evenly distributing green time between N/S and E/W directions. &nbsp;So&nbsp;red time = 1/2 cycle length.</li>
<li>Assume 1 minute cycle length</li>
<li>If a vehicle stops, it waits 1/2 red time.</li>
<li>Vehicles obey traffic signals.</li>
<li>Assume no platooning.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This means that the average vehicle will&nbsp;stop at 5 intersections for 15 seconds each = 75 seconds (or 1.25 &nbsp;minutes) (vs. 1 &nbsp;minute in motion time). In this case, 1.25/2.25 minutes (55.5%) is spent waiting at signals.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Thought Experiment 1 B</strong></h3>
<p>In contrast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume near perfect platooning.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, the vehicle will stop at 1 intersection per km, for 15 seconds = 15 seconds. In this case 0.25/1.25 = 20% of the time is spent waiting at signals.</p>
<h3><strong>Discussion</strong></h3>
<p>Now, not all travel takes place on an urban grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume 25% of travel is on limited access roads (this is approximately true in the US), &nbsp;75% on non-limited access roads.</li>
</ul>
<p>With perfect platooning on the grid, and 25% off-grid, then 15% of travel time is intersection delay with near perfect platooning.</p>
<p>Clearly in practice platooning is far from perfect. My guess is the green wave breaks down after one or two intersections during peak times, but can survive well in the off-peak. As a rule of thumb, about ~10% of travel is in the peak hour, ~30% peak period. ~60% AM + PM Peak.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<h3>GPS Studies</h3>
<p>Eric Fischer of MapBox was kind enough to offer to run this question on their open traffic data. The results are not yet in. I will update when they are.</p>
<h3>Arterial Travel Time Studies</h3>
<p>There are a variety of Arterial Travel Time studies for specific corridors, but nothing that is universally generalizable. &nbsp;(And logically where people do arterial travel time studies, there is a congestion problem, otherwise why study it.)</p>
<p>I recall that in my childhood,<a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/179862"> I did a study in Montgomery County, Maryland</a>&nbsp;using such data (from 1987 traffic counts and a floating car study published by Douglas and Douglas), I did not actually compute the percentage, but fortunately I reported enough data that allows me to compute the percentage now. (The sample is of course biased to what is measured). For the average arterial link, the speed was</p>

<p>Which is consistent with expectations that signals are more significant in more urbanized areas (inside the beltway is basically Bethesda and Silver Spring, MD), and with our general estimates. Now of course the speed here is impacted by downstream signals, and so is lower than the speed limit and certainly lower than the free-flow speed sans-signals. More details are in the paper.</p>

<h3>Engine Idling Studies</h3>
<p>Moaz Ahmed pointed me to a<a href="https://tc.gc.ca/eng/policy/annual-2014-3141.html"> Vehicle Idling Study</a> by <a href="http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/communities-infrastructure/transportation/cars-light-trucks/idling/4415">Natural Resources Canada</a>.</p>
<p>The percent of time of vehicle idling ranged from 20-25%. (Not all vehicle idling is at signalized intersections).</p>
<p>(Engine idling of course burns fuel without doing work, so if the engine is going to be idling for an extended period, it would save fuel (and reduce air pollution) to turn it off. Turning the engine on and off also has costs, so the estimate was if idling was going to be longer than 10 seconds, it uses more fuel, but considering other wear and tear costs, the recommended threshold is if idling is longer than 60 seconds, then turn off the engine. &nbsp;But at a signalized intersection, how will vehicles know how long they will wait? Smart traffic signals with connected vehicles could provide this, but now they don’t. Eventually this will be moot with a full electric vehicle fleet. Until that time, it matters. I suspect given the longevity and sluggishness of the traffic control sector, smart signals informing trucks will not be widely or systematically deployed before trucks are electrified.)</p>

<p>Now as noted above, Your Mileage May Vary. If you are a pedestrian, you are unlikely to hit a greenwave designed for cars, though of course your travel speed is slower is well. So redoing the Thought Experiment</p>
<h2><strong>Thought Experiment 2</strong></h2>
<p>Imagine an urban grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume 10 signalized intersections per km.</li>
<li>Assume a travel speed of 6 km/h when in motion. (this is a bit on the high side, average pedestrian speed is closer to <a href="https://westernite.org/datacollectionfund/2005/psu_ped_summary.pdf">5 km/h</a>)</li>
<li>Time to traverse 1 km=10 minutes + signal delay. &nbsp;(Some of the distance traversal time overlaps some of the signal delay time, but we will imagine a vertical stacking queue, rather than one that has physical distance for simplicity, this is a much better assumption for pedestrians than vehicles.)</li>
<li>Assume each intersection has only 2 phases.</li>
<li>Assume fixed time signals at each intersection evenly distributing green time between N/S and E/W directions. &nbsp;So&nbsp;red time = 1/2 cycle length.</li>
<li>Assume 1 minute cycle length</li>
<li>If a pedestrian stops, she waits 1/2 red time. (That is the “walk” phase for pedestrians is as long as the green phase for cars. Strictly speaking this is not true, it is more true in cities with narrow streets than it is in suburban environments with wide streets, as narrow streets can be crossed more quickly, so the amount of “walk” time allocated can be most of the phase. This is certainly not true in Sydney, where the “walk” phase is cut short so turning cars have fewer conflicts with late pedestrians.)</li>
<li>Pedestrians obey traffic lights. &nbsp;(This is not as good an assumption as vehicles obey signals, pedestrian signal violation is probably higher. This is not a moral judgment one way or the other, people tend to obey authority, even when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">authority abuses power</a>.)</li>
<li>Assume no platooning. (This is probably too severe, a quick pedestrian with some signal coordination can probably make a couple of lights in a row).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here the average pedestrian will&nbsp;stop at 5 intersections for 15 seconds each = 2.5 minutes (vs. 10 &nbsp;minute in-motion time). In this case, 2.5/(2.5+10) minutes (or 20%) is spent waiting at signals. Now, this number is probably true for more pedestrians than the vehicle delay estimate is for vehicles, since pedestrians are more likely to be found on an urban grid and less in a suburban or limited access environment. (Self-selection at work).</p>

<p>If you are a bicyclist, you are unlikely to hit a greenwave designed for cars unless you travel at exactly an integer fraction (1/1, 1/2, 1/3) of the green wave, as your travel speed is slower is well. So redoing the Thought Experiment</p>
<h2><strong>Thought Experiment 3</strong></h2>
<p>Imagine an urban grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume 10 signalized intersections per km.</li>
<li>Assume a travel speed of &nbsp;20 km/h when in motion. (This is a typical for <a href="http://www.road-bike.co.uk/articles/average-speed.php">experienced riders</a>).&nbsp;Time to traverse 1 km=3 minutes + signal delay. (Assume a stacking queue)</li>
<li>Assume each intersection has only 2 phases.</li>
<li>Assume fixed time signals at each intersection evenly distributing green time between N/S and E/W directions. &nbsp;So&nbsp;red time = 1/2 cycle length.</li>
<li>Assume 1 minute cycle length</li>
<li>If a bicyclist stops, she waits 1/2 red time. (That is the ‘bike’ phase for bicyclists is as long as the green phase for cars.)</li>
<li>Bicyclists obey traffic lights. &nbsp;(This is not as good an assumption as ‘motor vehicles obey signals’, bicyclists signal violation is probably higher.)</li>
<li>Assume no platooning. (This is probably too severe, a quick bicyclists with some signal coordination can probably make a couple of lights in a row).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case the average bicyclists will&nbsp;stop at 5 intersections for 15 seconds each = 2.5 minutes (vs. 3 &nbsp;minute in-motion time). In this case, 2.5/(3+2.5) minutes (or 45%) is spent waiting at signals in an urban environment.</p>
<h2>Strava Data</h2>
<p>Strava, an app for tracking bicyclists and runners can produce some useful data. <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_hsu">Andrew Hsu</a>, e.g., <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/16556#interval_type?chart_type=hours&amp;interval_type=week&amp;interval=201807&amp;year_offset=0">reports</a>&nbsp;“28 mile bike commute. 1:30-ish moving time. 10-15 minutes waiting at lights.” From this, for him, we estimate 15 / (15+90) = 14%. To be clear, 1:30 is an extreme commute. I don’t have access to …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>A while ago, I released <a href="https://orib.dev/git9.html">git9</a>, a git client for
Plan 9. However, it always felt like it was missing something: A git server.
over a few weekends of work, I sat down and put one together. This Labor
Day weekend, I took the opportunity to labor on it, and got something working.</p>

<h3>usage</h3>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> is a git server designed to fit into the Plan
9 ecosystem, allowing hosting of, and interacting with, code on a Plan 9
server, while still allowing legacy clients running on Unix to get a copy
of the code.</p>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> only speaks the <code>git://</code> protocol.
But because it runs behind
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/listen">aux/listen</a>
and 
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/tlssrv"><code>tlssrv</code></a>, we
effectively get two additional protocols for free: <code>gits://</code>, or
TLS-encrypted <code>git://</code>, and <code>hjgit://</code>, which is
<code>git://</code> but with Plan 9 authentication to support user login
over TLS. Unfortunately, only the unencrypted <code>git://</code> protocol
is supported out of the box by upstream git. There may be ways to solve
this, using <a href="https://rovaughn.github.io/2015-2-9.html">custom
transports</a>, and a unix port of tlsclient</p>

<p>To start a <code>git://</code> server, just run it under aux/listen1.
To enable encryption and user authentication, run it under
<code>tlssrv -a</code>. This doesn't need a certificate, because
the Plan 9 authentication generates the secret used for TLS. And,
finally, if you just want encryption, you can use <code>tlsclient</code>
with a certificate.</p>

<pre># git:// server, serving every repository under the current directory
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' git/serve -r `{pwd}

# gits:// server, doing the same: But with encryption.
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -c /path/to/cert.pem git/serve -r `{pwd}

# hjgit:// server doing the same: Requires account on server to connect
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -a git/serve -r `{pwd}
</pre>

<p>If you want to allow people to write, you can just add the
<code>-w</code> flag to git/serve. While you can do this on
any of the protocols, keep in mind that only <code>hjgit://</code>
authenticates the users. Push to the world, but don't let the
world push to you!</p>



<p>All the protocols git uses are closely related. The <code>ssh://</code>
protocol is just the <code>git://</code> protocol, with the command selected
sightly differently. The smart <code>http://</code> protocols are the same
as the <code>git://</code> protocol, with a different handshake, and split
over multiple post requests.</p>

<p>Git9 implements the git protocol in under 500 lines of C. The
full code is available on github, in
<a href="https://github.com/oridb/git9/blob/24abe6c00b6f65e7241763399fc72c043b7d9bbf/serve.c">serve.c</a>.
</p>

<p>The protocol look something like this for pushing:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 0086:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 009d:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 refs/heads/master\n"
&lt;=w= 0076:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\0report-status\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= <pack-data>
=r=&gt; 000e:	unpack ok
=r=&gt; 0019:	ok refs/heads/master
</pack-data></pre>

<p>And this for pulling:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-upload-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
<pack-data>
</pack-data></pre>

<p>The git protocol consists of pkt-lines, which are strings with a
hex-formatted length prefix.  The length prefix includes itself.  So,
the string <code>"hi"</code> would be formatted as
<code>0006hi</code>. A zero lenth packet where the length prefix
is not included is special. This is called a 'flush packet', and
is used to terminate a phase of negotiation.</p>

<p> All negotiation is with these packet lines, at
which git flips over to pure binary mode to transfer a pack file
over.</p>

<p>In the <code>git://</code> protocol, the client always starts off
by saying which action it wants to do: Either it wants the server to
fetch a pack from the client, or it wants the server to upload a pack
to the client.  That's this line:</p><pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
</pre>

<p>The upload side of this protocol is simpler on the server side so
we'll go through it first.</p>

<h3>pushing</h3>

<p>In the upload protocol, the server begins by sending a list of
references that the client may update. In <code>git/serve</code>
we grab all the refs in the repository, and filter down to just
the ones beginning with <code>heads/</code>.</p>

<pre>	if((nrefs = listrefs(&amp;refs, &amp;names)) == -1)
		sysfatal("listrefs: %r");
	for(i = 0; i &lt; nrefs; i++){
		if(strncmp(names[i], "heads/", strlen("heads/")) != 0)
			continue;
		if(fmtpkt(c, "%H refs/%s\n", refs[i], names[i]) == -1)
			goto error;
	}
	if(flushpkt(c) == -1)
		goto error;
</pre>

<p>With the first phase of the protocol, the client then
sends the list of references it wants to update. This
takes the form of:</p>

<pre>	OLDHASH NEWHASH heads/refs/updateme\n"
</pre>

<p>Because the client knows what the reference versions are on
the server, it can compute what commits are between the version
on the server and the version that it has. If the new hash
is the zero hash, this signals to the server that the reference
should be deleted. This list of updates is terminated with a
flush packet. The code in git9 that handles this is below:

</p><pre>	while(1){
		/* Did we get a packet? */
		if((n = readpkt(c, pkt, sizeof(pkt))) == -1)
			goto error;
		/* Was it a flush packet? */
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		/* Split it up into the 3 parts: old, new, reference */
		if(getfields(pkt, sp, nelem(sp), 1, " \t\n\r") != 3){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR  protocol garble %s\n", pkt);
			goto error;
		}
		/* verify that these are valid hashes */
		if(hparse(&amp;old, sp[0]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad old hash %s\n", sp[0]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(hparse(&amp;new, sp[1]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad new hash %s\n", sp[1]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and valid refs */
		if(!validref(sp[2])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR invalid ref %s\n", sp[2]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and then remember them for when we do the update */
		*cur = erealloc(*cur, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*upd = erealloc(*upd, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*ref = erealloc(*ref, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		(*cur)[*nupd] = old;
		(*upd)[*nupd] = new;
		(*ref)[*nupd] = estrdup(sp[2]);
		*nupd += 1;
	}
</pre>

<p>Next, the client uploads the pack. This is a blob containing
the commit data. It goes into <code>.git/objects/packs/recv-$pid.pack</code>,
at least until we can index it and rename it.</p>

<pre>	while(1){
		n = read(c-&gt;rfd, buf, sizeof(buf));
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		if(n == -1 || write(pfd, buf, n) != n)
			return -1;
		packsz += n;
	}
	if(checkhash(pfd, packsz, &amp;h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "hash mismatch\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(indexpack(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "indexing failed\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(rename(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "rename failed: %r\n");
		goto error2;
	}
</pre>

<p>Finally, we update the references. Note that we haven't
locked the repository yet. This is because none of the data
we have here can conflict: All objects are addressed by hash,
so a race would simply leave us with a duplicate hash in the
packfile. Eventually, a <code>git/repack</code> will clean
that up.</p>

<p>However, updating the references can conflict. So,
for updating the references, we acquire a lock file.
We then read all the references, make sure that they
match the old reference, and then write in the new
reference.</p>

<pre>	for(i = 0; i &lt; nupd; i++){
		if(resolveref(&amp;h, ref[i]) == 0 &amp;&amp; !hasheq(&amp;h, &amp;cur[i])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR old ref changed: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((o = readobject(upd[i])) == nil){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR update to nonexistent hash %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(o-&gt;type != GCommit){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR not commit: %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		unref(o);
		if(snprint(refpath, sizeof(refpath), ".git/%s", ref[i]) == sizeof(refpath)){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR ref path too long: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((fd = create(refpath, OWRITE, 0644)) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR open ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		if(fprint(fd, "%H", upd[i]) == -1){
			close(fd);
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR upate ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		close(fd);
	}
</pre>

<p>And that's pushing.

</p><h3>pulling</h3>

<p>Pulling takes more work on the server side, because the
server needs to compute a reasonable packfile to send to
the client. The protocol itself is still fairly simple.</p>

<p>It begins the same way as pushing, by sending all the
branches that a client may want to obtain from the git
repository.</p>

<pre>=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
</pre>

<p>The client then starts telling us what commits they want,
and what commits they have. This lets us find a graph difference
between the server and client graph, and generate a pack file
that contains few, if any, extraneous commits. </p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
</pre>

<p>Computing the commits that go into a pack is not always trivial.
The comits that the client may be on may have "bubbles" in the graph,
so simply walking back from the start of the graph to the commits
that the client has may end up walking around the commit, leading
to nearly the whole history of the repository being sent, instead
of just one or two commits.</p>

<p>Consider a repo where the server is ahead of the client, and
now the client is trying to pull the changes. The client has commits
<code>c</code>, and we're trying to compute a pack with only the
commits <code>o</code>.</p>


<pre>                o---o
               /     \
    --c---c---c---c---o---o &lt;-- server
                  ^
                client
</pre>

<p>The client does a git/pull, and sends that it has the
commit marked <code>[c]</code>. Since the server has
every commit the client does, and more, it can look at
all ancestors of the client commit. If we're smart, we
would, but a naive …</p></div>

					<div><p>Brent Morris eagerly studied the figures. Rows and rows of neatly arranged, entirely indecipherable markings, like hieroglyphs or Chinese hanzi, only written in Greek or Latin or Hebrew. In the center, a pyramid made of 14 rows of blocks encased the letter <em>S</em> with a horizontal line above it. Elsewhere on the page, which was taken from an obscure 19th-century text, appeared other illustrations: in one corner, an open book adorned with strange lettering; in another, a scroll surrounded by a skull, stars, and a crescent moon.</p><p>Other people had puzzled over the page before, reproduced in a volume titled <i>A History of Royal Arch Masonry</i>. And yet to Morris, it wasn’t bewilderment or frustration that seized him when he looked over the mysterious passage in the late 1970s. It was exhilaration.</p><p>No wonder: By day, Morris worked as a mathematical cryptologist for the National Security Agency, studying, developing, and breaking codes for secret government communications. In his free time, Morris was—and still remains—an active Freemason, a 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite, an editor of the <a href="https://scottishrite.org/media-publications/scottish-rite-journal/the-scottish-rite-journal/journals/"><i>Scottish Rite Journal</i></a>, a former master of the <a href="https://www.quatuorcoronati.com/">Quatuor Coronati</a> research lodge, and an affiliate of dozens of lodges and concordant bodies. So the case of the Masonic cipher spoke to both sides of his brain.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t the first time Morris had encountered secret Masonic writings. For hundreds of years and across many countries, Masons have used codes to mask communications of various kinds. According to Masonic lore, the first such cipher was cut with a mallet and chisel and used by Hiram, the king of Tyre; Hiram Abif; and Solomon, the king of Israel. By the 17th century, references abounded to the “Masonic word” known only to members. “By the 1700s, this arcane knowledge was part of the mystique of the Masons,” Morris says.</p><p>French Masons in the 18th century further popularized this sort of clandestine writing, including use of the Pigpen cipher, which came to be known as the Masonic cipher and drew characters based on a tic-tac-toe or X-shaped grid. These simple substitution codes, in which a new figure or character replaces each letter of the alphabet, are crude and easy to break, Morris explains. Yet they provide just enough of a barrier to the noninitiate to safeguard a message—at least for a while. “It’s somewhat useful in that it lets you preserve secret information, but more important, it becomes a symbol of secrecy,” Morris says. “It’s like when you get the key to a city: It doesn’t really unlock anything.”</p><p>Such substitution ciphers proliferated through various grand lodges in the 19th and 20th centuries, and keys to many were even sold in guidebooks by Masonic publishers. Today the use of Masonic codes remains common, although in place of formal ciphers, ritual training manuals are often written in a sort of shorthand, or what Morris describes as an “aide-memoir.” “It provides a sort of casual security,” he says. “So if you left it on a coffee table or an airplane seat, anyone who picked it up would go, ‘Huh, what’s this?’” Morris explains their use this way: “Think about the lock on a door. Sometimes it’s not that strong, but all you need is something to keep the dog in the house.”</p><p>The cipher Morris encountered in <i>A History of Royal Arch Masonry</i>, part of a manuscript belonging to a Dr. Robert Folger of New York dated 1827, was altogether different. Where other Masonic ciphers used simple, mono-alphabetic substitutions, the Folger manuscript was far more complex. Each figure, or hieroglyph, seemed to be composed of several characters nestled into groups. Morris puzzled over the enigma, using his usual code-breaking techniques, but without luck. He referenced the Folger cipher in an <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0161-118391857766?needAccess=true&amp;">article on fraternal cryptography</a> he wrote for the summer 1978 issue of the NSA’s internal journal, <i>Cryptolog</i>, and at the same time shared it with a fellow cryptanalyst named Donald Bennett.</p></div>

					<div><div><p>Bennett <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/cryptologic-spectrum/unsolved_puzzle.pdf">attacked the cipher with zeal</a>—and a lot of patience. He started out by scanning the document for clues related to frequency. For instance, among characters grouped together inside a box, 42 percent included a horizontal line near the top. Surmising that the box stood for the first letter of the word and the line for the second, Bennett hypothesized that the line stood for the letter <i>E</i>, the most common letter in English (and the letter most frequently appearing as the second letter of a word). Then he searched for repeating digraphs, or pairs of strokes appearing together. In English, a common example is <i>Q-U</i>. That turned up a distinctive pairing in the text: a crescent-moon shape followed by a backward gamma figure. It couldn’t be <i>Q-U</i>, however, because in several instances it appeared at what Bennett determined must be the end of a word. (No English words end with <i>Q-U</i>.) But it did suggest another common pairing: <i>T-H</i>. By focusing on figures containing the likely <i>T-H </i>digraph, Bennett was able to zero in on what he believed was a four-letter word that read <i>TH_T</i>. The only possible word it could be was <i>THAT</i>. Armed with this knowledge, he now knew the symbol for the letter <i>A</i>—a single dot. Having shaken loose the letters <i>T</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>A</i>, and <i>E</i>, he was able to hunt for longer words.</p><p>Here, Bennett relied on Morris for additional hints.</p><p>In any text, there’s a coded element hiding in plain sight: the language itself. “There’s specialized terminology in just about everything,” Morris says. For instance, in an academic setting, correspondence is likely to contain references to <i>semesters</i>, <i>adjuncts</i>, <i>symposia</i>, or <i>deans</i>—all familiar enough English words, but rarely used outside a collegiate environment. For anyone who’s read through an uncoded Masonic writing, the experience of feeling overwhelmed by the lexicon is all too familiar. Words like <i>brethren</i>, <i>ashlar</i>, and <i>cowan </i>occur far more frequently within Freemasonry than outside it. Armed with a list of common Masonic terms, Bennett inferred that, for example, the frequently occurring figure he interpreted as <i>T_ _TH </i>was more likely to be <i>TRUTH </i>than, say, <i>TENTH</i>.</p><p>From there, more coded terms could be pried open. Bennett hunted for two-letter possibilities like <i>TO </i>and <i>OR</i>. Then three-letter words like <i>OUR </i>were within his grasp. Next he searched for double letters, as in <i>EFFORT</i>. On and on he went, picking apart each graphic for clues, cautiously making assumptions, testing them, and swapping in letters as they were revealed. Before long, he had 15 characters deciphered, then 20. Finally, he’d recovered the entire alphabet, along with several figures that represented common words like <i>AND</i>, <i>HIS</i>, and <i>THEY</i>.</p></div></div>

				<div>
					<div><div><p>In relatively short order, Bennett produced a rough translation of the manuscript, which read like a homily on the importance of the Bible as a guidebook for living—possibly a speech to be delivered to initiates. While the excerpt was not familiar to Morris as being from a regular Masonic degree, it seemed clearly related to the craft. In fact, the word <i>Masonry </i>appeared on line three, and the phrase <i>newly enrolled initiate </i>was used several times throughout. Reviewing it, Morris determined that the lecture must come from a Master Mason degree in a French-style lodge—a strange possession for a 19th century American Mason in New York.</p><p>Even with the text deciphered, the mystery felt unsolved. The <i>what </i>of the cipher had been cracked. The <i>why </i>remained.</p></div></div>

				<div>
					<div><div><p>So Morris took up the case again, trying to piece together information about the text’s purpose and its author. He knew that the manuscript had been recovered from a journal kept by a Robert Benjamin Folger, a New York physician and Freemason. On the title page, the journal reads that it should be bequeathed to a Brother Dr. Hans B. Gram, and that if he’s unable to take possession of it, it should pass to a Mr. Ferdinand Halsey, “to preserve the substance in his mind while he [committed] the manuscript to the flames.”</p><p>Morris began to research the mysterious Dr. Folger, combing through Masonic records and meeting minutes. The picture the materials painted was one of an enthusiastic, if somewhat freewheeling, Freemason.</p><p>Folger was born in 1803 in Hudson, New York, and moved to New York City in 1817, where he apprenticed to become an apothecary. In 1824, he was initiated at Fireman’s Lodge No. 368, and he set out on a dizzying campaign of Masonic endeavors. Two years after his first initiation, he joined the Jerusalem Chapter of the Royal Arch, was received in a council of the Royal and Select Masters, and was dubbed a Knight Templar in Columbia Encampment No. 1. Soon after, he helped launch a new and short-lived chapter of the Royal Arch, received the fourth through 32nd degrees of the Scottish Rite, and joined the Lafayette Chapter of the Rose Croix. At the time he wrote his cipher, Folger was senior warden of the newly chartered Zerubabel Lodge No. 242.</p><p>From there, Folger rose—and fell—rapidly through the various appendant bodies. Partly that was a result of his own almost boundless zeal for …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></div>

                        <div><p>
                            There are a few reasons you may need to be able to prove who you are without revealing who you are.</p><p>
                            
                            Suppose you desire to share many different pieces of information online but must remain anonymous for security reasons. Since you are anonymous, you have no reputation online and therefore no trust or credibility.<br>
                            You can release one piece of information that will later prove to be true, thus gaining credibility for yourself. People will now take your information seriously, except you were fully anonymous, so that credibility is useless to you as you can't claim it in the future when sharing future information.<br>
                            What's worse, others may impersonate you, claiming to be the original author of the first piece of information, and then share bad information thus soiling all of the credibility you built up.</p><p>
                            
                            With AnoProof you can sign your first piece of information with an AnoProof signature using your AnoProof secret key.<br>
                            Now, once it gains credibility, you can sign your future informations with your same secret key.<br>
                            Using AnoProof, anyone can verify that the future information (signed) was authored by the same anonymous author as the original credible information.
                            </p></div><hr>
                            <p>
                            AnoProof doesn't always have to be used anonymously, another great use-case for AnoProof is in proving your known identity, online, in an ever increasing world of spoofing, deep-fakes, and general impersonation.</p><p>
                            
                            Consider the <a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/leoni-ag-email-scam-40-million-ceo-hack-september-2016/">case of Leoni AG</a>, in which the CEO instructed the CFO to wire transfer $40m to an offshore account, the only problem for the CFO, it wasn't a true eMail from the CEO, it was a hacker pretending to be the CEO.<br>
                            Had the company policy been that all instructions of such nature must be signed with an AnoProof signature, the CFO could have easily proven that the hackers weren't the CEO.</p><p>
                            
                            This example was just a simple eMail spoofing, but imagine a few years from now when DeepFakes, SIM spoofing, and a combination of other tools will allow a hacker to video call one of your employees, and pretend to be you not only with caller ID but visibly and audibly as well.<br>
                            Signing protocols like AnoProof will become more and more necessary in the identity verification crisis realm AI will bring us towards.</p><hr>
                            <p>
                            To use AnoProof, simply paste, verbatim, two messages that have AnoProof signatures, in the text boxes at the bottom of this page, then tap the 'Verify' button.</p><p>

He feels that he’s letting valuable time slip through the cracks, and perhaps now is the moment to do something about it.</p><p>After reviewing his financial situation and seeing that he has enough, he decides to take a deep breath and <a href="https://moretothat.com/take-the-leap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make the leap</a>.</p><p>He hands in his resignation letter. It’s over. He packs up all his stuff, and gets into his car.</p><p>A rush of excitement takes hold.

If this is what it’s like to have Creativity with him all the time, then everyday would be an opportunity to get so much done.</p><p>Since Stan is a disciplined guy, he blocks out a set number of hours each day to sit down in front of his notebook and get to work. The first week of this new schedule runs smoothly – whenever it’s time to make something, Creativity is there and everything flows without question.</p><p>Stan manages to keep up this daily routine for a number of weeks, and everything is going well.</p><p>But one day, something weird happens.</p><p>Stan gets up, arrives at his workspace at his predetermined time, sits down to start, but then it hits him:</p><p>He has no clue what the hell he wants to make.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page.png" alt="Looking at a blank page" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>This is strange. Not only is his mind blank, but he also can’t seem to locate his friend either.

Maybe it’s still sleeping?</p><p>Stan tries to go at it alone, but no matter how much he thinks, nothing substantive comes to mind.

He thinks to himself:</p><p><em>What was the point of quitting my job to do this, when I’m not spending 8 hours each day on it? I should have just kept my job and reserved this for the evenings like before. At this rate, I would be spending the same amount of hours on my creative work in both scenarios anyway…</em></p><p>Frustrated, Stan decides to spend the day at a nearby park, bringing a book with him to keep him company. He finds a nice, shaded bench on this beautiful sunny afternoon, sitting atop a small hill that overlooks a familiar city skyline. He’s been to this park many times before, but for some reason, today he feels compelled to take a closer look at his surroundings.</p><p>He surveys the landscape, and his eyes are drawn to the blades of grass that cushion the feet of humans and animals alike. The innumerable blades sway back and forth, dancing to the gentle rhythm of a wind that ebbs and flows. He can’t quite understand why this simple sight is so beautiful, yet he feels it viscerally.</p><p>Nostalgia then sweeps through him. He’s reminded of all the times his childhood friend would join him at this very park, chasing him through the patches of green that have now turned yellow. Those were simpler times, and even amidst the increasing complexities of life, their <a href="https://moretothat.com/are-you-my-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">friendship continued to grow</a>, and they remain best friends to this day.</p><p>Thinking about this, Stan decides to pick up the phone and give him a call.

Why didn’t Creativity show up when he needed it most, and instead it’s showing up when he’s getting ready for bed?</p><p>Matter of fact, what’s Creativity’s deal here?! Why has it been perpetually absent over the past few days? Has it been avoiding him the whole time?</p><p>These are all interesting questions, but in asking them, Stan is missing something important here:</p><p>He is unaware that <span><strong>creating things is just a small part of what Creativity is all about</strong></span>.</p><p>Stan believes that Creativity starts and ends with the time they spend working on things with each other. That it lives in the space between the moment he opens his notebook and the time he closes it.</p><p>But in reality, that’s only the final stage of Creativity’s entire routine.</p><p>Most of Creativity’s time is spent following Stan around as he lives his day-to-day life. Even if Stan doesn’t realize it, Creativity is always in the background, observing what he’s doing and taking note of everything that’s going on. Whether it arrives in the form of experience or knowledge, Creativity is there to document whatever is happening at various times.</p><p>For example, when Stan was at the park, speaking with his childhood friend about the course of their lives, Creativity was there to take note of what he was thinking:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park.png" alt="Creativity taking notes at the park" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Whenever Stan is enjoying a book and engaging with the author in this way, Creativity is there to keep track of what he’s learning:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading.png" alt="Creativity taking notes while reading book" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>And even when Stan was at his <a href="https://moretothat.com/pointless-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boring old job</a>, Creativity was there observing what he was pondering.

The first word you write is a distillation of the knowledge you’ve accumulated over time. The first brushstroke you paint is a reimagining of the experiences you’ve stored somewhere in the mind.</p><p>While Stan was working at his old job, Creativity was building out an extensive list for him. But since he wasn’t investing the time necessary to compress it regularly, the list went largely untouched. A vast resource was accumulating, but nothing was processed or cultivated.</p><p>So when Stan first left his job, this untapped list was essentially gifted to him. This is why Stan was able to spend entire weekdays making things with ease. There was so much to sift through, so much for him to distill.</p><p>But after weeks of output without adding any new experiences of his own, he soon had nothing left in the tank. When Stan arrived at his notebook that day to find Creativity missing, it wasn’t actually gone.</p><p>It was hovering in the background, hoping that Stan would give it reason to take out its notepad and document things for later.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something.png" alt="Go and do something" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>We often glamorize Creativity as this whirlwind of activity that culminates in greatness.

internal workings of some of the core algorithms that underly Dolt's
implementation. The previous posts in this series were about:</p>

</ol>
<p>In this post, we explore the Merkle DAG structure underlying Dolt's
commit graph and table storage a little more, and investigate how push
and pull to remote repositories is implemented in Dolt.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A Dolt repository contains any number of branches and tags, where each
branch or tag is a top-level reference to a particular commit. A
commit, in turn, points to a value of the database at that commit, and
0 or more parent commits. All data in the repository, the commits and
the table data, is stored in content-addressed <code>Chunk</code>s which in turn
can contain references to other <code>Chunk</code>s, forming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle
DAG</a>. This was the example
of a three commit branch from our previous blog post on the commit
graph:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Dolt supports remotes, which means it can clone, push and pull branch
and tag references from a Dolt repository stored in
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">Dolthub</a> or in cloud storage like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS
S3</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Google Cloud
Storage</a>. This blog post briefly
explores what Dolt remotes are and how they operate under the hood.</p>
<h2>A Dolt Remote</h2>
<p>A Dolt repository can have multiple remote repositories configured,
and each of these repositories can be fetched from and pushed to
separately. Each configured Dolt remote consists of three pieces of
configuration within a Dolt repository:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the remote. After a clone, this will be <code>origin</code>.</li>
<li>Configuration for a networked endpoint that implements a network
protocol that Dolt can use as a remote. Most commonly, this is the
GRPC API exported by <a href="https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/">https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com</a> and a
Dolthub repository path like <code>Liquidata/image-net</code>.</li>
<li>Default fetch specs for the remote. After a clone, this will be
<code>refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</code>, and most users never need to
interact directly with fetch specs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fetch spec is the subtlest piece of the configuration, but it's
also fundamental to the way that remotes actually work. The above
fetch spec says: When we <code>fetch</code> from <code>origin</code>, create a new <code>ref</code> in
<code>refs/remotes/origin/...</code> for each ref we find in the remote at
<code>refs/heads/...</code>. <code>refs/heads/...</code> will be all the branches in the
remote, and so fetching from the remote will create corresponding refs
in our local repository for each branch in the remote repository. If
the remote had the branches <code>main</code>, <code>bh/agi</code> and <code>aaron/by-zip</code>, and
we fetched from it, Dolt would create the refs
<code>refs/remotes/origin/main</code>, <code>refs/remotes/origin/bh/agi</code> and
<code>refs/remotes/origin/aaron/by-zip</code>, each pointing at the corresponding
commits that the remote branches were pointing at when we ran the
<code>fetch</code>.</p>
<p>So the remotes <code>ref</code>s namespace is seperate from our local branches
namespace, and Dolt is keeping a copy of the branches that we fetch
from the remote locally. The only time that copy is updated, and the
only time we reference the remote generally, is when we run <code>dolt
fetch</code> (or <code>dolt pull</code>, which does a <code>fetch</code> and then <code>merge</code>). And
the fundamental operation involved in a <code>fetch</code> is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contact the remote to list all the branches we will clone.</li>
<li>For each branch we will clone, update our local repository to
contain the referenced Commit <code>Chunk</code> and all <code>Chunk</code>s reachable from
it.</li>
<li>Set a corresponding <code>ref</code> in our local repository to point to the
newly fetched Commit <code>Chunk</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step #2 is where all the missing data actually gets copied into our
local repository. Let's take a look at exactly how that happens.</p>
<h2>Chunk Stores and DAG Traversals</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, all the data in the repository, both Commits and
the table data, is stored in these content-addressed variable sized
blocks called <code>Chunk</code>s. A storage abstraction exists in the Dolt
storage layer called a <code>ChunkStore</code>, which is a place where we can
read, and potentially write, chunks.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>package</span> chunk

<span>type</span> Address <span>[</span><span>20</span><span>]</span><span>byte</span>

<span>type</span> Chunk <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>Refs</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>Address
    
    <span>Bytes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>byte</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> Store <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Has</span><span>(</span>addr Address<span>)</span> <span>bool</span>
    <span>Get</span><span>(</span>addr Address<span>)</span> Chunk
    <span>Put</span><span>(</span>contents Chunk<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can create a <code>Store</code> implementation for a remote repository which
is hosted in DoltHub, and we have a <code>Store</code> implementation for our
local repository as well. A simple recursive DAG walk to copy a given
commit (or any <code>Chunk</code> with all of its children) into our local
repository looks like:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>CopyChunks</span><span>(</span>to<span>,</span> from Store<span>,</span> a Address<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>!</span>to<span>.</span><span>Has</span><span>(</span>a<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		c <span>:=</span> from<span>.</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span>a<span>)</span>
		<span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> r <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> c<span>.</span><span>Refs</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>Fetch</span><span>(</span>to<span>,</span> from<span>,</span> r<span>)</span>
		<span>}</span>
		to<span>.</span><span>Put</span><span>(</span>c<span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This approach already has some nice properties. Ideally, if a <code>Chunk</code>
is in a <code>Store</code>, all the <code>Chunk</code>s it references would also be in the
<code>Store</code>. We don't want our algorithm to persist any <code>Chunk</code>s to the
<code>Store</code> whose children we haven't already fetched and persisted,
because if the algorithm gets aborted halfway through the <code>Store</code>
could then be in an inconsistent state. So we're careful not to <code>Put</code>
the fetched <code>Chunk</code> until its children are persisted.</p>
<h2>Better Performance With Batching</h2>
<p>In Go, the recursion is not much of a concern because goroutines have
on-heap growable stacks. But if it is a concern, it's easy to
translate the call stack state into an explicit stack with on-heap
state as well.</p>
<p>The above algorithm has one glaring issue: it's very slow. If <code>from</code>
is a remote <code>Store</code>, then every <code>Get</code> is a round-trip RPC, and as
written there's no capacity for pipelining or batching. The simplest
solution is to make the batching explicit. We can give <code>Store</code> batch
methods, and make <code>CopyChunks</code> take a slice of <code>Address</code>es instead:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> Store <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
    
    
    <span>HasMany</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>Address<span>)</span> <span>(</span>present<span>,</span> missing <span>[</span><span>]</span>Address<span>)</span>
    
    
    <span>GetMany</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>Address<span>)</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>Chunk
    
    <span>PutMany</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>Chunk<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>CopyChunks</span><span>(</span>to<span>,</span> from Store<span>,</span> as <span>[</span><span>]</span>Address<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>_</span><span>,</span> missing <span>:=</span> to<span>.</span><span>HasMany</span><span>(</span>as<span>)</span>
	chunks <span>:=</span> from<span>.</span><span>GetMany</span><span>(</span>missing<span>)</span>
	nextlevel <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>Address<span>{</span><span>}</span>
	<span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> c <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> chunks <span>{</span>
		nextlevel <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span>nextlevel<span>,</span> c<span>.</span><span>Refs</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>
	<span>CopyChunks</span><span>(</span>to<span>,</span> from<span>,</span> nextlevel<span>)</span>
	to<span>.</span><span>PutMany</span><span>(</span>chunks<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That improves the round-trips for remote clones substantially and
allows for better bandwidth utilization. But it introduces two new
flaws.</p>
<ol>
<li>Memory usage is potentially unwieldy. In the batched version, we're
holding a potentially large number of <code>Chunk</code>s in memory at every call
to <code>CopyChunks</code>, and we're making a call to <code>GetMany</code> with an
unbounded number of <code>Address</code>es. Previously we were only holding one
<code>Chunk</code> in memory at each level of the call.</li>
<li>It potentially fetches the same <code>Chunk</code>s from <code>from</code> multiple
times. Two different length paths through the DAG to the same <code>Chunk</code>
will have <code>to.HasMany()</code> returning <code>missing</code> for the same <code>Chunk</code>
multiple times, with consequent calls to <code>GetMany()</code> with the same
addresses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Addressing those actually gets somewhat complicated. In Dolt, for #1
we form explicit RPC batches and write the fetched <code>Chunk</code>s to
temporary chunk files so that they don't have to stay in memory. The
temporary files are constructed so that they can be cheaply integrated
into the <code>to</code> <code>Store</code> when all their dependencies are
persisted. Addressing #2 involves adding a little bit of book keeping
across recursive calls.  But perfect behavior with regards to case #2
is actually a tradeoff between the batch sizes and memory usage. Once
the chunk from a higher level leaves memory and goes into the
temporary chunk file, it needs to be refetched from the remote or from
the disk in order to be incorporated in the <code>to</code> <code>Store</code> earlier than
its peers.</p>
<h2>Fetch and Push</h2>
<p>It's neat that the above algorithm works great whether operation is a
<code>push</code> or a <code>fetch</code>. If the remote <code>Store</code> is <code>from</code>, we're doing a
<code>fetch</code> and we will get new chunks from the remote into our local
<code>Store</code>. But we can also make the remote <code>Store</code> <code>to</code>, in which case
its a <code>push</code>—the remote <code>Store</code> gets the new <code>Chunk</code>s that were
unique to our local <code>Store</code>. In either case, once all the <code>Chunk</code>s are
persisted in the <code>to</code> <code>Store</code>, we can update any <code>refs</code> appropriately,
setting them to point to the newly persisted commit <code>Chunk</code>s based on
the operation we're performing and the fetch/push specs as
appropriate.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dolt remotes are a powerful feature that allows for data
synchronization, collaboration and easily maintaining local changes
while tracking upstreams. Underlying the feature is a simple model for
how to build up the commit graph and the table data as a merkle DAG of
content addressed chunks. Building on top of that model allows for
<code>push</code> and <code>fetch</code> to be both be implemented by the same elegant DAG
walk. At the same time, practical engineering and performance concerns
introduce an opportunity for tradeoffs and optimization. Hopefully
we've given you some insight into the ways that Dolt approaches and
solves the issues underlying its implementation.</p></div></div>]]>

    <h2 id="just-for-fun">Just For Fun</h2>

<p>I finally managed to get a complete piglit run over the weekend, and, for my own amusement, I decided to check the timediffs against a reference run from the IRIS driver. Given that the Intel drivers are of extremely high quality (and are direct interfaces to the underlying hardware that I happen to be using), I tend to use ANV and IRIS as my references whenever I’m trying to debug things.</p>

<p>Both runs used the same base checkout from mesa, so all the core/gallium/nir parts were identical.</p>

<p>The results weren’t what I expected.</p>

<p>My expectation when I clicked into the timediffs page was that zink would be massively slower in a huge number of tests, likely to a staggering degree in some cases.</p>

<p>We were, but then also on occasion we weren’t.</p>

<p>As a final disclaimer before I dive into this, I feel like given the current state of people potentially rushing to conclusions I need to say that <strong>I’m not claiming zink is faster than a native GL driver</strong>, only that <strong>for some cases, our performance is oddly better than I expected</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p><img src="https://zmike.github.io/assets/piglit-misc-bench.png" alt="piglit-misc-bench.png"></p>

<p>The first thing to take note of here is that IRIS is massively better than zink in successful test completion, with a near-perfect 99.4% pass rate compared to zink’s measly 91%, and that’s across 2500 more tests too. This is important also since timediff only compares between passing tests.</p>

<p>With that said, somehow zink’s codepath is significantly faster when it comes to dealing with high numbers of varying outputs, and also, weirdly, a bunch of <code>dmat4</code> tests, even though they’re both using the same softfp64 path since my icelake hardware doesn’t support native 64bit operations.</p>

<p>I was skeptical about some of the numbers here, particularly the <code>ext_transform_feedback</code> <code>max-varying-arrays-of-arrays</code> cases, but manual tests were even weirder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>time MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink bin/ext_transform_feedback-max-varyings -auto -fbo

MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink  -auto -fbo  2.13s user 0.03s system 98% cpu 2.197 total
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>time MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=iris bin/ext_transform_feedback-max-varyings -auto -fbo

MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=iris  -auto -fbo  301.64s user 0.52s system 99% cpu 5:02.45 total
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>wat.</p>

<p>I don’t have a good explanation for this since I haven’t dug into it other than to speculate that ANV is just massively better at handling large numbers of varying outputs.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>By contrast, zink gets thrashed pretty decisively in <code>arb_map_buffer_alignment-map-invalidate-range</code>, and we’re about <strong>150x slower</strong>.</p>

<p>Yikes. Looks like that’s going to be a target for some work since potentially an application might hit that codepath.</p>

<h2 id="the-weird">The Weird</h2>
<p><img src="https://zmike.github.io/assets/piglit-fp64-bench.png" alt="piglit-fp64-bench.png"></p>

<p>Somehow, zink is noticeably slower in a bunch of other fp64 tests (and this isn’t the full list, only a little over half). It’s strange to me that zink can perform better in certain fp64 cases but then also worse in others, but I’m assuming this is just the result of different shader optimizations happening between the drivers, shifting them onto slightly less slow parts of the softfp64 codepath in certain cases.</p>

<p>Possibly something to look into.</p>

<p>Probably not in too much depth since softfp64 is some pretty crazy stuff.</p>

<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>
<p>Tests (and especially piglit ones) are not indicative of real world performance.</p>

<p>CMake is known as a <strong>meta build system</strong>. It doesn't actually build your source code: instead, it generates native project files for the target platform. For example, CMake on Windows will produce a <em>solution</em> for Visual Studio; CMake on Linux will produce a Makefile; CMake on macOS will produce a project for XCode and so on. That's what the word <em>meta</em> stands for: CMake builds build systems.</p>
<p>A project based on CMake always contains the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file. This special text file describes how the project is structured, the list of source files to compile, what CMake should generate out of it and so on. CMake will read the instructions in it and will produce the desired output. This is done by the so-called <strong>generators</strong>, CMake components responsible for creating the build system files.</p>
<p>Another nice CMake feature is the so-called <strong>out-of-source build</strong>. Any file required for the final build, executables included, will be stored in a separated build directory (usually called <code>build/</code>). This prevents cluttering up the source directory and makes it easy to start over again: just remove the build directory and you are done.</p>
<h2>A toy project to work with</h2>
<p>For this introduction I will be using a dummy C++ project made up of few source files:</p>
<pre><code>myApp/
    src/
        engine.hpp
        engine.cpp
        utils.hpp
        utils.cpp
        main.cpp
</code></pre>
<p>To make things more interesting, later on I will spice up the project with an external dependency and some parameters to pass at build stage to perform conditional compilation. But first let's add a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file and write something meaningful in it.</p>
<h2>Understanding the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file</h2>
<p>A modern CMake's <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> is a collection of <strong>targets</strong> and <strong>properties</strong>. A target is a job of the building process or, in other words, a desired outcome. In our example, we want to build the source code into a binary executable: that's a target. Targets have properties: for example the source files required to compile the executable, the compiler options, the dependencies and so on. In CMake you define targets and then add the necessary properties to them.</p>
<p>Let's start off by creating the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file in the project directory, outside the <code>src/</code> directory. The folder will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>myApp/
    src/
        engine.hpp
        engine.cpp
        utils.hpp
        utils.cpp
        main.cpp
    CMakeLists.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Then open the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file with the editor of your choice and start editing it.</p>
<h2>Define the CMake version</h2>
<p>A <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file always starts with the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_minimum_required.html"><code>cmake_minimum_required()</code></a> command, which defines the CMake version required for the current project. This must be the first thing inside a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION &lt;version-number&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;version-number&gt;</code> is the desired CMake version you want to work with. Modern CMake starts from version 3.0.0 onwards: the general rule is to use a version of CMake that came out after your compiler, since it needs to know compiler flags, etc, for that version. Generating the project with a CMake older than the required version will result in an error message.</p>
<h2>Set the project name</h2>
<p>The second instruction a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file must contain is the project name, defined by the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/project.html"><code>project()</code></a> command. This command may take multiple options such as the version number, the description, the homepage URL and much more. The full list is available in the documentation page. A pretty useful one is the programming language the project is written in, specified with the <code>LANGUAGES</code> flag. So in our example:</p>
<pre><code>project(myApp
    VERSION 1.0
    DESCRIPTION "A brief CMake experiment"
    LANGUAGES CXX)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>CXX</code> stands for C++.</p>
<h2>Define the executable target</h2>
<p>We are about to add our first CMake target: the <em>executable</em>. Defined by the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_executable.html"><code>add_executable()</code></a> command, it tells CMake to create an executable from a list of source files. Suppose we want to call it <code>myApp</code>, the command would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>add_executable(myApp
    src/engine.hpp
    src/engine.cpp
    src/utils.hpp
    src/utils.cpp
    src/main.cpp)
</code></pre>
<p>CMake is smart enough to construct the filename according to the target platform conventions: <code>myApp.exe</code> on Windows, <code>myApp</code> on macOS and Linux and so on.</p>

<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<h2>Set some target properties</h2>
<p>As said earlier, targets have properties. They are set by a bunch of commands that start with the <code>target_</code> suffix. These commands also require you to define the <strong>scope</strong>: how properties should propagate when you include the project into other CMake-based parent projects. Since we are working on a binary executable (not a library), nobody will include it anywhere so we can stick to the default scope called <code>PRIVATE</code>. In the future I will probably write another article about CMake libraries to fully cover this topic.</p>
<h3>Set the C++ standard in use</h3>
<p>Let's assume our dummy project is written in modern C++20: we have to instruct the compiler to act accordingly. For example, on Linux it would mean to pass the <code>-stdc++=20</code> flag to GCC. CMake takes care of it by setting a property on the <code>myApp</code> target with the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_features.html"><code>target_compile_features()</code></a> command, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>target_compile_features(myApp PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
</code></pre>
<p>The full list of available C++ compiler features is available <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_gbl/CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES.html#prop_gbl:CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Set some hardcoded preprocessor flags</h3>
<p>Let's also assume that our project wants some additional preprocessor flags defined in advance, something like <code>USE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE</code>. It's a matter of setting another target property with the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_definitions.html"><code>target_compile_definitions()</code></a> command:</p>
<pre><code>target_compile_definitions(myApp PRIVATE USE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE)
</code></pre>
<p>The command will take care of adding the <code>-D</code> part for you if required, so no need for it.</p>
<h3>Set compiler options</h3>
<p>Enabling compiler warnings is considered a good practice. On GCC I usually go with the common triplet <code>-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic</code>. Such compiler flags are set in CMake with the
<a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_options.html"><code>target_compile_options()</code></a> command:</p>
<pre><code>target_compile_options(myApp PRIVATE -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic)
</code></pre>
<p>However, this is not 100% portable. In Microsoft's Visual Studio for example, compiler flags are passed in a completely different way. The current setup works fine on Linux, but it's still not cross-platform: we will see how to improve it in a few paragraphs.</p>
<h2>Running CMake to build the project</h2>
<p>At this point the project is kind of ready to be built. The easiest way to do it is by invoking the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html"><code>cmake</code></a> executable from the command line: this is what I will do in the rest of this article. A graphical wizard is also available, which is usually the preferred way on Windows: the <a href="https://cmake.org/runningcmake/">official documentation</a> covers it in depth. On Unix <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ccmake.1.html"><code>ccmake</code></a> is also available: same thing for Windows but with a text-based interface.</p>
<p>As said earlier, CMake supports out-of-source builds, so the first thing to do is to create a directory — sometimes called <code>build</code> but the name is up to you — and go in there. The project folder will now look like this:</p>
<pre><code>myApp/
    build/
    src/
        engine.hpp
        engine.cpp
        utils.hpp
        utils.cpp
        main.cpp
    CMakeLists.txt
</code></pre>
<p>From inside the new folder invoke the CMake as follows:</p>
<pre><code>cmake ..
</code></pre>
<p>This will instruct CMake to read the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file from above, process it and churn out the result in the <code>build/</code> directory. Once completed, you will find your generated project files in there. For example, assuming I'm running CMake on Linux, my <code>build/</code> directory will contain a <code>Makefile</code> ready to be run.</p>
<p>What we have seen so fare is a barebone yet working CMake configuration. We can do better, though: keep reading for additional improvements.</p>
<h2>Add multiplatform support: Linux, Windows and macOS</h2>
<p>CMake gives you the ability to detect which platform you are working on and act accordingly. This is done by inspecting <code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code>, one of the many variables that CMake defines internally. CMake also supports <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/if.html">conditionals</a>, that is the usual if-else combination. With this tools in place, the task is pretty easy. For example, assuming we want to fix the portability issue we had before with the compiler options:</p>
<pre><code>if (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Windows")
    target_compile_options(myApp PRIVATE /W4)
elseif (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Linux")
    target_compile_options(myApp PRIVATE -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic)
elseif (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Darwin")
    # other macOS-specific flags for Clang
endif()
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how <code>STREQUAL</code> is the CMake way for comparing strings. A list of possible <code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code> values is available <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/tutorials/How-To-Write-Platform-Checks#cmake-system">here</a>. You can also check for additional information such as the operating system version, the processor name and so on: full list <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html#id2">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Passing command line variables to CMake</h2>
<p>In our current configuration we have a hardcoded preprocessor definition: <code>USE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE</code>. Why not giving users the ability to enable it optionally while invoking CMake? You can do it by adding the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/option.html"><code>option()</code></a> command anywhere in the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file. The syntax is the following:</p>
<pre><code>option(&lt;variable&gt; "&lt;help_text&gt;" [value])
</code></pre>
<p>The optional <code>[value]</code> can be <code>ON</code> or <code>OFF</code>. If omitted, <code>OFF</code> is used. This is how it would look like in our dummy project:</p>
<pre><code>option(USE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE "Enable new experimental audio engine" OFF)
</code></pre>
<p>To use it, just run CMake as follows:</p>
<pre><code>cmake -DUSE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE=ON ..
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>cmake -DUSE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE=OFF ..
</code></pre>
<p>This is also how <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html">internal CMake variables</a> and other …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p><em>Quantum</em> <em>entanglement</em> is, as you know, a phrase that's jam-packed with meaning in physics. But what you might not know is that the linear algebra behind it is quite simple.&nbsp;If you're familiar with singular value decomposition (SVD), then you're 99% there. My goal for this post is to close that 1% gap. In particular, I'd like to explain something called the<em> </em><strong>Schmidt rank</strong> in the hopes of helping the math of entanglement feel a little less... tangly. And to do so, I'll ask that you momentarily forget about the previous sentences. Temporarily ignore the title of this article. Forget we're having a discussion about entanglement. Forget I mentioned that word. And let's start over. Let's just chat math. </p><p>Let's talk about SVD. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Singular Value Decomposition</h2><p>SVD is arguably one of the most important, well-known tools in linear algebra. You are likely already very familiar with it, but here's a lightning-fast recap. Every matrix $M$ can be factored as $M=UDV^\dagger$ as shown below, called the <strong>singular value decomposition</strong> of $M$. The entries of the diagonal matrix $D$ are nonnegative numbers called <em>singular values</em>, and the number of them is equal to the rank of $M$, say $k$. What's more, $U$ and $V$ have exactly $k$ columns, called the <em>left and right singular vectors</em>, respectively.</p><figure id="w-node-c5cffac943b5-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5562528e82aa6ab6d78ae1_open.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>There are different ways to think about this, depending on which applications you have in mind. I like to think of singular vectors as encoding meaningful "concepts" inherent to $M$, and of singular values as indicating how important those concepts are. For instance, this perspective arises naturally in a study of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10531">learning dynamics of deep neural networks</a>. As another example, you can imagine a matrix whose rows are indexed by people, and whose columns are indexed by movies.&nbsp;The $ij$th entry could be a 0 or 1, indicating whether or not person $i$ has watched movie $j$. In an applied setting—a recommender system, for instance—one may wish to compute a <em>truncated SVD </em>of this matrix. Here, only the top largest singular values are kept. The rest are viewed as containing little information and are set to zero. In this way, the diagonal matrix $D$&nbsp;operates on a low-dimensional "feature space," which provides a nice way to <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/collaborative/basics">compress and glean information about the data</a>.</p><p>Either way, I like to think of $D$ as providing a bridge between two worlds: information about the columns of $U$ (e.g. people) and information about the columns of $V$ (e.g. movies). Below is a very <em>non</em>-mathematical cartoon of this. You can imagine the thickness of the blue bridge relates to the number of singular values. Lots of singular values?&nbsp;The bridge is wide and lots of information passes through. Only a few singular values?&nbsp;The bridge is narrow and not much information gets through.</p><figure id="w-node-fc7a2c3b2624-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f55643d546e4a903f261c30_bridge2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>An actual mathematical picture is found in a <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-as-tensor-network-diagrams">tensor network diagram</a> representation of SVD.&nbsp;There, $D$&nbsp;really is a bridge! As a visual cue, we might draw the edges adjacent to the blue node as very thick if the number of singular values is large, and draw them to be thin otherwise. This again represents the idea of information "flowing" between systems described by $U$ and $V$.</p><figure id="w-node-235ea1f864dc-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5564d7d7916c43e6f8c4ce_TN2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Alternatively still, if you enjoy thinking of <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs">matrices as bipartite graphs</a>, then you might have in mind the graphs below. If we have lots of blue nodes—i.e. lots of singular values—then there are lots of pathways between the pink and green nodes (i.e. people and movies). But if we have only a <em>few</em> blue nodes—i.e. a few singular values—then there are fewer pathways between pink and green.</p><figure id="w-node-9ef538caa942-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f577be8bc99498290bfcb81_graph2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Either way we wish to visualize it, the role of the singular values—that is, the role of the diagonal matrix $D$—is key. Intuitively, they indicate the amount of "interaction" between the information stored by $U$ and $V$, and they mediate how those interactions contribute to the information represented by the original matrix $M$.</p><p><em>And this precisely idea behind the mathematics of entanglement</em>.</p><p>In the context of physics, one simply applies SVD to a particular matrix and then looks at the number of nonzero singular values of that matrix. This is the main idea behind something called the <em>Schmidt rank</em> of a quantum state (explained below), which is an integer that indicates how much entanglement is present. </p><blockquote>Entanglement is measured by the number of nonsingular values of a particular matrix. </blockquote><p>So what makes a physicist's application of SVD different from that of, say, someone building a movie recommender system?&nbsp;Well, in physics, your matrix $M$ presumably encodes information about a physical system and takes spatial considerations into account (ex. particles in a lattice). Its entries may also contain complex numbers, and the sum of their squares should satisfy $\sum_{ij}|M_{ij}|^2=1$. In this case—as I'll explain below—$M$ represents a <strong>quantum state</strong>. But lingo aside, the template is much the same: singular values convey important information about how two things—whether users and movies, or two quantum subsystems—are related.</p><p>I could stop here, but I'd like to dig a little deeper. In the next section, let me restate this punchline using slightly more specialized language.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Singular Values vs. Schmidt&nbsp;Rank</h2><p>To start, let's back up a bit. In a discussion of physics, what exactly is the matrix to which we apply SVD?&nbsp;In the opening example, we applied SVD to a user-by-movie matrix. But what's going on now?</p><p>Rather than starting with a matrix, we instead start with a <em>unit vector</em>. To that end, suppose $\psi$ is any unit vector in a <strong>tensor product</strong> of vector spaces $\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^m$. Here, it's important that our discussion takes place in a tensor product. After all, entanglement is defined <em>between two things</em> (So, if someone were to ask you, "How much entanglement is there?" one proper response would be, "Entanglement <em>between</em> <em>what</em>?"), and in quantum mechanics, the tensor product is the mathematical operation used to combine two systems. Now, if the phrase "tensor product" is unfamiliar to you, I recommend the article "<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-tensor-product-demystified">The Tensor Product, Demystified</a>." I&nbsp;think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how easy the concept is!</p><p>Alright, now that we have the vector $\psi$, it's easy to get a linear map $\mathbb{C}^m\to\mathbb{C}^n$ from it. Simply reshape the entries of $\psi$ into an $n\times m$ matrix $M$. (Said more formally, look at $\psi$&nbsp;under the isomorphism $A\otimes B^*\cong\text{hom}(B,A)$ for finite-dimensional vector spaces $A$&nbsp;and $B$.)</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5517185b36106928a313a9_reshape.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the language of physics, $\psi$ is called a <strong>quantum state</strong>, and $M$&nbsp;is simply the matrix associated with it. More generally, the terms&nbsp;"unit vector" and "quantum state" are synonymous. That's because the squares of the entries of any unit vector define a probability distribution, and—in the context of physics—that probability distribution tells you about the <em>state</em> of the system you're studying. (This is the Born rule.)</p><p>But I&nbsp;digress. Let's get back to SVD.</p><p>Suppose the singular value decomposition of our matrix $M$ is given by $UDV^\dagger$. Here I'm using the dagger to denote the conjugate transpose of $V$ since we're allowing $M$ to have complex entries. Now I'd like to use this decomposition&nbsp;to rewrite $M$ in a slightly messier way. Let $\mathbf{u}_i$ and $\mathbf{v}_i$ denote the $i$th columns of $U$ and $V$, respectively, and let $d_i$ denote the $i$th singular value of $M$. Then we can expand the matrix $M$ as the following sum, where $k$&nbsp;is the rank of $M$. </p><figure id="w-node-dc0fefa9bd0b-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556da578cb1b3bbc952fdd_expand2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We're almost at the punchline, but let me first introduce a definition and then make one final cosmetic change.</p><p>For any two vectors $\mathbf{u}$&nbsp;and $\mathbf{v}$, the matrix $\mathbf{uv}^\dagger$ is called their <strong>outer product</strong>. This simple operation is also denoted with a tensor product symbol $\mathbf{u}\otimes \mathbf{v}$ or in physicists' bra-ket notation by $|u\rangle\langle v|$. So for example, if $\mathbf{u}=\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;2&amp;3\end{bmatrix}^\top$ and $\mathbf{v}=\begin{bmatrix}4&amp;5\end{bmatrix}^\top$, then their outer product is the following little matrix.</p><figure id="w-node-c2af2f15f3fb-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f551c63f2d18fc4ccbcb28b_outer.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Why introduce this?&nbsp;Let's think back that expansion of $M$&nbsp;above. Under the correspondence $\mathbf{uv}^\dagger \leftrightarrow \mathbf{u}\otimes \mathbf{v}$, we can write $\psi$&nbsp;explicitly using the columns of $U$ and $V$, weighted by the singular values of $M$ like this:</p><figure id="w-node-3ff996165bf0-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556f9788b112261c051ef6_decomp0.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>At this point, you might think we haven't done much (and we haven't, really), <em>and yet</em> familiar things are now given <em>new names</em>. In the context of physics, the above decomposition of $\psi$ is called its <strong>Schmidt decomposition</strong>. The integer $k$, which is the rank of the original matrix $M$, is called its <strong>Schmidt rank</strong>. And the singular values $d_1,d_2,\ldots, d_k$ are called its <strong>Schmidt coefficients.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556fb589f1f866fb28a990_decomp1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Although terminology is new, the ingredients aren't. And that's the punchline.</p><blockquote>Punchline: the quantum state $\psi$ is said to be <strong>entangled</strong> if its Schmidt rank&nbsp;(i.e. number of singular values) is strictly greater than 1, and is <strong>not entangled</strong> otherwise.</blockquote><p>So, do you see the connection with our discussion above? As we stressed earlier, singular values can be thought of as providing a "bridge" between two subsystems. They are a measure of how much interaction exists between them. In the context of physics, this interaction is understood as entanglement.</p><p>The upshot is that a large number of singular values—i.e. a high Schmidt rank or a "wide bridge"—corresponds to lots of communication between two subsystems. A small number of singular values—i.e. a low Schmidt rank or a "narrow bridge"—corresponds to little communication. At the lowest extreme, <em>one</em> singular value corresponds to <em>zero</em> entanglement, and we might as well omit the thin bridge in the image below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f559310bc99491aa62d994a_zero1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Indeed, notice that if the Schmidt rank of $\psi$ is equal to <em>one</em>—that is, if $M$&nbsp;is a rank one matrix $M=\mathbf{uv}^\dagger$—then we can write $\psi=\mathbf{u\otimes v}$. In the mathematics literature, vectors of this form (i.e. a tensor product of vectors) are sometimes called <strong>simple tensors</strong>.&nbsp;For this reason, some mathematicians associate entanglement with "linear combinations of …</p></div></div>

<p>Web scraping is that activity where a party uses automated software to crawl the internet and copy data and other content, usually so that it can compile that together and make its own product offering.  This may be of concern to you because you are a company that does web scraping. Or you may be a web publisher and there are other parties that are scraping your content. Let’s examine some of the legal issues around web scraping.</p>



<h3>Breach of contract</h3>



<p>One of the questions that commonly arises around web scraping is whether the activity is a breach of contract. More specifically, the question is whether the use of automated software violates the terms of service of the website that is being scraped. You often see website terms of service prohibit the use of spider and other automated crawling software to access and use the site. Parties who own websites that are being scraped will often look to see whether the scraping of their site is a breach of contract. </p>



<h3>Copyright infringement</h3>



<p>Another common question arising when analyzing web scraping is lawful whether scraping constitutes copyright infringement. This is a difficult argument to make if all that is being scraped is data, because mere facts usually are not subject to copyright protection. But if there is other content being scraped, such as images or specific compilations of data, the question of copyright infringement becomes a bit easier to answer in that unauthorized copying is an likely an infringement.</p>



<h3>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> is another topic that often comes up in discussions about web scraping. This is a federal law that makes it unlawful for a person to access a protected computer without authorization, or in excess of a specific authorization. So the question becomes whether that access by the automated web scraper violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. There are some important things that have to be proven for a plaintiff to succeed under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and one of those is loss or damage that results from the unauthorized access. It is a very fact intensive inquiry that has to be made,  but the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is one thing that parties should think about in the context of web scraping. </p>



<h3>Trade secrets</h3>



<p>The question of trade secrets is another good one to raise in the context of web scraping. A trade secret is any information that a company has that gives that company a commercial advantage in the marketplace because it is secret. The information also has to be the subject of protective efforts — the company has to try to keep the information secret. For example, if information on a website is put there in a way that is behind certain protective barrier,s and the party doing the scraping circumvents those barriers, it could be that there is a misappropriation of trade secrets, particularly if that information is used for some competitive purpose. </p>



<h3>Let’s talk</h3>



<p>Web scraping legal issues can be complex. Scraping presents certain legal risks to the ones doing it, and the law provides certain powerful remedies when web scraping runs afoul of the rules.

            <p>Bad news: you’re in the meeting room.</p>
<p>You can distinctly see your team leader proposing the solution he had in mind for the next feature of your startup’s disrupting product.</p>
<p>“Great solution! Pretty easy to implement!”, you think. You only need to change two fields in the database, modify two or three existing features, and that’s all!</p>
<p>You give your estimation. Only two hours. After all, you did that so often. This feature won’t match your impressive skills! You will crush it, and everybody will praise you for generations.</p>
<p>Not so fast! I’m sorry, but you might have fallen into multiple cognitive biases, in only three minutes.</p>
<p>Did you ever create bugs or wrote nonsense because your certitudes and your self-confidence gave you wrong assumptions and wrong solutions? Don’t lie to me. I know you did. I did, too.</p>
<p>If not, you might not have a lot of experience yet. That’s fine. Be patient. It will happen.</p>
<p>This article is about our mistakes, caused by the most common and discussed cognitive biases in software development.</p>
<p>On today’s menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll learn what are cognitive biases and how they can pop up in our work, as software developers.</li>
<li>We’ll study more in details:
<ul>
<li>The optimistic bias</li>
<li>The overconfidence bias</li>
<li>The confirmation bias</li>
<li>Wishful thinking</li>
<li>The anchoring bias</li>
<li>The bandwagon effect</li>
<li>The cargo cult</li>
<li>The correspondence bias</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We’ll see different techniques to prevent these biases, to take more logical decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is it important? If you think that programming is about languages and technobabble, you’re wrong. It’s about problem solving. When you solve problems, assumptions will mislead you. Cognitive bias will bring you a lot of them, on a platter.</p>
<p>The result: you’ll come up with wrong solutions. You’ll get lost on the wrong path. It’s not only about you, but about everybody else, too. You only need to be a human.</p>
<p>Depending on the project, the impact of biases can be completely different, from insignificant to dangerous for the survival of the project itself.</p>
<p>Let’s not wait longer. Come with me, I will show you what’s our enemy looks like, and how to bring it down with a sharp mind. Bim.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-cognitive-bias">What’s a Cognitive Bias?</h2>
<p>Let’s open the sacrosanct <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/cognitive-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cambridge dictionary</a> to find out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way a particular person understands events, facts, and other people, which is based on their own particular set of beliefs and experiences and may not be reasonable or accurate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I explain briefly in my article about the <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/expert-blind-spot-software-development/">expert blind spot</a>, it’s easier for our cognitive system to reason about things by cutting details out, using already what we know. However, these details might be important, and our past believes and experience not adequate for the situation at hand.</p>










  
  
  
  





  


<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone takes the limit of his own vision for the limits of the world.</p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>There are no definitive cognitive biases codex, but we can roughly count more than 200 of them in psychology, sociology and management research.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that there is a lack of study about interconnected bias, which means that some cognitive biases will be similar to one another. Plus, some of these biases might be more frequent when another one is already in action.</p>
<p>Be aware as well that there is a serious lack of consistency in the research papers.
Depending on the study, they will be called with different names, even if they refer to the same ideas, more or less.</p>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/cognitive-bias-software-development/easy-changing-db-tables.jpg" alt="Stop and thinks before saying it's easy">
</picture>



<p>The biases I choose to write about is mainly based on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328410759_Cognitive_Biases_in_Software_Engineering_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this study</a> and my own experience.</p>
<p>I’ll explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biases themselves</li>
<li>In what context they can appear</li>
<li>Some technique to fight them (debiasing techniques).</li>
</ul>
<p>The most evident of these debiasing techniques is to point out the biases when somebody makes a mistake; however, it has been shown that blaming people for their bias, or showing them that they, personally, are victim of biases, won’t help.</p>
<p>Instead, try to show the biases creeping in specific task or situation.</p>
<p>This article can be useful as well for you to learn how to fight your own biases.</p>
<p>Debiasing techniques are no silver bullets. There is no strong evidence of their effectiveness: we lack studies about them. However, they are still useful guidelines to show you the good direction to take. See them as experiments you can try to take better, more logical decisions.</p>
<h2 id="the-optimistic-bias-and-the-overconfidence-bias">The Optimistic Bias and the Overconfidence bias</h2>
<p>The optimistic bias is this tendency to be unrealistically optimistic for events happening around us. This is a common and well documented bias in software development.</p>
<p>It can be linked to the overconfidence bias, which makes us utterly optimistic in our own skills and talents.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-optimism-look-like">What Does Optimism Look Like?</h3>
<p>Did you hear, during your career, one of your colleague developer claiming, without even checking the codebase, that a random new feature should <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/development-easy-just-simple/">be easy to implement and won’t take time</a>?</p>
<p>If you have a bit of experience as a developer, I’m sure you did. Developers have tendency to be optimistic when asking to estimate tasks.</p>
<p>In fact, studies show that technical persons, including developers, fall into the optimistic bias trap even more than anybody else!</p>
<p>How many of these estimates have proven to be wrong? How many times the work took more time than estimated? Yep. Too many.</p>
<p>The cherry on the cake: people have even tendency to be optimistic for hard tasks, and pessimistic for easy task. This is known as the hard-easy bias.</p>
<p>Optimistic bias will kick in as well more easily if the task is abstract and far in the future. It makes sense: we have all difficulties to project ourselves too far in the future. Even when we try, we’re often wrong.</p>
<p>This bias can be detrimental for estimations and for understanding the requirements of a task. The optimistic bias can whisper to you that you understood everything, even if you didn’t spend enough time to really assess all the nuances of the task.</p>
<p>This can lead to a superficial, or even incorrect, understanding of a situation, which will bring wrong implementations.</p>
<h3 id="debiasing-the-optimistic-bias">Debiasing the Optimistic Bias</h3>
<h4 id="ask-directed-questions">Ask Directed Questions</h4>
<p>To find out if an estimate is too optimistic, or to be sure you really understood everything, you can ask directed questions to your colleagues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you see any reason why your solution might be wrong?</li>
<li>Do you see anything which might cause problem?</li>
<li>Can you think about dependent features which are coupled to the one we modify?</li>
<li>Can we look at the codebase before giving our estimation?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions try to put the optimistic affirmations on their heads. It will force people to reverse their way of thinking, and think about the difficult parts instead of the easy ones.</p>










  
  
  
  





      
      
      
    
     
      
    
    

    
    
         
         
         

         
        
        
        
        
        
        
      
      
    
  


<blockquote>
  <p>Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment.</p>
  
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-double-loop-learning">The Double Loop Learning</h4>
<p>Questioning your initial assumptions, or the ones from your colleagues, is always good, if it’s done for the good reason. The goal is not trying to be right whatever the cost, but to avoid biases.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-loop_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double loop learning</a> approach does exactly that. Basically, you can try to frame the problems differently, with another mental model than the primary one used.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example. One of your colleague tells you that changing every name of every table in your wonderful database is an easy task which takes 1 hour. After all, it’s only changing names!</p>
<p>You could easily answer that it will be done quickly. You’re a <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/software-developer-titles-junior-senior/">senior developer</a>, you know much about programming and you want people to know that, for you, changing a bunch of names is easy.</p>
<p>However, instead of thinking about changing simply names, let’s think about the database itself. How many tables does it have? Where these tables are queried in the source code, with their names hard-coded?</p>
<p>Changing the mental model, from thinking about simply a bunch of names to think about the database itself and where it’s queried, can change drastically the difficulty of the task, and its estimation!</p>
<h4 id="smaller-tasks-are-easier">Smaller Tasks Are Easier</h4>
<p>It’s true that estimating future features is hard. Estimating features which have 13647 sub-tasks and 82372 nuances is harder.</p>
<p>I will never stress it enough: if your features are big, break them down to the smaller unit you can, and push these units in production as often as you can. Even if the customers don’t want to see a tiny bit of a feature: you can put a switch on it and hide it to their eyes.</p>
<p>Estimations will become way easier, you’ll learn the joys of continuous deployment, you’ll have quick feedback on your possible over-optimistic estimations, and everybody will live happy for the rest of their lives.</p>
<h4 id="logging-the-estimations">Logging the Estimations</h4>
<p>I tried an experiment not long ago: logging my estimations. Each time I estimated a task, I would write it in my development journal. I did the same for my colleagues, too.</p>
<p>As expected, in the company I was working with, we were all very optimistic. It led me to always add 50% of my first estimation on top. Two days of work becomes three days.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to log your estimations too, and see for yourself if you are overly optimistic.</p>
<p>Another good idea: each time your estimations are wrong, ask yourself why. Did you forget some other features tight to the one you modified? Were you interrupted too much the last few days?</p>
<p>Finding the reasons can help you next time to fix the efficiency problems you might have faced.</p>
<h2 id="confirmation-bias-and-wishful-thinking">Confirmation Bias and Wishful Thinking</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/">Last week we announced our adaptation of the ReactJS.org website to use all React Hooks examples and explanations</a>. This week I thought I would write a bit more about what it was like to make that conversion. The challenges getting set up, re-writing the explanations, and getting the examples adapted both on the website itself and in the linked CodePen examples.</p>
<p>ReactJS.org is built with Gatsby, and this was actually my first time using Gatsby for anything significant. All things considered it went pretty well, although I will probably wait to see if Gatsby’s leadership adequately addresses <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/gatsbyjs-employees/5b08b884be088bce54abaf4f980fbf7b">their horrific corporate culture issues</a> before deciding to use their tooling on any projects in the future.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get into it.</p>
<h2>Getting Up and Running</h2>
<p>As it turns out, getting the ReactJS.org site running locally and deployed online is pretty straightforward. I had a couple of errors before I figured out I should be using <code>yarn</code> commands instead of <code>npm</code> commands, but after I figured that out, the basic yarn commands were all it took to get running:</p>

<p>Getting it deployed was as simple as wiring it up to Netlify and the letting Netlify handle the rest. It may have been the most straightforward process I've ever gone through for getting someone else’s project up and running.</p>
<h2>Converting the “Main Concepts” Pages to Hooks</h2>
<p>Once I had everything running, I decided to start the updates by adapting the "Main Concepts" pages one by one. The “Main Concepts” pages cover most basic React concepts, and since they are divided up into shorter, individual explanations, I figured starting with them would be a good way to assess how much work it would be to convert the entire site. At this point in the process, we were still in the ”Let’s see how much work it is to make these changes before committing to adapting the whole site” phase.</p>
<p>As it turned out, these conversions where mostly straightforward: converting class components to function components and adding the requisite <code>useState</code> calls was the majority of the work.</p>
<p>I was pretty excited from the start to see that almost every example got shorter as I updated it. There was no more need for constructors, no more need to explicitly bind component methods, no more <code>this</code>, and also no more weird technically-not-valid-JavaScript method declaration statements like this</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>handleClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Is handleClick a let? A const? A...var?"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I also found that while some of the conceptual explanations did require some re-working, there were other sections I was able to get rid of entirely (for example, explanations of how <code>this</code> works).</p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1597456981/383/" alt="a Git diff of removing an explanation of the “this” keyword"></p>
<p>Though there were a few times things got longer as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1597456961/379/" alt="a Git diff of changing a three-step set of instructions to a four-step set of instructions"></p>
<p>Overall, most of changes I was making to the documentation seemed like evidence that the switch to hooks would make learning React an easier process for newbies than it had been before. And it was incredibly satisfying to watch almost all of the code examples get both shorter and easier to read.</p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1597456966/380/" alt="a Git diff removing “this.state” from some code"></p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1597456976/382/" alt="a Git diff of some React code getting shorter"></p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1597456971/381/" alt="a Git diff of replacing a React constructor function with a useState call"></p>
<p>Converting the examples was mostly straightforward. The hardest part of converting the ”Main Concepts” documentation turned out to be converting the conceptual explanations. Changing the existing writing on things like constructors, <code>setState</code>, and <code>componentDidMount</code> to bits on <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>. But after a few drafts and re-drafts, I got those to a place where I felt like they worked reasonably well.</p>
<p>Converting the ”Advanced Guides” section turned out to be more difficult.</p>
<h2>Converting the “Advanced Guides” Pages to Hooks</h2>
<p>While converting the ”Main Concepts” section was pretty straightforward, converting the ”Advanced Guides” pages required a lot more working through tricky code constructs and techniques.</p>
<p>Some advanced React concepts, like <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#introducing-error-boundaries">error boundaries</a>, don’t exist in hooks at all. Others, like <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/context.html#updating-context-from-a-nested-component">context updating</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#forceupdate">the <code>forceUpdate</code> function</a>, do exist but are more awkward to use via hooks. Some, including error boundaries, I decided to remove entirely. Others, like <code>forceUpdate</code>, I searched around a bit and was able to find <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-forceupdate">explanations of how to update them for a hooks context</a>.</p>
<p>I dedicated <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks#unresolved-issues-with-modifying-the-docs-to-be-100-hooks">a section of the README</a> to listing things I couldn’t figure out and worked my way as best I could through the rest. Fortunately, the advanced concepts that were the most trouble to adapt were mostly concepts that aren’t used very much by beginners.</p>
<p>The hardest part was probably the ”Integrating with Other Libraries” page. It’s been seven years or so since I’ve tried to do anything with Backbone.js. I still haven’t figured out a working conversion of <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html#extracting-data-from-backbone-models">the “Extracting Data from Backbone Models” section of that page on ReactJS.org</a>, but I did manage to get a somewhat weird working version of <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html#using-backbone-models-in-react-components">the “Using Backbone Models in React Components” section</a> cobbled together after much tinkering.</p>
<p>For a while as I was working on the “Main Concepts” and the “Advanced Guides” sections, I worked on converting the code examples on the documentation pages, but ignored the CodePen-based examples. Those I decided to comment out and save for later. Eventually, though, especially as I got to working on converting the “build a tic-tac-toe game” tutorial pages, it got harder to put those conversions off.</p>
<h2>Converting the CodePen Examples</h2>
<p>One of the first things I realized when I started converting the CodePen examples was that the React CDN used by CodePen doesn’t expose hooks functions directly. Everywhere I used functions like <code>useState</code> or <code>useEffect</code> on the documentation pages, I had to use <code>React.useState</code> and <code>React.useEffect</code> on CodePen. For a while I just dealt with this by peppering my code with <code>React.</code> statements, but after a while I decided to do some fiddling to see if there was a better way.</p>
<p><code>import</code> and <code>require</code> statements are not available on CodePen, so that wasn’t an option. I briefly experimented with setting the hooks functions as constants at the top of each example, like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>useState</span><span>,</span> <span>useEffect</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>but that seemed messy, and it meant that there would still be differences between the code showing on the documentation site and the code in the CodePen links. This seemed like it could be confusing for people just starting out and fiddling around with the examples.</p>
<p>Finally, I hit on the idea of hosting a small JavaScript file that exposed the hooks functions myself. Once that file was online, I could import it with a script tag the same way that CodePen imports the React CDN. The resulting file, which is included in almost all of the CodePen examples, is at <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/expose_hooks.js">reactwithhooks.netlify.app/expose_hooks.js</a> and looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>React</span> <span>!==</span> <span>'undefined'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useEffect</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useEffect</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useRef</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useRef</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useContext</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useContext</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useReducer</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useReducer</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useCallback</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useCallback</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useMemo</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useMemo</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useRef</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useRef</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useImperativeHandle</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useImperativeHandle</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useLayoutEffect</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useLayoutEffect</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useDebugValue</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useDebugValue</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And just like that, the CodePen examples worked without any weird extra lines added to the main body of code. It’s all hidden away in the script tags.</p>
<p>The rest of the conversion of the CodePen examples went mostly smoothly, and it revealed quite a few bugs I had accidentally left in the code examples I had written on the documentation pages.</p>
<h2>Smaller (mis)adventures</h2>
<h3>Semicolons</h3>
<p>In the middle of this work I discovered that there was <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines-for-text">a contribution guide</a> that I had not bothered to look for previously, and it stipulated among other things that all the JavaScript examples out to use semicolons. Because I usually don't use semicolons in my JavaScript, there are now about fifteen different commits in the git log specifically for adding semicolons back to every example ever 😅</p>
<h3>Autorefresh Limitations</h3>
<p>For the most part, Gatsby is set up to automatically recompile and reload pages as you make changes to project files. If you change a code example in the <code>state-and-lifecycle.md</code> file, the application reloads to show the new content. However, code examples that are stored in their own separate javascript files do not trigger automatic reloads. For those, it takes a full cycle of <code>control + c</code>, <code>yarn dev</code>, and waiting for the Gatsby start-up-and-compile process to complete to see what changes will look like.</p>
<p>When I first encountered this, I had some trouble figuring out why the changes I was making weren’t showing up. Was a editing the right file? Were there errors preventing it from completing some required process?</p>
<p>Once I figured it out, it wasn’t so much of a problem, although still a bit frustrating to have to do a complete re-start of Gatsby to see each change.</p>
<h3>Search Bar</h3>
<p>The last significant issue that came up was with the search bar the site uses. When students first started trying the site out, we discovered that the search bar was still directing them to pages on <code>ReactJS.org</code> instead of our <code>reactwithhooks.netlify.app</code> domain. This led to students seeing a confusing mix of hooks-based and class-based React explanations without knowing why the examples were changing so much from page to page.</p>
<p>After doing some digging, I discovered that the search bar on ReactJS.org uses a hosted site search service called Algolia. I did a little bit of research into the service to see about adopting it for our version, but decided for now to just leave the search bar off.</p>
<h2>It’s Live!</h2>
<p>All in all, making this adaptation was one of the most fun projects I’ve been able to work on recently. We got a chance to use it as a resource for students during our last cohort, and it seemed to work pretty well. I’m hoping that it will be useful for other people trying to learn React as well, and as with all of our open source work, feedback is appreciated. The repo is at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org</a> (on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">the <code>convert-all-to-hooks</code> branch</a>)[1] and the documentation site itself is live at <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/">reactwithhooks.netlify.app</a>.</p>

	<p><span face="Arial" size="2">In this book we are concerned with how to <b>

	<p><span face="Arial" size="2">"A Marxist begins with his prime truth that all

	of the proletariat, and finally the last stage -- the political paradise of

			<p>
			<span face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Alinsky's tactics were based, not on Stalin's revolutionary violence, 
			but on the Neo-Marxist strategies of&nbsp;
			<a href="http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/Bush4-99.htm">Antonio Gramsci</a>, an Italian 
			Communist. Relying on
			<a href="http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/05/stuter-quiet-revolution.htm">
			gradualism</a>, infiltration and the
			<a href="http://www.crossroad.to/Quotes/brainwashing/dialectic.htm">dialectic process</a> rather 
			than a bloody revolution, Gramsci's transformational Marxism was so 
			subtle that few even noticed the deliberate changes.</span></p>
			<p>
			<span face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Like Alinsky, <a href="http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/gorb10-95.html">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> 
			followed Gramsci, not Lenin. In fact, Gramsci aroused Stalins's wrath 
			by suggesting that Lenin's revolutionary plan wouldn't work in the West. 
			Instead the primary <b>assault </b>would be on <b>Biblical absolutes</b> 
			and Christian values, which must be crushed as a social force before 
			the new face of Communism could rise and flourish. Malachi Martin gave 
			us a progress report:</span></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><span face="Arial" size="2">"By 1985, the influence 
				of traditional Christian philosophy in the West was weak and negligible.... 
				Gramsci's master strategy was now feasible. Humanly speaking, it 
				was no longer too tall an order to <b>strip large majorities</b> 
				of men and women in the West of those last vestiges that remained 
				to them of Christianity's transcendent God." </span></p>

<h3><strong>Stack ranking is natural human behavior&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>I have a buddy from high school named Murph. His real name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bfelt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Felt</a> but every legit teenage crew in Pitsford, New York in the 90s needed a Murph so Ben took one for the team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s a quant. Like Taylor Mason from the show Billions.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/aLSHkNWCVa3tsooRGsEIn_ePCfPbm8q76JG1IFkqXgNr5XQ9UDaadhEWwDWx6PmnYKQbYUg3RejrISynwYZy21haJKT_N8O12TRFNBojxdP37hpOO80kmOoRc-ViIo2AWv2cJboF" alt=""></figure>







<p>It would have been easy to predict Murph would end up as a big shot on Wall Street. For starters, he got a perfect 1600 score on his SATs and was accepted early admission to Yale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was also his unique approach to fantasy football. I’ve been playing with the same group of guys since 1999. We started in my Mom’s basement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it came time for draft day, the regular nerds in our group like me would bring fantasy football magazines with last year’s stats and analyst opinions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Murph brought his computer. He wrote a program that organized his draft board based on each player’s predicted performance correlated to his personal skill preferences. This is years before Daryl Morey founded <a href="http://www.sloansportsconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sloan Conference</a>. Murph was ahead of his time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People naturally want to quantify objects by ranking them in lists of best to worst, most expensive to least expensive, most important to least important. We do this throughout our personal and professional lives. Often subconsciously before we even realize we’re doing it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes it makes sense to rank objects by performance. Like ranking athletes in your fantasy league. Murph won our league multiple times using his ranking algo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes it even makes sense to rank real people by performance. Like on a sales team where there is a relatively direct link between the contribution of a sales rep and the outcomes (e.g. new customer, revenue) they deliver.</p>



<p><strong>When it comes to members of your dev team, it does not make sense to rank them using personal performance statistics.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Running a data-driven team does not mean stack ranking developers&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>A software development team is less like a sales team and more like a band. Everyone is highly dependent on one another to deliver a great result. If one person is off, it throws everyone off. And, like in a band, there are often unsung heroes (like the bass player or drummer) who make it possible for other stars (like the lead singer) to shine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cqrL_fBle6dxY8DlVUhtTWbh54DZMympB2IVKA4EfMFLQ5y712qgwgXxHwVAsZH_8cxd3MCAmoRRGoIkbrpFVtpDrjTIWQqXjFijyhLLF2eRgjvCJmP7--6FkGXpmFnheNvtZyJ" alt=""></figure>







<p>The contributions of your most selfless team members may not show up if you just look at lines of code, number of commits or personal story point velocity.</p>



<p>The other big reason not to stack rank your devs is that they just don’t like it. Unlike sales people, your engineers did not sign up to work in a hyper competitive environment.</p>



<p>So why does stack ranking still happen? Some would say bad managers are the culprit. That’s probably true sometimes. Many bad managers want control and pitting teammates against each other in competition is certainly one way to get it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the time the reason is more nuanced. I believe most managers have good intentions and want their people to succeed. But they get caught in the “data-driven trap.”</p>



<p>I hear it from engineering leaders every day… “My CEO wants me to be more data-driven” or “Our company is rolling out a metrics initiative.” Pressure to become data-driven can lead to arbitrary use of data to show the boss metrics are being used. “Let’s use data to make better decisions” gets confused as “let’s use data for performance management.”</p>



<p>When this misconception occurs, one of two things happens. Performance stack ranking metrics are implemented and it damages the team culture. Or the manager knows performance management is bad and avoids using metrics all together. Both are bad outcomes for the team.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You can run a highly data and metrics-driven dev organization with absolutely zero performance management statistics.&nbsp;</strong></p>







<h3><strong>Data-driven engineering leadership anti-patterns</strong></h3>



<p>To avoid the “data-driven trap”, watch out for these 5 anti-patterns:&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Not knowing your “why”</strong></p>



<p>Without the “why”, the metrics themselves can become the outcome everyone cares about instead of being an indicator of the actual outcome you are trying to achieve like faster innovation, more predictable delivery dates, happier customers, etc.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Only measuring individual stats</strong></p>



<p>As leaders we preach that we’re all working together as a band (team) to make beautiful music. What we measure shows what matters to us. If we track tons of individual metrics, we’re showing our people that individual stats matter more than team accomplishments. To get around this, I’ve actually seen some engineering leaders maintain secret dashboards with individual performance data. Their rationale is that it’s helpful for management as long as its existence does not get out. Everything always comes out eventually so I don’t recommend this. Plus, if you’re measuring something you don’t want your team to know about, that’s a good indicator you’re measuring the wrong thing.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Focusing on just 1 or 2 metrics&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>I can’t tell you how many dev leads I meet that look only at velocity to determine the success of an iteration. <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/why-agile-velocity-is-the-most-dangerous-metric-for-software-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Even if you think velocity is a useful indicator (I don’t)</a>, there is no silver bullet. Without a balanced approach to measuring each area of your team and process, it’s easy to lose sight of the big picture. For example, if you just focus on data that measures your delivery speed, you could encourage behavior that has a negative effect on quality.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Thinking your new hammer (data) works for every nail (problem)&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When we first start experiencing how powerful data can be as a tool to quantify trends and diagnose problems, it’s really exciting. And this is precisely when we need to be careful. We can’t forget to seek out input from our people too. Reports and dashboards are at their best when they prompt penetrating questions and point us in the right direction. We can’t get lazy and base decisions exclusively on the numbers.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Just using metrics that are easily available&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“Let’s use velocity to measure team performance. We get it from our project management system automatically.” Pulling the data you really need can be an initial large lift but the benefit overtime will pay back 100x. And it’s actually worse to force the wrong metrics than to use none at all.</p>







<h3><strong>14 ways to use data in your daily dev team practices without being a performance tyrant</strong></h3>



<p>Forget about individual performance management stats. There are many other ways to incorporate data into your team’s day to day routine that will have a positive impact on delivery efficiency, quality and predictability and actually improve your culture, not hurt it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what should we measure?&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was a team lead, I answered that question for myself by taking a step back and looking at my personal leadership responsibility areas. After analyzing all of my important jobs, I found that they fit into three pillars.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/13hUMY4HlnRRfrtmq4bMgYWOYBAHk95xsSDCvXbi7FRgNp7vUckkpkgFONefECxyU7deWyn46tOXd6QKnSNvrbKGwuiRzlS8hOFbKe1mhwgHXrXW6GxPUTRFTQzgWSXS-BkB67e0" alt=""></figure>







<p>These pillars became my “why”. So instead of starting with metrics and looking for a place to apply them, I looked for data that would help me understand and improve these areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s 14 ways we use data to run our team on a day-to-day basis at <a href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinearB</a>.&nbsp;</p>







<h4><strong>How we use data to accelerate project delivery</strong></h4>



<p>Project delivery is highly complicated because of the number of things happening in parallel. Even if your team is only 6-8 people. Technology, time constraints, priority shifts, developers, business stakeholders, customers… The only way to see across all of these dimensions is with data. Better yet, visual representations of data help distill complex things into manageable views and show you where to look and how to invest your time.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>1. Pull request throughput</strong></p>



<p>My friend <a href="https://linearb.io/coffee-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Downard</a>, the VP of Engineering at GigSmart, put it well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Knowing what to measure starts with aligning your team around what’s important to the business. In most companies, they want the dev team to deliver new value. So I care about metrics that are proxies for value delivery. I lean on merge requests because it helps me see throughput for work related to new features and bug fixes.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>We use our PR throughput dashboard the exact same way on our team. We like to see that the ratio of PRs opened to PRs merged stays in the 90-95% range otherwise we know we have a bottleneck in review.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/get-started-linearb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dHWqhiCedjAb52oN1VY0S8uFUZ1cR7gJcHRrcRWQbb84XouHrTD21sRih0oQz9SwhywEdmp6ZHTaJ6niGMnWxReoMigGIieLXM2glZ5CUkCqc1HBGIrKM1vc7FKWCZCsBaTBqkwC" alt=""></a></figure>







<p><strong>2. Stuck pull requests&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We look for A) PRs that have not been picked up for review, B) PRs that have abnormally high back and forth interaction and C) PRs with long review time.&nbsp; Then we alert the team to these in Slack so we can start a conversation about how to help and click through to the PR directly in Git.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/get-started-linearb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1JL97AoLYrbimIpkxfT405N-FxrCieSqchuaEn2Dh6dwlRe5OYYBCX6TlpsUDIQiSHiEtQPsa9Sl_iJRDS2845EB4DyMUm03OvDba3_ASMiKaBe7ToucIUMAgyhFZYPjD6ICAywB" alt=""></a></figure>







<p>We implemented this in <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/dev-productivity-is-way-down-at-linearb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March when work-from-home started</a> and it’s become a critical part of our delivery process. Our devs love it because it’s one less thing they need to remember and they can jump in and help teammates more easily.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>3. PRs merged without review</strong></p>



<p>Our team is great about reviews but occasionally things slip. Flagging large PRs that have been merged without review has helped us catch a lot of mistakes before customers found them.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/get-started-linearb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PsPxncxslm2V2acQox3pnFiR_nULYXN8FCXnvxjD-JLlVSiihieUMDayOELHpubE5aZ45QonVchJt9WhrDdD_M2TMyBlGCAp96lhU0BGVI2pzkRM6CB_j_pP4YivthPHVqgXs26N" alt=""></a></figure>







<p><strong>4. High risk branches</strong></p>



<p>About 15 months ago we analyzed all of our bugs and found a connection between bugs and large branches with a high rate of immediate rework (more than 30%). So now we look for those branches proactively and use our Slack alerts to get another set of eyes on them for review.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/get-started-linearb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XuW12YJqhGmUTkMDRueIlTudnmil0P7uElElddlcDcc17COKUaporHhX7XhljQrRTWnjc2F1eHK1enijyKwIcppaIDnVnFpngbWYBYvslH0QI8U7W3uAK0-883deZ28d9cCN58Qq" alt=""></a></figure>







<hr>











<hr>







<p><strong>5. Days remaining to open work ratio&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We work in two week iterations. Once we’re about a week in, there’s a general equation our leads use to figure out if we’re on track to deliver the iteration: WIP + to-do ÷ days remaining = almost everything you need to know about whether or not you are going to finish on time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Work in progress</strong>: I still need to clean this up &amp; add the complete source code. ETA for a more or less done version is Soon(TM).<br>
<strong>Last updated</strong>: 2020/09/10 because how the eff did this end up on the front page of Hacker News? :D<br>
<strong>Suggestions welcome</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/AnotherKamila/kamila.is/issues/new?labels=teaching&amp;title=[teaching/how-routers-work]+Title">complain</a> if something is unclear or wrong!</p>

<p>This is the inside view of how exactly a router operates. You only need to know this if you are poking inside a router implementation. If that is the case, my condolences.</p>

<p>At the end of this exposition, I will give you the complete source code to a functional router (written in <a href="https://p4.org/">P4</a>, the new &amp; shiny software-defined networking thing). My aim is that you will understand every line of that.</p>

<p>I accompany my explanations below with some P4 code. I think it is useful to read it even if you’ve never seen P4, because it shows a bit more detail than the text and I believe that it is sufficiently pseudocode-ish. Here is a summary of what you need to know to read it:</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24436585">Cyph0n on HN did a good job explaining this distinction.</a></p>



<p>A <em>switch</em> (or an L2 switch :-) ) is an L2-only<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> thing. It knows about L2 stuff such as MAC addresses and ports<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. It does <strong>not</strong> know about anything like IP addresses. It has a <strong>MAC table</strong>: it maps MAC addresses to ports.</p>

<p>A <em>router</em> (or an L3 switch by some people’s vocabulary) operates on L3 only. It knows about L3 stuff such as IP addresses and interfaces and hosts. It does <strong>not</strong> know about L2 stuff such as MAC addresses or ports.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> In fact, the routing parts of the router would not have to be changed at all if you decided to use something other than ethernet on L2. It has a <strong>routing table</strong> (details later): a table of subnets/prefixes and how to reach them.</p>

<p>What you normally call a router (that box sitting over there) is actually a router (for handling L3) and one or more switches (for handling L2), and some glue in between. They may in fact be separate chips in hardware.</p>

<p>You need glue to put together the L2 and the L3. This “L2.5” glue is ARP (or NDP for IPv6). It usually lives in the router, but it is glue, not routing, and you can think about it separately.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-plane-life-of-a-packet">The Data Plane: Life of a Packet</h2>

<p>When a packet arrives and needs to be sent further, these things have to happen to it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It needs to be <em>routed</em>: the <strong>router</strong>, based on L3 information, decides where it needs to go, in L3 speak – it will decide which <em>host</em> to send it to, but not how. This corresponds to the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table">routing table</a></em>.</li>
  <li>It needs to be passed down to L2: this is where the L2.5 ARP/NDP <strong>glue</strong> translates the L3-speak IP address to L2-speak MAC address. This is the <em>ARP table</em>.</li>
  <li>It needs to be <em>forwarded</em> on the correct port: the <strong>switch</strong> puts the packet on the correct port. This is the <em>MAC table</em>.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="life-of-a-packet-now-properly">Life of a Packet, Now Properly</h2>

<h3 id="1-it-needs-to-be-routed-l3router">1. “It needs to be routed”: L3/router</h3>

<p>The packet has a destination IP address. This is matched in the <em>routing table</em>, using a longest-prefix match (LPM), i.e. it matches IP address prefixes. It may either be for a host the router is directly connected to (on some interface), or it may need to be sent further, through a <em>gateway</em> (through some interface). Therefore: <strong>The routing table maps a <em>prefix</em> to either <em>a next hop through a gateway and an interface</em>, or <em>a direct connection through an interface</em></strong>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>routing_table : Prefix -&gt; NextHop (GatewayIP, Interface) | Direct Interface
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the next hop’s IP address is in the router’s memory only: it does not appear in the packet at any time.</p>

<p>The P4 code defining the IPv4 routing table is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>action ipv4_through_gateway(ipv4_addr_t gateway, interface_t iface) {
    meta.out_interface = iface;
    meta.ipv4_next_hop = gateway;  // send through the gateway
}

action ipv4_direct(interface_t iface) {
    meta.out_interface = iface;
    meta.ipv4_next_hop = hdr.ipv4.dst_addr;  // send directly to the destination
}

table ipv4_routing {
    key = {
        hdr.ipv4.dst_addr: lpm;  // match prefixes
    }
    actions = {
        ipv4_through_gateway;    // ipv4_through_gateway(gateway, iface)
        ipv4_direct;             // ipv4_direct(iface)
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();     // If there is no route, drop it -- in reality, we might want to
                                 // send an ICMP "No route to host" packet.
                                 // Note that this is the default route, so control plane might
                                 // want to set a default gateway here instead of dropping.
    size = ROUTING_TABLE_SIZE;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(and the exact same thing for IPv6)</p>

<h3 id="2-it-needs-to-be-passed-down-l25arp-glue">2. “It needs to be passed down”: L2.5/ARP glue</h3>

<p>If we did not drop the packet because there was no route, we now know the IP address and interface of the next hop. (Note that this is a host that is connected to us directly – it is sitting on the same wire.)
We need to translate this into an L2 MAC address in order to pass it to the switch. We do it via the ARP table:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arp_table : (IPv4Address, Interface) -&gt; MACAddress
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: <code>Interface</code> conceptually belongs there, but <code>IPv4Address</code> should be unique. We need to store the interface in the control plane anyway, because we want to pre-emptively re-send ARP requests when an entry is about to expire, but in the data plane it is not strictly necessary.</p>

<p>An interesting question arises here: What do we do if there is no match, i.e. when we don’t know the MAC address for the IP? First, we send an ARP request. Then, most routers drop the packet (relying on either retransmissions or “nobody will miss it”). Storing the packet until the ARP reply comes back (or until it expires) would also work, but usually isn’t done.
Sending ARP requests is normally done in the control plane, because the ARP requests need to be throttled and expired and such.</p>

<p>P4 code:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>action set_dst_mac(mac_addr_t dst_addr) {
    hdr.ethernet.dst_addr = dst_addr;
}

table ipv4_arp {
    key = {
        meta.ipv4_next_hop: exact;     // next_hop is the host we found in the routing step; we want to send to that
        // meta.out_interface: exact;  // conceptually this belongs here, but actually next_hop should be unique, so
                                       // we can leave it out
    }
    actions = {
        set_dst_mac;                // set_dst_mac(mac)
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();
    size = ARP_TABLE_SIZE;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>IPv6 uses NDP instead of ARP, which is different but the same ;-)</p>

<h3 id="3-it-needs-to-be-forwarded-l2switch">3. “It needs to be forwarded”: L2/switch</h3>

<p>This is L2 / the switch. It works on each interface separately (it could be multiple chips in hardware). It gets a packet with some destination MAC address, and it decides on which port it should put it. It uses a <em>MAC table</em> to do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mac_table : MACAddress -&gt; Port
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>P4 code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// note: we're operating on metadata.out_interface

action set_out_port(port_t ports) {
    standard_metadata.egress_spec = ports;
}

action broadcast() {
    // Implementation depends on the switch.
    // In v1model, use a multicast group corresponding to all ports on metadata.out_interface.
}

// we call it dmac -- see below why
table dmac {
    key = {
        hdr.ethernet.dst_addr: exact;
    }
    actions = {
        set_out_port;  // set_out_port(port)
        broadcast;     // no params, uses metadata.out_interface
                       // remember to set broadcast for 0xffffffffffff in the control plane
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();
    size = ARP_TABLE_SIZE;  // we can have at most as many ports as MAC addresses
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: Real switches are a bit more complicated than that: for example, redundant links mean that a MAC address may be on more than one port. However, you will notice when you need to think about this. Normally considering the simple version is sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="the-logic-applying-the-tables">The logic: Applying the tables</h3>

<ol>
  <li>apply routing =&gt; find the next hop (either gateway or direct)</li>
  <li>apply ARP translation to the “next hop” host</li>
  <li>send out on the right port</li>
</ol>

<p>In P4:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>apply {
    routing.apply();  // fills out metadata.next_hop
    arp.apply();      // sets pkt.ethernet.dst_addr to the MAC of next_hop
    dmac.apply();     // sends out on the port for pkt.ethernet.dst_addr
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Note: While this is conceptually correct, we actually also want to apply the auxiliary table mentioned below. The full code contains that.)</p>

<h2 id="the-control-plane-how-to-fill-the-tables">The Control Plane: How to Fill the Tables</h2>

<p>Starting at the bottom for a change:</p>

<h3 id="l3--routing-table">L3 / routing table</h3>

<p>Filled out by the control plane, depending on the context:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In your home router, it probably has only two entries: the local network (something like 192.168.0.0/24) =&gt; direct on the internal interface, and a default route via your ISP’s gateway on the external interface.
 In this case, the routing table is static and is filled out by the firmware according to the settings.</li>
  <li>In a small company router, there might be a direct network such as 10.0.0.0/24, a remote office in 10.0.1.0/24 via a VPN server, and a default route from the ISP.
 The default route and the direct route would also be filled …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Something is wrong with clinical trials for ALS. It seems difficult, if not impossible, to do worse than current experts in the field. The situation is similar for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.</p>

<p>Over 700 clinical trials, nearly 500 of which are interventional studies [15], have been conducted over the past 15 years on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the case of Alzheimer's, there have been over 1900 interventional clinical trials and over 2000 of them for Parkinson's disease.</p>

<p>The cumulative cost of these unsuccessful attempts is colossal.</p>

<p>While the average success rate for a phase III clinical trial is over 40%, it is close to zero for neurodegenerative diseases.
In fact, there have been more than 80 negative phase III clinical trials in the case of ALS [14].</p>

<p>The public might expect it to be truly unlikely that experts would fail 500 times in a row, or fail 82 times in Phase III, without any success, when the success rate of phase III clinical trials is close to 50%.</p>

<p>Is it an exaggeration to say that this huge number of failures means that not only do we have no idea of ​​the cause and mechanism of this disease, but that <strong>experts in charge have no clues about this type of disease?</strong></p>

<p>One of the first paradigms was that since ALS is caused by the death of upper motor neurons (it's the medical definition of ALS), drugs and treatments for stroke should be effective. It shows the thinking of a doctor, not a biologist.</p>

<p>It has been the main paradigm for decades. There is indeed good reason to think that ALS is similar to an extremely slow stroke. In particular, it mainly occurs in the elderly and the symptoms start locally, for example in the muscle of the hand called the thenar. The symptoms then reach increasingly larger areas of the anatomy as the disease develops.</p>

<p>One of the two drugs approved for ALS, Edaravone, is an intravenous drug used to aid healing after stroke.
In line with this paradigm that says ALS is a kind of stroke, oxidative stress has long been suspected to be a major factor in the spread of the disease. This is why Rilutek has been approved for ALS.</p>

<p>Then, over the last century, there has been the extraordinary expansion of molecular biology. <strong>Biologists then, considerably surpassed physicians in numbers and publications</strong>. Biologists became the de-facto experts  in ALS.</p>

<p>The promise of molecular biology is indeed revolutionary, and that is to find a simple solution to any non-contagious disease.</p>

<p>It is also a promise of considerable simplicity in tooling, which seems to come out of a kitchen rather than from a sophisticated laboratory. In particular, it becomes possible for biologist students to publish on these subjects a few years earlier than if they were studying medicine.</p>

<p>Molecular biology involves a complete paradigm shift in the way we think about ALS disease.</p>

<p>The brains, the nerves and the muscles are forgotten. The cells, whose internal mechanisms are however still largely unknown at the end of the XX century, are rejected as irrelevant in a process of thought which is centered on the translation of the genome in proteins.</p>

<p>The blindness towards medicine, is however difficult to understand for neurodegenerative diseases, because for example reactive astrocytes have been repeatedly identified as a component of senile amyloid plaques in the cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease. from 1988 [9-12]. But not long ago, 30 years later, the theory implicating amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease was still the dominant theory.</p>

<p>This may correspond to what was known at the time, as astrocytes and microglia were then considered almost useless. This is, however, something astonishing to say, even at the end of the 20th century, since these cells clearly constitute a large part of the matter of the brain and the spine.</p>

<p>It started off well for the application of cell biology in neurodegenerative diseases, with an apparent success in 1998, when mutations in the SOD1 gene were implicated in familial ALS.
Unfortunately, it quickly became clear that SOD1 mutations only affect a small number of familial cases of ALS and they presented a great diversity with a life expectancy varying from one year in severe forms to 10 years or more in other less dangerous mutations.</p>

<p>Although the vast majority of articles on ALS concern SOD1, mutations in SOD1 therefore appear to be an epiphenomenon in the case of ALS, both because of their very low frequency but also for the diversity of phenotypes.</p>

<p>The main cause of familial ALS was not found until 2011, 20 years after promises from like those of the human genome project. Mutations in C9orf72 create repeats motifs in some proteins. Geneticists had been investigating familial ALS for about 30 years, and the lack of progress raised concerns. C9orf72 is not a gene, it is an area that was considered non-coding until then, hence the difficulty in using molecular biology tools.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, these pattern repeats are also present in everyone, but more pronounced in the elderly. They are also present in other diseases. So it seems that the number of repetitions could involve different diseases.</p>

<p>Molecular biology has proposed more than a hundred genes as participating in the etiology of ALS and has proposed thousands of drugs and at one point scientists started to be reluctant to incriminate even more genes in ALS (or Alzheimer's, etc.).</p>

<p>Thus, for scientists who had decided to pursue a career in molecular biology and who thought they were in an impasse, there was a strong temptation to turn towards translation and post-translational modifications of proteins.</p>

<p>We were then inundated with studies claiming that this or that protein was poorly translated, poorly conformed or poorly localized in the cell. The subject of misfolded proteins even created small wars between biologists (Tauiste against Baptiste). The problem is that most of these proposed proteins are found in most neurodegenerative diseases, Tau, TDP-43, etc [1]. <strong>So they do not seem specific to ALS, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.</strong> If they are not specific, how can they be causative of one, but not other neurodegenerative diseases?</p>

<p>There are however alternative views among scientists working in the field of ALS, one is that ALS starts in muscles, not in the brain. This hypothesis has been both * proven and disproved * on several occasions, which seems very confusing from a non-specialist's point of view.
But anyway this hypothesis does not explain what would cause the muscle disease, it only pushes the explanation of this muscle wasting, away to future works.</p>

<p>If we think globally, like a doctor, there are two common reasons for cells to die (be it muscle cells or upper motor neurons). There is no need for extremely sophisticated explanations for this.</p>

<p>Either their blood supply is faulty (see the similarity to stroke above) or the cellular metabolism is faulty (hence the appearance of reactive stress).</p>

<p>It seems that articles on a defective metabolism are quite rare, but they could be found, here are examples [7-8, 13]. Some articles have even blamed the use of methionine sulfoximine (MSO) in a now abandoned flour bleaching process [8] or other environmental contaminants as contributing factors to ALS.
It is surprising that although there have been many publications on these two topics, <strong>no clinical trial has tried drugs linked to metabolic dysfunction</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, clinical trials could study:
 * MAO-B inhibitors [2],
 * Methionine sulfoximine (MSO) which dramatically extended the lifespan of a SOD1 G93A mouse model for ALS. [3]
 * Pathological inhibition of glutamine synthetase (GS). In the brain, GS is exclusively localized in astrocytes where it is used to maintain the glutamate-glutamine cycle, as well as nitrogen metabolism. Changes in GS activity have been identified in a number of neurological conditions [4].
 * Methionine sulfoximine (MSO), a well-characterized glutamine synthetase inhibitor, is a convulsant, particularly in dogs, but shows significant therapeutic benefits in animal models for several human diseases [5, 6]
 * But also many other drugs related to the brain and spine metabolism.</p>

		<h2 id="003">0:03</h2>

<p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every
layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. Today, we’re
going to have a conversation about hardware, and in particular about
how you can take the tools that come out of the world of chip design
and apply them to a much broader space of problems than people
typically think they can be applied to. And I’m joined in this
conversation by Andy Ray.</p>

<h2 id="031">0:31</h2>

<p>Hello, Ron, good to be chatting with you.</p>

<h2 id="033">0:33</h2>

<p>Andy is a longtime veteran of the hardware industry. He spent over a
decade building real shippable hardware designs, working on things
like modems and video codecs. And along that time, he also did a lot
of interesting work exploring and eventually designing his own
alternative languages for expressing hardware designs. The final one
was called <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml">Hardcaml</a>, which
is a hardware design language embedded inside
<a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, which itself is the primary programming
language we use here at Jane Street. And that work actually led him to
us. And today he works here and leads Jane Street’s hardware design
team. And so, to start with Andy, maybe you can tell us a little bit
about why hardware is useful for a technology organization and an
organization like ours, and what advantages it has over traditional
software-style approaches?</p>

<h2 id="123">1:23</h2>

<p>Sure. So hardware allows you to build customized architectures for a
specific problem, which can be tuned to trade off, at a very fine
level, lots of things like performance, and cost and power usage. That
lets you design a range of different products. Whereas with a CPU,
you’re very much more limited in the software world to the CPU design
that can meet the performance of the problem domain. I think the sorts
of problems that it can solve are very, very broad. And you can see
that just because well, a CPU is a hardware design, in fact. And you
can create all sorts of hybrid designs with multiple CPUs or digital
signal processors or custom hardware blocks that make up your final
solution. So I think that’s why hardware exists, why it will always
exist. It’s the fact that you can build architectures entirely suited
to your problem domain that optimize along these sort of areas.</p>

<h2 id="230">2:30</h2>

<p>That description on the face of it sounds awesome. And in fact, it
sounds from what you said so far, strictly superior to writing
software. I don’t think that’s quite true. Can you see more about what
the downsides are of operating inside of a hardware context?</p>

<h2 id="243">2:43</h2>

<p>Oh, my goodness, yes, there are a lot. So it is fundamentally this:
hardware designs are much, much more difficult to write than
equivalent software. So all that flexibility in choosing, you know,
the architecture for your problem domain, you actually have to
implement that. In software, you have reams and reams of support
libraries that either your organization has developed or that you can
pull in from open source or that you can go and purchase. To some
extent that infrastructure works in hardware with the idea of
intellectual property suppliers. They’re basically just companies who
supply a hardware design for you to integrate into your system. That’s
actually the job I used to do when we were developing video codecs.</p>

<h2 id="328">3:28</h2>

<p>Yeah. And just to interrupt for a second though, that was a bit of
terminology that really confused me when I first encountered the
hardware world. When people in hardware say, “IP,” they mean something
like when a software person says “library.”</p>

<h2 id="341">3:41</h2>

<p>Correct.</p>

<h2 id="342">3:42</h2>

<p>Which is to say some component that somebody else wrote that you get
to integrate. Except in this case, the component is a bundle of wires
that you kind of plop into your design rather than something that
looks more like a module or library.</p>

<h2 id="354">3:54</h2>

<p>Yeah, that’s right. I don’t know why that terminology came about, but
it’s just always been called IP when you buy hardware library
design. There’s some sort of infrastructure there for buying external
blocks to integrate with your hardware. It’s a vastly smaller
ecosystem than we have in software. It’s vastly more expensive. There
is in the last maybe ten years more of an open source community around
providing hardware blocks that you can integrate. But it’s still
absolutely miniscule compared to software. And then just the process
of writing hardware is slow and detailed. And I’m gonna say
difficult. I’m not so sure it is really technically that
difficult. It’s just that it’s so detailed, and you’re dealing with
such big systems that it becomes a real problem trying to manage the
complexity of all these very simple bits that sit together.</p>

<h2 id="453">4:53</h2>

<p>Right, I think of that as one of the paradoxes of hardware: hardware
is in the micro, in many different ways, simpler than software.</p>

<h2 id="500">5:00</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2 id="538">5:38</h2>

<p>The thing that you’re generating in a hardware design is essentially
some layout of the circuit, the individual gates and wires that
connect them. And it’s some kind of fairly static graph that
represents the structure of the computation, and is converted into,
when you actually get one of these fabricated, actual bits of material
laid out on a physical surface. And understanding how those individual
pieces work, at least logically how they work, leaving the physics
aside, is relatively simple. But then having a big design that does a
lot of these things, is enormously hard to reason about.</p>

<h2 id="537">5:37</h2>

<p>It is and unfortunately, the abstraction tools we have, they take us
some way. So you know, you talked about a chip design, which you can
think of as a layout of just two things really, lots of lots of NAND
gates (a Boolean AND function with the output NOTed) and metal wires that
connect them together. And it’s interesting because NAND is a
universal Boolean function. Any other Boolean function can be computed
with the NAND function. That’s not true of AND, for example, you can’t
create an OR with an AND, but you can create it with a NAND. And they
are like, I think sixteen Boolean functions, and four of them are
universal. I think NAND and NOR are quite often like the basis of
technology (NOR being an OR gate with the output inverted). We don’t
actually think about writing circuits at the level of just
interconnected NAND gates. An interesting aside, I believe the first
ARM processor was basically designed that way. But actually even
lower, they were drawing the transistors for the NAND gates in like
just a graphics package. That’s how they created the very first ARM
processor. But that’s not how they do it now. So we’re a little bit
above that: we work with a tool called a synthesizer, and it takes a
slightly more abstract notion of a hardware design in which we can
think about components like adders and multiplexers. And the job of
the synthesizer will be to turn those components into the actual low
level hardware components for the chip, which might be NAND gates if
you’re doing an ASIC, it might be look-up tables for an FPGA. But that
being said, it’s not massively above building it with NAND gates. But
really a lot of the industry just works at this sort of level of
putting together these macros, which represent adders and
multiplexers, and multipliers and registers and just wiring them
together and getting them to form some function.</p>

<h2 id="743">7:43</h2>

<p>So you were talking there about ASICS and FPGAs. Can you just quickly
explain what those are.</p>

<h2 id="749">7:49</h2>

<p>An ASIC is a custom-made chip that can perform a single function. In
contrast, an FPGA is a reprogrammable chip that can be programmed to
perform many different functions.</p>

<h2 id="803">8:03</h2>

<p>Got it. So when you talked about what the advantages are of hardware,
you talked about how by having much more control, you get to really
optimize the things you care about via power consumption or
performance or latency or whatever it is of the, of the, system. Can
you put a little bit of meat on the bones of that? What is the scale
of the improvements that you can get by taking something that you
might do in software and moving it into a hardware design?</p>

<h2 id="830">8:30</h2>

<p>It’s obviously going to depend on the sort of problem you’re trying to
solve. But you know, an area I know really well, video coding. I used
to work on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding">H.264</a> a lot and
there was just a really good software implementation called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X264">x264</a>, which was almost entirely
written in assembly, using the SSE instructions, which is a vector
instruction set on the x86 processor. And it could just about manage
like real-time 1080p on modern Intel processors of the time, which
were like four gigahertz processors. In order for it to achieve that
sort of performance, you had to turn off lots of lots and lots of
codec features. If you’re willing to go non-real-time, you could turn
on all sorts of features that would compress it better. There’s an
extremely large standard for H.264 that I used to read a lot, and
there’s a lot of features on that thing, but you just can’t do them
all. And so we used to target different markets, there was like, a
sort of low-end video codec, which could fit in smaller FPGAs, could
be used for like internet based communication. And there was like
really high-end video codecs, which were built over multiple FPGAs,
and had a really high end feature set, and was used for
professional-grade encoding. So that’s the sort of video that you get
over your satellite link or over your cable link. That bitstream is
compressed as much as it possibly can be so they can fit more channels
into that link. We didn’t have to compromise so much on the features
to do that with hardware, we could pick the features that made the
difference that got us to the bit rate, and they could run in real
time. And you just couldn’t do that real time in software. You know,
in that world, you’re looking at an order of magnitude more
computation being done by these FPGAs. But these sort of things can
scale massively. They’re like chips, which do packet processing, for
example. So the idea here is you’ve got a switch and you want to do
packet processing to detect threats in those packets to route …</p></div></div>

I can say that it is <em>the</em> most interesting textbook I have gone through. Imagine, you begin with just 4 or 5 constructs, and you end up building algebraic equation solvers, circuit simulators, and even logic programming languages. Because you start off with such few constructs, the added benefit is that you begin to see the fundamentally simple, shared essence in programming. </p><p>I wanted to give you one example that surprised me in the book. We tend to think that <strong>classes belong in a</strong> <strong>fundamentally different category</strong> <strong>from functions.</strong> </p><p>But are they so different? </p><p>For example, let’s say we have a class like this:</p><pre><code>class Person { 
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.fName = firstName; 
    this.lName = lastName;
  }
  getFullName() { 
    return this.fName + ' ' + this.lName;
  }
  setFirstName(firstName) {
    this.fName = firstName;
  }
}</code></pre><p>Well, if we think about it, this is really just a higher order function. a <code>Person</code> higher order function accepts arguments (constructor), and returns a list of functions that can manipulate those arguments (methods). We could write <code>Person</code> like this: </p><pre><code> function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  let fName = firstName; 
  let lName = lastName;

  function getFullName() { 
    return fName + ' ' + lName;
  }
  
  function setFirstName(firstName) { 
    fName = firstName
  }

  return function(method) { 
    switch (method) { 
      case 'getFullName': 
        return getFullName;
      case 'setFirstName': 
        return setFirstName;  
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>Now, </p><pre><code>const person = new Person("Ben", "Bitdiddle")
person.getFullName()</code></pre><p>becomes</p><pre><code>const person = Person("Ben", "Bitdiddle")
person('getFullName')()</code></pre><p>Here, instead of invoking a method, we are “passing” a message. This is why by the way, many classic OO folks talk about object orientation really being about message passing.  </p><p>Yup, really. Classes are just higher order functions, which accept arguments (constructor) and return a list of functions that can manipulate those arguments (methods). </p><p>When you previously thought two concepts were different, but they turn out to be the same, you’re ripe to discover new ideas: you can find the deeper abstractions between them, apply ideas from across those seemingly different categories, and move between concepts more fluidly. So, not only are epiphanies like this fun, but they’re much more useful than you’d think. </p><p>If you liked this, there are a <em>ton</em> of similar epiphanies in the textbook. To experience it best, I suggest picking a partner and working through the book together.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Alex Reichert, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>Our <strong>12 Questions</strong> series takes you into the minds of influential leaders to discuss today’s hot topics. Read their fresh views on leadership, managing through change, and the ins and outs of modern work. Think of it as your office hours with some of the most innovative people in business.</p><p>We continue this series on resilience with Ben Werdmuller. <a href="https://twitter.com/benwerd?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_self">Ben</a> is an award-winning startup founder, venture capital investor at the intersection of media and technology, product owner, CTO, and full-stack developer. He writes prolifically about his work and loves to work on projects that allow him to draw together his diverse experience in the service of great ventures that make society more informed, empowered, and empathetic. <strong>Full interview below.</strong></p><hr><p><br><strong>Can you describe your career in 12 words or less?</strong></p><p>Engineer to accidental founder to impact investor to mission-driven product lead.</p><p><strong>What does being resilient mean to you?</strong></p><p>Work is getting faster and more intense. Our work lives are often hyperconnected, and the lines between work and life continue to blur. But we're also still human: real people with lives, commitments, and stresses outside of work.</p><p>Being resilient as a person means finding ways to intentionally set boundaries, conserve your energy, be self-aware, and meet your needs in a way that allows you to sustainably be present and effective at work and in your home life. It's partially about establishing the right rhythms and structures for you and your team, and partially about recognizing and embracing our human characteristics.</p><p>In a world where more workers are suffering from burnout than ever before, tools for stronger resiliency are vital work practices.</p><p><strong>How has your thinking about resilience changed in 2020?</strong></p><p>2020 has made the need for resilience more pressing for many people, myself included. We're still in the middle of a global, deadly pandemic. Many of us have had to learn to be more mindful, to find techniques for better emotional regulation, to more actively learn, and to more intentionally lead by example in our companies and communities.</p><p>At the same time, it's been made clearer to a lot more people that some communities have faced harsher challenges than others for generations. The current civil rights movement - one of the largest in the history of the world - gives me a lot of hope that we'll see real change, but there's a lot of work to do. The resiliency that truly matters is going to be found in the people that are fighting to challenge the discriminatory institutions and assumptions that underpin almost every aspect of society, in the face of stark opposition.</p><p>Companies are communities of people. Resilience at work means acknowledging that you can't separate the worker from the human. We all bring our whole selves to work, and that should include our moral compass. By tackling the human rights issues that affect the lives of members of our communities, we can build safer, more resilient workplaces.<br></p><p><strong>How have you come to understand the importance of resilience in your own career?</strong></p><p>For most of the last decade, my mother has been suffering from a terminal, genetic disease that I assumed I would eventually get too. Thankfully, a recent DNA test showed me that I wouldn't, but the battle remains for my mother and others in my family. There are certainly times when I lie awake at night, unable to let go of my anxiety. But through mindfulness, therapy, coaching, and a lot of leadership training, I've been able to show up as support for my family while making significant progress in my career and leading teams that have built products I'm proud of.</p><p>If I hadn't shown up for my family, and instead had focused on my career, I never would have been able to forgive myself. Likewise, making real progress on meaningful work has improved my well-being in a way that helped me better support the people I love. Being resilient meant taking care of my whole self, so I could take care of the people around me.<br></p><p><strong>When was the last time you had to check in with yourself?</strong></p><p>I try and check in with myself every day. Inspired by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/toolkit/activity/feedback-grid" rel="noopener" target="_self">feedback grids</a>, I like to ask myself four questions:</p><p><em>1. What did I do well today?</em></p><p><em>2. What could have gone better?</em></p><p><em>3. What questions do I have about the future?</em></p><p><em>4. What ideas do I have for changing how I show up?</em></p><p>The answers could be personal, or they could be professional. Usually, it's a mix of both.</p><p>I try to be honest with myself, but I also like to get feedback from the people I work with, using a <a href="https://medium.com/matter-driven-narrative/feedback-is-a-gift-df8fbf599b69" rel="noopener" target="_self">technique</a> inspired by <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/carole-robin-how-create-feedback-rich-environment" rel="noopener" target="_self">Carole Robin's framework for a feedback-rich environment</a>. It's good to be self-reflective and check in with myself, but I want to make sure that I check in with others, too. I'm certain I could be more self-aware than I am, and I want to avoid blind spots if I can.<br></p><p><strong>Is there a time when you wish you were more resilient?</strong></p><p>Frankly, always. Life is stressful; work is stressful; living in a pandemic is stressful. In our current moment, I've intentionally lowered my bar for what constitutes "showing up" - but I wish it could be higher.</p><p><strong>What’s one big mistake you made and how did you bounce back?</strong></p><p>At a startup earlier in my career, I made an architecture decision that made our platform noticeably slow for users. We had to scramble to fix it. I was embarrassed, but learned how to make sure I never did anything like it again.</p><p>The way to bounce back is to place the emphasis on learning, not blame. These are the questions I try to ask:</p><p><em>1. What actually happened, and why?</em></p><p><em>2. What would prevent it from happening again?</em></p><p><em>3. What checks can we establish to make sure that happens?</em></p><p>I also push back - hard - against any attempts to ascribe blame or create bad feelings for a mistake. We all make them. Environments that punish people for trying and failing will just result in fewer people trying.<br></p><p><strong>What are some mistakes we all make when it comes to resilience?</strong></p><p>Ignoring it, and pushing ourselves harder than we should at the expense of our well-being. Not only do we hurt ourselves in the process, but we become part of making a less resilient environment for others. It takes a lot more strength to maintain boundaries and look after yourself if no-one else around you is doing it.</p><p><strong>How can people be more resilient in their work-life?</strong></p><p>Emotions play an important role in the way we think and act. So does our physical wellness. It's important to take care of ourselves: exercise, eat well, get good sleep, and practice mindfulness. In times of extreme stress, finding the things to be grateful for is also important - otherwise we tend to over-index on our negative experiences. And finally, it's not just about ourselves: we need to promote these things in the people around us, too, and be mindful and observant about how they're doing.</p><p>We all need to look out for the whole human, not just the tiny sliver of a human that is responsible for completing tasks relevant to the work we do. And we need to take it seriously.<br></p><p><strong>Vulnerability plays a critical role in building trust among teams. How much does showing humanity help in building a resilient team?</strong></p><p>Culture is the most important thing in any team. By a mile. Your collective norms, beliefs, and practices will define how everyone acts and reacts, how safe they feel to be themselves at work, and as a direct result, how high quality the work itself is.</p><p>Showing someone that you're human gives them permission to do the same. It also gives them permission to be more honest with you; you'll get better feedback, catch issues earlier, and understand when someone is having struggles. It makes it easier to create an environment where everyone can do their best work.</p><p><strong>Who's the most resilient person that you know? Why?</strong></p><p>I'm inspired by all the people who have literally been fighting for equality for their entire lives. I can't begin to imagine the resiliency required to fight for the human rights of you and your community, day in, day out, with no end in sight. I wish it wasn't required.</p><p><strong>If you could leave people with one piece of advice about how to deal with what's happening right now in the world, what would it be?</strong></p><p>Listen to the experts, center their lived experience and expertise - and then participate. We're all part of what happens next.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@benwerd" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/1e6d0351b98744fece0ad48104ceb5e6aa9da61e-2316x2316.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Inline image"></a></p><p>Ben in the great outdoors!</p><hr></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>When it comes to building apps, no-code is having its moment. Typeform is a shining example of how no-code is well suited for simple use cases, and here at JourneyApps we use it extensively. However, therein lies the problem: No-code’s sweet spot is simple use cases. This limitation of no-code tools has been well analyzed. [<a href="https://journeyapps.com/blog/low-code-road-to-software-enlightenment-part-1/">1</a>][<a href="https://www.alexhudson.com/2020/01/13/the-no-code-delusion/">2</a>]</p>

<p>If you want to build more sophisticated custom software, you essentially have two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use a no-code/low-code tool and jump through nasty hoops to implement the sophisticated parts of your app — which most often means writing actual code that needs to conform to the constraints of the tool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use pro-code tools such as Swift/Objective-C, or frameworks like Xamarin/MAUI, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://journeyapps.com/assets/images/blog/2020-09-08-no-code-vs-pro-code-a-new-hope/1.png" alt="image"></p>

<p><em>Image: building anything beyond basic logic with a visual programming language ends up looking like this</em></p>

<h3 id="a-big-problem-that-needs-solving">A Big Problem That Needs Solving</h3>

<p>Both of the above approaches (using pro-code, or using a low-code platform’s pro-code extensibility) are time-consuming, although for different reasons. Both also require senior developer talent, while senior developers are as scarce as hen’s teeth.</p>

<p>The result is that many companies are highly constrained while executing on ambitious software and digital initiatives.</p>

<p>These are the companies that we serve. Enterprise developers have been building custom apps using code on JourneyApps since 2009.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 2019 we wanted to up the ante. We wanted to offer a new app development paradigm for companies with a large app backlog, especially where a big chunk of that backlog consisted of ambitious B2E and B2B apps.</p>

<p>We set two high level goals for ourselves: help companies write great software much more productively (especially those whose core focus is not software), and let them do this using modern software technologies and best practices, without the typical barriers.</p>

<h3 id="key-tenets-of-what-we-set-out-to-build">Key Tenets of What We Set Out to Build</h3>

<p>We decided that the best thing we could do was to build a next-generation IDE (as a complement to our full-stack app platform) that has the <strong>power and flexibility of pro-code</strong> at its core, but also has the high <strong>development velocity and easy adoption of no-code/low-code platforms</strong>.</p>

<p>From the start, we decided that some things are non-negotiable:</p>

<h4 id="1-coding-should-be-easy">1. Coding should be easy</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Creating a new app shouldn’t require any configuration or setup.</li>
  <li>Developers should be able to start coding immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-coding-should-have-a-fast-feedback-loop">2. Coding should have a fast feedback loop</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We will have a first-class IDE with real-time error checking, keyboard shortcuts, IntelliSense, etc.</li>
  <li>Developers should have access to a real debugger.</li>
  <li>We will have live, stateful hot reload on an actual device in development mode — not a time-consuming compile &amp; deploy process.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-coding-in-the-ide-should-be-fun-and-relevant">3. Coding in the IDE should be fun and relevant</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We will not use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a>: We will support open-source programming languages – preferably those with gradual typing.</li>
  <li>We will not use convoluted proprietary visual interfaces.</li>
  <li>We will not use a proprietary “app store”. Developers must be able to import open source packages.</li>
  <li>The IDE should be easily accessible to junior developers.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-coding-should-be-as-efficient-as-possible">4. Coding should be as efficient as possible</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We will provide developers with powerful functionality that can be used with minimal lines of code, and customized as required. This will include things like bi-directional relational offline data sync, dozens of UI components including Excel-like data grids, full audit trails, a cross-platform BLE engine, to name just a few.</li>
  <li>We will offer full git support with either hosted git, or external git providers (e.g. GitHub)</li>
  <li>We will support unit testing.</li>
  <li>We will support multiple environments, with easy portability of changes as new versions of software are moved from one environment to the next.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-there-should-always-be-an-escape-hatch">5. There should always be an escape hatch</h4>

<ul>
  <li>There will be APIs for everything.</li>
  <li>We will allow developers to easily mix in fully custom HTML in their UIs, and allow those custom HTML components to communicate bidirectionally with the rest of the frontend stack, when required.</li>
  <li>There will be a Node.js environment in our cloud backend where developers can build any custom backend functionality, without any configuration or setup.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6-the-platform-should-be-secure-by-design">6. The platform should be secure by design</h4>

<h3 id="a-foundational-decision-building-a-web-ide">A Foundational Decision: Building a Web IDE</h3>

<p>We were taking the time to figure out a new approach to app development from first principles, so we had to make big design decisions with significant trade-offs. One major early decision was whether to build a web-based IDE or an installable desktop IDE.</p>

<p>The obvious question is: “Why an IDE on the web?”. We strongly believe that the recent developments across browser technology, transpiled languages and new approaches to software development (such as declarative UI) have made it possible to not only reach a desktop-grade level of quality in a web IDE, but also capitalize on the inherent benefits of the web paradigm.</p>

<p>Using this approach, we would have an IDE that is evergreen, cross-platform, cross-device, backed by modern UI and most importantly, ready for the future. Oh, and there would be nothing to install. Perhaps the biggest win, however, would be our ability to innovate quickly due to the open nature of web technologies and how quickly they evolve.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss other key design decisions in separate posts.</p>

<h3 id="unveiling-the-solution">Unveiling the Solution</h3>

<p>Today, we’re incredibly proud to announce <a href="https://journeyapps.com/platform/oxide/">OXIDE</a>. It’s the fruit of a lot of hard work by the JourneyApps team over the past year.</p>

<p>OXIDE helps both junior and senior developers build sophisticated cross-platform apps using JavaScript or TypeScript, complemented by visual tools. Apps can run natively on mobile and desktop operating systems, or in the browser as PWAs. Under the hood, OXIDE uses CRDTs [<a href="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/are-crdts-suitable-for-shared-editing/">3</a>] to enable live co-editing in teams, and it is deeply integrated with both GitHub and npm. In OXIDE, developers can switch between visual editing and coding for UI layout and schema design. Developers also have access to a first-class code debugging tool.</p>

<p>OXIDE is a fundamental pillar of the broader JourneyApps platform. Therefore, all apps inherit other flagship JourneyApps technologies out of the box — technologies that have seen around 10 years of R&amp;D and battle-hardening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All apps ship with an enterprise-grade BaaS, and it’s easy to integrate with other data sources (in part because the platform is not based on a DSL).</li>
  <li>All apps are offline-first: Data is automatically synced to user devices, and loaded from the local database on each view. Querying data is fast. This avoids complicated state management and/or query cache systems. (What happens when data volumes scale? The platform provides highly configurable <a href="https://docs.journeyapps.com/reference/container/introduction-to-sync-rules">selective syncing.</a>)</li>
  <li>Each app is automatically provisioned with a Node.js serverless compute environment so that developers of all skill levels can add server-side logic and functionality.</li>
  <li>Developers have access to a rich built-in UI component set that is designed to work with data, with very little development overhead. No tweaking of styles or adding event listeners and state management to each component — this is handled for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, JourneyApps takes the complexity out of the development cycle. We take care of the hard problems of enterprise software development (hosting, offline data sync, mobile app builds, backend APIs, deployment tooling, audit trails, and more) so that developers can focus on core app requirements and maximize the rate of innovation at their companies.</p>

<p>Working in OXIDE looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://journeyapps.com/assets/images/blog/2020-09-08-no-code-vs-pro-code-a-new-hope/2.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>And here’s a view of a debugging session. The app can be seen on the bottom right (running on macOS), the Chrome developer tools on the top right, and OXIDE on the left:</p>

<p>48 hours after the shocking <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/08/28/unplugged-tesla-model-3-crashes-at-pikes-peak-pics-videos/">crash of the Unplugged Performance Tesla Model 3 at Pikes Peak</a>, the car was back to the track one more time. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Unplugged team and the Tesla engineers who came to help in this crucial moment.</p>



<h2>The Resurrection</h2>



<p>The sub-frames of the car were bent and it was almost declared ‘totaled’ — but if there’s a will, there is always a way. A new Tesla Model 3 Performance was purchased to retrofit the sub-frames, motors, and other parts. </p>



<p>Tesla also rushed to cooperate in this effort by providing parts within hours of requirements from the car’s resurrection team.</p>



<p>Our friend Sofiaan Fraval from the Third Row Podcast covered the entire event with his camera and kept the Tesla Community in the loop. He took us inside the Eurocars workshop in the following video when the team was prepping the new glass roof for the tuned Model 3.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/owner-stories/">Tesla Community</a> also helped the team working on the CORSA 42 Unplugged Performance Tesla Model 3 at the workshop. They supported the team by giving moral support in person, on social media, and even sending meals for the team to keep their energy levels up and running.</p>



<p>Here are a few photographs of the Unplugged team working on the Tesla Model 3 resurrection for its next and final run on the Pikes Peak for this year.</p>

<p>As we showed in the first part of this story, one wheel of this Model 3 was totally damaged, and probably the other ones also weren’t in their perfect shape. So Unplugged Performance brought in a new set of Forged Monoblock Made-for-Tesla wheels.</p>

<p>Legendary pro racing car driver Randy Pobst is the one piloting this ultra-tuned electric beast of a vehicle. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The night before the Race Day, Randy test drove the newly rebuilt Unplugged <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> at the local airport, he thought the car was ready for the Pikes Peak hill climb.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>He talks about the re-building of the totaled Tesla Model 3 Performance in record time in the following video before attempting the final run on Pikes Peak. He calls this heroic vehicle restoration effort the ‘Teslurrection’.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Impossible? Better luck next year? </p><p>We laughed in the face of adversity and overcame the odds. </p><p>We then raced 14,000 feet to the summit at Pikes Peak to say: Tesla spirit never quits!</p><cite>Unplugged Performance via <a href="https://twitter.com/UnpluggedTesla/status/1300138406324965377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>The Race Day</h2>



<p>Randy started the race with the utmost enthusiasm that is required to accomplish such feat as the Pikes Peak Hill Climb. As the Model 3 reached higher altitude, he felt something was not right.</p>



<p>The battery pack temperature of the car was rising beyond what is considered normal in these conditions. The Tesla safety algorithm kicked in and slowed down the vehicle to protect the battery pack.</p>

</figure>

<amp-youtube data-videoid="d7MFCRsE4ag" layout="responsive" width="16" height="9" title="Race Day Teslurrection" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer><a placeholder="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7MFCRsE4ag"><amp-img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d7MFCRsE4ag/hqdefault.jpg" layout="fill" object-fit="cover" alt="Race Day Teslurrection" i-amphtml-layout="fill"></amp-img></a></amp-youtube>
</div></figure>



<p>This was perhaps a broken coolant tube or other damage in the battery pack of the car from the previous crash that went undetected in the restoration process.</p>



<p>However, Unplugged Performance is still investigating the actual cause of this battery pack overheating. This problem in the heat management system restricted the car’s peak power to a meager 240hp that is even lower than a Standard Range Plus Model 3.</p>



<p>The dream of completing the Pikes Peak hill climb lap in less than 10 mins wasn’t achieved. But still, it was a great adventure and the Tesla Community around the world is proud of the efforts of everyone involved.</p>



<p>The 2020 Unplugged Performance Tesla Model 3 Ascension-R completed the Pikes Peak lap in 11:04.131 — just behind a 2018 Tesla Model 3 which did it in 11:02.802 in the Exhibition category (full results PDF below).</p>



<h2>What Went Wrong</h2>



<p>As of this writing, Unplugged Performance released the following side-by-side comparison video of their qualifying vs Race Day runs — the results show that at least 230hp of the power was missing.</p>



<p>The Unplugged team also posted its analysis in the video description as:</p>



<blockquote><p>A week has gone by and we still do not know the causation of our casual Sunday drive on race day, but we at least now clearly know the problem. We ran the full race in limp mode! Our 11:04 run was with a power limit of 180kw for 10 of the 11 minutes. That’s 240hp peak power for almost the entire race…basically half of what the car should be outputting. We would have had more power in a Standard Range Model 3! </p><p>In the video, you’ll see that even despite a full battery state of charge, our power was lower right off of the line. Then something even more strange happened, the battery went directly to bright red and severe power cut at just under a minute (the display is visible in our other video). After that 180kw / 240hp was all the power the car could give us for the full race. Randy Pobst described the race as a tourist drive and that he had time to admire the scenery as the car gracefully, albeit slowly, escorted him to the summit. </p><p>In the end, we celebrated overcoming the extreme odds. It was still a victory for us. Just a much more leisurely pace to the top than we all expected.</p><cite>Source: Unplugged Performance / YouTube.</cite></blockquote>

<p>Still, the race and all the mission-critical stuff was an exciting joyride and this is just the beginning of what emission-free electric vehicles can achieve in the future. Let’s watch the in-car video of the final Race Day attempt and:</p>

			<section>
				<p>Blogging has been an exciting experience so far. After writing about <a href="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/open-core-first-principles/">a simple framework for building Open Core businesses</a>, I wanted to explore why Open Core is the better model (compared to Red Hat’s “Stable Release” approach). I didn’t do it, because I ended up writing about <a href="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/red-hats-business-model-was-an-outlier/">market data that proves that Open Core companies are financially more successful</a>. Now I’m sitting here, and I want to write the Open Core “deep-dive” blog post, but my brain keeps wandering off. I can’t stop thinking about MongoDB, the open source vendor with the highest market cap<sup>[1]</sup>. It’s such a fascinating business and extraordinarily transformed itself over the last years. But let’s take it step by step.</p><h2 id="self-managed-software-was-mongodb-s-roots">Self-managed Software Was MongoDB’s Roots</h2><p>MongoDB Inc. is the commercial vendor behind the MongoDB NoSQL database. Startup success stories are never a straight line, and MongoDB<sup>[2]</sup> is no exception. In 2007, the team planned on building an open source PaaS, but couldn’t find a database that would fit their needs. MongoDB was born, and eventually, the company scrapped its old vision and focused exclusively on building the database business<sup>[3]</sup>. Fast-forward a couple of years, MongoDB sees more than 30M downloads of the open source project, generates $100M+ in revenue, serves more than 4,000 customers, and goes public on October 20, 2017.</p><p>To quote from MongoDB’s S-1:</p><blockquote>“<em>MongoDB is the leading, modern database platform, built to run applications at scale across a broad range of use cases in the cloud, on-premise or in a hybrid environment. <strong>Our primary subscription package is MongoDB Enterprise Advanced, our comprehensive offering for enterprise customers that can be run in the cloud, on-premise or in a hybrid environment. </strong>MongoDB Enterprise Advanced includes our proprietary database server, advanced security, enterprise management capabilities, our graphical user interface, analytics integrations, technical support and a commercial license to our platform. <strong>We also offer MongoDB Atlas, our cloud hosted database-as-a-service</strong>, or DBaaS, offering that includes comprehensive infrastructure and management of our Community Server offering.</em>”</blockquote><p>In 2016, the year before MongoDB went public, the company generated 90% of its revenue from the downloadable, self-managed<sup>[4]</sup> enterprise product (called “MongoDB Enterprise Advanced”). Another 9% came from professional services associated with its enterprise business. Only 1% came from its “MongoDB Atlas” SaaS offering. That’s not surprising. <strong>The developer tool and infrastructure market lagged other market categories in terms of SaaS and public cloud adoption.</strong> It has started to shift over the last years, and nowadays, most newly founded B2B startups go SaaS first. But if you founded a company in 2007, the world looked very different.</p><p>In terms of numbers, MongoDB is a healthy, high-growth technology company (this was before companies like Zoom reset our expectations for what’s possible). Pre IPO, revenue grew 50%+ YoY, and MongoDB’s customer growth was accelerating with YoY growth between 70-90%.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Revenue-and-Customer-Growth.svg" alt=""></figure><p>I remember looking at those numbers a few years ago. I was curious about the financial profile of developer-focused companies to better plan and model the Codeship business. In 2016, there weren’t many public companies selling to developers. I looked at all of them, and there was a pattern between the Atlassian’s, New Relic’s, and Twilio’s of the world. All of them saw quarter-over-quarter increases in their average revenue per customer. It wasn’t surprising. New Relic and Twilio became successful through developers championing their products and bringing them into their companies. Atlassian did product-led growth before it became the latest trend of the day. Atlassian has always been focused on the end-user, a simple online purchase process, and avoided a sales team as long as possible. All those companies have terrific Net Dollar Expansion rates, and their customers spend more and more over time. Additionally, when those companies matured, they started to move up-market. Once they seeded their products with enough teams inside a given company, they sold enterprise-level agreements. Larger companies spend more on software, are often willing to prepay for many years, and churn less than the SMB or Midmarket segment. <strong>Starting with SMBs, the Midmarket, or small teams inside large organizations and eventually moving upmarket is a well-established playbook.</strong></p><p>All of this brings me back to MongoDB. Atlassian, New Relic, Twilio - they all increased their average revenue per customer over time. They grew their customer base, and they grew their revenue proportionally faster than their customer base. MongoDB was the exception. Its revenue per customer declined over time, which at first didn’t make any sense to me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Average-Revenue-Per-Customer.svg" alt=""></figure><p>It was even more astounding that while their average revenue per customer decreased, MongoDB successfully grew the number of customers paying more than $100K per year. At the end of FY16 (the first time they reported the metric), MongoDB had 246 $100K+ customers. One year later, the number grew to 354, and by the end of FY18, MongoDB had 557 of those high-value customers. Despite the larger number of high-ACV customers, MongoDB’s average revenue per customer decreased. The only explanation for that could be that there’s a growing long-tail of small customers.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Average-Revenue_Customers-and-_-100K-Customers.svg" alt=""></figure><h2 id="disrupt-yourself-or-get-disrupted">Disrupt Yourself or Get Disrupted</h2><p>When a company goes public, its S-1 filing shares much more data than a private company would ever transparently communicate. Yet, it only provides a short history, and if a company goes through a significant transformation, it’s hard to see the full picture. In hindsight, everything is more obvious. MongoDB was quietly working on their next S-curve. Developers are more and more building new applications in the cloud. It was clear to MongoDB that SaaS was the future. Without a solution for this increasingly important market segment, MongoDB knew that they couldn’t keep growing and would eventually stall and become irrelevant.</p><p>Looking back, MongoDB’s average revenue per customer decreasing was a good sign. The cause was its blossoming Atlas SaaS business. Only after the IPO, MongoDB started to break out dedicated numbers for SaaS vs. self-managed, and they are mind-blowing. Atlas grew 15.5x in FY18, 5.4x in FY19, and another 2.7x in FY20. It could be a standalone public company. What was 1% of total revenue at IPO time in 2017 became 44% of total revenue in Q2 2020 (= Q2’FY21).</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Revenue-By-Product.svg" alt=""></figure><p>SaaS revenue per customer is typically lower than revenue from self-managed products. It implies a specific customer segmentation. SaaS skews towards SMB, Midmarket, and pockets of teams in enterprises. Self-managed skews towards enterprises. Those large companies adopt new technology slower and have more stringent security requirements. The two worlds couldn’t be more opposite. SMB/Midmarket SaaS results in many small customers. Enterprise/Self-managed results in fewer and larger customers. Christopher Janz wrote a fantastic blog post about <a href="http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2019/04/five-years-later-five-ways-to-build-100.html">the different ways to generate $100M in revenue</a>. I highly recommend reading it.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Total-Number-of-Customers.svg" alt=""></figure><p>As long as MongoDB didn’t break out customer and revenue numbers per product, there was no way to tell them apart. The result was the confusing, decreasing average revenue per customer chart. With more data available now, we can analyze both revenue streams. We can see that MongoDB is growing its Atlas customer base, while its self-managed product is losing customers. Most customers of the self-managed product are likely converting to the SaaS solution. MongoDB is not churning those customers but leveraging its existing relationships to transition those customers to a cloud-native model. Despite the customer churn, the traditional business is still growing its overall revenue. The average revenue per customer of the self-managed business grew 3x over two years. That segment of customers is expanding, using the product more, and paying MongoDB more every year<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Average-Revenue_Customer-By-Product-1.svg" alt=""></figure><p>Even those hefty increases can’t offset the influx of small SaaS customers. The Atlas customers are paying a fraction (1/17!) of the self-managed customers. That’s despite the average revenue per SaaS customer doubling over the last two years as well. Keep in mind, this is positive, and only a testament to MongoDB’s SaaS efforts’ success. All it means is that the aggregated numbers are confusing, and frankly irrelevant.</p><h2 id="winners-consolidate-markets">Winners Consolidate Markets</h2><p>The number of Atlas customers increased significantly FY18 to FY19. This jump didn’t happen organically. MongoDB acquired one of its competitors in the SaaS market in October 2018 (which is FY19) - mLab. In the same month, MongoDB Inc. decided to relicense the MongoDB open source project under the Server Side Public License (SSPL)<sup>[6]</sup>. The license change resulted in an outcry in the open source community. Debating whether the SSPL still counts as “open source” and why MongoDB felt they had to do this deserves a dedicated blog post. The purpose of the SSPL is clear. To quote from <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB’s announcement blog post</a>:</p><blockquote>“<em>The SSPL is designed to make sure that companies who do run a publicly available MongoDB (or any software subject to the SSPL) as a service are giving back to the community.</em>”</blockquote><p>In a nutshell, this means that <strong>anybody who offers a MongoDB-aaS product needs to open-source the underlying code that makes providing such a service possible</strong>. MongoDB took a clear shot at the large cloud providers, particularly Amazon Web Services. AWS excels in taking open source projects and running those for their customers as-a-Service.</p><p>AWS mostly didn’t care. A few months after MongoDB’s license changed, AWS launched DocumentDB, a proprietary NoSQL database that is compatible with MongoDB<sup>[7]</sup>. The compatibility only works for older versions that were released before the license change. But, that’s sufficient for AWS to provide a migration path for the many MongoDB enterprise workloads that rarely run on the latest version anyway. I still find it …</p></section></div></article></div></div>

<p>Since the IETF’s CFRG decided to recommend OPAQUE as a next-generation <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/21/authenticated-key-exchanges/">Password Authenticated Key Exchange</a>, there has been a lot of buzz in the cryptography community about committing authenticated encryption (known to the more academically inclined as Random Key Robustness), because OPAQUE requires <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/2W9LoeeiRzAiTWVnDsyxvjYPPmo/">an RKR-secure AE scheme</a>.</p>



<p>Random Key Robustness is a property that some symmetric encryption modes have, where it’s not feasible to decrypt a valid (ciphertext, tag) pair into two different plaintexts if both recipients are using different keys.</p>



<p>To illustrate this visually:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1348" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/robustness/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png" data-orig-size="750,550" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="robustness" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png" alt="An example of random key robustness: encrypting two different images, with two different keys, can produce an identical stream of bits (ciphertext + tag)."><figcaption>RKR-secure ciphers don’t let people produce the same ciphertext+tag from two different plaintexts, with two different keys. You might be able to create an identical ciphertext, but the authentication tag will differ. (Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/SwizzlestixUK">Swizz</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the wake of the CFRG discussion, it became immediately clear that <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM doesn’t meet this requirement</a>.</p>



<p>What wasn’t immediately clear is <a href="https://keymaterial.net/2020/09/07/invisible-salamanders-in-aes-gcm-siv/">that AES-GCM-SIV also falls short</a>. But don’t take my word for it, Sophie Schmieg worked out the math in the linked post, which I highly recommend reading.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that AES-GCM or AES-GCM-SIV are doomed, or should be deprecated. You probably don’t even care about Random Key Robustness in most of the places you’d use either algorithm! But if you are doing something where RKR actually matters, you probably care a lot. And it certainly violates the principle of least astonishment.</p>



<p>ChaCha20-Poly1305 won’t save you here either, since this is a property that message authentication codes based on cryptographic hash functions (e.g. HMAC) provide, but polynomial MACs (GMAC, Poly1305, etc.) do not.</p>



<p>So, if every standardized and widely-supported AEAD construction fails to provide RKR security, what’s a software engineer to do?<em> <a href="https://vnhacker.blogspot.com/2020/08/so-you-want-to-roll-your-own-crypto.html">Roll their own crypto</a>?!</em></p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="61" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/glitch-ecb/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png" data-orig-size="224,224" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="glitch-ecb" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png" alt=""><figcaption>Don’t actually do that. (Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/SwizzlestixUK">Swizz</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you’re always on a well-tread path with a well-defined, standard threat model (i.e. client-server application accessible via TLS 1.3, possibly storing hashed passwords server-side), then rolling your own crypto isn’t just dangerous; it’s wholly unnecessary.</p>



<h2 id="coping-with-nonstandard-threat-models">Coping with Non-Standard Threat Models</h2>



<p>Systems that require Random Key Robustness do not fall within the standard threat model of AEAD cipher constructions.</p>



<p>However, RKR is far from the only scenario in which application developers might find themselves without a clear solution. Another example that comes up a lot:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I need to encrypt data in a relational database, but still somehow use it in SELECT queries.”</p><cite>— Far too many damn developers who haven’t heard of <a href="https://ciphersweet.paragonie.com/">CipherSweet</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The first thing that you should do is clearly document your requirements and what attacks your system must protect against. Any undefined attack vector in your model should be assumed to be a vulnerability in your design. (This gets into <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">Unknown Unknowns</a> territory quickly.)</p>



<p>And then you should have a cryptographer review your design, and then have a cryptography engineer build it for you.</p>



<p><strong><em>But where’s the fun in that?</em></strong></p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Instead of copping out with sane and reasonable advice, let’s actually walk through the process. At the end of this post, I’ll share a toy example I cooked up for this blog post.</p>



<h2 id="designing-new-cryptography">Designing New Cryptography</h2>



<h3 id="understand-the-problem">First, Understand the Problem</h3>



<p>Why don’t AES-GCM, etc. provide Random Key Robustness? Because they’re built with universal hash functions rather than cryptographic hash functions.</p>



<p>Cryptographic hash functions have different properties (i.e. preimage resistance and collision resistance) that make it significantly difficult to calculate two different authentication tags under two different keys. Attacking HMAC-SHA-256 in this way is about <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/19/the-physics-of-brute-force/">as expensive as brute forcing a 128-bit AES key</a>. (Good luck with that!)</p>



<p>However, cryptographic hash functions are much slower than polynomial MACs, and using them in a construction like HMAC approximately doubles the slowness.</p>



<p>You might be tempted to just hash they key and the message together to save on CPU cycles, but that’s actually <a href="https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2012/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hash-length-extension-attacks">not safe for the hash functions nearly everybody uses</a> (due to length extension attacks).</p>



<p>It logically follows that, <strong>if we had an AEAD cipher construction based on a hash function, we could have RKR security</strong>.</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 id="prior-art">Look At Prior Art</h3>



<p>Before the days of AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305, there were a lot of ad hoc constructions used everywhere based on <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-aes-cbc">AES-CBC and HMAC</a>. (In that era, everyone used HMAC-SHA1, but don’t do that.)</p>



<p>However, there are a number of problems with ad hoc CBC+HMAC that we don’t want to reintroduce in modern systems:</p>



<ol><li>If you forget to include the initialization vector in the HMAC tag, you give attackers free reign over the first 16 bytes of the decrypted plaintext without having to break the MAC.</li><li>The order of operations (Encrypt-then-MAC, MAC-then-Encrypt, Encrypt and MAC) matters tremendously.</li><li>CBC+HMAC is usually implemented in application-layer code, but the security of such a construction depends heavily on the availability and utilization of <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/#string-comparison">constant-time functions</a>.</li><li>There is no standard format for CBC+HMAC, nor the order of operations for what gets fed into the MAC.<ul><li>IV + ciphertext? Ciphertext + IV?</li></ul><ul><li>Append the MAC, or prepend it?</li></ul></li><li>CBC+HMAC is only an AE mode, there is no room for additional authenticated data. If you try to naively shove extra data into the HMAC, <em>now you have to worry about canonicalization attacks</em>!</li><li>CBC mode requires padding (usually PKCS #7 padding), whereas cipher modes based on CTR do not.</li></ol>



<p>This is among the long list of reasons why cryptographers have spent the past decade (or longer) pushing developers towards AEAD modes.</p>



<p>Boring cryptography is good cryptography!</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Make sure you clearly understand the risks of the components other constructions have used.</p>



<h3 id="sketch-first-draft">Sketch Out A First Draft</h3>



<p>By now, it should be clear that if we have an Encrypt-then-MAC construction, where the MAC is based on a cryptographic hash function (e.g. SHA-256), we may be able to attain RKR security.</p>



<p>With that in mind, our sketch will probably look something like this:</p>



<ul><li>Encrypt(K1, M, N) -&gt; C<ul><li>Where Encrypt() is AES-CTR or equivalent</li></ul></li><li>Auth(K2, C, A) -&gt; T<ul><li>Where Auth() wraps HMAC-SHA2 or equivalent</li><li>How we feed C and A into the underlying MAC is important</li></ul></li><li>???? -&gt; K1, K2</li></ul>



<p>We still have to define some way of splitting a key (K) into two distinct keys (K1, K2). You never want to use a cryptographic key for more than one purpose, after all.</p>



<h3>Key-Splitting and Robustness</h3>



<p>Your encryption key and authentication key should be different, but they should also derived from the same input key! This is mainly to protect implementors from having independent keys and accidentally creating a forgery vulnerability.</p>



<p>There are several different ways you can split keys:</p>



<ol><li>Just use SHA-512(k), then cut it in half. Use one half for encryption, the other for authentication.</li><li>Use HMAC-SHA256(k, c1) and HMAC-SHA256(k, c2), where c1 and c2 are distinct (yet arbitrary) constants.</li><li>Use HKDF. This works with any secure cryptographic hash function, and was specifically designed for situations like this. HKDF also supports salting, which can be used to randomize our derived keys.</li></ol>



<p>We can really pick any of these three and be safe, but I’d advise against the first option. HKDF uses HMAC under-the-hood, so either of the latter options is fine.</p>



<h3 id="speed">Can We Make it Faster?</h3>



<p>What if, instead of HMAC-SHA256, we used <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>?</p>

<p>BLAKE3’s advertised 6.8 GiB/s can be even faster than <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/60269">Poly1305 or GHASH</a> (and BLAKE3’s speed really shines through with long messages, due to its extreme parallelism through Merkle trees).</p>

<p>It’s no secret that <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">I’m not a fan of AES</a>. It’s not the mathematical properties of AES that bother me, it’s the 128-bit block size and the fact that software implementations have to decide between being fast or being secure.</p>

<p>ChaCha’s 256-bit security level is easier to justify: The underlying PRF state is 512 bits (which implies an approximately 256-bit security level) and the keys are always 256 bits.</p>



<p><s>Furthermore, if you’re building ChaCha and BLAKE3 in the same codebase, you could reuse some components (i.e. the compression function, G). This is very desirable if you’re trying to ship a small amount of code (e.g. embedded systems).</s> EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/veorq">One of the BLAKE3 authors</a> informed me that I’m mistaken about this: “[N]ope, not exactly the same logic (rotations in different direction)”.</p>



<h3 id="other-desirable-properties">Other Desirable Security Properties</h3>



<h4 id="nonces">Nonce Nonsense</h4>



<p>One of the biggest problems with standard AEAD modes is that they explode gloriously when you reuse a nonce. There are two ways out of this peril:</p>



<ol><li>Use a nonce misuse resistant AEAD construction (AES-GCM-SIV, etc.).<ul><li>For prior art on nonce-misuse resistant cipher modes based on ChaCha, check out <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/067">DAENCE</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Use large nonces (e.g. XChaCha20 uses 192-bit nonces) and generate them randomly, so the probability of nonce reuse becomes negligible.</li></ol>



<p>Since we’re already planning on using a hash function to derive subkeys (one for encryption, one for authentication), it makes sense to also accept a longer nonce than our stream cipher demands. The excess bytes can be passed to our KDF without significant risk or additional overhead.</p>



<p>Since the IETF’s ChaCha20 variant expects a 96-bit nonce, designing our construction to support 256-bit nonces means we can pass the first 160 bits of the nonce to the KDF and the latter 96 bits to the stream cipher. You can expect a single KDF collision after 2^80 encryptions, but it will almost certainly occur with a different nonce.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>Recently, while conducting research, I wanted to follow a specific kernel code flow: I was about to modify the behavior of an existing kernel mechanism, and I needed to understand the flow of data between different functions.</p><p>As with any open source project you’re trying to analyze, your go-to assistant is the source code. Linux, besides being open source, provides tons of <em>dynamic</em> tools for debugging, and they are a great supplement to static reading of the code. In this post, I’ll focus on one of these tools, <em>ftrace</em>, and present a modification I made to make its filtering capabilities more versatile.</p><h4>ftrace</h4><p>At its base, ftrace (Function Tracer) is a <em>dynamic function instrumentation infrastructure.</em> It can be used to set dynamic traces on virtually all kernel functions, and also supports a large set of static tracepoints, used to record core kernel events. It is available in most modern Linux distributions.</p><p>It’s a powerful tool for tracing flows and events in the kernel. Providing both in-kernel API and usermode control interface via <code>tracefs</code>, it’s arguably one of the most comprehensive tracing tools in Linux.</p><p>ftrace has many modes of operation, in this post I’ll focus on the <code>function_graph</code> mode: It allows you to record the call graph originating from a given function, recursively.</p><p>In case you’ve never used it (or just as a slight reminder) — here’s how it looks when tracing the kernel path for a <code>vfs_read</code> call on <code>/proc/version</code>:</p><pre>  8)               |  vfs_read() {

....</pre><p>That call graph can provide great aid in understanding flow, alongside reading the code.</p><p><em>This isn’t a starters guide for ftrace, so I will assume you know its basics from this point onward. If you want a longer introduction on ftrace and its additional modes, I recommend reading the articles in [1], [2] and [3].</em></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p>Back here, I was trying to understand the receive flow of a specific TCP packet (which functions does it go through).</p><p>The TCP receive entry-point function is <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c#L1781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c#L1781">tcp_v4_rcv</a></code>. We can <code>function_graph</code> it, but we’ll soon encounter a problem — there are <strong>heaps</strong> of data generated by graph-tracing this function: On my desktop, under a not-so-heavy network load, I was getting a 5MB/s trace file! That’s a lot of data.</p><p>There are 2 limitations pointed out here:</p><ol><li>The calls didn’t undergo any filtering — all calls were written to the trace file. I wanted to see the graph of <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code> on a specific packet, not on all TCP packets processed by the system.</li><li>There’s no information attached to the calls (for example, function arguments). Take a look on the sample graph above — there are only function names and durations. How can we differentiate the “interesting” calls?</li></ol><h4>Existing filters?</h4><p>Let’s seek help from existing ftrace features. For this purpose, we can start with the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt">very long documentation</a>.</p><p>ftrace can record the current PID/TGID and the command (<code>/proc/pid/comm</code>), and report them in the trace file. As far as I can tell, no more specific details are available to be recorded on each entry.</p><p>ftrace also supports <strong>filtering</strong> by PID: Using the <code>set_ftrace_pid</code> file, we can limit the traced calls to specific processes. For example, this will limit traces to the <code>init</code> process:</p><pre># cd /sys/kernel/tracing
# echo 1 &gt; set_ftrace_pid</pre><p>Sounds nice, eh? For many filtering use-cases, this is just enough: A simple program that writes its PID to <code>set_ftrace_pid</code> and then invokes some kernel code you wish to trace.</p><p>In the network RX case, it’s impossible⁴: Network packets are processed in <em>software interrupts⁵</em> running possibly on any CPU, in the context of virtually any thread of the system. There goes filtering by PID…</p><p>I’m not aware of any other sophisticated filters allowed by ftrace. We can try to filter out the events externally (e.g in the case of network RX — filter away unwanted packets with <code>iptables</code>, this way they won’t end up in <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code>)…</p><p>… or, we can tweak ftrace to provide the filtering we need!</p><h4>Tweaking ftrace’s filtering</h4><p><em>All following Linux references are based on kernel 5.0+.</em></p><p>What I had in mind: ftrace has its PID-based filtering. I can provide external filtering, and after a call, I wish to trace passes my filter, the PID of the currently running process can be “added” to <code>set_ftrace_filter</code>, effectively making the process traced (and I’ll get the call graph I desired)</p><p>What happens when you write to <code>set_ftrace_pid</code>? A quick search of this string yields <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6593">ftrace_init_tracefs</a></code> which registers the <code>tracefs</code> file; And <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6526" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6526">ftrace_pid_write</a></code> actually implements the write.</p><p><code>ftrace_pid_write</code> is rather long for its seemingly simple purpose. Summing it up, this function does 3 things:</p><ol><li>Creates a <code>trace_pid_list</code> struct from the input PIDs (you can write multiple PIDs for tracing), and stores it for later use.</li><li>Registers a <code>sched_switch</code> event handler called <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6336">ftrace_filter_pid_sched_switch_probe</a></code>.</li><li>Updates tracers that use PID filtering to have <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L146">ftrace_pid_func</a></code> as their tracing handler.</li></ol><p>Effectively, the 3rd step enables filtering. <code>ftrace_pid_func</code> is very simple: It is called instead of the original tracing handler and checks whether the current task should be traced or not, by reading <code>tr-&gt;trace_buffer.data-&gt;ftrace_ignore_pid</code>. Iff tracing should be performed, it calls the original handler.</p><p>Let’s see where this field is updated. <code>ftrace_pid_write</code> has previously registered <code>ftrace_filter_pid_sched_switch_probe</code> for the <code>sched_switch</code> event. This handler will be called <em>for each task switch in the system.</em> It knows which is the next task to run.</p><pre>static void
ftrace_filter_pid_sched_switch_probe(void *data, bool preempt,
                                     struct task_struct *prev, struct task_struct *next)
{
    struct trace_array *tr = data;
    struct trace_pid_list *pid_list;
    pid_list = rcu_dereference_sched(tr-&gt;function_pids);
    this_cpu_write(tr-&gt;trace_buffer.data-&gt;ftrace_ignore_pid,
            trace_ignore_this_task(pid_list, next));
}</pre><p>&nbsp;It calls <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/trace.c#L354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/trace.c#L354">trace_ignore_this_task</a></code> to see whether the new task’s PID was marked for tracing:</p><pre>bool
trace_ignore_this_task(struct trace_pid_list *filtered_pids, struct task_struct *task)
{
   /*
    * Return false, because if filtered_pids does not exist,
    * all pids are good to trace.
    */
    if (!filtered_pids)
        return false;

    return !trace_find_filtered_pid(filtered_pids, task-&gt;pid);
}</pre><p>The result is written into the <code>ftrace_ignore_pid</code> field, itself a percpu⁶ variable. This is a caching optimization: instead of filtering PIDs through the list whenever a task hits a traced function, the check of a PID is done <strong>once</strong> on task switch, and later the tracing decision is a mere cache read of this single boolean. Neat, and a very nice use of percpu as well! The result will be automatically invalidated upon the next call to <code>ftrace_filter_pid_sched_switch_probe</code>, which will write a new value for the next task.</p><p>I think we know enough. If we can update the percpu <code>ftrace_ignore_pid</code>, we can control whether tracing is enabled for the current CPU. If we can set it once we want to start tracing and unset it once we want to stop, we can use it to limit filtering at will.</p><p>So, I started writing a kernel module to work this out. Shortly enough, I recalled I worked on a MicroPython port for the Linux kernel⁷ just for such occasions! Using it, we can quickly define a few hooks that’ll do the job.</p><p>Our goal: given an input TCP packet that matches a precondition (say, destination port is 9000) we’d like to get its ftrace call-graph of <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code>.</p><p>We’ll start with a hook that’ll do the actual filtering on the packets. It has to be called <em>before </em>ftrace-graph, otherwise, we won’t be able to control the filtering! If I hook <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code> itself with ftrace, it runs after the ftrace-graph filtering decision, which is too late for us. I’m sure there’s a way around it, but I didn’t bother checking — instead, I hooked the <code>tcp_protocol-&gt;handler</code> pointer, which is used to call <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code>. This way, we’re surely called before it.</p><pre>def my_pre_tcp_v4_rcv(skb):
    # TODO: do the filtering stuff...
    return tcp_v4_rcv(skb)

cb = callback(my_pre_tcp_v4_rcv)
net_protocol_s = partial_struct("net_protocol")
net_protocol_s(tcp_protocol).handler = cb.ptr()</pre><p>At this point, we have the <code>sk_buff</code> and we can make the tracing decision. If we wish to trace, we can write to <code>tr-&gt;trace_buffer.data-&gt;ftrace_ignore_pid</code>… Which is not in the exported headers, sadly.</p><p>I wanted this to be fully compatible with standard kernel headers, so accessing unexported structs is a bad idea. A workaround is to hook <code>trace_ignore_this_task</code> with a simple handler that returns <code>1</code> only for our traced task. Then we can call <code>ftrace_filter_pid_sched_switch_probe</code>, as if a scheduler switch has happened. It will update the tracing status for the current task — and since we forced <code>trace_ignore_this_task()</code> …</p></div></div></section></div>

September 9, 2020 | https://othacehe.org/hosting-a-blog-using-only-scheme.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://othacehe.org/hosting-a-blog-using-only-scheme.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've discovered static blog generators using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> to
write a <a href="https://levelocestrigolo.org/">travel blog</a> a few years ago.</p><p>While it gets the job done, and allowed me to write articles using <a href="https://www.orgmode.org/">Org
mode</a>, I would not recommend it. I found it too
complex for my modest needs.</p><p>Being quite involved in <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a>, I decided to have a
look to <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html">Haunt</a> that is currently
used for the GNU Guix website.</p><p>Haunt defines itself as <em>a simple, functional, hackable static site generator
that gives authors the ability to treat websites as Scheme programs.</em></p><h2>Writing the blog using Haunt</h2><p>I chose to get started using the blog of David Thomson, the creator of Haunt
itself. Haunt is well
<a href="https://dthompson.us/manuals/haunt/index.html">documented</a> and writing a
website mostly consists in creating a site object, this way:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>site</span> <span>#:title</span> <span>"Othacehe"</span>
      <span>#:domain</span> <span>"othacehe.org"</span>
      <span>#:build-directory</span> <span>"/tmp/website"</span>
      <span>#:default-metadata</span>
      <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>author</span> <span>.</span> <span>"Mathieu Othacehe"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>email</span>  <span>.</span> <span>"othacehe@gnu.org"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>#:readers</span> <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>commonmark-reader*</span><span>)</span>
      <span>#:builders</span> <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>(</span><span>blog</span> <span>#:theme</span> <span>my-theme</span>
                             <span>#:collections</span> <span>%collections</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>atom-feed</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>atom-feeds-by-tag</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>index-page</span>
                       <span>projects-page</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>static-directory</span> <span>"css"</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>static-directory</span> <span>"fonts"</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>static-directory</span> <span>"files"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Pretty straightforward, compared to Hugo complex directory organization. The
most problematical part for me here are the three letters CSS. My strong
aversion for web design forbids me to roll-out my own theme.</p><p>One advantage of Hugo is the impressive collection of available website
themes. Haunt being for now less popular, I opted for the exact same theme as
David.</p><p>Then, a few lines of Scheme later, the website was ready. You can have a look
to my
<a href="https://gitlab.com/mothacehe/website/-/blob/master/haunt.scm">haunt.scm</a>. This
very file contains the whole configuration of the website, all the rest is
static content.</p><h2>Building the website</h2><p>The operation of <strong>building the website</strong> roughly consists in calling Haunt to
convert the Scheme files and the post articles into a bunch of HTML files.</p><p>This can be done by invoking this command:</p><pre><code>$ haunt build</code></pre><p>To run this command you obviously need to have <strong>haunt</strong> installed, but also
<strong>guile-syntax-highlight</strong> that is used for highlighting code snippets. As I'd
like the building process to be self-contained, I use GNU Guix for this
operation.</p><p>I won't go into details here but the idea is to write a
<a href="https://gitlab.com/mothacehe/website/-/blob/master/.guix.scm">.guix.scm</a> file
that specifies the build dependencies and the required command to build the
website.</p><p>Then, all you have to do is:</p><pre><code>$ guix build -f .guix.scm
...
build completed successfully
successfully built /gnu/store/19fx3njl6sr53nraayrvfzgb209g6mml-my-web-site.drv
/gnu/store/cgs02fcvmb3p7rni0nlb7wp85yd3mnkm-my-web-site
</code></pre><p>This returns a <em>store</em> directory that contains the built website. The only
requirement here is to have GNU Guix available.</p><p>Now, we need to find a way to deploy this directory on a web server,
and believe it or not, that's the fun part!</p><h2>Deploying the website</h2><p>I've been previously hosting stuff on a friend's server. I'd like to take my
independence, but I don't want to use a machine at home, as I'm frequently
moving.</p><p>This means that I need to find a hosting company. The choice is tricky because
I don't want to run Dockers, Kubernetes or type a bunch of <code>apt install</code>
commands and edit brutally some <code>/etc/</code> configuration files.</p><p>I would prefer the hosted machine to run <em>Guix System</em> so that I can pursue my
Scheme-only experiment.</p><p>Turns out GNU Guix has a <em>deploy</em> command that is able to:</p><ul><li>Deploy a Guix System configuration on a remote machine using SSH.</li><li>Spawn a remote DigitalOcean virtual machine and deploy a Guix System
configuration on it.</li></ul><p>The second option is very tempting, so I had a closer look at the mechanics.
It appears that <em>Guix System</em> is not supported as a distribution by
DigitalOcean. The employed trick for deployment is to spawn an <em>Ubuntu</em> VM, or
<em>droplet</em> as it is fancily called, and install <em>Guix System</em> from there.</p><p>I'm not fond of this approach and I would prefer to have <em>Guix System</em>
directly deployed. Luckily, I discovered that DigitalOcean supports running
<em>custom images</em>, that's exactly what we need.</p><p>I decided to proceed this way:</p><ul><li>Write an <code>os.scm</code> file that describes the configuration of a Guix System
distribution able to host my website.</li><li>Create a disk-image from this file and upload it on DigitalOcean.</li><li>Spawn a <em>droplet</em> using that disk-image and run it.</li></ul><p>Let's try it. We first need the <code>os.scm</code> configuration file. Here it is:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-modules</span> <span>(</span><span>gnu</span><span>)</span>

   <span>%base-services</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>It is a bit lengthy, but keep in mind that it will allow us to run a custom
<em>Guix System</em> distribution that behaves exactly as we want, out of the box.</p><p>Most of the work is to describe the five services we need:</p><ul><li>A DHCP server, so that the <em>droplet</em> can figure out its public IP address.</li><li>An OpenSSH server, so that we can connect to the <em>droplet</em> via SSH.</li><li>An Nginx web server hosting the website.</li><li>A certbot service so that we have proper HTTPS support.</li><li>A service that will periodically fetch the website sources from the Gitlab
repository, build them and deploy them.</li></ul><p>You can have a look to the documentation
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Services.html">here</a> for the exact
syntax of this file.</p><p>Then, we need to produce a disk-image out of this configuration file. It can
be done that way:</p><pre><code>$ guix system disk-image os.scm  -L ~/maintenance/hydra/modules/ --image-size=5G
...
/gnu/store/hca2zg51in1dnhaqkljfkvl8gyipmzni-disk-image</code></pre><p>The extra <em>-L</em> option is required here because the
<em>static-web-site-service-type</em> is not defined in GNU Guix itself, but in an
external repository, available
<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix/maintenance.git/">here</a>. As stated
previously, this service will create a cron job that fetches the website
sources from my Gitlab repository, build them and deploy them. To save some
extra space, let's also convert this raw disk-image into a compressed
<strong>qcow2</strong> image:</p><pre><code>$ qemu-img convert -c -f raw -O qcow2 /gnu/store/hca2zg...-disk-image do.qcow2</code></pre><p>The resulting image that weighs around 500MiB can then be uploaded to
DigitalOcean, and a <em>droplet</em> using this custom image can be started from the
web interface.</p><p>A few other manipulations are required to set up the DNS records, but nothing
original.</p><p>That's it, using almost only Scheme, I was able to write and deploy this
blog. This setup should be autonomous and the only work left is to write some
articles, commit them, and wait for the <em>droplet</em> to fetch, build and deploy
them.</p><p>If for some reason I need to edit the configuration of the <em>droplet</em> in the
future, I have two options:</p><ul><li>Create a new disk-image and spawn a <em>droplet</em> from it.</li><li>Reconfigure the existing <em>droplet</em> using <code>guix deploy</code> via SSH.</li></ul><p>The two options are equally valid but the second one should go faster as it
does not involve uploading a new image. Anyway, we will maybe explore those
options in a future article.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]>

September 9, 2020 | https://confused.ai/posts/intercepting-zoom-tls-encryption-bpf-uprobes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://confused.ai/posts/intercepting-zoom-tls-encryption-bpf-uprobes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I originally wrote an earlier version of this post at the end of March, when I was working on adding uprobes support to <a href="https://github.com/redsift/redbpf">redbpf</a>. I wanted to blog about the work I was doing and needed an application to instrument for the purpose of this post. At that time Zoom's popularity was rising quickly, and I happened to read somewhere that it supported this creepy attention tracking feature that allowed meeting hosts to monitor if attendees were paying attention. I figured I could try to use uprobes to snoop into the data Zoom was sending to their servers and see how the tracking worked.</p><p>But then Zoom quickly started getting under a lot of fire. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoombombing">Zoombombing</a> became a thing, several security issues were discovered and pretty much everyone started piling on the company. Considering all that, I was advised and ultimately decided not to publish the post.</p><p>Now things seem to have settled, Zoom <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/a-message-to-our-users/">improved their security</a> and by popular demand <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000538083-Attendee-attention-tracking">got rid of attention tracking</a>. So I think I can finally publish this! I edited out the part about attention tracking (which no longer exists) and a couple of other things that could potentially get me in trouble.</p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> I wrote a command line tool that uses BPF uprobes to intercept the TLS encrypted data that zoom sends over the network, and here I'm going to show the process I went through to write it. After I wrote this post I made the tool generic so that it can now instrument any program that uses OpenSSL. I published the code at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy">https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy</a>.</p><h2>Instrumenting applications with uprobes</h2><p>Uprobes let you instrument user space applications by attaching custom code to arbitrary locations inside a target process. It's a bit like running an application in a debugger, setting breakpoints and fiddling around, but programmatically and without the overhead of a debugger.</p><p>An uprobe must be <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/cargo_bpf/#building">compiled</a> and <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf/load/struct.Loader.html">loaded</a> like any other BPF program, then it can be attached with the following API:</p><pre><code><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>attach_uprobe</span><span>(</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>self</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    fn_name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    offset</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>u64</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    target</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    pid</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>pid_t</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p><a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf/struct.UProbe.html#method.attach_uprobe">attach_uprobe()</a> parses the <code>target</code> ELF binary or shared library, looks up the function <code>fn_name</code>, and once the target is running it injects the probe code at the resolved address. If <code>offset</code> is non-zero, its value is added to the address of <code>fn_name</code>. If <code>fn_name</code> is <code>None</code>, then <code>offset</code> is interpreted as starting from the beginning of the target's <code>.text</code> section. Finally if a <code>pid</code> is given, the probe will only be attached to the process with the given id.</p><p>In the rest of the post I'm going to show some examples of uprobes, focusing on the code that gets compiled to BPF bytecode, loaded in the kernel and then injected in the target process (in our case zoom). I'm not going to show much of the user-space code that loads the probes. That part is pretty standard rust code that does some setup, then prints out the data coming from the probes as it receives it. If you're interested you can still find all the user-space code at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy/blob/master/src/main.rs">https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy/blob/master/src/main.rs</a>.</p><h2>Poking into Zoom</h2><p>We're going to use uprobes to inspect the network traffic between the zoom client and the company's servers. Zoom uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security</a> to encrypt the data. In order to intercept the <em>unencrypted</em> data, we need to find out which TLS library is used by the client, then attach uprobes to strategic places inside it.</p><p>Let's start with searching for common TLS symbols using <code>objdump</code>:</p><pre><code><span>$ objdump -CT /opt/zoom/zoom | grep -iE "ssl|gnutls"
</span>000000000080d5b0 g    DF .text	0000000000000013  Base        PreMeetingUIMgr::sig_blockUnknownSSLCertChanged()
<!-- -->000000000080d590 g    DF .text	0000000000000013  Base        PreMeetingUIMgr::sig_sslCertWarningChanged()

Once they are triggered, they get passed a <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf_probes/kprobe/struct.Registers.html">Registers</a> argument through which they can access memory.</p><p>The <code>SSL_write_entry</code> probe is the simplest. It reads the registers containing the values of the <code>buf</code> and <code>num</code> arguments passed to <code>SSL_write</code>, and sends a copy of the buffer to user-space before it gets encrypted.</p><p>The <code>SSL_read_entry</code> probe is similar in that it reads the content of the <code>ssl</code>, <code>buf</code> and <code>num</code> arguments passed to <code>SSL_read</code>. It doesn't send the buffer to user-space though. Remember the data is decrypted <em>after</em> <code>SSL_read</code> returns, so we need a second uprobe that we attach to the <em>return address</em> of the function. That's what <code>SSL_read_ret</code> is for. It's similar to the other two probes, but is annotated with <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf_probes/uprobe/prelude/attr.uretprobe.html">#[uretprobe]</a>, which means that it will trigger once the function it's attached to <em>returns</em>.</p><p>But why do we need two probes for <code>SSL_read</code>, why not just have <code>SSL_read_ret</code>? The answer is that when <code>SSL_read</code> returns, it's likely that the registers that used to contain the function arguments were modified, so we need to read their values at the start of the function and store them so we can retrieve them later. This is a very common pattern when writing BPF code.</p><p>Finally if zoom linked to OpenSSL dynamically or if debugging symbols were present, the user-space code to attach the probes would be as simple as:</p><pre><code><span>use</span><span> </span><span>redbpf</span><span>::</span><span>load</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>;</span><span>

            <div>
              <p><span>7 August 2020</span><span>• PRESSRELEASE</span></p><p>On August 7, the WHO reports more than 1 million recorded COVID-19 infections in Africa and calls it a turning point. Yet, the number of people who are sick or deceased on the continent is relatively low. How is that possible? In an article in Science, LUMC researchers and partners in Africa highlight the possible causes and add the hypothesis that the distinct wiring of the immune system might also be playing a role in the relatively low COVID-19 death rates in Africa.</p>

<p>          According to the authors, many predicted a very dark scenario for Africa with millions of COVID-19 deaths as many countries on the continent grapple with poverty, poor health systems and unhygienic conditions. However, factors such as country lockdowns, bans on mass gatherings, young population age, and less diabetes and cardiovascular diseases probably contributed to the dampened COVID-19 death rates so far.&nbsp;          </p>
<h2>          Intense exposure to microorganisms          
</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.lumc.nl/cen/ima/80813054048221/1964392/covid-in-africa.jpg" alt="Diagnosis of COVID-19 in the laboratory in CERMEL, Gabon. Photo: Curtsy of Professor Ayloa Akim Adegnika." title="Diagnosis of COVID-19 in the laboratory in CERMEL, Gabon. Photo: Curtsy of Professor Ayloa Akim Adegnika." width="395" height="260"></p><p>          LUMC LEaDing fellow Simon Jochems and Professor of Parasitology Maria Yazdanbakhsh, with their co-authors, write in Science that the more intense exposure to microorganisms and parasites might also play an important role in the reported low death rate per capita in Africa compared to many other parts of the world. This exposure leads to a distinct wiring of the immune system. Yazdanbakhsh: “We have shown together with our partners in low to middle income countries that the immune system of people living in less urban areas is very distinct. This is not just because of genetics, but more importantly due to environmental factors. Of note, the largest burden of disease of COVID-19 in Africa is found in South-Africa, the most developed country on the continent, accounting for over 50% of cases.”          </p>
<p>          Previous research has shown that the immune system of someone living in the Netherlands is very distinct from a person with the same age and sex living in Senegal, Gabon or Indonesia. But more importantly, someone living in an urban area of these countries has even a more distinct immune system than a genetically similar person living in a rural area of the same country. “A distinct immune system will also mean a distinct response to SARS-CoV-2. For example, one of the immune cells in the lungs that leads to the cytokine storm, might be better regulated in Africans and therefore cause less havoc upon infection with SARS-CoV-2”, explains Jochems, an expert in mucosal immunology and in particular of the airways.          </p>
<h2>          Africa in COVID-19 research roadmap          
</h2>
<p>          Therefore, Africa should be included in the COVID-19 research roadmap, states Yazdanbakhsh. “Understanding the variability in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and identifying the key factors that contribute to the course of the pandemic, can help us develop innovative policies, therapies and vaccines that help the global fight against this and possibly future pandemics.”          </p>
<p>          “What is contributing most strongly to the pattern of COVID-19: social distancing, ban on large gatherings, socioeconomic segregation, or washing hands? Why is young age protective? Which cells or signals in the immune system need to be triggered to prevent the excessive inflammation? The answers to all these questions, through multisectoral research, would provide us with the knowledge that we need to stop the pandemic."&nbsp;          </p>
<h2>          LUMC Global programme          
</h2>
<p>          The long term and sustained relations between LUMC and African research partners has been essential in being able to publish these insights. Yazdanbakhsh: “In order to understand global health issues, looking at and working closely together with researchers in continents such as Africa is indispensable.” This is the reason why the LUMC will put extra effort in its international outreach through the LUMC Global programme.          </p>

      Revealing a Forgotten Chinese Compute History: Stone MS-240x Typewriter (1): Background
    </h2> 
    
  </header>
  <!-- /.post-info -->
  <div>
    <p>While typewriters for European languages was available since the 1800s, Chinese typewriter was always hard to build. In the late 80s in PR China, a company, Stone Company (四通公司), in coordination with Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd, released a series of revolutionary Chinese typewriters. It was adequately priced, user friendly, and from a n engineer's point of view, a masterpiece in engineering.</p>
<p>With help of Mr Wang Jizhi (王缉志), the Chief Scientist at Stone Co and inventor of Stone Chinese typewriter, I was able to obtain some technical documentation on the original Stone typewriter. This series of article discusses about the background, the technical details, and the long term effects of the revolutionary typewriter.</p>
<div id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>CJK computing is hard. Depending which standard to take, there are 4800 (常用國字標準字體表 / List of Frequently used National Character Standard Font) or 4400 (常用漢字表 / List of Jōyō Kanji) or 3500 (通用规范汉字表 / List of Commonly Used Standard Chinese Characters) frequently used characters. Considering not-so-frequently-used-but-necessary characters, we'll be looking at something around 10k characters.</p>
<p>As we know, there're only 7 bits in ASCII, which means it can hold up to 127 characters. The reason being 7 bits? To reduce cost. Apparently, ASCII is not enough to support anything that's not English. Pioneers in Japan opted to use 8 bit encoding (JIS X 0201) to allow Katakana -- well, that's better than nothing. Unfortunately, Kanji or even Hiragana are not available.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, a very large amount of internal encodings was released by multiple companies and government entities. But there're one common thing -- all characters were encoded with multiple bytes (2 or 4, depending on amount of characters to support).</p>
<p>Another problem is CJK font. With so many characters to support and display, font is a big problem. If we use 12x12 pixels to display each CJK character, it would take a whopping amount of 18 bytes of space! For an entire set of Chinese characters included in GB2312, it will take around 122 KB of space. In the 70s or 80s, memory are extremely expensive. The IBM PC comes with just 64KB of RAM and 64 KB of ROM and costs 1565 USD in 1981. Remember, PR China was still in extreme poverty, and take home pay for an average teacher is just 30 RMB (10 USD) per month. Nobody wants to use 13 years worth of salary to buy a IBM PC yet _still_ can't use your language! A solution must be made!</p>
<p>Well, the solution back then was hardware based. Mask ROM is a really good solution to store large amount of data in the 80s. With a specifically built, IBM PC compatible display adapter, the display adapter is able to display CJK characters if the screen is in text mode. However, the add-on card is not cheap, as it retails at around 2000 USD, more expensive than a PC!</p>
<p>The most common use of computers in the 80s is word processing. Businesses and government entities literally just buy the computers for typesetting, and schools buy them to print stuff on mimeograph wax papers for the students. So, naturally, the 80-20 rule kicks in: if 80% of the users are just buying the computers for typesetting and printing, why buy an expensive PC, an expensive add-on card, and a printer, why not just release a Chinese typewriter?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is, there were Chinese typewriters already, but they all suck.</p>
<p>Most typewriters are imported from Japan and have a built-in thermal printer. Not a good choice in China, as thermal papers has to be imported. Also, thermal paper are just not good for archival purposes. Besides that, you can't use thermal printer to print on wax papers.</p>
<p>Some other typewriters are not user friendly, and some of them have fonts not suitable for use in China. This might be a surprise to non-CJK users, but the reality is, different culture sometimes use different variants to write the same character, and while still perfectly readable by other Chinese character using cultures, it feels foreign and strange.</p>
<p>So here comes the Stone Chinese Typewriter, a typewriter that's very user friendly, with localized Chinese fonts, a 24 pin dot matrix printer, and more importantly, only costs around 13500 RMB in total (~ 30k USD), almost 1/5 the price for a complete set of Chinese computer.</p>
<p>Some interesting fact on the manufacturing process: the electrical boards and parts was imported from Japan costing around 6000 RMB. When arrived at Beijing, SOTEC (Stone Office Terminal Equipment Co, a wholly owned subsidiary of Stone Co) assembles the machine, put the EPROM containing the software in, and performs QA checks. The machine will then be sold to the Office Automation Department of Stone Co at 9000 RMB. The OA department sells the machine to dealers across the country at around 11000 RMB. The total BOM cost is at around 50% of the retail price, much lower than the standard rate of 30% in consumer electronics industry such as TV sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="technical-overview">
<h2>Technical Overview</h2>
<p>I'm not going to talk a whole lot about technical details in this article. This will come later when I finish writing the emulator for the typewriter. However, I'd still like to share some high level overview on the machine itself.</p>
<p>The original MS-2400 typewriter is actually a computer. This should not be a surprise to anyone, as you really needed a serious computer to perform word processing tasks.</p>
<p>The hardware was designed by ALPS Electric in Japan, and all software was architectured by Mr Wang Jizhi and designed by himself with a small team.</p>
<p>NEC V20, an Intel 8088 clone, is the heart of the system. However, this is not a IBM PC clone. The similarity with PC really stops here, as BIOS, IO devices, and even the keyboard are not PC compatible. Heck, even the PIT are not compatible!</p>
<p>This machine featured 64 KB of RAM, 64 KB of EPROM for BIOS and word processor, 576 KB Chinese Character Generator (2 * 256 KB, 1 * 128 KB mask ROM), a 32 KB Chinese dictionary (not for looking up words, but for converting keystrokes to Chinese characters, later commonly known as Input Method), and another optional 32 KB Chinese dictionary for secondary input method.</p>
<p>There are no video output capability for MS-2400. The display is a 240x64 LCD controlled by OKI MSM6255 LCD controller.</p>
<p>There's also a Ni-Cd battery in the machine, which could back up the memory for around 30 days.</p>
<p>To support the printer and keyboard, there are 4 timers with 3 modes (including NMI). The printer can print up to 20 characters per second.</p>
<p>The external memory is audio cassette. It has standard 3.5 mm audio jacks to interface with an external recording device.</p>
<div id="the-os">
<h3>The OS</h3>
<p>No, there are no OS. The BIOS itself is the OS. As the machine is not designed to run any PC OS, ALPS simply implemented everything as software interrupts. As the BIOS is mapped to the fixed F000:8000 address, all programs can just execute in place, saving precious memory. Even the Chinese font loading feature was done in the BIOS itself, so that user program (the word processor itself) don't have to worry anything about the hardware at all.</p>
</div>
<div id="development">
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>The development of word processor software was done on an IBM PC. Mr Shimadzu from ALPS Electric provided Mr Wang a BIOS routine reference manual, and Mr Wang first implemented the same BIOS routine on an IBM PC.</p>
<p>From there, all the development work are much easier, as the dev team can simply stay in China and develop everything locally to save cost on travel. Remember, China was still poor, and you just can't afford to have an entire team to stay in Japan for months.</p>
</div>
<div id="memory-maps">
<h3>Memory Maps</h3>
<p>All the flash memory are hard wired to the processor. This enables execution in place. All the software are in the flash memory, as there're no easy way to use external programs. The only external storage interface is a 1200bps audio interface.</p>
</div>
<div id="interrupts-as-api">
<h3>Interrupts as API</h3>
<p>This shouldn't be a surprise as well. After all, we're talking about a real mode x86 machine. The interrupts itself is the "stable API", and different team members would solely rely on interrupts to call each other's subroutines.</p>
</div>
<div id="event-driven">
<h3>Event Driven</h3>
<p>The word processing software itself is event driven. The machine is just looping forever, waiting for a hardware interrupt to come, and the request will be dispatched by the ISR.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll be discussing about the disassembled BIOS of the machine. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Open letter to DY Logunov et al., authors of:</p>



<p><strong>“Safety and immunogenicity of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine in two formulations: two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies from Russia.” Lancet. 2020;0(0). doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31866-3</strong></p>



<p>Available at:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31866-3/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31866-3/fulltext</a></p>



<p>and to Richard Horton (editor of The Lancet).</p>



<p>OBJECT.</p>



<p>The study reports the results of a phase 1/2 study on an adenovirus-based vaccine, using Ad5 and Ad26 vectors for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen, and two different formulations (liquid and lyophilized).</p>



<p>During the current pandemic, the extreme public interest and expectations for an effective vaccine are understandable. However, the very same reasons should motivate the scientific community to pay even more attention to the scientific evidence and the underlying data, and it is thus of utmost importance that they are fully available for close scrutiny. Numerical data for all the experiments and original FACS files in fcs format, for example, would be of great help in evaluating the present study, enabling direct reproduction of &nbsp;all analyses and findings, rather than trying to do so from data abstracted or inferred from the figures.<br>While the research described in this study is potentially significant, the presentation of the data raises several concerns which require access to the original data to fully investigate. These are detailed below.</p>



<p>POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCIES IN FIGURES 2, 3 AND 4.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<strong>figure 2</strong>, the authors report the reciprocal titre of RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies at different time points, for all the patient groups (challenged with different formulations).<br>As evident by the following reproduction, there are several data patterns which appear repeatedly for the reported experiments. To this end, connecting measurements for each individual across time points would be highly beneficial in reporting (and hence) interpreting the results. This suggestion also applies to similar measurements in the other manuscript figures.</p>

<p><br>In the red boxes, 9 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd26-S appear to have identical antibody titres at 21 and 28 days; this is also true for 7 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd5-S (yellow boxes). Furthermore, in the cyan boxes we can see all the experimental points differing for a constant value in two completely unrelated experiments; and 8 out of 9 experimental points are completely preserved among other two completely unrelated volunteer groups (green boxes).</p>



<p>While we understand that in this case the variable under study is discrete (representing the reciprocal of a dilution), still it seems to us that on the ground of simple probabilistic evaluations the fact of observing so many data points preserved among different experiments is highly unlikely.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;<strong>figure 3</strong>, intended to present the results of the cellular response to the different formulations used for challenging the volunteers, in the following reproduction repeated experimental point patterns are boxed with the same colours as in the previous case, with an important difference: in this case, the variable under study (cell proliferation %) is continuous in nature, rendering the coincidence of data points among different experiments even less likely.</p>

<p>For&nbsp;<strong>figure 4</strong>, which is intended to show the neutralizing antibody formation against the adenovirus vectors used for the vaccine, problems like those observed for figure 2 are again apparent. The coloured boxes in the following reproduction are to be intended as in the previous cases.</p>

<p>Please note that, in lack of the original numerical data, no conclusions can be definitively drawn on the reliability of the data presented, especially regarding the apparent duplications detected.</p>



<p>FURTHER CONCERNS.</p>



<p>The authors did not specify enough characteristics of the convalescent patients used as a control for the evaluation of the humoral response in figure 2. How were they matched to the different groups of enrolled volunteers? Since there are several convalescent control patients which apparently are seronegative and are also negative for neutralizing antibodies, it is also crucial to know when their plasma was collected – for each patient, how many days passed since symptoms and seronegativization occurred? How many convalescent controls were used for the graphs in figure 2?</p>

</span>
					</p><div>
						<p><span>For blind and visually impaired people like me, accessibility is the difference between us being able to use a website and clicking off it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>How screen readers work</h2>
<p><span>Screen readers allow blind and visually impaired people to use computers, phones and tablets independently. Most screen readers use software, and a Text To Speech (TTS) engine, which is what converts the text from the screen reader into speech. Screen readers convert the text displayed on screen into a format that blind users can process.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read out loud everything that’s on the screen and allow people to navigate using touch gestures and shortcut keys. They also work with other output devices such as a braille display.</span></p>
<p><span>As a screen reader user, here are the most common issues I encounter on a daily basis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Unlabelled links and buttons</h2>
<p><span>Screen reader users rely on links and buttons to navigate around a website and to find the information we need. If links and buttons are not labelled correctly or if at all, then it makes it difficult for screen reader users to find the information they need. Ultimately, unlabelled links make it much harder to navigate the website easily, quickly and independently.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when linking to an about page, ‘click here’ doesn’t give any clue as to where it leads to, but ‘find out more about who we are’ is clear.</span></p>
<p><span>If links and buttons are labelled correctly, screen readers can read the label out loud. It means that blind and visually impaired people don’t have to press the link or button without knowing where it will take them.</span></p>
<p><span>As well as unlabelled elements, links and buttons that do not have a clear description are also really frustrating. They must have a clear description of where they will lead to when pressed, rather than ‘click here’. Never make your users guess where a link will take them or force them into a trial-and-error situation. This makes for tedious user experience.</span></p>
<h2>No image descriptions</h2>
<p><span>This is probably the most common issue I encounter when browsing the web.&nbsp;</span><span>Using image descriptions is essential for accessibility. Image descriptions are also known as alt text (alternative text) which is a written description of an image.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read image descriptions out loud. This means that blind and visually impaired people can understand the content of the image in an accessible way.&nbsp;</span><span>If images do not have alt text, then screen readers will simply say “image” or “graphic” which gives no context or meaning.</span></p>
<p><span>Images often convey valuable information. It’s therefore important that people with a visual impairment can access this information as well.&nbsp;</span><span>Alt text should be clearly written and give an accurate description of the image.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://bighack.org/how-to-write-better-alt-text-descriptions-for-accessibility/">our tips for writing better alt text</a> to ensure your images are fully accessible.</strong></p>
<h2>Poor use of headings</h2>
<p><span>For quick and easy navigation, many screen reader users navigate using various elements on the page such as headings. They are a great way to find the information we need quickly and effectively. Especially when they follow a logical heading structure with H1s, H2s and H3s helping to prioritise the content.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" alt="Logical heading structure begins with Heading 1, with Heading 2 sitting beneath heading 1. Heading 3 sits within heading 2 and so on." width="1958" height="1236" srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1958px) 100vw, 1958px" data-srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>If websites don’t use headings, it means screen reader users are unable to use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the webpage this way. If that’s the case, we have to resort to tabbing or arrowing through a long web page to find the information we need.</span></p>
<p>Headings also help to break up the web content visually and improve readability. Other elements that screen reader users use to navigate webpages include links, lists or landmarks.</p>
<h2>Inaccessible web forms</h2>
<p><span>Most websites use forms in one way or another. Whether it’s to help you search for a product or to get in touch through a contact form. However, when these forms are not labelled, or not labelled correctly, it means we cannot use them.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a search box is not labelled, it means screen reader users have no idea of the purpose of that box. It means people who use screen readers cannot access the same functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact forms are an effective way for customers to get in touch with your brand or business. And as a screen reader user, there’s nothing more frustrating than these forms being labelled incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially CAPTCHA checkout requirements. Without an option to hear the audio, it’s not accessible. It means we are unable to fill in the form independently. I often have to enlist help from a sighted person, but this isn’t possible for everyone.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2>Auto-playing audio and video</h2>
<p><span>Most people will know how annoying it is to load a web page with noisy adverts that start playing suddenly. But for screen reader users, it can be even more alarming. When video or audio starts playing automatically, it can drown out the voice of the screen reader. This makes it harder to find the pause or stop buttons.</span></p>
<p><span>(And if these buttons are unlabelled, then it’s practically impossible for me to stop the video quickly which causes extra frustration.) If I’m unable to stop the sound or video, I normally click off.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution? Make sure there’s no auto-playing video or audio when your website loads. If you really want to use video, make sure the audio is muted and the user can pause, stop or hide the media player.</span></p>
<p><span>These issues may seem small to sighted users. But they’re the difference between me being able to use a website independently or not. And they make a huge difference when implemented correctly.</span></p>

quite probably you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX">ActiveX</a> controls. Most
frequently this involved bulky popups on pages with these controls having to display something
more complex than a few blocks of text.</p>

<p>Or, remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet">Java applets</a>? They became
available in 1995, and later they weren’t limited to just Windows and Internet Explorer. I remember
I had to use Java applets on macOS as recently as 2013, which chronologically is closer to the
present time than the 90s are. (Feeling so old anyway! 👴)</p>

<p>Seems like ActiveX and Java applets were necessities mostly in the enterprise world, but
Macromedia Flash (later known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a>)
was certainly much more widely known to consumers. It was a requirement in the early days of streaming
video (even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/27/7926001/youtube-drops-flash-for-html5-video-default">YouTube required
Flash</a>
to work back then!), but also a major driver in browser gaming in late 2000s and early 2010s.
We certainly could blame Flash for making our browser windows look like this:</p>

<p>While ActiveX has seemingly failed to reach a significant adoption, Microsoft made yet another
attempt with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">Silverlight</a>:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://desiatov.com/static/silverlight-b8600e7fe201dbc24998a9aacecd3684-da6d6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

<p>In the meantime, Google was working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client">its own thing for
Chrome</a>:</p>

<p>It would be fair to say that these attempts failed to establish wide adoption, especially
after both consumers and businesses started shifting to mobile. Here’s how all these forays ended
according to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft dropped ActiveX support from the Windows Store edition of Internet Explorer 10 in
Windows 8. In 2015 Microsoft released Microsoft Edge, the replacement for Internet Explorer with
no support for ActiveX, this marked the end of the technology in Microsoft’s web browser
development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in 2013, major web browsers began to phase out support for the underlying technology
applets used to run, with applets becoming completely unable to be run by 2015–2017. Java applets
were deprecated since Java 9 in 2017 and removed from Java SE 11 (18.9), released in September
2018.</p>

and will cease support, distribution, and security updates for Flash Player.</p>

<h2>But JavaScript solved all these problems, didn’t it?</h2>
<p>Most of these browser add-ons were introduced before modern JavaScript and HTML5 became available,
so one could argue you no longer need browser add-ons at all. Well, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/27/web-without-javascript">some
purists</a> even say browsers
should have never supported JavaScript or any scripting whatsoever in the first place. Nevertheless,
there are enough use cases for browser scripting and browser apps in general that are hard to avoid.
When looking at the history of browser plugins in general, it’s hard not to notice a few themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributing productivity apps via browsers is convenient in a lot of cases.</li>
<li>Browser gaming made a lot of sense, especially for casual games.</li>
<li>In both of these scenarios browsers had to display something more complex than text and a few
static images.</li>
</ul>

    </p>
<p><small>The modern casual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense game genre</a>
arguably was reborn due to the popularity of Adobe Flash and browser gaming, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Element_TD">Flash Element
TD</a> being a classic example.</small></p>
<p>Even though native apps were (and in many situations still are) objectively better for users, early
browser apps were attempting to build their own ad-hoc app stores before the App Store existed.
You didn’t have to buy a CD with an application and install it and manage it on your disk. You
didn’t have to install updates manually and migrate your data. There was no need to uninstall apps,
you just close a corresponding browser tab and forget about it.</p>
<p>And when browser scripting capabilities became advanced enough, some people started seeing the
allure of making a browser version of their app the only version they provided. Browsers are
cross-platform, aren’t they? Just wrap your JavaScript app code in a browser-like container (say
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)">Electron</a>) and distribute that instead
of your native app. </p>
<p>But eventually not only the JavaScript APIs became more complex, the language itself could no longer
accommodate what developers wanted. Not everyone liked JavaScript syntax (remember
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript">CoffeeScript</a>?) or semantics (I couldn’t help but
notice that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">TypeScript</a> has grown in popularity in recent
years). But it’s hard to transpile an arbitrary programming language to JavaScript, the latter was
not built with that goal in mind.</p>
<p>Corollary, the JavaScript interpreter itself has both memory and performance overhead. Having a
garbage collector built in makes it even harder to transpile languages with different memory models
to JavaScript. The allure of having only one language to write all your apps for all platforms is
still there, but why do you have to be confined to JavaScript itself, even as a target language?</p>
<h2>How WebAssembly actually started</h2>
<p>With the death of browser plugins, at least we can praise the interoperability efforts of browser
vendors. Some lowest common denominator of JavaScript is supported in all browsers, and there is a
clear incentive for the vendors to keep up. With the demand to go beyond JavaScript, there were
initial attempts to support low level programming with asm.js in 2013:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of this performance gain over normal JavaScript [with asm.js was] due to 100% type consistency
and virtually no garbage collection (memory is manually managed in a large typed array).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js">“asm.js”</a> article on Wikipedia.</small></p>
<p>Syntactically this still looked pretty much like JavaScript, but when you have a lot of low level code,
the resulting file can get big pretty quickly, and the size of your code is pretty important when your
users download it frequently. As you weren’t supposed to write asm.js code manually most of the time,
and it was designed primarily as compilation target, it made sense to invent a binary format for it.
That’s basically how WebAssembly started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly was first announced in 2015, and the first demonstration was executing Unity’s Angry
Bots in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. The precursor technologies were asm.js from
Mozilla and Google Native Client, and the initial implementation was based on the feature set of
asm.js.</p>

<h2>What WebAssembly got right</h2>
<p>Now you’re no longer restricted to JavaScript as a target language for browser apps. As soon as
<a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> got WebAssembly backend more or less ready, it allowed compilers built
on top of LLVM (for C, C++, Rust, Swift and many more) to adopt it without rewriting everything from
scratch. This unlocked the browser environment to a huge amount of pre-existing software that can
also run close to native speed if optimized well.</p>
<p>Not only can you run fun little projects such as <a href="https://sandspiel.club/">Sandspiel</a> and
<a href="https://orb.farm/">orb.farm</a> in your browser tab, but complex games such as <a href="https://www.continuation-labs.com/projects/d3wasm/">Doom
3</a> (at least its demo version) are available too.
Both <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/08/15/webassembly-is-here/">Unity</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/unrealengine/status/932624595722559490">Unreal
Engine</a> announced their support for
WebAssembly, and while we may not see AAA games running in browsers on their initial release date,
this still gives enough confidence in the maturity of the platform.</p>

<p>We’re excited by the possibilities that WebAssembly opens up. Perhaps, by integrating with

reduce latency by running on Cloudflare, as close to the player as possible. Maybe, with the help

<p>This blogpost presents intuition and experimental results for Gated Linear Networks, a new family of neural networks introduced by DeepMind in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01526.pdf">recent paper</a>. Accompanying implementations in JAX, NumPy, PyTorch and TensorFlow can be found <a href="https://github.com/aiwabdn/pygln">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-gated-linear-network">What is a Gated Linear Network?</h2>

<p>A <strong>Gated Linear Network (GLN)</strong> is a collection of <strong>data-dependent neurons</strong>, arranged in a sequence of layers. Instead of predicting the target output only at the final layer, as is usually the case in deep learning, each neuron predicts the output directly, computes the error and updates its weights locally in an online fashion. In the following, we will explain the various components of a GLN in more detail. We will start off by describing how a <strong>neuron</strong> works.</p>

<p>Imagine an expert who, given an input, is supposed to make a <strong>binary decision</strong> and report their prediction as a probability value. This expert considers two types of data when making their decision: the input itself, and a set of prediction probabilities for the same decision from a panel of other experts. The expert then performs the following steps to arrive at their own decision:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Conditioned on the input, choose one decision rule from a fixed set of rules which the expert maintains internally. In the paper, this process is implemented as <strong>halfspace gating</strong> and called the <strong>context function</strong>, since the input provides the “context” which determines how the decision is made. This context function is akin to <strong>locality-sensitive hashing</strong>, as similar inputs are supposed to map to the same decision rule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the chosen decision rule to combine the prediction probabilities of the panel of other experts. In the paper, each decision rule consists of a set of weights which are used to aggregate the panel probabilities via <strong>geometric mixing</strong>. So the expert effectively refines the decisions of the panel, relying more on some experts than on others, depending on the context, i.e. the input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By comparing their prediction with the expected output, the expert adjusts the selected set of weights which has produced this decision, by shifting them slightly in the direction which encourages the correct decision in the future.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The following awesome stick figure sketch attempts to visualize this:</p>

<p><img src="https://aiwabdn.github.io/pygln/assets/images/expert2.png" alt="panel-of-experts"></p>

<p>We can think of the layers in a GLN as panels of such experts. Each expert/neuron in a layer considers the previous layer as their panel of experts. Consequently, the prediction of the target output gets iteratively refined through the sequence of layers, until a last single-neuron layer makes the final decision, which is taken as the network output. Different from typical deep neural networks, however, the output of each neuron is directly interpretable and updated locally, as opposed to globally via backpropagation through the entire network.</p>

<h2 id="core-concepts">Core concepts</h2>

<p>With that intuition in place, let us look at the main mathematical concepts underlying a neuron in more detail. Henceforth, we will refer to an “expert” as a <strong>neuron</strong> and to a “panel” as a <strong>layer</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="halfspace-gating">Halfspace gating</h3>

<p>We have seen how each neuron has its own <strong>context function</strong> which it uses to choose a decision rule conditioned on the input. Since the neuron should use the same decision rule for similar inputs, the context function should map regions of the input space to the same context. One way to achieve this is to divide the space into <strong>halfspaces</strong> and compute region membership based on which halfspace an input point belongs to, but other methods, for instance, based on a fixed number of representative points, could be used instead.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a two-dimensional input space and an input point \((x_0, y_0)\). Any straight line divides the space into two halves, and our point lies either to the left (0) or right (1) of the line. So every line gives us a binary value indicating, very roughly, in which region of the input space our point is located.</p>

<p><img src="https://aiwabdn.github.io/pygln/assets/images/context_function.png" alt="context-function"></p>

<p>We can consider the point’s position relative to multiple lines and combine the binary results to form a binary string. In general, if we draw \(n\) lines, we get a binary string of length \(n\) with \(2^n\) possible values, i.e., sub-regions. This operation forms the basis of how the <strong>context function</strong> computes context identifiers given an input point. A neuron interprets this binary string as number and uses it as index into an array of \(2^n\) different set of weights, thus making a <strong>data-dependent choice</strong> of which linear function to apply.</p>

<p>In the figure above, the context function consists of \(3\) lines, shown in red, green and blue, which divide the space into \(2^3 = 8\) regions, indexed by integers from \([0, 7]\). When passed through the context function, input \((x_0, y_0)\) produces the binary string <em>“010”</em>, i.e. index \(2\), and point \((x_1, y_1)\) produces <em>“110”</em>, i.e. index \(6\).</p>

<p>Let’s see how that might look in code.</p>

<h3 id="geometric-mixing">Geometric mixing</h3>

<p>A neuron takes the probabilistic predictions of the previous layer and combines them using the context-selected weights to produce a prediction of its own. This is implemented as <strong>geometric mixing</strong>, that is, a dot product of the weights and the prediction logits of the previous layer and subsequent sigmoid:</p><p>

\[\mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p) = \sigma(w^\mathrm{T} \cdot \sigma^{-1}(p)) = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{d}p_i^{w_i}}{\prod_{i=1}^{d}p_i^{w_i} + \prod_{i=1}^{d}(1 - p_i)^{w_i}},\]

</p><p>where \(\mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p)\) represents the mixed output when the ground truth is \(1\).</p>

<p>Conceptually, this implements a kind of voting mechanism:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If all weights are \(0\), i.e. no weight is given to any input, then the output is \(0.5\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all weights have the uniform value \(\frac{1}{d}\) (\(d\) being the number of neurons in the previous layer), i.e. equal weighting, then the output is the geometric mean of the predictions of the previous layer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, <strong>vetoing</strong> is possible in the sense that if one neuron from the previous layer has predicted a probability close to \(0\) and the weight assigned to that prediction is greater than \(0\), then the output is pushed towards \(0\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the neuron sees more samples, it learns which of the predictions of the previous layer to pay more attention to. So in a sense a neuron behaves like an expert who, given a certain type of input, learns the best way to combine decisions from other experts based on their area of expertise, to arrive at their own judgement. This also demonstrates the difference between a GLN and a normal neural network. Usually, the neurons of the intermediate layers of a neural network learn to combine “features” from the previous layers to produce a higher-order “feature” value. However, the features themselves do not have any (extrinsic) semantic meaning or obvious interpretation. That is why the weights of intermediate layers can only be updated via backpropagation after the final output has been computed, since it is the only interpretable value and can thus be optimized. A neuron in a GLN, on the other hand, is directly predicting the output and can consequently learn immediately from its mistakes.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="online-gradient-descent">Online gradient descent</h3>

<p>Now that we know how a neuron chooses weights based on the input, and uses them to mix the outputs of a previous layer of neurons to produce its own output, let’s see how it learns to update the weights in training.</p>

<p>Using the standard logarithmic loss, it can be shown that the gradient consists of scaling the difference between the output and the ground truth \(y\) by the logit of the output probability:</p><p>

\[\nabla \mathcal{L}^\mathrm{GEO}(w) = \nabla \big( -\log \mathrm{GEO}^y_w(p) \big) = \big( \mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p) - y \big) \cdot \mathrm{logit}(p).\]

</p><p>This value is then multiplied with the learning rate to arrive at the update for the weights used for the current data point by the neuron. This update can be performed for every neuron as soon as it predicts the output, so there is no need for a separate forward and backward pass during training. Contrary to a regular deep neural network, where the loss is computed at the final layer and the gradients are propagated backwards, layer by layer, a GLN will hence not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients. Moreover, given enough expressive …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>The original founders of the major programming languages and computer systems are still alive today. They’ve had every opportunity to change with the times. They, after all, know innovation. They inspired us. They still do.</p>

<p>I’ll never understand a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock">Jackson Polloc</a> painting, but I do understand this art shown above.</p>
<p>The first two guys listed have very valid reasons for making their sites this way, distilled down perfectly to the last drop of the purest logic. The last two guys are just trolling us.</p>
<p><em>I was going to list <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck">Mark Zuckerberg’s</a> homepage (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091101062708/http://www.facebook.com/zuck">archive 1</a>) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200805074602/https://www.facebook.com/zuck">archive 2</a>) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831024214if_/https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0251986/">archive 3</a>) but it turns out he is sharing it with about 2.7 billion other people. It also presented compatibility issues by being listed on the same page with Richard Stallman.</em></p>

<h2 id="why-basic-flat-html-sites-are-best-for-most-of-us">Why Basic Flat HTML Sites Are Best for Most of Us</h2>
<h3 id="html-site--longevity">HTML Site = Longevity</h3>
<p>Being a zealous Christian, I’m a big fan of longevity. And, to me, there is nothing more enduring on the web than a basic HTML website.</p>
<p>You can host an HTML site, literally, for FREE, beautiful and complex…and it will be here later on when future post-world-war-3 generations finally find the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">GitHub Archive Program</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831170906/https://archiveprogram.github.com/">archive</a>) (provided you use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831111818/https://pages.github.com/">archive</a>), I think…).</p>
<p>Lets be realistic. If you are like most people, you will probably abandon your site when you realize its pointless. But if you did it in HTML, it will still be here 20 years from now, even if you never touched it again. Just ask Linus Torvolds.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200731110209/https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/syntaxerror.png">WordPress and other CMS’s will not do that for you…</a>)</p>
<h3 id="static-sites-can-handle-traffic">Static Sites Can Handle Traffic</h3>
<p>If you go viral and get inundated with traffic, an HTML flat site can handle it. Even if its running on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/">Raspberry Pi</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200708214027/https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/">archive</a>).

The set up is fairly straight forward: model an A/B test as sampling from two beta distributions, sample from each distribution a lot, then compare the results.</p><p>This simulation approach often first appears as a clever little trick to solve a more complex math problem, but in fact is a primative form of Monte-Carlo Integration and turns out to one of the only ways to really solve this problem. By exploring this topic deeper in this post we'll see some of the myths that many people have about analytic solutions as well as demonstrating why Monte-carlo methods are so essential to Bayesian statistics.</p></div><h2>Background: A conversation about election results</h2><div><p>An interesting conversation happened on Twitter recently.

So it is not inconsistent, nor suprising for someone to believe a candidate has 71% chance of success and they still lose. Even when looking at typical p-values, we wait for 95% percent certainty before making claims (and many feel this is a pretty weak belief). But for some reason whenever election polls come up, it seems even very statistically minded people suddenly think that 51% chance is a high probability.</p><p>I retweeted Nate Silver's forecast, mentioned my annoyance and provided an example of another case with a similar probability of winning:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. <br><br>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:<br><br>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials<br><br>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href=\&quot;https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao\&quot;>https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p>\u2014 Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;Will Kurt&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_6372"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. </p><p>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:</p><p>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials</p><p>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href="https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao">https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p></div>— Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href="https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

What we are really doing here is equalivant to using a Monte-Carlo simulation to integrate over the distribution of the difference between two Beta distributed random variables. After the next two sections it will be more clear that what's happening here is a surprisingly sophisticated operation that is, in my opinion, the easiest method of solving this problem as well as not truly a brute force solution.</p></div><h2><br>Analytic versus Easy</h2><div><p>When we see computational solutions to mathematical problems our first instinct is typically to feel that we are avoiding solving the problem <em>analytically.</em> An analytical solution is one that uses mathematical analysis to find a closed form solution.</p><p>A strivial example, suppose I wanted to find the value that minimized \(f(x) = (x+3)^2\)</p><p>In R I could brute force this by looking over a range of answers like this:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_13626"><div><pre><span>f</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>-</span> <span>function</span>(<span>x</span>){

It's also a bit messy because if we had iterated by an incredment that didn't include -3 exactly (say by 0.031) we would not get the exact answer.</p><p>If we know some basic calculus we know that our minimum has to be where the derivative is at 0. We can very easily work out that</p><p>$$f'(x) = 2(x+3)$$<br>And that</p><p>$$2(x + 3) = 0 $$</p><p>When</p><p>$$ x = -3 $$</p><p>Knowning basic calculus this later solution becomes much easier. </p><p>But even with the calculus is part is hard, often solving it once makes future solutions much easier. Take for example if you wanted to find the maximum likelihood for a normal distribution with a mean of \(\mu\) and standard deviation of \(\sigma\)</p><p>To solve this we start with our PDF for the normal distribution \(\varphi\):</p><p>$$\varphi(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$$</p><p>Now computing the derivative of this is not necessarily "easy" but it's certainly something we can do. All we really care about is when</p><p>$$\varphi'(x) = 0$$</p><p>Which we can find out happens when (computing the deriviative of course is left as an exercise for the reader):</p><p>$$\frac{\mu-x}{\sigma}$$</p></div><div><p>This allows us to reallize the amazing fact that for any normal distribution we come across, we know that the maximum likelihood estimate is the sample is when \(x = \mu\)!</p><p>Even though our calculus might take us a bit of work, once this is done the problem of doing maximum likelihood estimation for any Normal distribution truly does become easy!</p></div><h3><br>Proposing an Analytic solution to our problem</h3><div><p>Let's revisit our original problem this time attempting to find an analytic solution. This is a very interesting case because arguably this is the simplest Bayesian hypothesis test you can imagine.</p><p>Recall that we have two random variable representing our beliefs in each test. These are distributed according the the posterior which we described earlier.</p><p>$$A \sim \text{Beta}(2+1, 13+1)$$<br>$$B \sim \text{Beta}(3+1,11+1)$$</p><p>Here is where I skipped some steps in reasoning. What we want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B &gt;A)$$</p></div><div><p>Which is not expressed in a particularly useful mathematical way. A better way to solve this is to consider this as the sum (or difference in this case) of two random variables. What we really want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B - A &gt; 0)$$</p><p>In order to solve this problem we can think of a new random variable \(X\) which is going to be the difference between B and A:</p><p>$$X = B - A$$</p><p>Finally we'll suppose we have a probability density function for \(X\) we'll call \(\text{pdf}_X\). If we know \(\text{pdf}_X\) our solution is pretty close, we just need to integrate between 0 and the max domain of this distribution:</p><p>$$P(B &gt; A) = P(B - A &gt; 0) = \int_{x=0}^{\text{max}}\text{pdf}_{X}(x)$$</p><p>Already this is starting to look a bit complicated, but there's one big problem ahead. Unlike Normally distributed random variables, we have no equivalent of the Normal sum theorem (we'll cover this in a bit) for Beta distributed random variables. </p><p>What does \(\text{pdf}_X\) look like? For starters we know it's not a Beta distribution itself. We can see this because we know the domain (or support) of this distribution is not \([0,1]\). Because they are Beta distributed, A and B can both take on values from 0 to 1, which means the maximum result of this difference is 1 but the minimum is -1. So whatever this distribution is, its domain is \([-1,1]\) meaning it cannot be a Beta distribution.</p><p>We can use various rules about sum of random variables to determine the mean and variance of this distribution, but without knowing the exact form of this distribution we are unable to solve the integral analytically. </p><p>Here we can see that even in this profoundly simple problem the analytical solution is frustratingly …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></section></div></div></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we are going to discuss a change to server security that is going to make waves in the home lab and secondary markets for servers and components in the future. During our recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 review</a> we briefly mentioned that AMD EPYC CPUs in the system are vendor locked to Dell EMC systems. This is not a Dell-specific concern. We have confirmed that other vendors are supporting the feature behind this. For the large vendors, their platform security teams are pushing to build more secure platforms for their customers, and that is going to have future impacts on the secondary server market and home labs.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to cover the basics of what is happening. We are going to discuss the motivations, and why this is going to be more common in the future. Finally, we are going to discuss what those in the industry can do to keep the secondary server market operating well. If you work with partners or resellers who dip into used parts bins or even have the potential to purchase grey market CPUs, send them this article or accompanying video. The current market has a large disconnect between what some large customers are asking for, and large vendors are delivering on and what others in the market know is happening.<span id="more-46716"></span></p>

<h2>Background: How we learned this was a “thing”</h2>
<p>In 2018 we did a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-r7415-review/">Dell EMC PowerEdge R7415 review</a> and as part of that review, we started our normal process of trying different CPUs in the system. Early in that process, we used an AMD EPYC 7251 CPU, the low-end 8-core model, and noticed something curious. It would not work in our other test systems after.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, we found it was because Dell EMC was vendor locking the chips to Dell systems. We did not know exactly why, but we were told was a security feature. At this point, and even to this day two years later, not every vendor takes advantage of all of the AMD EPYC security features. What that practically means is that what we saw with the Dell EMC system is not what we saw with other systems. For example, we were able to interchangeably use CPUs in Supermicro and Tyan systems, but we could not use those systems once they went into a Dell EMC server.</p>

<p>We found we were not alone. Laboratories, VARs, and other organizations were finding that transferring AMD EPYC CPUs from one vendor’s system to another, was not the simple process it was on the Intel Xeon side. It did not always work.</p>
<p>We knew it was a security feature and thought that most who are buying servers would be informed of this by their sales reps or channel partners. After I personally got a lot of texts, e-mails, instant messaging, and comments on our C6525 video and article, I realized that this actually may be a situation where many people do not know what is going on.</p>

<p>This experience that we had, apparently is one that is not overly common yet. That makes sense because the systems that utilize the enhanced security levels are still largely new, and being used by their first buyers. Also, AMD still has a smaller market share than Intel. A big reason, by the way, that Intel Xeon does not have this issue is that they do not have the security feature that AMD has. Vendors have come out and stated that their AMD EPYC systems are more secure than their Intel Xeon systems, and this behavior is a byproduct of that enhanced security.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to dive into the feature of AMD processors (and what will be more common in future CPUs from other vendors.)</p>
<h2>AMD EPYC Secure Processor Platform Secure Boot (PSB)</h2>
<p>Let us start with the high-level slide. This is effectively the same slide on the AMD Secure Processor that we saw with the AMD EPYC 7001 series launch, but this is from the EPYC 7002 series. AMD EPYC CPUs may be x86, but they have an embedded Arm Cortex-A5 microcontroller that runs its own OS that is independent of the main system. This AMD Secure Processor is the backbone of AMD’s security push as it provides features such as key management and hardware root of trust for the platform.</p>
<figure id="attachment_36705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36705"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7002-series-rome-delivers-a-knockout/amd-epyc-7002-platform-secure-processor/" rel="attachment wp-att-36705"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg" alt="AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor" width="1792" height="918" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg 1792w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-400x205.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-800x410.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-696x357.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-1068x547.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-820x420.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-36705">AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor</figcaption></figure>
<p>AMD spends time <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-confirms-cts-labs-exploits-requiring-admin-access/">patching this solution</a>&nbsp;to make it more secure, but it is generally fairly hard to reach without some extremely low-level access in a system. We are going to come back to the “Enables hardware validated boot” line shortly, but it is important to understand that this secure processor underpins many of AMD’s best security features.</p>
<p>For example, at STH we use EPYC’s Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization heavily. With AMD EPYC, we do not have to manually manage keys. Instead, the ephemeral keys are managed for us by the AMD Secure Processor. This is the basis for what is really the building wave of confidential computing offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-cloud-confidential-computing-enabled-by-amd-epyc-sev/">Google Cloud Confidential Computing Enabled by AMD EPYC SEV</a>. Intel has its secure boot features and SGX that will be enhanced greatly with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake Xeons</a>, but for now, AMD has this capability while Intel does not. When big vendors say AMD is more secure, the AMD Secure Processor is a cornerstone of those offerings.</p>

<p>Let us discuss that “Enables hardware validated boot” line. While traditionally CPUs just fire up in whatever platform they are in, AMD has intelligence in their CPU due to the Arm-based AMD Secure Processor. EPYC CPUs are designed to be a bit more intelligent about the platforms they are in, and interact with server platform security to act as this root of trust that would not be possible if they effectively just booted up in any system.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from AMD describing the AMD Platform Secure Boot.</p>
<p><em>The AMD Platform Secure Boot Feature (PSB) is a mitigation for firmware Advanced Persistent Threats. It is a defense-in-depth feature. PSB extends AMD’s silicon root of trust to protect the OEM’s BIOS.&nbsp; This allows the OEM to establish an unbroken chain of trust from AMD’s silicon root of trust to the OEM’s BIOS using PSB, and then from the OEM’s BIOS to the OS Bootloader using UEFI secure boot. This provides a very powerful defense against remote attackers seeking to embed malware into a platform’s firmware.</em></p>
<p><em>An OEM who trusts only their own cryptographically signed BIOS code to run on their platforms will use a PSB enabled motherboard and set one-time-programmable fuses in the processor to bind the processor to the OEM’s firmware code signing key. AMD processors are shipped unlocked from the factory, and can initially be used with any OEM’s motherboard. But once they are used with a motherboard with PSB enabled, the security fuses will be set, and from that point on, that processor can only be used with motherboards that use the same code signing key. (<strong>Source</strong>: AMD statement to STH)</em></p>
<p>That is a lot to take in. We asked HPE about this. Their response mirrored what the above was describing. HPE firmware, when a system is first turned on, performs this binding process where the AMD EPYC CPU expects to see HPE signed firmware. If you alter the HPE firmware on the system, the check fails and the system will not work. That means if your HPE motherboard fails, you can replace it and put your CPU in another HPE motherboard with signed HPE firmware. It also means if the server platform’s firmware is not signed by HPE, the processor will see it as evidence of tampering and not work.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: 2020-09-09</strong> – HPE clarified that they are doing this in a different manner than Dell after initially confirming that they were using the AMD PSB feature. After this went live, HPE sent us the following:</p>
<p><em>HPE does not use the same security technique that Dell is using for a BIOS hardware root of trust. HPE does not burn, fuse, or permanently store our public key into AMD processors which ship with our products. HPE uses a unique approach to authenticate our BIOS and BMC firmware: HPE fuses our hardware – or silicon – root of trust into our own BMC silicon to ensure only authenticated firmware is executed.&nbsp; Thus, while we implement a hardware root of trust for our BIOS and BMC firmware, the processors that ship with our servers are not locked to our platforms. (<strong>Source</strong>: HPE)</em></p>
<p>What is at least interesting there is that HPE was initially claiming feature parity with Dell to us, and from the comments on this article were saying they used this feature in sales pitches, but now are saying they are not blowing the eFuses.</p>

<p>Here is where the concern develops, and not necessarily for AMD, the OEM, or most of the initial customer base. Customers want more security. The OEMs want to create a secure hardware environment because that is what their customers want. AMD is implementing an advanced security solution beyond what Intel Xeons have giving the OEMs and end-customers what they want. Effectively, when these are sold as new systems, this is exactly what everyone involved wants.</p>
<p>If everyone is getting what they want, then where is the concern, that is what we are going to cover next.</p>

<p>and to Richard Horton (editor of The Lancet).</p>



<p>OBJECT.</p>



<p>The study reports the results of a phase 1/2 study on an adenovirus-based vaccine, using Ad5 and Ad26 vectors for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen, and two different formulations (liquid and lyophilized).</p>



<p>During the current pandemic, the extreme public interest and expectations for an effective vaccine are understandable. However, the very same reasons should motivate the scientific community to pay even more attention to the scientific evidence and the underlying data, and it is thus of utmost importance that they are fully available for close scrutiny. Numerical data for all the experiments and original FACS files in fcs format, for example, would be of great help in evaluating the present study, enabling direct reproduction of &nbsp;all analyses and findings, rather than trying to do so from data abstracted or inferred from the figures.<br>While the research described in this study is potentially significant, the presentation of the data raises several concerns which require access to the original data to fully investigate. These are detailed below.</p>



<p>POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCIES IN FIGURES 2, 3 AND 4.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<strong>figure 2</strong>, the authors report the reciprocal titre of RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies at different time points, for all the patient groups (challenged with different formulations).<br>As evident by the following reproduction, there are several data patterns which appear repeatedly for the reported experiments. To this end, connecting measurements for each individual across time points would be highly beneficial in reporting (and hence) interpreting the results. This suggestion also applies to similar measurements in the other manuscript figures.</p>

<p><br>In the red boxes, 9 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd26-S appear to have identical antibody titres at 21 and 28 days; this is also true for 7 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd5-S (yellow boxes). Furthermore, in the cyan boxes we can see all the experimental points differing for a constant value in two completely unrelated experiments; and 8 out of 9 experimental points are completely preserved among other two completely unrelated volunteer groups (green boxes).</p>



<p>While we understand that in this case the variable under study is discrete (representing the reciprocal of a dilution), still it seems to us that on the ground of simple probabilistic evaluations the fact of observing so many data points preserved among different experiments is highly unlikely.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;<strong>figure 3</strong>, intended to present the results of the cellular response to the different formulations used for challenging the volunteers, in the following reproduction repeated experimental point patterns are boxed with the same colours as in the previous case, with an important difference: in this case, the variable under study (cell proliferation %) is continuous in nature, rendering the coincidence of data points among different experiments even less likely.</p>

<p>Please note that, in lack of the original numerical data, no conclusions can be definitively drawn on the reliability of the data presented, especially regarding the apparent duplications detected.</p>



<p>FURTHER CONCERNS.</p>



<p>The authors did not specify enough characteristics of the convalescent patients used as a control for the evaluation of the humoral response in figure 2. How were they matched to the different groups of enrolled volunteers? Since there are several convalescent control patients which apparently are seronegative and are also negative for neutralizing antibodies, it is also crucial to know when their plasma was collected – for each patient, how many days passed since symptoms and seronegativization occurred? How many convalescent controls were used for the graphs in figure 2?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
	Disney has publicly thanked a Chinese government agency accused of human rights abuses in Xinjiang for its help in making "Mulan" — a revelation that has provoked a storm of criticism online.</p>
<p>
	Disney acknowledges several Chinese government bodies in the credits for the live-action remake of the 1998 animated picture of the same name, but a few in particular have raised red flags: The Xinjiang government's publicity department and the Public Security and Tourism bureaus for Turpan, a city of about <a href="http://www.tlf.gov.cn/zjtluf/rkyy/rkgk.htm" target="_blank">633,400 people</a> just outside Xinjiang's capital Urumqi.</p>
<p>
	Disney did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business to its media inquiry line, and to U.S. press officers about the film and the credits. It's not clear how much of "Mulan" may have been shot in Xinjiang, though people who worked on the movie have said on social media and in interviews that they scouted and filmed locations there.</p>
<p>
	The U.S. State Department estimates that since 2015 as many as <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/120418_Busby_Testimony.pdf" target="_blank">two million of the Muslim-majority Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities</a> have been imprisoned in enormous re-education camps in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>
	The Turpan Public Security Bureau has been listed by the U.S. government as an organization involved in <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-22210/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list" target="_blank">"human rights violations and abuses"</a> in the region.</p>
<p>
	Beijing has long defended the crackdown in Xinjiang as necessary to tackle extremism and terrorism, and said it is in line with Chinese law and international practice, calling accusations of mass detentions a "groundless lie" and "sensational rumor." A spokesperson for the country's foreign ministry on Tuesday reiterated its defense of what it calls its Xinjiang "vocational skills education and training centers." CNN Business has reached out to the Xinjiang government and Turpan's tourism bureau, but Turpan's Public Security bureau could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>
	"There are no so-called concentration camps in Xinjiang," said China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. "The establishment of vocational skills education and training centers in Xinjiang in accordance with the law is a useful attempt and active exploration for preventive counter-terrorism and de-radicalization."</p>
<p>
	But the connections between Xinjiang and "Mulan" have ignited widespread criticism on social media since its release Friday on Disney+, the company's streaming service. Human rights advocates are now calling on Disney to make public any agreements with the Chinese government over filming in the region.</p>
<p>
	"[It's] deeply disturbing that Disney thought it was okay to partner with, and also thank, government departments, specifically propaganda departments, and a public security bureau from a region in China that is<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/asia/xinjiang-sterilization-women-human-rights-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank"> complicit with genocide," </a>said Isaac Stone Fish, senior fellow at the Asia Society, a New York based non-profit organization focused on raising awareness of Asia.</p>
<h3>
	A FILM PLAGUED BY SETBACKS</h3>
<p>
	Disney hoped that "Mulan" would be a major success at the lucrative Chinese box office, now the second-largest in the world. The company spoke last year about its dedication to making the film culturally accurate — remarks that were reported in Chinese state media.</p>
<p>
	"We spent a lot of time in the beginning with scholars, experts and people from the region. And we spent a great deal of time in China," said Sean Bailey, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, at a Disney expo event last year, reported the state-run news agency Xinhua. Bailey added that the studio "not only has a Chinese cast but also brought in a Chinese producer to make the movie with them," the outlet noted.</p>
<p>
	Eschewing the musicality of Disney's earlier animated feature of the same name, one box office analyst told CNN Business earlier this year that the live-action epic was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/media/disney-mulan-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">"tailor-made for success."</a></p>
<p>
	But the film — which is based on a traditional Chinese legend about <a href="http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/history/1706/4656-1.htm" target="_blank">a female warrior</a> who disguised herself as a man and took her father's place in the army — has already faced controversy and setbacks.</p>
<p>
	In August 2019, pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong called for a boycott of "Mulan" after the lead actor expressed support for Hong Kong police on her social media account.</p>
<p>
	"I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong," Liu Yifei, a Chinese-born U.S. citizen who plays the titular Hua Mulan, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/asia/china-mulan-actor-protests-intl-hnk-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">posted to her official Weibo account.</a> At the time, Hong Kong police faced allegations of excessive violence against protesters. (Hong Kong police <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/asia/hong-kong-protests-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">defended their actions</a> in September 2019, saying they had been "so restrained.")</p>
<p>
	Then in March, Disney was forced to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/media/mulan-delay-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">delay the film's release</a> as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered movie theaters.</p>
<p>
	Even now, its rollout has been stilted. The film was released as a US$30 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/media/mulan-disney-china-international-release/index.html" target="_blank">video-on-demand </a>last Friday on Disney+, which is only available in certain markets, including the United States. It makes its debut in Chinese theaters this weekend. (Disney+ is not available in China.)</p>
<p>
	The release of the film has renewed the controversy surrounding it, however. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/entertainment/mulan-boycott-hong-kong-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Thailand and Taiwan</a> have once again called on people to boycott the film because of Yifei's remarks last year.</p>
<p>
	And it's not even clear that the film will win over Chinese audiences, who were already chilly toward the original animated version because of its westernized flair and unfaithful retelling of the original legend.</p>
<p>
	After the release of the trailer in 2019, Chinese state-run media Global Times criticized the film for using<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1157286.shtml" target="_blank"> Japanese "ninja gestures"</a> and Chinese stereotypes.</p>
<h3>
	CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY</h3>
<p>
	Allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang stretch back years.</p>
<p>
	In recent years, the Xinjiang government has allegedly undertaken a large campaign to imprison and re-educate Muslim minorities in the region, especially the large Uyghur population.</p>
<p>
	Evidence of widespread human rights abuse has trickled out from inside the region, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">lengthy detentions,</a> abuse, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/26/asia/china-xinjiang-leaks-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">indoctrination</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/asia/xinjiang-sterilization-women-human-rights-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">mass birth control</a> — which experts have described as evidence of "genocide."</p>
<p>
	In 2017, Mulan director Niki Caro posted a photo from Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang<strong> </strong>and said she was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZle-neFOc-/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank">scouting out locations</a> for the film. And in an interview in September<strong> </strong>with Conde Nast traveler, Mulan production designer Grant Major discussed filming in Xinjiang's <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/on-location-mulan" target="_blank">Taklamakan Desert</a>, in the region's far southwest.</p>
<p>
	Adrian Zenz, a leading academic<strong> </strong>at the Victims of Communism Foundation who has helped break major stories from Xinjiang, said that the earliest documented case of a re-education center in the region was in Turpan in 2013.</p>
<p>
	Zenz said that while it was possible Disney didn't know about the growing number of detention centers set up across Xinjiang, the widespread oppression in the region was impossible to miss.</p>
<p>
	"There were police stations and checkpoints all over Xinjiang by late 2016, not to be missed," he said.</p>
<p>
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao dismissed Zenz's claims and accused him of making a living "through making Xinjiang-related rumors and slandering China." He also claimed there had been no cases of violence or terrorism in Xinjiang for "more than three consecutive years."</p>
<p>
	Turpan was also the setting for one of the worst outbreaks of ethnic violence in Xinjiang in recent years, when 35 people died during an attack on a police station in Lukqun township, in 2013, <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/kindle/2013-07/05/content_16731473.htm" target="_blank">according to state media.</a></p>
<p>
	Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, called for Disney to <a href="https://twitter.com/Yaqiu/status/1303002585155149825" target="_blank">disclose what assistance</a> it had received from Xinjiang authorities and what agreements it had made with the regional government.</p>
<p>
	And<strong> </strong>Asia Society fellow Stone Fish said that many companies were accustomed to making small concessions to the ruling Communist Party to access the Chinese market.</p>
<p>
	"Studios feel like they need to make these compromises to be in Beijing, but you can slightly censor your movies to get into the Chinese market, you can bring Chinese movies that shouldn't be in the States because of poor quality or because of propaganda elements into the States. And you can do that and maintain your integrity, mostly intact," he said.</p>
<p>
	"You don't need to take these extra steps that Disney is taking, and they're rightly getting excoriated for it."</p>

  <p>Should you join a big company or start a startup?</p>
<p>This frequently debated question paints a picture of a world where the only choice is between being a cog at a giant semi-monopoly, or taking investment money in the hopes of one day growing to be head cog at a giant semi-monopoly.</p>
<p>Role models matter. So I made a list of small companies that I admire. Neither giants nor startups - just people making a living writing software on their own terms.</p>
<h2 id="sqlite"><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite</a></h2>
<p>Sqlite is an existence proof that you don't need a thousand engineers to have an impact. It's been around since the early 90s, is one of the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most shipped</a> pieces of software in existence and is widely respected for its <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html">exceptional testing methodology</a>. Yet it was written almost entirely by a few people:</p>
<pre><span>jamie@machine:~/sqlite$ git shortlog -s -n | head -n 5
 14012	drh
  4297	dan
  1663	danielk1977
  1099	mistachkin
   175	shane
</span></pre>
<p>Their growth plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hwaci is a small company but it is also closely held and debt-free and has low fixed costs, which means that it is largely immune to buy-outs, take-overs, and market down-turns. Hwaci intends to continue operating in its current form, and at roughly its current size until at least the year 2050. We expect to be here when you need us, even if that need is many years in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sqlite is also interesting because although the code is open source they operate on a cathedral model, generally <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html">refusing or rewriting</a> outside contributions.</p>
<h2 id="pinboard"><a href="https://pinboard.in/">pinboard</a></h2>
<p>Pinboard is a single-person operation that has been making a solid income year on year <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2019/07/i_cant_stop_winning/">since 2010</a>. It somehow still leaves Maciej enough free time to go around <a href="https://idlewords.com/2019/5/">teaching politicians how to not get hacked</a> and <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/senate_testimony.2019.5.htm">explaining privacy to the senate</a>. All the while <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/">destroying his competition</a> using highly advanced tactics such as <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/fan_is_a_tool_using_animal.htm">listening to his customers</a> and not operating at a loss.</p>
<p>But if Maciej had done nothing else he would still be on this list for his beautiful talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt8zqhHe_c">Barely Succeed! It's Easier!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in a remarkable time when small teams (or even lone programmers) can successfully compete against internet giants. But while the last few years have seen an explosion of product ideas, there has been far less innovation in how to actually build a business. Silicon Valley is stuck in an outdated 'grow or die' mentality that overvalues risk, while investors dismiss sustainable, interesting projects for being too practical. So who needs investors anyway?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll talk about some alternative definitions of success that are more achievable (and more fun!) than the Silicon Valley casino. It turns out that staying small offers some surprising advantages, not just in the day-to-day experience of work, but in marketing and getting customers to love your project. Best of all, there's plenty more room at the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your goal is to do meaningful work you love, you may be much closer to realizing your dreams than you think.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tarsnap"><a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a></h2>
<p>Another single-person operation, tarsnap has reported been profitable <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/about.html">since 2009</a> and shows no sign of going anywhere, even lowering it's prices over the years as storage became cheaper. It's saved me on multiple occasions and it's so simple, reliable and cheap that I think of it almost like a utility - tarsnap having an outage would be more surprising to me than water not coming out of my taps.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things about tarsnap is that it could <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/04/03/fantasy-tarsnap/">easily be making more money</a>. If tarsnap had investors or shareholders, they would have <strong>already forced Colin to do so</strong>. In other words, the only reason that Colin gets to continue running the kind of business that he <strong>wants</strong> to run is that he owns it entirely and noone can force him to maximize profit instead.</p>
<h2 id="sublime"><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a></h2>
<p>Version 1.0 came out in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/one-point-oh">2008</a> and they're still going strong today, making enough to <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/">hire an extra developer</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-merge">launch a separate product</a>.</p>
<p>Sublime is notable for surviving despite massive open-source competition in a field where people hate to pay for tools. As <a href="https://thume.ca/2017/03/04/my-text-editor-journey-vim-spacemacs-atom-and-sublime-text/">Tristan Hume points out</a>, it's really the only editor that has managed to remain both fast and consistent while still supporting a large plugin ecosystem. These kind of end-to-end qualities are perhaps one of the main advantages for small teams with a long time horizon.</p>
<h2 id="zig"><a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a></h2>
<p>Zig has been around <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/post/full-time-zig.html">only a few years</a> but I'm already wildly impressed by the quality of thought and engineering that has gone into it.</p>
<p>The Zig Software Foundation is a non-profit, currently funded entirely by donations and working towards being able to employ a second full-time developer. They explicitly chose to be a non-profit out of concern over how profit incentives creep into daily decision making:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In You Weren’t Meant to Have a Boss, Paul Graham makes an analogy between animals in the zoo (employees) and animals in the wild (startup founders). I think he’s on to something, but when you start a startup, you still have a boss. In fact, you have the same boss. At the end of the day, it is an inescapable fact that you must do what makes a profit, for the shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference in incentives makes a structural difference that permeates every part of an organization. Windows users wake up one day and find ads in their start menu. Will Debian Linux ever try to put ads into any of its software? The concept is absurd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zig was explicitly designed to be a <a href="https://ziglang.org/#Small-simple-language">small, simple language</a>, allowing it to be maintained indefinitely by a small, committed team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ZSF is a small organization and makes efficient use of monetary resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t see the need for ZSF to grow beyond a handful of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Maciej <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt8zqhHe_c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2144">puts it</a>, one of the advantages of being small is that you can speak with a human voice. This comes across clearly from the zig team, who are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8f48iYKxgg">resolutely human</a> instead of projecting some impassive facade of professionalism.</p>

<p>
through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54ea652">
<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d8bce">
<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.
</p>

<div>

<p>
That's it! The network is ready to learn.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgae4dec0">
<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>time <span>(</span>train net train-images y-train <span>:crossentropy</span> 12 <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

<p>
Should I mention that the book <a href="https://aiprobook.com/deep-learning-for-programmers/">Deep Learning for Programmers: An Interactive Tutorial with
CUDA, OpenCL, DNNL, Java, and Clojure</a> teaches the nuts and bolts of neural networks and deep learning
by showing you how Deep Diamond is built, <b>from scratch</b>? In interactive sessions. Each line of code
can be executed and the results inspected in the plain Clojure REPL. The best way to master something is to build
it yourself!

It' simple. But fast and powerful!

        <p>A story on Hacker News recently argued that webpage speeds haven't improved, even as internet speeds have gone up.</p>
<p>This article explains why that conclusion can't be drawn from the original data.</p>
<p>We'll also look at how devices and the web have changed over the past 10 years, and what those changes have meant for web performance.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="interpreting-the-http-archive-data">Interpreting the HTTP Archive data</h2>
<p>This chart from the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/">Nielsen Norman Group article</a> suggested that increasing mobile network bandwidth hasn't resulted in faster page load times.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart.png" alt="Chart showing increasing bandwidth along increasing page load times"></p>
<p>However, <strong>the connection speed used by HTTP Archive has not actually increased over time.</strong></p>
<p>Instead it went down in 2013, <a href="https://httparchive.org/faq#what-changes-have-been-made-to-the-test-environment-that-might-affect-the-data">switching from wifi to an emulated 3G connection</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart-annotated.png" alt="Annotation for page loads time showing when methodology changed"></p>
<p>The onLoad metric has increased 55% since 2013, from 12.7s to 19.7s. If you bought a phone in 2013 and have been on a 3G connection ever since, then the web has become slower for you.</p>
<p>Before looking at how devices and the web have changed over the last 10 years, here are a few notes on how to think about this data.</p>
<h3 id="why-look-at-on-load">Why look at onLoad?</h3>
<p>The <code>load</code> event is emitted by the page when all page resources like scripts or images have been downloaded.</p>
<p>If the top of a page renders quickly, but the page also loads 20 images further down, then the onLoad metric will suggest that the page is slow.</p>
<p>A different page might not initially render anything useful at all, and only start loading additional resources and rendering content long after the onLoad event. Yet this page will appear fast.</p>
<p>As a result, onLoad doesn't do a good job measuring whether a user experiences the page as fast.</p>
<p>So why do we even look at this metric? <strong>Because it's been around for a long time</strong>, and HTTP Archive has been tracking it since 2010. Newer metrics like <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> or Time to Interactive were only added to HTTP Archive in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="should-we-expect-increasing-bandwidth-to-result-in-faster-page-load-times">Should we expect increasing bandwidth to result in faster page load times?</h3>
<p>Increasing bandwidth will only make a page load faster if bandwidth is the bottleneck at some point. It won't help if you're on a Gigabit connection with a 1s network roundtrip time.</p>
<p>However, the 1.6Mbps 3G connection emulated by HTTP Archive is very slow, so we should expect significant performance improvements as bandwidth improves. The average website downloads 1.7MB of data in 2020, which will take at least 9s to download on the HTTP Archive connection.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-http-archive-caveats">Some more HTTP Archive caveats</h3>
<p>I'll talk a lot about "the average website" in this article. It's worth noting that HTTP Archive only collects data on homepages, not pages deeper down in the site. The corpus of tested domains has also grown over time.</p>
<p>The tests weren't always run on the same device. Initially a physical iPhone 4 was used, today the tests are run on an emulated Android device.</p>
<p>We'll look at median metric values in this article. If most websites are fast but one in five websites freeze your phone for 20s we won't be able to pick this up.</p>
<h3 id="performance-on-desktop">Performance on desktop</h3>
<p>This article will focus on mobile performance in the US. However, if you're looking at the desktop data from the original article, it's worth noting that the test bandwidth was increased and latency was reduced in 2013.</p>

<h2 id="how-have-mobile-networks-and-devices-changed-over-the-last-10-years">How have mobile networks and devices changed over the last 10 years?</h2>
<p>Let's look at 4 factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>network bandwidth</li>
<li>network latency</li>
<li>processor speeds</li>
<li>browser performance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobile-network-bandwidth-in-the-us">Mobile network bandwidth in the US</h3>
<p>This chart shows average mobile bandwidth in the US by year, according to different sources. It increased from 1 Mbps to around 30 Mbps.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-bandwidth.png" alt="Mobile bandwidth in the US by year"></p>
<p>(I've not been very careful when collecting this data. For example, I didn't consistently distinguish when data was collected from when it was published. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifZ_ngADpT3YzezNQLpXKCsr74-BvaBJUkYm6PGpv1g/edit?usp=sharing">You can find my sources here</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="mobile-network-latency-in-the-us">Mobile network latency in the US</h3>
<p>This was harder to find data on, but the results indicate that latency dropped from around 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-latency.png" alt="Mobile latency in the US by year, going down from 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020"></p>
<h3 id="mobile-device-cpu-speeds">Mobile device CPU speeds</h3>
<p>I've not been able to find data on average mobile device speeds in the US. But <a href="https://infrequently.org/">Alex Russel</a> and <a href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> have published a <a href="https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1233275220275818498">chart showing GeekBench 4 scores alongside the release years of different phones</a>.</p>
<p>Even budget phones have become 4x faster, with iPhones now being up to 20x more powerful.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/mobile-cpu-benchmark.jpeg" alt="Mobile CPU performance over time"></p>
<h3 id="how-have-browsers-changed">How have browsers changed?</h3>
<p>A lot of work has been done on browsers over the last 10 years. JavaScript has become a larger part of the web, so many improvements have focussed here.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/10-years">this chart from the V8 blog</a>, page CPU usage for gone down by a factor of 4.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/v8-performance.png" alt="V8 Speedometer 1 benchmark results 2013 to 2018"></p>
<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<p>Browser networking has also improved, for example with the introduction of HTTP/2 in 2015. 64% of requests are now served over HTTP/2.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/http2.png" alt="HTTP/2 adoption over time"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-websites-changed">How have websites changed?</h2>
<p>Let's look at some data from HTTP Archive to see how websites have changed.</p>
<h3 id="page-weight">Page weight</h3>
<p><a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight">Mobile page weight</a> increased by 337% between 2013 and 2020. This is primarily driven by an increase in images and JavaScript code.</p>
<p>Other resources also increased a lot –&nbsp;I suspect these are mostly videos.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/page-weight.png" alt="Page weight by resource type over time"></p>
<p>The chart starts in 2013 as HTTP Archive changed its methodology in October 2012. Before page weight was undercounted, as the test stopped when the page load event was triggered, even if more data was still being loaded.</p>
<h3 id="java-script-execution-time">JavaScript execution time</h3>
<p>JavaScript would be the most likely culprit if pages are getting slower despite faster mobile networks. Unfortunately, HTTP Archive only started collecting this data in late 2017, and it seems to have been mostly stable since then.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/javascript-execution-time.png" alt="HTTP Archive JavaScript execution time chart"></p>
<p>The drop in mid-2018 can probably be attributed to a URL corpus change.</p>
<p>Note that the absolute run duration (0.5s) is less than what you'd normally see in a tool like Lighthouse. These tools normally slow down JavaScript execution to emulate a mobile device, but <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/methodology#lighthouse">this was broken for the HTTP Archive tests</a>. So while this number might be realistic for mid-range phones, a common assumption is that budget phones are around 4x slower.</p>
<h2 id="answering-whether-the-web-has-become-slower">Answering whether the web has become slower</h2>
<p>Has the web become slower? Well, it depends on what your device, network connection, and most-used websites are.</p>
<p>We'd need to weigh real-world performance data to get a distribution that shows how different users experienced the web over time. And should the experience of someone opening thousands of pages a day count as much as someone who only visits Facebook once a week?</p>
<p>I don't have detailed per-user data, but we can take a look at the question in a few different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real-user data from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome UX Report (CrUX)</a></li>
<li>Naive modelling based on how websites and devices have changed</li>
</ol>
<p>I also tried downloading old page versions from archive.org and testing them with Lighthouse, but wasn't able to get meaningful results in the time I had available. For example, often some images are missing from the page archive.</p>
<h2 id="data-from-the-chrome-user-experience-report">Data from the Chrome User Experience Report</h2>
<p>The big limitation of CrUX data is that it's only been collected since late 2017. But we can still use it to see if the web has become slower in the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike HTTP Archive, CrUX looks at the whole domain instead of just homepages.</p>
<p>The data we'll look at is the 75th percentile, meaning pages load at least this fast for 75% of users.</p>
<p>(I'm taking the average across websites rather than the median, which is not great.)</p>
<h3 id="us-page-load-times">US page load times</h3>
<p>CrUX data for the US does not show page performance getting worse.</p>
<p>The onLoad metric shows a slight improvement, maybe due to an increase in bandwidth. Or maybe more activity is now happening after the initial page load.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-us.png" alt="Page load speeds in the US"></p>
<p>The paint metrics seem fairly stable. Largest Contentful Paint is a new metric that has only been collected since mid-2019.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-of-the-world">The rest of the world</h3>
<p>The downward trend in the US onLoad metric is matched by the global data. There are however signifianct differences in page load times across countries, with onLoad timings in India being almost twice those in South Korea.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-global.png" alt="Page load speeds globally, in the US, UK, Korea, and India"></p>
<p>We can use CrUX data to put HTTP Archive data into perspective. In January 2020 HTTP Archive reported a median (50% percentile) load time of 18.7s, based on its synthetic data.</p>
<p>In contrast, CrUX suggests a load time of just 5.8s –&nbsp;and this is the 75th percentile.</p>
<p>(Note that the Global values here just take an average and are not weighed by population.)</p>
<h2 id="modelling-page-load-times">Modelling page load times</h2>
<p>We can create a theoretical model of how changes in devices, networks, and websites might affect overall performance.</p>
<p>This won't be a great model, but hopefully it will still provide some insight.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-page-download-time">Theoretical page download time</h3>
<p>Page weight has increased over time, but so has bandwidth. Round-trip latency has also gone down.</p>
<p>Downloading a file the size of the median mobile website would have taken 1.7s in 2013. If your connection hasn't improved since then downloading this much data would now take 4.4s. But with an average connection today it would only take 0.9s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/minimum-page-download-time.png" alt="TCP download time"></p>
<p>In practice, a website wouldn't consist of just a single request, and other factors like CPU processing or server latency would also affect how quickly the page loads. The onLoad times reported by HTTP Archive are 2-3 times this lower bound.</p>
<p>But we can still use this as an indicator that reduced latency and increased bandwidth have helped make websites load faster overall.</p>
<p>(I'm starting in 2013 rather than 2011, as the HTTP Archive page weight metric has only been measured consistently since then.)</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>I'm not quite sure how to think about this, but I'll make some guesses anyway.</p>
<p>Someone who used a Galaxy S4 in 2013 and now uses a Galaxy S10 will have seen their CPU processing power go up by a factor of 5. Let's assume that browsers have become 4x more efficient since then. If we naively multiply these numbers we get an overall 20x improvement.</p>
<p>Since 2013, JavaScript page weight has increased 3.7x from 107KB to 392KB. Maybe minification and compression have improved a bit …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

              <p>September 2020</p>

              <p>
                It's 2020, and you're browsing the web when you see a job ad with something very unusual:
              </p>

              <p>
                <i>"We're looking for experienced marketers to help us launch a new product line. White candidates only, please".</i>
              </p>

              <p>
                Infuriating and depressing! How long do you think it would take for every news agency in the world to be talking about this? And for this company to go out of business? And how about for the authors to be facing criminal charges?
              </p>

              <p>
                This entire situation sounds very unlikely to happen today. But isn't it disturbing to think that less than a century ago this would be just another ordinary day?
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, replace the <i>"White candidates only"</i> with <i>"Australian residents only"</i>, and you have a real example of thousands of modern job ads shared around the web every day.
              </p>

              <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c08abdd264a662ef6b35ae6807f17f4322cbdb90/424f0/assets/img/blog/open-borders-book.jpg" alt="Open Borders Book"></p><p>
                <i>(Illustration from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960/">Open Borders</a> by Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith)</i>
              </p>

              <p>
                I was born in Brazil, and as I grew up, I became each year more distant and frustrated with the country's (and my) future. Living in one of the poorest states in the country, I was one of the very few who was lucky and privileged to have parents who could afford to send me for a year abroad during high-school.
              </p>

              <p>
                I spent my last year of high school in the U.S., a life-changing and mind-expanding event. With one caveat, though. I wasn't allowed to work and get paid anywhere while I was in the country. I still remember my American friends giving me a ride on their way to work after school and perplexed that I depended on my parents sending me money from overseas.
              </p>

              <p>
                Back in Brazil, as I entered university and started working as a software developer, I found myself dreaming about working and living in Australia. But once again, I wasn't allowed, I was born in Brazil.
              </p>

              <p>
                As an 18-year old, my obsession with moving to Australia wasn't just rational. It was also an emotional one. I knew I wanted to scape the fear of daily violence in Brazil. I dreamed about a society with less economic inequality. But I also pictured myself surfing in Australian waves.
              </p>

              <p>
                And to be fair, I didn't understand what was wrong with that. I wanted a better life right away. A better life obviously means different things for different people. For me, I knew it would be a move to Australia. But I couldn't just save some money, buy a ticket and fly to Oceania. No, I would be committing a crime if I did that, I was born in the wrong place to do that.
              </p>

              <p>
                By then, I spoke English and was getting more experienced in my field each year. After years contacting hundreds of companies in Australia and doing remote test projects, I was offered a job with visa sponsorship, meaning I would get a temporary work visa to live in the "lucky country".
              </p>

              <p>
                Everything worked out for me, and I've relocated permanently to Australia. But that was never the case for thousands of people who have contacted me in the last ten years asking for help to do the same. In fact, that's not the case for approximately one billion people in the world today.
              </p>

              <p>
                Accordingly to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/124028/700-million-worldwide-desire-migrate-permanently.aspx">Gallup World Poll</a>, 16% of the world's adults would like to move to another country permanently if they had the chance.
              </p>

              <p>
                The point is: That same feeling I had about moving to Australia is not uncommon. Millions of people daydream about a similar move to a better country their entire lives. The sad part is that my migration story is an outlier. The vast majority of people are not able to legally enter the more developed nations due to current immigration law.
              </p>

              <p>
                Removing (or at least reducing) immigration restrictions would not just be the right and moral thing to do. It would be one of the smartest and most impactful economic moves we could make.
              </p>

              <p>
                It's practically unanimous between economists that reducing immigration restrictions would make the world more productive. To be more specific, estimates are we would instantly get close to <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/economics-and-emigration-trillion-dollar-bills-sidewalk-working-paper-264">doubling global GDP</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                But if economic gains are so clear, why do countries decide to close their borders to foreigners?
              </p>

              <p>
                I prefer not to enter the immigration debate directly linked to political elections around the world in the last couple of decades. People are too zoomed-in to see the big picture and think un-emotionally about at least small reductions in immigration restrictions that would create a net gain for most people.
              </p>

              <p>
                The most frequent counter-arguments I hear are:
              </p>

              <p>
                1) Mass migration would create mass poverty. A popular one is that everyone from South America and Africa would move to the U.S., which would, in turn, become a poor country.
              </p>

              <p>
                2) No developed nation would be able to afford the new demand for their welfare programs. How would they keep a quality health system or unemployment protection program in place?
              </p>

              <p>
                3) Terrorism.
              </p>

              <p>
                4) The receiving countries would risk losing their national culture.
              </p>

              <p>
                I can understand people raising these questions. It's just not productive that this is where they stop when they think about freer immigration. They are moved by fear and passion, and no healthy debate can come from that.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you're interested in learning more about such questions, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960/">Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Whatever your view and belief are about this topic, the truth is that at least small improvements can be made. The default logic for immigration law in 2020 is simply cruel.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the things that seem almost always to surprise people is knowing that having a passport and not being able to go to a country because of visa restrictions is a very recent phenomenon.
              </p>

              <p>
                Until 1914, there were no travel restrictions based on where you were born. Anyone could go anywhere. Every individual could make their own decisions about where in the world they would be able to live a better life, as long as they had a way to make it to their desired destination.
              </p>

              <p>
                And then came World War I, security concerns and the introduction of the modern passport as we know it. Germany, France and Italy were the first ones to officialise its use. By the end of the war, the system had global mass adoption.
              </p>

              <p>
                The passport with visa restrictions was supposed to be a temporary "hack". For the next several decades, governments held international conferences to discuss getting rid of passports and restoring the freedom of movement for everyone.
              </p>

              <p>
                But the temporary hack became a complex system with no easy way back. Less than a hundred years later, and we had all got used to it and could not imagine life without it anymore. No matter what, you have to agree we got used to critical loss of freedom.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm optimistic, and the good news is that if you zoom out, you can see the world is moving in the right direction on several fronts. There are still errors and injustices, of course, and the passport in its current form is an example. A mistake, I believe, that will be corrected slowly in the next few decades. I expect we will be talking about passport discrimination, the same way the world is currently talking about discrimination based on gender, skin colour or age, for example. No discrimination can be accepted, and as humans, I expect us to continue learning and evolving.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the meantime, there's a lot more that could be done. A few examples: We could easily have at least ten times more free movement agreements between neighbour countries. The developed countries should be creating more flexible work-holiday programs, open to a much higher number of people than current volumes. And points-based immigration systems could be used as a way to start opening up the most strict and closed countries.
              </p>

                <i>(Small agreement between Australia and Vanuatu in September 2020)</i>
              </p>

              <p>
                On a final note, our complex immigration programs, which change from country to country, create another substantial barrier: Access to information. I'm building <a href="https://www.duoflag.com/">Duoflag</a> as a side project in a small attempt to have a centralised resource for people to discover and understand their options to migrate to another country. I wish this existed twenty years ago when I was researching my options. If this is something you're also interested in, I would love to hear from you and join forces.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Let's face it, It is not easy to choose a freaking PC these days with the deluge of specifications that come with it let alone FPGAs. The question of using FPGAs to solve any computing problem only arises when an extraordinary performance is required. Owing to this fact, FPGAs in their feature specification and build can be extremely specific to the application at hand. This results in an insane number of varieties in terms of the logic structures within the FPGA as well as the interfaces that are provided with the external world. However, this guide aims to guide you in the right direction (which does not mean dumping a list of the hundreds of different options out there) based on your level of experience and requirement.</p>
<p>There are other posts out there that provide large tables with exhaustive lists of FPGA development boards out there and let you (after a year or two of research) make a choice. If that's your thing, I'll attach some links to help you get started.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>If you're already familiar with the various bells and whistles of  FPGAs and are only looking for some good suggestions, you might prefer to <a href="https://thedatabus.io/fpga-buying-guide#the-top-contenders"><strong>JUMP TO THE LIST OF SUGGESTIONS</strong></a>.  If not, read on to learn some very important stuff about the FPGA world and how to choose better!</em></p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-be-looking-for"><a href="#what-you-should-be-looking-for" aria-label="what you should be looking for permalink"></a>What you should be looking for</h2>
<p>There are already a lot of aspects to an FPGA in general that determine its fit to a particular problem and the ease with which it can be programmed, now add to this the complexity of a feature-rich development board with all sorts of peripherals, interfaces, connectors and memory options you have at hand a humongous task of deciding between hundreds of varieties out there.</p>
<h3 id="soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga"><a href="#soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga" aria-label="soc based board or just an fpga permalink"></a>SOC based board or just an FPGA?</h3>
<p>SOC stands for <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/integrated-circuit/ic-types/system-on-chip/" target="_blank">System-on-Chip</a> which simply means that various interacting technologies are built onto the same die (/chip). You see SOCs everywhere, on your phones, TVs, and computers. In the context of an FPGA development board, a SOC based system means that the hardware has two components, a sea of programmable logic (the FPGA) and a hard processor core implemented in silicon independent of the programmable FPGA logic. Interfaces are created between the programmable logic and the processing system (in Xilinx lingo) that enable communication between the two regions.</p>
<p><img src="https://thedatabus.io/static/zynq7000-ae213195db5b530cc3f5d60785b3b0b1.png" alt="Zynq7000"></p>
<p>If you are an absolute beginner looking for direction, you should definitely choose a SOC based system because of the immense additional learning potential it adds. Having said that, your first few digital design projects should never involve the processor cores or any kind of software programming. For that, you can just ignore the processor logic and dump your design into the programmable region to use it as a normal FPGA. As you progress, you can add much higher levels of complexity to your design by bringing in the processor core to directly read and write data in your configurable hardware. You can also experiment with writing firmware, drivers, the Linux OS, and the higher levels of abstraction thus getting a truly holistic experience of embedded system design. Even the simplest SOC based board will keep you busy for a long time. </p>
<p>These boards can also be of great interest for Software engineers looking to explore into the digital design world since processor + FPGA structures lend themselves very well to paradigms like HLS, Heterogenous computing and partial acceleration of algorithms. Viewing the FPGA logic as an extension of the SOC is something that is going to be very important in the future and is a good investment of your time.</p>
<p>Alternatively, If you are a beginner but are looking only to learn digital design or you wish to buy a board to complement your studies at college where you get to use a particular board in your lab, you can get a lot more basic FPGA resources (LUTs, BRAMs, DSPs) on a Non-SOC based board that has only the FPGA. This way you save money and have a much less complex system at hand that you can comprehend better. The same is true If you plan to implement something specific that takes up an enormous number of resources, you might be better off going for a dev board that has only the FPGA and the required peripherals.</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/9yutk8/best_100300_fpga_development_board_in_2018/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">this post</a> on the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/" target="_blank">r/FPGA</a> user <strong>u/ndbroadbent</strong> has shown the resource usages of several open source projects, this can give you a good idea of how big projects usually are.</p>
<p><strong>An important note for beginners</strong> : <em>Having an SOC board, with all the processor logic around the FPGA can really deviate you from the basic idea of programmable logic and how you're supposed to learn it. I strongly suggest completely disregarding anything to do with the processor for your first few projects and use only the FPGA part of the device. Also note that as of today, any good FPGA engineer will tell you that any form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_synthesis#:~:text=High%2Dlevel%20synthesis%20(HLS),hardware%20that%20implements%20that%20behavior."><strong>HLS</strong></a> is not good enough to be used in real world projects. This is doubly true for the beginners. <strong>DO NOT</strong> fall into the 'Write code in C++/Python and run it on FPGA' trap. A lot of youtubers seem to be promoting stuff like that for beginners these days which is just sad. If you have the money to spend, the ideal (and more enjoyable) learning strategy would be to use a standalone FPGA board first and upgrade to an SOC later.</em></p>

<h3 id="interfaces-and-ios"><a href="#interfaces-and-ios" aria-label="interfaces and ios permalink"></a>Interfaces and IOs:</h3>
<p>FPGAs are excellent tools for working on high-speed interfaces. So you might want to look at the interfaces and IO options a particular development board is providing. This is important because if the board has a particular interface out of the box, the vendor will probably provide the necessary documentation and sample designs for those interfaces. This can save you tons of head-scratching and hair-pulling (trust me that is common in the FPGA world) as a beginner. That's not to say that newer interfaces cannot be added to the board manually but when it comes to High-speed interfaces like Ethernet, HDMI, PCIe, it can be very difficult to add them yourself and expect reliable performance. Low-speed ones like SPI, UART, etc can always be manually added using the GPIOs, so let them not be the dealbreaker for any board.</p>
<p>Some common networking interfaces that you should look for are high-speed interfaces like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" target="_blank"><strong>HDMI</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array" target="_blank"><strong>VGA</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet" target="_blank"><strong>ETHERNET</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express" target="_blank"><strong>PCIe</strong></a>  etc. and low-speed peripherals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface" target="_blank"><strong>SP</strong>I</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" target="_blank"><strong>CAN</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank"><strong>I2C</strong></a>  etc.</p>
<p>Although not as important for a beginner, another set of interfaces that can be useful are the analog and sensor interfaces like ADCs, DACs, Camera Interface, Audio CODECs, etc. These are very niche features that can make or break a particular project if it depends on data acquisition from the external world.</p>
<p>If you choose to go for a board with not too many peripherals for whatever reason, you might be better off choosing one that has the industry-standard <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/" target="_blank"><strong>PMOD</strong></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA_Mezzanine_Card" target="_blank"><strong>FMC</strong></a> connectors installed so that when you do need additional interfaces in the future, they can be added very easily. These standard connectors essentially decouple FPGA carrier boards from the IO engines (which plug-in as daughter cards), enabling you to use the same FPGA boards with a large variety of IO designs without ever having to re-design the board.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="buttons-leds-and-displays"><a href="#buttons-leds-and-displays" aria-label="buttons leds and displays permalink"></a>Buttons, LEDs, and Displays:</h3>
<p>Debugging FPGA designs can be a hard thing. Unlike MCUs where you can place print statements and breakpoints anywhere you want in the code, there is no such equivalent in the FPGA world and that can often lead to great frustration. One workaround is possible, if there are switches and LEDs on your board. They provide an easy way to pull out signals to the real world and give you an indication of the status of some status registers that can help you visualize and debug (like the current state of a state machine or a particular flag in a CPU design). However, this should not be the deciding factor between two boards since it is very easy to add LEDs, buttons, switches, and LCDs using the GPIO connectors without much effort.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="memory-and-resource-count"><a href="#memory-and-resource-count" aria-label="memory and resource count permalink"></a>Memory and Resource Count:</h3>
<p>The Resource Count is another important metric that goes into deciding on an FPGA device. By resource, we mean the number of programmable logic elements available on the board. These can be LUTs (ALMs for Altera), Block Rams, DSPs, and IO blocks. Much more complex and fancier devices like the  <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/acap/versal.html" target="_blank"> Versal family</a> from Xilinx can have lots of other stuff like AI, video, and audio cores, etc. It is important to take note of these resource numbers because they determine the biggest project that you can successfully fit onto the FPGA. It is hard to come up with a fixed count for a particular project owing to differences in the underlying CLB architecture from vendor to vendor and family to family.</p>
<p>FPGAs store the configuration(bitstream) data on the SRAM (usually) cells within the FPGA. Since SRAM is a volatile kindof memory, the program is lost each time the board is power-cycled. A PC support is needed to reprogram it again after the power cycle, to prevent this, FLASH (or EEPROM in older boards) based storage is provided onboard by the vendors. Flash is a non-volatile form of storage that holds the bitstream data even without a power supply. Each time the board comes up after a power cycle, the FPGA checks the flash memory for a bitstream and programs itself with it. This is usually given by default in most boards but can be something important to look out for. </p>
<p>The other important form of memory is the external onboard volatile storage which is most commonly provided in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM" target="_blank">DDR SDRAM</a>  This is extremely useful if you are building an application that needs to store data locally for whatever reason. Since the block ram storage within the FPGA fabric is very little and is very precious, having a DDR that can be written to and read from in a reasonable amount of time is very much essential. The more the better!

        <article>
          <section><p>Operating systems and file systems have traditionally been developed
hand in hand. They impose mutual constraints on each other. Today we
have two major leaders in file system semantics: Windows and <span>POSIX</span>.
They are very close to each other when compared to the full set of
possibilities. Interesting things happened before POSIX monopolized
file system&nbsp;semantics.</p>

<p>When you use a file system through a library instead of going through
the operating system there are some extra possibilities. You are no
longer required to obey the host operating system’s semantics for
filenames. You get to decide if you use <code>/</code> or <code>\</code> to separate
directory components (or something else altogether). Maybe you don’t
even use strings for filenames. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/weinholt/fs-fatfs">fs-fatfs</a> library uses
a list of strings, so it’s up to the caller to define a directory
separator for themselves. While working on that library, I was driven
to write down some ideas that I’ve previously run across and found&nbsp;inspirational.</p>

<p>The very first hierarchical file system was developed for Multics. It
is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.multicians.org/fjcc4.html">A General-Purpose File System For Secondary Storage</a> (1965)
by Robert C. Daley and Peter G. Neumann. There are several things that I find
astounding about this&nbsp;paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were apparently no hierarchical file systems before Multics.
The references do no cite any previous work on this and I haven’t
found&nbsp;any.</li>
<li>Privacy in computing was a big consideration even back&nbsp;then.</li>
<li>Modern hierarchical file system are essentially unchanged from 1965,
but some features disappeared along the&nbsp;way.</li>
<li>There’s a <em>very</em> interesting backup system described in this&nbsp;paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper describes these concepts that we still use&nbsp;today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files.</li>
<li>Directories.</li>
<li>Root&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Working&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Tree name, i.e. the name of a file or directory in the tree
structure. Akin to&nbsp;realpath(3).</li>
<li>Path name, which is like a tree name, but it is conceptually
different because components can be links. The paper used <code>":"</code>
instead of <code>"/"</code> to separate&nbsp;directories.</li>
<li>Relative paths. They used an initial <code>":"</code> in place of <code>"./"</code> (or
empty) and <code>"*"</code> in place of <code>".."</code>. Instead of <code>"cd .."</code> you used
<code>"CHANGEDIRECTORY :*"</code>.</li>
<li>Symbolic&nbsp;links.</li>
<li>Access control using access control lists (showed up relatively
recently in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>).</li>
<li>Read, execute and write modes on files and directories. Execute
on a directory means permission to search it, just as in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>.</li>
<li>Segments and segment numbers (file descriptions and file
descriptors, respectively, if I’m not&nbsp;mistaken).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is said that Unix took inspiration from Multics and simplified
things. What was lost? Whoever implemented the file system for Unix
stopped reading the paper somewhere around subsection 2.3. There are
at least these features we’re&nbsp;missing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Access control lists can define a <span>TRAP</span> for a user. Users can refuse
to use TRAPs and instead get an error. Otherwise TRAPs call a named
function at the time of the access. They can be used to implement
smart files that can e.g. monitor file usage or apply password-based
file&nbsp;locks.</p>
<p>(Someone will undoubtedly insert eBPF into the Linux <span>VFS</span> soon and we
will have invented TRAPs&nbsp;again).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multics fully separated the append mode and the write mode and made
it available to users. You could actually have files and
<em>directories</em> that were writable but not appendable, or appendable
but not writable (or&nbsp;both).</p>
<p>(Append-only <em>files</em> exist on Linux through file attributes settable
by the super user or processes with <code>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</code>. This is
very weak sauce. Immutable directories exist, but not append-only
directories. And of course there is no way to have a writable file
or directory that can’t&nbsp;grow).</p>
</li>
<li>Directory entries that point to secondary storage. <em>This is a game
changer for file system management.</em> More on this&nbsp;below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiple-level-storage-and-backups">Multiple-level storage and&nbsp;backups</h2>
<p>Files in the Multics file system could have directory entries that
point to a secondary storage medium. At the time the secondary media
were tapes, but today they could be mechanical hard drives, <span>USB</span> drives
or network servers. But what is the point of having a file that isn’t
there? It’s really quite clever and it only gets more clever the more
you look at&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>When a Multics system was running out of disk space it could remove
unused files from the primary medium, but keep the directory entries.</strong>
If you then tried to open such a file it would ask you to wait while
the file is being made available. It would issue instructions to the
operator (perhaps later a tape robot) to have them retrieve the
required tapes for restoring the file. Very useful when disks were
small and tapes were&nbsp;plentiful.</p>
<p>But it gets even better when you consider backups. Today if you need
to restore a Linux system from backups you do it this way: find the
oldest full backup and restore it, then restore each incremental
backup, going from oldest to newest. This means that the system can’t
be used until you’ve completely restored it from the backups. With
today’s disk sizes that could take a very, very long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Multics backups are done differently. To restore a completely hosed
system you first restore the system files, which will allow you to
boot. Then you restore the <em>latest</em> incremental backup. After this the
file system will contain the most current directory entries. <strong>Just
restore one incremental backup tape and all the files are already in
their right places. This is <em>much</em> faster than waiting for everything
to be&nbsp;restored!</strong></p>
<p>Why is only the latest incremental backup required to get everything
back in its place and working? The clever part is that the files might
not yet be on the disk. In fact, most files will probably be on
another backup medium. But the most recently used files have been
restored, so you can most likely do useful work already, and all other
files have their directory entries. If you try to open a file that
hasn’t been restored then you’re asked to wait and the operator is
told which tape to put in to get the file&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>Is something like this offered on <em>any</em> <span>POSIX</span>-compatible file&nbsp;system?</p>

<p>The Xerox Alto was also a system of many firsts. It is most famous for
having the first windowing <span>GUI</span>, which inspired Apple’s design, which
then inspired Microsoft’s design. Of course it had a hierarchical file
system with version numbers, and even a network file&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>I would like to highlight the interesting disk structure of the Alto
file system, which is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/an-open-operating-system-for-a-single-user-machine/">An Open Operating System for a Single-User Machine</a> (1979)
by Butler Lampson and Robert F.&nbsp;Sproull.</p>
<p>The designers of the system were concerned about data loss caused by
hardware issues and buggy software. They came up with a feature to
protect the user’s data against loss of any block on the disk. (Unless
the user data was in that lost block, of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>All blocks on the disk have a label that contains these&nbsp;fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>A file&nbsp;identifier</li>
<li>A version&nbsp;number</li>
<li>A page number (block&nbsp;index)</li>
<li>A&nbsp;length</li>
<li>A next link (pointer to the next block in the&nbsp;file)</li>
<li>A previous&nbsp;link</li>
</ul>
<p>The label means that each block is self-identifying. By my count this
type of disk had an additional 14 bytes of label per each 512 byte&nbsp;block.</p>
<p><strong>If the disk structure is damaged then a special program called the
<em>scavenger</em> will iterate over all blocks and recover the structure.</strong>
Contrast this to a file system like ext4 where a damaged structure can
mean that huge swathes of data are rendered&nbsp;inaccessible.</p>
<p><strong>The scavenger was also used to upgrade the disk structure.</strong> Imagine
converting in-place between ext4, btrfs or <span>ZFS</span> by just running a
scavenger for the new disk structure. It would e.g. regard the
existing ext4 metadata as nonsense and build a new disk structure
based on btrfs by using the labels. (It will not work with these
specific file systems, but it demonstrates the&nbsp;principle).</p>
<p>Why don’t we have this today? Nobody wants to build a <span>POSIX</span> file
system that uses labels because the disks we’re using have 512-byte or
4096-byte blocks and no room for a label. A label would have a very
small overhead for each block, but even a very small overhead like
this is not acceptable to file system designers. More seriously, it
would mess up mmap(2). There are disks with slightly larger blocks
meant to store a label, but they are more expensive and not very
common. So we’re left with fragile file system structures and the sage
advice that you’re supposed to have backups anyway (for which, see
previous&nbsp;section).</p>
<p>The best modern alternative is something like Btrfs or <span>ZFS</span>. Blocks are
checksummed and those checksums are stored next to the pointers in the
disk structure. A modern version of the Alto file system should
certainly have checksums, but not using labels gives weaker
protections than what the Alto file system provided. If you want to
see how relevant the Alto file system design is today, just read what
using ZFS protects against, but then remember that it doesn’t use&nbsp;labels.</p>

<p>Hydra is another historical operating system with innovations in the
file system. It is described in the
paper
<a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/os/Qual/papers/hydra.pdf"><span>HYDRA</span>: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System</a> (1974)
by W. Wulf, E. Cohen, W. Corwin, A. Jones, R. Levin, C. Pierson, and
F. Pollack at Carnegie-Mellon&nbsp;University.</p>
<p>Hydra does away with the idea of ownership and a hierarchy of ever
more privileged components. It uses a fundamentally different concept
of protection and security than what <span>POSIX</span> is based&nbsp;on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Technologists like hierarchical structures – they are elegant; but
experience from the real world shows they are not viable security
structures. The problem, then, which <span>HYDRA</span> attempts to face
squarely, is to maintain order in a nonhierarchical&nbsp;environment.”</p>
<p>– <span>HYDRA</span>: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System&nbsp;(1974)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Resources that need protection, such as files, are called <em>objects</em>.
You can apply an <em>operation</em> to an object, such as reading or writing.
But to do so you need a reference to that object, which is called a
<em>capability</em>. You can even know a file’s identity, but without the
reference you can’t do&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>This is similar, but not identical, to a safe programming …</p></section></article></div></div></div>

As the next generation of the internet, the DWeb offers massive strides forward in terms of data autonomy, disaster and censorship resilience, performance, and speed — but for those who aren't yet familiar with it, using or building for the decentralized web can be time-consuming or difficult. Fleek's mission is to speed adoption of the DWeb by making it easier for everyone from dedicated developers to everyday internet users to create apps and store files in a decentralized paradigm, positioning them on the vanguard of a "low-code/no-code" movement of platforms, services, and development tools for users at all levels of coding experience.</p> <p>Fleek's product and service portfolio is built on the Fleek Stack of IPFS, <a href="https://textile.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Textile</a>, and <a href="https://filecoin.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filecoin</a>, and deployed via Fleek Edge — infrastructure that combines the distributed peer-to-peer data sharing protocol of IPFS with edge computing to create an exceptionally fast and reliable distributed network. On Fleek Edge, data and information are processed and stored at edge locations geographically close to users' requests, reducing latency for real-time data applications and improving the performance and speed of peer-to-peer interactions.</p> <p>Fleek's service offerings — hosting, storage, and their new Space Daemon suite of developer tools — all utilize Fleek Edge, and can be used on their own or together as needed to put the power of IPFS's decentralized storage architecture into the hands of everyone from everyday internet users looking for file storage to more experienced developers who need low-friction tools for building on IPFS. With Fleek, anyone and everyone can use IPFS to join the decentralized web. For the Fleek team, it's IPFS that makes the DWeb possible, and Fleek wants to make IPFS easier, faster, and more streamlined for everyone.</p> <h3 id="fleek-by-the-numbers"><a href="#fleek-by-the-numbers">#</a> Fleek by the numbers</h3> <div><div><p>&gt;8K</p> <p>IPFS site deployments</p></div><div><p>&gt;8K</p> <p>Fleek URLs and DNSLink records</p></div><div><p>99.99%</p> <p>guaranteed uptime on Fleek Edge</p></div><div><p>150+</p> <p>global Fleek Edge locations</p></div></div> <h2 id="the-story"><a href="#the-story">#</a> The story</h2> <p>Fleek started life as Terminal.co with a simple mission: Build tools that make using the Dweb easier for everyone in order to fuel a faster, more seamless transition from the centralized web of today to the decentralized web of the future. To that end, the team originally launched with a focus on user-friendly tools for building decentralized apps (dapps) interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.</p> <p>But Fleek soon realized that starting with dapps was putting the cart before the horse. Not only is building for dapps and smart contracts a specialized market, but these products themselves are only ever as decentralized as the storage architecture upon which they rely. To truly guide the web's transition to a decentralized future, the team needed a broader approach. That's when Fleek turned to IPFS as the technology that would help them make their vision a reality.</p> <div><p><strong>"We saw that the fastest, simplest, and most direct way to advance the decentralized web is to equip ordinary web users with the tools they need to access and build on IPFS. IPFS offers the data integrity, privacy, and security that we think matter most for the future of the DWeb. And with the right tools, we knew we could give a full hosting experience and seamless workflow — making IPFS as easy to use as a standard website today."</strong></p> <p><em>— Brett Shear, COO, Fleek</em></p></div> <p>The Fleek team decided to pursue a new company direction, with a product roadmap geared toward boosting the accessibility of IPFS-based hosting, storage, and database management. That decision spurred development of an entirely new platform — the Fleek Stack of IPFS, Textile, and (after mainnet launch) Filecoin — with a debut in early 2020.</p> <p>Fleek currently offers three products built on the Fleek Stack, each intended to enhance and streamline the workflow around common DWeb use cases:</p> <ul><li><strong>Fleek Hosting:</strong> Tools for hosting sites and apps on IPFS, including industry-familiar continuous integration and deployment tooling via GitHub.</li> <li><strong>Fleek Storage:</strong> A service for importing, storing, pinning, and fetching files via IPFS that includes a friendly UI in addition to API and CLI interfaces.</li> <li><strong>Space Daemon:</strong> A developer toolset for building peer-to-peer encrypted apps that packages IPFS, Textile Threads and Buckets, and Filecoin into a single JavaScript interface.</li></ul> <p>Each of these products is designed to facilitate IPFS use and integration in as streamlined a manner as possible. Space Daemon, for example, makes it simple for users to leverage IPFS for encrypted database storage and serverless app development. Fleek's hosting and storage offerings automatically handle the IPFS-specific details by auto-updating references to content identifiers (CIDs), TXT values in DNS records, and more.</p> <p>In creating this streamlined workflow for using, building upon, and deploying to IPFS, Fleek empowers developers to integrate the protocol's key benefits — such as peer-to-peer functionality, serverless interactions, and autonomy from centralized hosting — into their sites, products, and apps. What's more, the Fleek Edge network provides significant performance and efficiency boosts that anyone from DWeb newcomers to IPFS veterans can benefit from.</p> <p>In short, Fleek's portfolio offers wide-ranging functionality and a bridge between the legacy web and the DWeb, facilitating many valuable use cases across the end-user and developer space. "One of the biggest barriers to adoption of IPFS by the broader web community is unfamiliarity with the manual work involved in hosting or building on IPFS," says Shear. "Fleek takes care of that work on its own, which ensures that anyone who wants the benefits of hosting their website on IPFS can get them easily and quickly. But even experienced devs can benefit from the ease of use and faster speeds they get with Fleek products deployed on Fleek Edge."</p> <h2 id="ipfs-benefits"><a href="#ipfs-benefits">#</a> IPFS benefits</h2> <p>Fleek chose IPFS because it decentralizes two of the core aspects of the internet: file storage and data transfer. Combined with the inherent advantages of IPFS content addressing and IPFS's position as a fundamental technology in Filecoin, this opens up a host of benefits not available elsewhere:</p> <ul><li><strong>Data integrity in a peer-to-peer world:</strong> Fleek uses IPFS in combination with encryption tools like Textile's, enabling them to offer a best-of-both-worlds paradigm where users get the benefits of client-side encryption (through user-owned keys) as well as the ability to share data directly without touching any third-party servers. Because the transport is encrypted by default, external watchers can't view it in transit, and IPFS's <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">content addressing</a> also ensures that the data a user receives when they make a request is cryptographically verified as the data they asked for.</li> <li><strong>Censorship and disaster reslilience:</strong> IPFS content addressing allows for multiple copies of the same content-addressed resource to exist as equivalent items in multiple locations worldwide. This can offer the potential for a degree of resilience against physical disaster or censorship unavailable on the legacy web.</li> <li><strong>Integrated access to future storage and retrieval markets:</strong> Because IPFS and Filecoin are so tightly integrated, building on IPFS will facilitate the ability to offer Fleek users a seamless way to access the Filecoin marketplace for their storage needs.</li></ul> <p>Additionally, IPFS's vibrant and active community of developers means that the protocol is constantly evolving to better meet the needs of its users and builders.</p> <h2 id="how-fleek-uses-ipfs"><a href="#how-fleek-uses-ipfs">#</a> How Fleek uses IPFS</h2> <p>Fleek creates a simple, streamlined workflow for anyone looking to host, share, or build content on the decentralized web. Fleek provides its own public IPFS gateway, which means that developers don't need to build their own in order to serve their users. The gateway allows even IPFS-ignorant legacy web browsers and apps to access content provided via IPFS.</p> <p>Fleek also automates the process of building and deploying on IPFS. Developers who use Fleek for site and app deployments don't need to do anything except link Fleek with a GitHub repo, and Fleek will automatically build and deploy their code via IPFS.</p> <p>So, what does that look like in action? Since IPFS uses content addressing, every piece of content on IPFS needs its own unique content identifier (CID). This CID is updated with every change to the content with which it is associated. For developers, keeping up with these updates can be a hassle, since it would normally involve manually updating CID pointers or implementing other downstream changes to match a new CID.</p> <p>Fleek handles all that manual work on its own. In the case of a website, Fleek automatically takes the CID generated by IPFS for the site content and points it to a Fleek subdomain URL, using a TXT record added to the DNS settings Fleek creates for the site. Whenever anyone visits that Fleek URL, the most recently associated CIDs are delivered to the user via Fleek's HTTP IPFS gateway — meaning that a request that starts with an HTTP request (such as a legacy web browser) remains HTTP throughout. And any time site content changes, Fleek automatically detects the new hash and re-associates the TXT record accordingly.</p> <p>In short, a developer on Fleek can use familiar tools and workflows without worrying about the manual work that might normally go into using IPFS — while still taking advantage of the benefits provided by the decentralized web.</p> <h3 id="the-tooling"><a href="#the-tooling">#</a> The tooling</h3> <p>At the core of all of Fleek's offerings are <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>go-ipfs</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>ipfs-http-client</code></a>, used out of the box. Nodes on <code>go-ipfs</code> appear throughout the Fleek ecosystem, including:</p> <ul><li>Pinning nodes used by Fleek Hosting and Fleek Storage</li> <li>Nodes for encrypted backups</li> <li>Space Daemon-specific nodes (behind Textile Hub)</li></ul> <p>Platform-wide,…</p></div></div>

        <blockquote><p>Perhaps you are a skilled technologist. But beware: If your personality is as scintillating as a dish rag, you could jeopardize your open source projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8935389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent study</a>, a developer’s personality could significantly impact their contributions to open source projects. The researchers at the University of Waterloo found that social factors, including experience, remain the most influential factors in whether a contributor’s work is accepted or rejected. But the study also found that personality traits play a key role in how their work is perceived.</p>
<p>“People who voluntarily work on open source projects need to be aware of how open they are to change and how conscientious they are, as these two personality traits will impact how willing people are to work with them,” says Meiyappan Nagappan, a professor in Waterloo’s David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science and a co-author of the study, <a href="https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=256663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in&nbsp; a statement.</a></p>
<p>Nobody works in a vacuum. A person’s behavior comes out <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-good-qa-director-and-a-great-one/">when they interact with other people</a>, whether it’s in person, in a Slack channel, or in code comments. Software development often involves <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/4-lessons-software-teams-can-learn-from-rock-bands/">creating a team where it’s comfortable and safe to share ideas</a>. As the researchers note, it’s not enough to complete a task; developers also need to listen and consider other people’s opinions with an open mind. In fact, some developers say, the more diverse personalities on a team, the better the end product.</p>
<p>The researchers collected their data from GitHub. They analyzed the personality traits of 16,935 active developers from 1,860 projects. Each developer had at least 250 pull requests, the process by which GitHub developers notify other open source contributors working on the same project that they completed a task.</p>
<p>The researchers then used the IBM Watson Personality Insights to retrieve the big five personalities of the software developers in GitHub: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.</p>
<p>“We found that social factors are still more important than technical factors in getting your open source work accepted,” says Alex Yun, a master’s student in Waterloo’s faculty of mathematics and another study co-author, in a statement.</p>
<p>The researchers also examined the importance of personality factors. They found that biases may be involved in the acceptance or rejection of open source work. That’s true despite the apparent advantage of open source whereby you can contribute with a level of anonymity; your persona shows in your code and comments. Someone reviews and comments on your work based on what they see in front of them, and not how they know you as a person.</p>
<p>“Managers are more likely to accept a contribution from someone they know, or someone more agreeable than others – even though the technical contribution might be similar,” Yun says.</p>
<h3>Developers are not surprised</h3>
<p>People who work in the open source community agree with the research findings.</p>
<p>“If your work is being reviewed and you immediately shoot down any suggestions made by others, I could then foresee this negatively impacting the views of the decision makers who merge your work,” observes Matthew Arnold, a senior software engineer at global call intelligence provider <a href="https://www.infinity.co/us/">Infinity</a>.</p>
<p>“What’s the adjective for the furthest thing from ‘surprised’? Because whatever that word is describes my reaction to this research finding,’’ says VM (Vicky) Brasseur, an open source leader, speaker, and author of the book, <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/vbopens/forge-your-future-with-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forge Your Future With Open Source.</a> “While the research phrases it academically as ‘personality,’ what they mean is someone’s ability to interact with others: <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">the application of social interaction skills</a> as well as technical skills.”</p>
<p>Those with an extroverted personality likely find it easier to hit “submit” when sending pull requests to open source repositories, Arnold adds. “By submitting this pull request, you’re agreeing to let the internet community review and judge your work. That can be quite daunting, especially when open source projects often attract some of the finest minds in the industry.’’</p>
<p>To some degree, each of us can assess our own capabilities – for good or ill. Arnold’s personality falls into the introverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging (INTJ) personality type within the Myers-Briggs personality assessment. He considers himself to be open and conscientious. But we may see ourselves with a different perspective than do outsiders.</p>
<p>Personality traits have <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">some impact on software development</a>, but social factors are more influential, says Dawn Foster, director of <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource">Open Source Community Strategy</a> &nbsp;at VMware. “In my experience, the social factors have had a bigger impact on my ability to successfully contribute to open source projects.”</p>
<p>Foster describes herself as “primarily conscientious with a bit of agreeableness,” which she says has served her well because &nbsp;she is usually prepared and detail oriented. This “allows people to feel more comfortable relying on me to perform my duties.” Being agreeable helps her empathize with others and make them feel welcome, she says.</p>
<h3>Social factors carry more weight</h3>
<p>Both Foster and Brasseur agree with the Waterloo study finding that social factors are more influential on the likelihood of pull request acceptance of contributions into open source projects.</p>
<p>“Open source communities often feel like very small worlds where I keep running into the same people over and over again,’’ Foster explains. “My past social interactions in previous communities have helped smooth the way for my participation in new ones.”</p>
<p>For example, when Foster started contributing to Kubernetes, she wanted to help out with the Contributor Summit. Because she had worked with several of the organizers on other projects who could vouch for her work, it was relatively easy for her to get involved as an organizer despite being relatively new to the project.</p>
<p>Another example the <a href="https://chaoss.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHAOSS Project</a> where Foster eventually joined its governing board. “Because many of the existing board members and maintainers knew of my past work on open source project health metrics, it allowed me to participate in meaningful ways much more quickly than I might have if I didn’t have those previous social interactions,” Foster says.</p>
<p>Brasseur points out that social interaction is critical not just to a successful open source contribution – but to any endeavor that involves more than one person.</p>
<p>“Collaboration is difficult if not impossible when people aren’t able to interact well, whether due to personal skills, language differences, or some other obstruction,’’ Brasseur says. “We in open source have abundant documentation about the technical aspects of contributing, such as <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/16-things-that-testers-wished-theyd-learned-earlier/">writing tests</a> or the mechanics of sending your contribution for review, but relatively little about the social expectations for that contribution.”</p>
<p>Projects don’t necessarily ignore the social expectations, Brasseur adds. “It’s simply that they rarely document them.”</p>
<p>Like Foster, Arnold says that being open, conscientious, and agreeable has benefited him professionally. These traits have helped him to “gel well with teammates, which to me is a massive benefit.” But, he adds, “I have to be careful, however, that I don’t let this cloud my judgement when receiving feedback around changing how I have done something. I need to make sure I’m not too quick to go with what makes the other person happy.”</p>
<p>The result is a willingness to accept suggestions that go against his initial view. “My impediments tend to come from a lack of extroversion along with levels of neuroticism,” Arnold says, “making experiences such as presenting and training a lot more stressful and anxiety inducing than they necessarily need be.”</p>
<p>Don’t expect arguments. Most developers are agreeable! “The times that I see a pull request being hindered most by personality are when you have a small pool of developers reviewing the work,” Arnold says. In those cases, “The author is implementing review comments without really critiquing the suggestions, which can sometimes cause a reduced level of quality.”</p>
<h3>Being a good communicator speaks volumes</h3>
<p>Someone who is a good communicator always is in demand. <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/so-you-want-to-become-a-software-qa-professional/">Employers are always looking for that soft skill</a> in candidates across industries, says Lusen Mendel, director of developer relations at <a href="https://karat.com/">Karat</a>, which conducts technical interviews for organizations hiring developers.</p>
<p>“Just as <a href="https://www.functionize.com/acceptance-testing-a-step-by-step-guide/">we validate software correctness with tests</a>, it often takes bouncing ideas off a peer to validate the degree of our own understanding and the effectiveness of our insights,’’ Mendel says. “Being a good, concise communicator lets developers quickly identify what information is salient to specific brainstorms, decisions, and open source projects.”</p>
<p>In virtually every interview Karat conducts,&nbsp;regardless of what they were&nbsp;supposed to be evaluating, “Interviewers inevitably tell the hiring manager how the candidate communicated,’’ he notes.</p>
<h3>More change is needed</h3>
<p>While he is not a developer, Jack Wallen, who has covered open source for decades as a journalist, finds that “Developers are very much like artists, in that they can be very sensitive to criticism and place a very high value not only on their work, but on the acceptance of both their work and who they are.”</p>
<p>Many developers pride themselves on their individuality and tend to hold that trait very dear, Wallen says. “That can translate to either being very satisfied with a project, when they and their work are accepted – or walking away when they are not.”</p>
<p>For Wallen, there is another longstanding issue in the development community that needs to be addressed. “It’s become clear that there needs to be significant improvement in the way the development community treats people of color, women, and members of the LGBTQ community,” he says. “At this point, there must be a zero tolerance for unwanted or unequal treatment.”</p>
<p>Wallen says he knows very talented developers who have been affected by this. “And …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>Nobody wakes up in the morning excited to deal with a SOC 2 audit, but completing one will help your company grow and close larger deals faster. SOC 2 covers <em>a lot</em>, and it’s not just an engineering checkmark - but if you’re a developer at a not-huge company going through SOC 2 compliance, chances are you’ll need to get involved. This guide will cover everything you need to know from a technical perspective, from basic access controls to encrypting data at rest. <em>‍</em></p><p><em>(Note: this guide is NOT a comprehensive assessment of what you’ll need to pass SOC 2 compliance, nor is it legal advice. The goal here is just to help developers understand what they’ll need to do to make sure that tech and infrastructure aren’t holding things up.)</em></p><h2>What SOC 2 is and why it's important</h2><p><em>SOC 2</em> is a certification – an objective third party checking your company out – developed by the AICPA, one of the big “governing bodies” of accountants in the U.S (riveting, I know). The way it works is that you hire an auditor to investigate how secure and trustworthy your company is, fill in any holes they identify, and then they certify you as SOC 2 compliant. Once you’ve passed an audit, you can display the SOC 2 logo on your site, tell your customers and leads that you’re compliant, and close those bigger deals. </p><p>The important thing about SOC 2 is that it’s not just a stamp for giant enterprises - like <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">SSO</a> and <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-directory-sync-scim">Directory Sync</a>, even fast growing startups are starting to require more advanced security measures before engaging with vendors. And as we’ll see in a bit, most of what you’ll need to work on to be SOC 2 compliant overlaps a lot with engineering best practices anyway. So if you’re considering whether SOC 2 compliance is worth it for your company, it might be a realistic fit earlier than you think - and help you stand out to potential customers.</p><p>Now if you’re thinking that SOC 2 implies the existence of a SOC 1, you’d be right, but SOC 1 is a lot less popular among SaaS startups. It’s generally a lower lift certification and doesn’t meet the security requirements that those larger deals are looking for. There’s also a SOC 3, but same story here - generally not the focus for the customers you’re trying to woo. SOC 2 is the big one.</p><p>So what exactly are these auditors looking for? What makes your company SOC 2 compliant? The answer, weirdly enough, is that criteria are subjective and company-specific - the auditor you work with will put together a plan. Generally, they’re looking for a few things:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>There’s quality <strong>oversight of the company</strong> as a whole (performance reviews, independent voices, background checks, etc.)</li><li>The <strong>SDLC</strong> (software development lifecycle) is transparent, trackable, and controlled (issue tracking, unit testing, version control, etc.)</li><li>Your <strong>application and underlying infrastructure</strong> are secure and monitored (encryption, logging, APM, vulnerability scans, etc.)</li><li>You’ve implemented <strong>access controls</strong> for internal services and SaaS (de-provisioning accounts, 2FA, malware detection, etc.)</li></ul><p>If a lot of these examples look familiar to you, it’s because you’ve probably already implemented them. The good news about SOC 2 is that as it relates to engineering, the requirements are generally pretty agreeable and a lot of modern SWE orgs already have issue tracking, review pipelines, vulnerability checks, and a good amount of the remaining checks auditors will be looking for. </p><p>We’ll dive into the SDLC, app and infrastructure, access controls, and then take a look at how you can save time with pre-built software like <a href="https://www.vanta.com/">Vanta</a> that takes care of a lot of the annoying work you need to do for SOC 2, like policy generation.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>The SDLC</strong>‍</h2><p>Your auditor will put together a list of concrete checks that you’ll need to either (a) provide evidence that you’ve already done, or (b) get started on doing. Again - this is not a comprehensive list, but it should help you get started and think about what auditors will be looking for.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Issue Tracking</strong>‍</p><p>Any “issues” that relate to the core business - new features, products, bugs, vulnerabilities, etc. - should be tracked. There are a hundred ways to do this - if you’re at a bigger company you’re probably using <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a>, the cool kids are using <a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a>, and there’s also <a href="https://clubhouse.io/">Clubhouse</a>, <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub Issues</a>, and many many more. The auditors are just looking to make sure known problems don’t slip through the cracks, and when a problem arises it’s dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.<br></p><figure id="w-node-361755762ee0-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f4fb0d32ee58930e6b6eb82_image%20(6).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>They might ask for a sample of your tracked issues over a given time period. You’ll save yourself a bunch of time down the road by finding a way to link commits and PRs to specific tickets, e.g. via a naming convention (BUG-453-fix-broken-dropdown).<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Change Testing and Review Cycles</strong>‍</p><p>Auditors will be looking for documented policies that govern how you track, test, approve, and validate changes to your core application. Now ideally if you’re reading this, you’re not pushing directly to master - you’ve got a staging environment set up and a pull request process with required reviewers. Internal documentation might suffice here, but you’ll probably need to generate a policy (something Vanta can help with - more on that later).</p><p>If you’re working via a monorepo, building foolproof review cycles is pretty easy (it’s just a setting in GitHub). But if you’ve got a bunch of repositories all constantly changing, they should all ideally require reviews before merging in changes. Even if there’s only one engineer pushing code, laptops can get lost or stolen, and auditors will want to see that extra security to bestow the SOC 2 stamp.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Application and infrastructure</strong></h2><p>Here, auditors are trying to verify that your app is generally reliable, trackable, and that you fix things quickly when they come up. Again - all things that you probably already care about.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Encryption</strong>‍</p><p>You’ll generally want to encrypt customer data at rest, and make sure that sensitive requests (especially if they’re auth or customer data related) are encrypted in transit/motion (e.g. HTTPS). Ideally your site and app have SSL enforced, your certificate isn’t expired (duh), and there aren’t any known issues. Some auditors will also require an encryption policy that describes your company’s approach to encryption.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ APM / Monitoring</strong>‍</p><p>To be SOC 2 compliant, you’ll need to set up a basic application monitoring system, either in house or via a vendor like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>. Auditors will also be interested in <em>what you do with this information</em> - how often is there downtime? How quickly does it get resolved? You might need to provide screenshots of outage statistics via your APM tool, and evidence that you resolved the issue via your issue tracking software. These usually come in the form of a post mortem / analysis and remedy of the root cause.</p><p>It’s not a given, but some auditors will specifically require that you set up a Load Balancer to handle traffic, and monitor that Load Balancer as well as your core app.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Logging and Backups</strong>‍</p><p>Auditors will be looking for centralized logging from your app into a secure spot, via something custom like flat files, Elasticsearch, or an out of the box setup like Heroku (if you’re running on PaaS). You might be asked for daily backups - auditors are generally more concerned with your app’s data than your app itself, so if you’re using something like RDS, you can rely on their backup to S3 feature.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Vulnerabilities</strong>‍</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this is a major focus of the audit process, even if it’s not a common day-to-day occurrence. Auditors are basically looking for 3 major things here:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>There’s a safe way for anyone (literally, anyone) to notify your company of vulnerabilities</li><li>Your team is proactively checking for vulnerabilities via review meetings and software</li><li>When a vulnerability gets uncovered, your team fixes it </li></ol><p>You’ll want to set up an email inbox for disclosing vulnerabilities (e.g. <a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#41322422343328353801362e332a2e326f222e2c"><span data-cfemail="41322422343328353801362e332a2e326f222e2c">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>), put together a policy for how you handle incident response, and (if relevant) provide evidence that you’ve resolved any major vulnerabilities (i.e. a post-mortem). Auditors will also look for proactive vulnerability scanning. If you’re running on managed infrastructure like Heroku, they do a lot of that for you. GitHub will also <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies">notify you of any dependencies with known vulnerabilities</a>.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Access controls / SaaS</strong></h2><p>This is where things get a bit tedious. In addition to your core infra (AWS or whatever cloud you’re using), chances are you’re using a bunch of SaaS like PagerDuty, Segment, GitHub, and the like, some cloud based and some (potentially) on prem. Auditors are looking for rigid access controls: only relevant team members should have access to customer data and applications, and access needs to be revoked when employees leave the company.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Core Infrastructure Access</strong>‍</p><p>Auditors will be looking for even stricter controls when it comes to managing core infra. In practice, this means a robust IAM setup in AWS (or your cloud provider of choice) with clear lines between admins and non-admins, and a review process for adding new folks to the organization. You might need to prove that review via a screenshot of someone asking permission, or something along those lines.</p><p>As part of this review, you’ll probably end up needing to remove users from accounts that they previously had access to. Early on in the company lifecycle things are pretty free rein, but auditors will want to make sure that if you have no business querying the warehouse, you’re not on BigQuery.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ De-provisioning Users</strong>‍</p><p>If an employee leaves the company or gets terminated, their access to all company accounts - infrastructure, SaaS, any anything else - needs to be revoked, and auditors will often look for this to happen within one business day of the employee’s last day with the company. You’ll probably need to do this manually for the first couple of years in the company lifecycle, but eventually you’ll want to <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-directory-sync-scim">set up Directory Sync so computers can do it for you</a>.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ MFA</strong>‍</p><p>Any method for accessing customer data needs to be protected by (at least) …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/how-metrics-lead-to-effective-sprint-retrospectives" data-title="How Metrics Lead to Effective Sprint Retrospectives">
<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective">Atlassian’s playbook</a>, it states that Sprint Retrospective’s goal is to&nbsp;<em>identify how to improve teamwork by reflecting on what worked, what didn’t, and why.</em>&nbsp;Usually, the meeting consists of brainstorming what the team did well and what the team needs to do better.</p>



<p>During my journey, I’ve been in many of these meetings, sometimes participating, sometimes facilitating. I’ve noticed that writing down post-its is painful for some people. When everybody is speaking, engineers get stuck and can’t think of anything else during the meeting.</p>



<p>Then, right after the meeting is over, many situations and problems emerge. They would like to discuss those topics. However, they wait a couple of weeks for the next meeting. Rarely they remember the issue. I don’t think the meeting gets as effective as it could.</p>



<p>To increase effectiveness, I think managers should promote a culture in which people raise their hands when the problems occur. They should discuss as soon and fresh in their mind as possible.</p>



<p>If the issue needs a more extended discussion, the team can add it to Evernote, Notion, GitHub Gist, or any other shareable document. A couple of sentences telling the problem with a little context would do the job.</p>



<p>The team can do the same as what did well. More post-its may pop up during the meeting. Then, the Scrum Master or facilitator can read the document.</p>



<p>When the meeting starts, the team already has a list of essential items to discuss. It saves time and makes it more productive.</p>



<p>So, how can teams make Sprint Retrospective meetings even more effective?</p>

<h2>Using Pull Request Lead Time &amp; Throughput in Sprint Retrospectives</h2>



<p>I’ve been talking about <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/software-engineering-kpis-how-to-choose-the-best-fitting-metrics">Pull Request Lead Time and Throughput</a> for a while. If you’re familiar with the term Cycle Time, I recommend reading my article on why&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/why-you-should-use-lead-time-instead-of-cycle-time">I rather use Lead Time instead of Cycle Time</a>.</p>



<p>To be explicit, in this article, Pull Request Lead Time measures how many days a Pull Request takes to be merged, and Throughput is the number of merged Pull Requests.</p>



<p>These two metrics can truly help teams to understand how they are performing. Besides, teams benefit from them when they look for the variability along the weeks. The data bring valuable insights and allow teams to question their decisions.</p>



<p>Let me explain through an example.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="654" height="295" src="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24.png" alt="" srcset="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24.png 654w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24-300x135.png 300w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24-300x135@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px"><figcaption>Lead Time and Throughput – Chart provided by SourceLevel</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I took this chart as an example. Let’s say we’re back in January 2020. We’ve started the Sprint Retrospective creating post-its for the team’s issues and appraisals during the last weeks of December 2019.</p>



<p>We’ve discussed a bit, and now someone shares the chart above to analyze the Pull Request Lead Time and Throughput.</p>



<p>If the sprint is two-weeks long, we could use the metrics to ask ourselves questions like this:</p>



<ul><li>Why did we merge less Pull Requests in the week of Dec 2nd compared to Nov 25th?</li><li>What did we do in the week of Nov 25th that allowed us to merge more Pull Requests than the last few Sprints?</li><li>Why did the Lead Time increase in the week of Dec 2nd?</li></ul>



<p>Asking this kind of question is fundamental. However, nobody should point fingers or blame other people. That’s not healthy nor effective.</p>



<p>I would expect answers like this:</p>



<ul><li>We merged less Pull Requests in the last week because we had a massive refactoring going on.</li><li>In the Week of Nov 25th, we fixed several small bug fixes that popped up after deploying a problematic feature in the week before.</li><li>The Lead Time increased because everyone held their reviews, and we made a task force to merge the refactoring.</li></ul>



<p>The numbers themselves don’t matter as much as the story behind them. Now it’s time to ask what are learnings from the last iteration. Here are some alternatives to address those issues:</p>



<ul><li>Should we avoid massive refactorings because they slow down everyone? Should we make it part of the team’s guidelines?</li><li>Deploying complex features may lead to a higher escaped bugs rate. How to minimize the impact? Should we invest more effort into testing? Should we deliver smaller changes? Should we adopt a more incremental approach? Should we consider a gradual rollout?</li><li>Was the task force an effective strategy? Maybe fewer people working on the refactoring at the same time ships it faster.</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, the data allow teams to derive relevant aspects for the Retrospective. The discussion is a tremendous source of knowledge and should generate insights for improving the development flow.</p>



<h2>In short</h2>



<p>Sprint Retrospectives can be more effective using metrics. The team can extract valuable knowledge by questioning the Pull Request Lead Time and Throughput. Indeed, other metrics are useful, as well.</p>



<p>The crucial point is to use the metrics to distill tacit knowledge and formalize it. What went well and what went wrong should promote changes in the process, feed guidelines, and motivate new practices.</p>



<p>That’s what an effective Sprint Retrospective is about, in my opinion.</p>

September 8, 2020 | https://tomgamon.com/posts/a-losers-game/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tomgamon.com/posts/a-losers-game/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.empirical.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the_losers_game.pdf">this essay</a> which discusses changes in investment strategy in the 1970’s. In it, Charles Ellis talks about the difference between a <strong>winner’s game</strong> and a <strong>loser’s game</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Expert tennis is what I call a Winner’s Game because the ultimate outcome is determined by the actions of the winner. Victory is due to winning more points than the opponent wins – not, as we shall see in a moment, simply to getting a higher score than the opponent, but getting that higher score by winning points.</p><p>Amateur tennis, Ramo found, is almost entirely different. Brilliant shots, long and exciting rallies and seemingly miraculous recoveries are few and far between. On the other hand, the ball is fairly often hit into the net or out of bounds, and double faults at service are not uncommon. The amateur duffer seldom beats his opponent, but he beats himself all the time. The victor in this game of tennis gets a higher score than the opponent, but he gets that higher score because his opponent is losing even more points.</p><p>…</p><p>In other words, professional tennis is a <strong>Winner’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the winner – and amateur tennis is a <strong>Loser’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser.</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to talk about winning or losing in programming? What does success look like? I think that is a hard question, which could probably fill several blog posts, but I think a good working definition for us is “producing high quality code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, either by oneself or as part of a team, that helps to solve some problem for an end user”. Based on this definition, it seems to me that professional programming is somewhat of a losers game, at least for most of us.</p><p>I will concede that perhaps in fast moving startups, or for those involved in bleeding-edge research, there is an element of succeeding by “winning points”. Developing a faster algorithm, or determining some incredibly innovative way to implement a feature may help you succeed. However, I believe for a lot of professional programmers, succeeding comes from focusing on not “losing points” - causing bugs or producing unfathomable code, for example<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>When we consider programming with this in mind, it highlights the importance of some of the less glamorous elements of our field as a viable strategy for success. As you approach your next project, ask yourself, how can you avoid losing?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Which itself was taken from the work of Simon Ramo in his book <em>Extraordinary Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>By “high quality code” I mean code that is clean, understandable and that produces few bugs in normal operation. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote"><p>There has been some discussion on this piece on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iqctuy/programming_is_losers_game">lobste.rs</a> and it has highlighted a point that I need to clarify. I am not trying to claim that programming <em>is</em> a game, but rather it represents a scenario where we are working towards a goal, and perhaps one of the best strategies for achieving that goal is to avoid actions that frustrate your attempts to reach it. In tennis, that goal would be to win the match and a strategy you can pursue is to avoid hitting the net, rather than focussing on trying to outsmart your opponent with a clever backhand. For programmers, that goal may be to produce high quality software, and a strategy to pursue is to be extra careful to avoid bugs, rather than implement some very complex algorithm. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></section></div>]]>

<p>EC2 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html">instance profiles</a> allow you to attach an IAM role to an EC2 instance. This allows any application running on the instance to access certain resources defined in the role policies. Instance profiles are usually recommended over configuring a static access key as they are considered more secure and easier to maintain.</p>



<ol><li>Instance profiles do not require users to deal with access keys. There is one less secret to securely store and one less secret that can leak. </li><li>Instance profiles can be replaced or removed using EC2 API or in EC2 Console. There is no need to make your application configuration dynamic to change or revoke permissions.</li><li>Instance profiles, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">roles in general</a>, provide temporary credentials per-use. If those credentials leak, the damage is contained to their lifespan.</li></ol>

<p>But how does an application running on EC2 use this instance profile? Where do the credentials come from? How does this work without any application configuration change?</p>



<p>EC2 shares the credentials with the application through the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">metadata service</a>. Each instance can access this service through <code><a href="http://169.254.169.254/" rel="nofollow">http://169.254.169.254</a></code> (unless disabled) and EC2 will expose instance-specific information there. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html">exposed information</a> includes AMI id, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-add-user-data.html">user-data</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-identity-documents.html">instance id and IPs</a>, and more.</p>



<p>The instance profile credentials are exposed on <code><a href="http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/" rel="nofollow">http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/</a></code>. When you <code>curl</code> this URL on an EC2 instance, you will get the name of the instance profile attached to the instance. When you <code>curl</code> the same URL with the instance profile name at the end, you get the temporary credentials as JSON. The metadata service will return access key id, secret access key, a token, and the expiration date of the temporary credentials. Behind the scenes it is using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html">STS AssumeRole</a>.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="878" data-permalink="https://kichik.com/image-7/" data-orig-file="https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png" data-orig-size="1986,874" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-7" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=809" src="https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=1024 1024w, https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=150 150w, https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=300 300w, https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=768 768w, https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png 1986w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>All this data can be used to configure any application to use the role attached to the instance profile. You just have to be careful not to use it past the expiration date. You must also remember to check for new temporary credentials once the expiration date passes. If you are going to use these credentials manually, remember that the token is required. Normal user access keys don’t have a token, but temporary credentials require it.</p>



<p>To save you on <code>curl</code> calls and to automate this process further, all AWS SDKs check the instance profile for credentials first. As you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/e70cc1d46d9301cc12266c4666759de4afec9dbb/botocore/utils.py#L393-L446">source code</a>, this is exactly what the Python SDK, <a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore">botocore</a>, does to get credentials from the instance profile. In the end, everything just works as expected, and no application configuration is required.</p>

        <p>Content that ranks on Google's first page has an unfair advantage over those who don't.</p>
    
        <p>It attracts massive organic traffic without being promoted.</p>
    
        <p>One-third of all content pieces that I have written in the last ten months, rank on Google's first page. That's a 33% success rate in less than a year.</p>
    
        <p>In this post, I will share my process that you can use to publish content with a high probability of ranking on search engine.</p>

                            <p>
                                I write for SaaS founders and marketers. My audience love case studies.
                                I researched and wrote an analysis of
                                <a href="https://www.thoughtlytics.com/newsletter/notion-organic-growth-strategies">Notion's growth strategies</a>
                                that ranks #1 on Google for the search term 'notion growth' ahead of mighty TechCrunch, NYTimes, and Forbes.

                                Compared to my website, all other websites on this SERP have very high domain authority.
                                My post ranking above these sites busts the myth of domain authority being a constraint for
                                ranking on Google SERP.

                                A crucial step in the SaaS buying journey is prospects searching for product reviews.
                                Pythonanywhere is a web-hosting service for Python web apps, and I rank #1 in Google

                                I wrote this review before launching the Organic SaaS Growth (OSG) newsletter and had no audience at that time.
                                So, I published it on the Medium to leverage their distribution.

                                Growth loops have helped many internet businesses with compounding growth. There is a lot of
                                interest in growth loops among SaaS founders and marketers. I wrote the
                                <a href="https://www.thoughtlytics.com/newsletter/growth-loops">definitive guide to growth loops</a>
                                in May 2020, and it started ranking on Google's first page within two months
                                from its publication, competing head-to-head with the content published by some of the world's
                                most famous internet marketers.

                                I love Webflow's content and was curious about their growth strategies. So I researched and published a

                                on the strategies they have used for growth over the years. It is a recent post and
                                ranks on Google for the keyword 'webflow growth'.

                                Interestingly, I didn't do any keyword research for this post. I followed my curiosity and
                                wrote about all the growth strategies that I found working for Webflow.

                                I admire Zoom as a product and its founder Eric Yuan as an entrepreneur. Zoom is also one of
                                the fastest grown startups of this decade. It seemed to me that many SaaS founders would be
                                interested in learning about Zoom's growth strategies.
                            </p>

                                When I googled to learn about their growth strategies, all I found were blog posts talking
                                about top-level marketing stuff like being customer-driven and spending money on billboards,
                                nothing actionable. So, in

As opposed to more complicated honeypots looking at attacker behavior, I decided
to do something simple and was only interested in where they were coming from,
what tools might be in use, and what credentials they are attempting to use to
authenticate.  My dataset includes 929,554 attempted logins over a period of a
little more than 3 months.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a big surprise, I’ll go ahead and let you down easy: my
analysis hasn’t located any new botnets or clusters of attackers.  But it’s been
a fascinating project nonetheless.</p>

<h2 id="honeypot-design">Honeypot Design</h2>

<p>With a mere 200ish lines of Go, I implemented a honeypot server using the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh?tab=doc"><code>golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</code></a>
library as the underlying implementation.  I advertised a portable OpenSSH
version as the server version string (sent to clients on connection).  I then
logged each connection to a SQLite database, including the timestamp, IP
address, client version, and credentials used to (attempt to) authenticate.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-credentials">Analysis of Credentials</h2>

<p>In a surprise to absolutely nobody, <code>root</code> is by far the most commonly tried
username for login sessions.  I suspect there must be many attackers trying
lists of passwords with just <code>root</code> as the username, as 78% of attempted logins
were with username <code>root</code>.  None of the remainder of the top 10 are particularly
surprising, although <code>usuario</code> was not one I expected to see.  (It is Spanish
for <code>user</code>.)</p>

<p>Blank passwords are the most common attempted passwords, followed by other
obvious choices, like <code>123456</code> and <code>password</code>.  Just off the top 10 list was a
surprising choice of password: <code>J5cmmu=Kyf0-br8CsW</code>.  Interestingly, a Google
search for this password only finds other people with experience running
credential honeypots.  It doesn’t appear in any of the password wordlists I
have, including <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists</a> and
others.  If anyone knows what this is a password for, I’d love to know.</p>

<p>There were a number of other interesting passwords such as <code>7ujMko0admin</code>, used
for a bunch of networked DVRs, and also known to be used by malware attacking
IoT devices.  There are other passwords that don’t look obvious to a US-centric
view of the world, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>baikal</code> – a lake in Siberia</li>
  <li><code>prueba</code> – Spanish for test</li>
  <li><code>caonima</code> – a Mandarin profanity written in Pinyin</li>
  <li><code>meiyoumima</code> – Mandarin for “no password”</li>
  <li><code>woaini</code> – Mandarin for “I love you”</li>
  <li><code>poiuyt</code> – <strike>The name for an optical illusion also known as the "devil's tuning
fork"</strike> <strong>Edit:</strong> multiple redditors pointed out this is the begginning
of the top row of the keyboard from right to left.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also dozens and dozens of keyboard walks, like <code>1q2w3e</code>, <code>1qaz@WSX</code>,
and <code>!QAZ2wsx</code>.  There are many more that took me much longer to realize they
were keyboard walks, such as <code>4rfv$RFV</code> and <code>qpwoei</code>.</p>

<p>It has actually fascinated me to look at some of the less obvious passwords and
discern their background.  Many are inexplicable, but I assume they are from
hardcoded passwords in devices or something along those lines.  Or perhaps
someone let their cat walk across the keyboard to generate it.  I’ve certainly
had that experience.</p>

<p>Overall, the top 10 usernames and top 10 passwords (not necessarily together)
are:</p>

<p>Again, no real surprises here.  <code>ubnt</code> is a little bit higher than I would have
thought (for Ubiquiti networking gear) but I suppose there’s a fair bit of their
gear on the internet.  It’s interesting to see the mix of “lazy admin” and
“default credentials” here.  It’s <em>mildly</em> interesting to me that all substrings
of the first 10 digits (3 or longer) are included, <em>except</em> for 7 digits.  I
guess 7 digit passwords are less common?</p>

<h2 id="timing-information">Timing Information</h2>

<p>Though I imagine these kind of untargeted scans are long-term processes
continually running, I decided to check and see what the timing looked like
anyway.  Neither the day of week analysis nor the hour of day analysis look
like there’s any significant variance.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/days_of_week.png" alt="Day of Week">
<img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/hours.png" alt="Hour of Day"></p>

<p>Looking at the number of login requests over the time period where I’ve been
running the honeypots shows the traffic to be intermittent.  While I didn’t
expect the number to be constant, the variance is much higher than I expected.
I imagine a larger sample size and more nodes would probably make the results
more even.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/dates.png" alt="Day of Study"></p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-sources">Analysis of Sources</h2>

<p>So where are all of these requests coming from?  I want to start by noting that
<em>none</em> of my analysis is an attempt to attribute the actors making the requests
– that’s just not possible with this kind of data.  There’s two ways to look at
the source of requests – in terms of the network, and in terms of the (assumed)
geography.  My analysis relied on the IP to ASN and IP to Country data provided
by <a href="https://iptoasn.com/">iptoasn.com</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the country-level data, networks from China lead the pack by a long
shot (62% of all login attempts), followed by the US.</p>

<p>Again, I’m not claiming that these countries mean anything other than location
of the autonomous system (AS) that originates the requests.  I also did not do
individual IP geolocation, so the results should be taken with a small grain of
salt.</p>

<p>So what networks are sourcing this traffic?  I have the <a href="https://systemoverlord.com/static/attachments/gopot/asns.csv">full AS counts and

<p>Chinanet is no surprise given the high ratio of China in general.  OVH is a
low-cost host known to have liberal AUP, so is popular for both malicious and
research purposes.  DigitalOcean and Microsoft, of course, are popular cloud
providers.  Surprisingly, AWS only sourced about 600 connections, unless they
have a large number of IPs on a non-Amazon ASN.</p>

<p>Overall, traffic came from 27,448 unique IPv4 addresses.  Of those, more than 11
thousand sent only a single request.  At the other end of the spectrum, the top
IP source sent 64,969 login requests.</p>

<p>Most hosts sent relatively few requests, the large numbers are outliers:</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/ipcnts.png" alt="IP Count Graph"></p>

<p>Surely, by now a thought has crossed your mind: how many of these requests are
coming from Tor?  Surely the Tor network is a wretched hive of scum and villany,
and the source of much malicious traffic, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/tor.png" alt="Tor Graph"></p>

<p>Not at all.  Only 219 of the unique source IPs were identified as Tor exit
nodes, representing only 0.8% of the sources.  On a per-request basis, even a
smaller percentage of requests is seen from Tor exit nodes.</p>

<p>You know, I didn’t expect that.  <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> as the top
client strings.  (Also not sure what to make of the case difference.)  I wonder
if people are building the PuTTY SSH library into a tool for scanning or
wrapping the binary in some kind of script.</p>

<p>Go, paramiko, and libssh are less surprising, as they’re libraries designed for
integration.  It’s hard to know if the OpenSSH requests are linked into a
scanning tool or just wrapped versions of the SSH client.  At some point in the
future, I might dive more into this and trying to figure out which software uses
which libraries (at least for the publicly-known tools).</p>

found things that were much as expected – common usernames and passwords,
widespread scanning, large numbers of requests.  One thing’s for sure though:
connect it to the internet and someone’s going to pwn it.</p>

<p>Benjamin Disraeli, speaking in the House of Commons in 1872, said of then Prime Minister William Gladstone’s Cabinet: ‘Behold, a range of extinct volcanoes; not a flame flickers upon a single pallid crest.’ ‘Extinct volcanoes’ would be far too generous a phrase to describe the current crop of Western leaders – if political regimes could be said to decay from the head downwards, then we are in some trouble. The political scientist Wilfred Pareto said that leaders can be divided into two types – lions who are distinguished by their machismo and foxes who are distinguished by their intelligence. In world politics, the lions are on the rampage because the foxes have abandoned the public weal.</p>



<p>In America, the proportion of people who say that they trust government has fallen from about three-quarters in the early 1960s to less than a third today. Across the rest of the West, opinion is moving in the same direction if not quite as sharply.&nbsp;Governance has emerged as a central feature of the Covid-19 crisis: we have learnt that good government can make all the difference between living and dying. One problem with poor government is that it is self-sustaining. The lower government falls in public esteem the more likely it is that able people will shun it. And the more able people shun it the more government becomes a butt of jokes, even the object of outright contempt.</p>



<p>The problem of good government and leadership is nothing new. In the 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and early 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;centuries, England’s political system was known as ‘Old Corruption’ because it was so self-serving. An entrenched elite treated the state as a source of jobs and benefits. The state was so disconnected from the forces of industry and commerce that were transforming society that many liberals wanted to reduce government to a night-watchman.&nbsp;These tensions are never far away from the contemporary scene. Modern politicians routinely take up lucrative jobs in the private sector when they leave office – often working for the industries that they once regulated. Indeed,&nbsp;‘reciprocal nepotism’ is now so commonplace on Capitol Hill, with members of Congress giving jobs to the children of friends in return for their friends giving jobs to their children, that Melanie Sloan, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, comments: ‘Members of Congress basically are profit centres for their entire families’.</p>



<p>How did the Victorians shake themselves out of this cycle of decline? A cohort of reforming politicians and educators realised that a successful commercial society required a successful modern state. They suggested a solution: a collective immersion in the wisdom of Plato. They set about revitalising the patronage-ridden civil service and educational world by opening opportunities and jobs to competition.<strong> </strong>They treated Plato’s&nbsp;<em>Republic</em>  as a near deified talisman against&nbsp;the twin evils of self-indulgence and short-termism. In the present day, this spirit requires us to set down self-help guides and leadership manuals in favour of the same text that inspired the Victorians. Not only does Plato provide a comprehensive explanation of why a republic needs a leadership class, he also provides a guide to producing one.</p>



<p>The great philosopher’s starting point is that government&nbsp;<em>matters</em>. A republic is rather like a ship at sea, he says. Whether the ship can survive the ever-changing hazards that confront us – storms, pirates, jagged rocks – depends on the quality of the ship’s leadership. If the ship is well run, then at least it has a chance; if it is badly run, then it will flounder and everybody aboard will drown. What does being ‘well-run’ mean? Plato asks a simple question: should we give the job of steering the ship safely to the members of the crew at large, when they can’t agree on where they’re headed and most of them don’t know the rudiments of navigation? Or should we give it to a captain who has spent his entire life studying&nbsp;‘the seasons of the year, the sky, the stars, the winds and other professional subjects’?</p>



<p>The metaphor of the ship is a way of driving home Plato’s wider point about the importance of ‘guardians’. Plato argues that a successful republic is run by a class of people whose job it is to think about the long-term success of the polis. What threats are there on the horizon? What trade-offs do we need to make in order to ensure success? How might we be scuppered by known unknowns and unknown unknowns? Despite being an aristocrat, Plato argued that potential guardians – or men of gold as he described them – might occur in every class of society – and indeed might be women as well as men. If they are to escape decay, successful societies have to re-allocate leadership positions in each generation. The second job is to train the guardians through a prolonged education that involves not just academic education but also character-training designed to ensure that guardians put the public good above private interests. Morality is arguably even more important than intellect because the leaders possess so much power over everybody’s lives: if they are corrupt they will not only lead the country in the wrong direction – from the light to the darkness in Plato’s view – but will also set a model of corruption that the rest of society will only too happily follow.</p>



<p>If a society run by educated guardians is the best sort of society, in Plato’s view, a society run by the masses is the worst. Plato conceded that democracy is in many ways the most attractive form of society,&nbsp;because it combines the maximum of opportunity for the regular citizen with the maximum of freedom. But these attractions are purely superficial – democracy is like a ‘coat of many colours’, he says, that looks good when you see it in the market but turns out to be threadbare after you’ve worn it a couple of times. Voters invariably favour the short-term over the long-term and the exciting over the wise. And they are usually drawn towards bad leaders – demagogues who can weave wonderful fantasies about the state’s future but are really nothing more than charlatans, lying their way to power or buying votes with other people’s money. Plato was particularly scathing about aristocrat-demagogues who enjoy the advantage of the best education that money can buy but nevertheless prefer to pander to the mob rather than to guide it to the light.</p>



<p>Democracy’s fetishisation of freedom inevitably gives way to anarchy. Fathers pander to their sons, teachers to their pupils, humans to animals, and ‘the minds of the citizens become so sensitive that the least vestige of restraint is resented as intolerable’. Anarchy produces class struggle, as the poor attack the rich and the rich retaliate; class struggle produces war and disorder. When all this becomes intolerable the masses will turn to a dictator who can restore order.</p>



<p>If tyrants are the unavoidable consequence of democracy, they are also the antithesis of philosopher kings. They regard power as an end in itself rather than a means to an end, and they are governed by their passions rather than their reason. Thus the paradox at the heart of tyranny: even though tyrants have absolute power over other people, they have no power over themselves. Slaves to their own passions – ‘ill-governed’ in their own souls as Plato puts it – they use their positions to inflict those passions on the entire population. A tyranny is a psycho-drama in which everyone is caught up in the tyrant’s raging ego.</p>



<p>Many of Plato’s suggestions for producing successful guardians strike us today as at the minimum bizarre.&nbsp;He believed that the guardians should be banned from getting married or owning private property in order to focus their minds on the common good. He was so keen on producing the best guardians that he advocated eugenic breeding programmes (guardians would be compensated for not getting marred by being allowed to participate in regular orgies with women selected for their brains and beauty). But even if he was far-fetched in his solutions, he was right in the problems that he identified. Guardians will cease to be guardians if they put themselves and their families among the public good, degrading public offices and turning the people against them.</p>



<p>William Gladstone, the greatest liberal reformer of the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, believed that, if the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century was the age of the rule of prerogative, and the 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century one of rule by patronage, the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century should be ruled by virtue, and Plato was to be the new age’s guiding force.</p>



<p>Gladstone was so fluent in Classical Greek that, in 1858, he gave a speech to the inhabitants of the Ionian Islands (a British protectorate) in the language. Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby and the greatest school reformer of his age, adopted many of Plato’s signature ideas: that education was as much about shaping character as shaping intellect; that group loyalty should trump individual self-expression; and that physical education was as important as book learning. The two most influential civil servants of the age, Charles Trevelyan and Cyril Northcote, abolished patronage in the civil service and introduced open competition in order specifically to promote the rule of a Platonic ‘natural aristocracy’.</p>



<p>Benjamin Jowett, the master of Balliol from 1870 until his death in 1893, devoted his life to two great projects: producing a definitive edition of Plato&nbsp;and turning his college into a production line for Platonic guardians. Though he failed at his first task – his edition of&nbsp;<em>The Republic</em>&nbsp;was only completed after his death by his friend and biographer Lewis Campbell – he succeeded spectacularly at the second. Balliol became the leading educational institution in the empire.&nbsp;Jowett’s pupils included Lord Curzon, a future viceroy of India, Lord Grey, a future foreign secretary, Herbert Asquith, a future prime minister, Cosmo Gordon Lang, a future archbishop of Canterbury and Charles Gore, a future …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As a startup founder, I frequently receive questions from friends, family, acquaintances, about how this mysterious fundraising process works. In short, <a href="https://www.startups.com/library/playbooks/funding/structure-your-fundraise"><u>raising venture capital</u></a> funds is a business deal in which you exchange equity, or a percentage of company ownership, for the capital your business needs to grow, in the form of investment funds.</p><p>Rapidly just raised our Seed round in February and now I am currently in the process of raising our Series A in the midst of COVID-19 and a faltering economy. From the early days of Rapidly, I knew the importance of enlisting help from a trusted accountant and I am now able to utilize our organized financial recordkeeping in my venture capital fundraising process.</p><h2>The Importance of Financial Planning Before Raising Capital</h2><p>As part of the venture capital process, it is mandatory that you understand your numbers, your growth rate, your burn rate. You should have a sense of what type of historical growth you need to be able to show in order to get a VC who is going to be interested in funding your company.</p><p>Founders want to quickly establish your cadence and relationship with your accountant or bookkeeper. Every company has to have this: either a third party person handling this, or you have a CFO function. You want to have a pulse on managing these things, with tracking revenues, costs, cash flow. Record keeping and paying your taxes are of utmost importance, for example with payroll, for both for due diligence by investors and general compliance purposes. Not getting your ducks in a row can have longer-lasting effects. Just this year with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), many businesses were ineligible due to having their employees classified as contractors rather than W-2 employees.</p><p>You want to have an accountant on your roster as early as you can, whether that’s when you incorporate your company, get your first paying customer, or hire your first employee. From Day 1, you should think about your financial recordkeeping and prepare for the future of your business by staying up-to-date with your books.</p><p>An added benefit of having a tax and accounting professional on your side is that they can bring their expertise of which bookkeeping and payroll software are going to be best for your business, rather than you trying to compare 10 different options.</p><h2>Your Due Diligence Essentials</h2><p>You want to have your base level due diligence items all together and ready before reaching out to investors. Even though you’ve prepared all documents before reaching out to investors, provide only what is asked for, when it is requested.&nbsp;</p><p>You will want to wait until after you receive a term sheet from investors to provide company financial information and documentation. You only want to show your company’s proprietary information to those who are serious about investing, not just someone who is considering investing in a competitor and wants your competitive intel. Prior to a term sheet, you would want to answer base level questions that they request, but not necessarily share your documents. I use Carta’s Deal Rooms feature just for transferring documents to potential investors.</p><h2>Required Due Diligence Items</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization-table.asp"><u>Capitalization Table</u></a> with a summary of all shareholder equity</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plstatement.asp#:~:text=The%20profit%20and%20loss%20(P%26L,synonymous%20with%20the%20income%20statement."><u>Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L)</u></a> statements with records of revenues, costs, expenses, in a given time period</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp"><u>Cash Flow</u></a> statements with a summary of all incoming transaction through operations, investments, and financing</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp"><u>Balance Sheet</u></a> with the company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity</p></li><li><p><a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/modeling/types-of-financial-models/"><u>Financial Models</u></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><ul><li><p>One model if the business continues to grow month over month for 12 and 24 months</p></li><li><p>A second model if the business does not make any further month for the next 12 months, illustrating how long the business can run if things go south for our business during this time (very essential during a post-COVID world)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Cohort analysis from your customer data</p><ul><li><p>Paid customers/users month over month</p></li><li><p>New users acquired month over month</p></li><li><p>Month over month churn</p></li><li><p>Month over month retention</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>How to Choose Your Accountant</h2><p>Timeliness and a good relationship with your accountant as additional questions or last-minute requests from investors come up during the fundraising process. This is why it’s best to have everything prepared before you begin your fundraising round. Shameless plug here Rapidly is a great starting point to start a long term relationship with a vetted accountant.</p><p>If you’re new to working with an accountant, you will want someone who has experience with startups, understands your revenue model, and your specific vertical. If you’re early stage and raising venture capital, you’re most likely not yet profitable, and your accountant should understand that in the short term your expenses are going to be more than your revenue.</p><p>Your accountant should be able to include stories from your user data (revenue, acquisition costs, churn rate, customer lifetime value, burn rate, revenue pipelines) in their financial modeling numbers of historical and projected KPI’s. Timeliness and a good relationship with your accountant as additional questions or last-minute requests from investors come up during the fundraising process. This is why it’s best to have everything prepared.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>Use your slow days to:</p>

<li>Proactively plan your creativity time and to;</li>

<p>I find this approach super helpful.</p>
<p>It is an idea adapted from <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremiahdillon">Jeremiah Dillon</a>, previously Head of Product Marketing at Google for 9 years. </p>
<p>At Google, Dillon <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3054571/the-better-time-management-strategy-this-googler-taught-his-coworkers">sent an email</a> that encouraged employees to set aside more time for <em>Maker Time — our creativity and thinking time —</em> instead of having endless busy times, back to back.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noc-DKZoNGU">2-minute video</a> on this concept.

<p><strong>In summary: first set aside more time for creativity by reducing the amount of busy times you have. Then align your days throughout the week with your energy level.</strong></p>
<p>Make sense? </p>
<p>Let’s go a little bit deeper into each of these.</p>
<h2>Set aside more time for creativity</h2>
<p>You want your plan to drive down busy time while also increasing maker time. </p>
<p>

  </a>
    
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>The higher your busy time, the lower your maker time; but you can plan ahead more maker time by reducing your busy time.</em></p>
<p>The chart moves from 100% busy time to 100% maker time.</p>
<p>But 100% maker time is an idealistic state. We most likely will never get there. And that’s fine. Think of it as a form of stretch goal.</p>
<p>If you picture the top left corner of the graph, most busy people reside there: <em>busy, exhausting, working on back-to-back tasks</em>. So when a day starts out slow, guilt immediately follows because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>I should be doing a ton of work right now but I’m not! I really don’t feel like doing anything.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more realistic place to shoot for is somewhere, a little past the center where you’re still busy but you’ve set aside even more maker time. </p>
<p>Then on the far right is where you keep pushing yourself to — as you go more towards the right, it becomes much tougher to achieve 100%.</p>
<h2>Align tasks with your energy level</h2>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of an example week by Dillon:</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<p>Energy ramps out of the weekend — schedule low-demand tasks like setting goals, organizing, and planning.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>Peak of energy — tackle the most difficult problems, write, brainstorm, schedule your Make Time.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<p>Energy begins to ebb — schedule meetings, especially when consensus is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<p>Lowest energy level — do open-ended work, long-term planning, and relationship building.”</p>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that you set yourself ahead of time and this is particularly powerful if you manage others. </p>
<p>Less guilt;
More work;
Even more creativity.</p>
<h2>But I don’t manage anyone</h2>
<p>That’s ok. </p>
<p>You actually don’t have to be a manager to follow the high level principle. You don’t even have to work for a company.</p>
<p>You can adapt it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Workouts</strong>: Days where you want to do a full work out. Plan ahead something simple for days when you notice your energy is typically low</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Writing</strong>: You have a book to write but feel lazy in the evenings. You can use that period to plan titles for the book, outline for chapters, etc. But then dedicate your high energy in the mornings to writing at least one pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meditation/House Chores/Job application/etc</strong>: Plan ahead for low-energy moments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your next action</h2>
<p>Maybe for you, Mondays are not slow.</p>
<p>It could be Tuesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>The most important takeaway is that you should chunk your activities by different days of the week or different hours of the day and align them with your energy level. You can use your slow days to boost your creativity.</p>
<p>That way, you’ll feel more balance and control in how your week goes.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, simple little tweaks like this can add up to the big transformation you desire.</strong></p>
<p>Slow days are inevitable. Don’t just slog through.</p>
<p>Instead use them to get strategy and creative work done. If you’re like most busy people, you’re not doing a lot of thinking work anyways.</p>
<p>Change that – with this tiny shift in your approach.</p>

September 8, 2020 | https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A long time ago, I gave a talk in front of a full audience talking about BigchainDB, a company I worked for to create a (scalable) decentralized database. As we just had released our browser-compatible JavaScript driver, enthusiastically, I told the audience: "... and so by using our driver from within the browser, your app won't need a backend anymore"!</p>
<p>That must have been around 2017 when I first discovered Metamask, and started drinking Ethereum's web3 cool-aid. Arguably, web3 quickly became something extraordinary. All of a sudden, users could download a browser extension and directly interact with a public network. In a sense, it still is extraordinary.</p>
<p>If you have an extension like Metamask installed in your browser today, you can visit sites on the web that allow you to do the craziest things with your digital money. An excellent recent example of this are DeFi (short for "Decentralized Finance") websites. They allow a user to engage in trading cryptocurrencies, providing liquidity, and peer to peer lending. With the click of a button and no mandatory signups, you're able to pool thousands of dollars. That is super cool and confirms the viability of the web3 vision.</p>
<p>But actually, what is the web3 vision? It may be that there never was such a thing in the first place. All I know is that someone named a library "web3.js". Developers use it to talk to remote or local Ethereum nodes when working in a browser environment (JavaScript).</p>
<p>On a web3-enabled website, when a user now clicks a button to, e.g., pool ether in a smart contract, most calculations are supported by the web3.js library that periodically talks to an Ethereum node. Ultimately web3.js allows the user to send the transaction to the node to transfer the user's money.</p>
<p>Often, a key-management program, like Metamask, is running on the user's browser. It allows the user to sign transactions with the same key on different websites.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that's web3. It's supposed to be a play on words regarding "web 2.0". Web 2.0 is the upgrade of web standards that gave us modern single-page applications and dynamic AJAX loading. And Web3? An advancement towards what exactly? Money websites?</p>
<p>Indeed, if you were capable of cleaning your mind of specific memories, specifically, let's say you could do <code>grep -l web3 brain | xargs rm</code>. And then someone asked you how you'd envision a blockchain-based and smart-contract-enabled web3; you'd likely describe an ecosystem vastly different to what it is today. You'd think about peer-2-peer networks, light clients, and renewed web standards. That's precisely not web3.</p>
<p>In today's experience it will instead be mostly shitty react websites that crash or stop working when you've neglected to install Metamask (or other key-management plugins). Opening a web3 website's network console, you'll see that it's making an excessive amount of RPC request to an Ethereum full node. Sorry, I meant to say Infura node, a hugely-popular cloud provider hosting Ethereum full nodes. That's kinda stupid.</p>
<p>And since Metamask allows developers to prompt the user for specific contract calls, what's even more stupid, is that all your money may be at the risk of continually getting stolen with the accidential click of a button. Either by someone hacking the website's server. Or by the website provider becoming corrupt themselves. Or simply because a website pretends to do X when it does Y (stealing all your money).</p>
<p>But instead of continuing to rant, I'd now like to now point out what I think should change about web3:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should stop building key-management plugins and start thinking about a standardizable web API. We must stop training our users to install shitty browser plugins!</li>
<li>We need to make light clients work as soon as possible and become independent from third-party services like thegraph and Infura.</li>
<li>We need to improve our client libraries (ethers.js and web3.js) by dramatically simplifying them and making them bug-free (god damn it!)!</li>
<li>We need to take advantage of some of the blockchain's fundamental properties. Most data is immutable so let's start caching things.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, I think we should stop focusing all of our attention on bumping the web's version number. Maybe we should reconsider writing more backends. We should promote more work on permissionless networks like Open Gas Station Network that allow developers to upgrade a user's experience. And, we should start thinking of a machine network of blockchains more often. In many ways, web3 was just a cool demo. But let's come up with something better. Just imagine what happens once there's a deeper integration of money into computer systems!</p>

				<p>Axial operates a confidential online marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of privately held small and medium sized businesses. The platform is 100% software enabled and includes tools and recommendation engines to empower both buyers and sellers to discover, connect and transact with one another. By expanding the reach of both buyers and sellers and eliminating hundreds of hours of manual time spent pursuing an offline transaction process allows deals with the most merit to rise to the top. The platform goes beyond matching the correct individuals and focuses on facilitating success at many levels. A key example of this is the platform's ability to facilitate real human to human interactions with communication on the platform itself.</p><blockquote><em>“Axial at its core is a specialized matching engine and communication platform.”</em></blockquote><p>The ability for the platform to connect people on a deeper level is what has made it a successful medium for completed deals and a major contributor to democratizing capital markets. As Zach Werheim, Director of Engineering at Axial, puts it, “one big goal is to be able to help people where they need it — for those who, otherwise, would never be able to get it."</p><p>Zach is a prominent software engineer and tech leader who has led a number of engineering teams. He, along with the rest of the Axial team, were quick to recognize the rapidly evolving market conditions in the way people communicate. The mindset of their users was changing quickly, and it was critical to provide them with industry best practices and features.</p><p>The Axial platform has served their customers for over 10 years. In that time they’ve endeavored to maintain best practices while evolving with emerging technologies. Their philosophy of pushing innovation results in a couple of issues arising that the team must address.</p><p><em><strong>1. Ensuring institutional knowledge isn’t lost over time.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>2. Making it easy to adopt the newest best technologies.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>3. Making their tooling accessible to their developers.</strong></em></p><p>Applications being built and improved over the course of a decade are always at risk of institutional knowledge being lost. It is paramount that developer and operations workflows and processes are common knowledge and not siloed. Additionally, over the course of the last decade, there are a new set of tools and processes which represent best practices. A core facet of engineering at Axial is to adopt the latest best practices to empower their development team to perform at their highest.</p><blockquote><br><em>Zach was on a mission to make it easier for their development team to adopt optimal tooling without silos and individual points of failure. This would empower their dev team to make the best technology choices while ensuring that the tool knowledge was collaborative and distributed. The solution was creating their own workflows meshed with the optimal tools for their day-to-day operations.</em><br></blockquote><p>After evaluating multiple tools with limited success, the team came across <a href="https://cto.ai/platform">The Ops Platform by CTO.ai</a>. The Ops Platform allowed them to start building solutions immediately by creating and automating developer workflows. These workflows were sharable with the entire team and could plug into any specific developer tooling that was necessary. They did this via Slack workflows and the CTO.ai SlackOps capability. Axial built 3 initial Ops to empower their engineering teams right away: The Dev Op, The Vault Op, and The Cluster Op.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="1-the-dev-op">1. The Dev Op</h3><p>The engineering team leverages VMs which run in AWS, which also run most of their services for development. Their Dev Command controls the state of their DevBox for AWS cost savings. When the development team isn’t active, it can easily be turned off or turn on, on demand. The team also implemented an automatic shut off. Because it’s built as an Op, the team can run these suites of commands directly from Slack and avoid having to interface with the AWS Console or other specific services.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WJ21lVtgdBCuga-WYA2xJc8h3LQUojaozdTE7cuiVgfVYtDC80LbgJRN0D1_gMul3ekbXDjS3zMwLXszGVPEGzwMOWVcRYSO6nXbTRbYIfw90_7zeRCAnBtiEZhIjThFDvNPGC3A"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br>

The <em>Dev </em>Op specifically helped save on their AWS bill by making it easy for the team to activate development services only when necessary. Across the 5 DevBoxes, Zach is able to save over 12 hours of uptime per day, which equates to a savings of over $5,900 annually. The Ops Platform made it simple to build—not only to save money, but also to streamline development for the rest of the engineering team and save developer hours.</p><blockquote><em>“Without CTO.ai, we would have to adopt the bare minimum tooling. Anything new would have to be written in a language our team was familiar with and we’d be running scripts manually. Having this technology available is going to make it easier to develop dev operations around new systems. It’s definitely going to be a big advantage for us going forward”</em></blockquote><div><p>Zach plans to continue to build key Ops to empower the rest of his team. Specifically, a production release pipeline. In addition, there are a lot of fragmented utility scripts their team uses to run various operations. These scripts currently sit in a folder and eventually become outdated as infrastructure changes. “Opifying” these would allow them to be version controlled and give the entire team more visibility. Zach has also thought about ways to empower other departments of the organization with Ops. One of their next plans for Ops is to build an “extremely simple and impossible to screw up” SlackOp to empower their marketing department to perform an operation they would usually need the assistance of engineering for. This Op would be trackable, so the engineering team would have visibility into what is being run, but the marketing team would be unblocked to continue their tasks. </p><p>Adopting Ops has allowed Axial to immediately reduce their cloud spend, enable easier adoption of new technologies, and even open the door to empowering non-engineers to run operations. Ultimately, this allows the engineering team to focus on their core competency in the pursuit of their own market innovation instead of spending time and resources on infrastructure and tooling.</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p><em>Contact us to understand how much time and money workflows can save your team:</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--[if lte IE 8]>

				<div>
				
				
				<div><p><span>In the winter of 1938, deep into the Depression,&nbsp;eight-year-old Verne was put on a train and sent 2,000 miles east, to the Ontario School for the Blind. It was when Verne was in the school’s hospital for six weeks with scarlet fever that he first heard the sound of a piano being tuned – the intervals being stretched and shortened. It was a pinging sound, not quite musical, and hardly melodic.</span></p>
<p><span>Once he had recovered,Verne sought out the school’s tuning shop. As it happened, he had a near perfect ear, and he studied the craft of piano tuning with rigor and determination.</span></p>
<p><span>Years later, Verne often took to quoting his tuning teacher, J. D. Ansell, whose favorite aphorism was “The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.” To give Verne experience, Ansell started taking his young protégé into town to tune pianos in private homes. Verne was allowed to keep the money – $2.50 per piano, and sometimes, when he got lucky, $3.00 – which he put toward some basic tools: a tuning wrench, a tuning fork, needle-nose pliers, gauges for measuring the diameter of piano wire, and rubber wedges for muting strings.</span></p>
<p><span>After graduating from high school at age 19, Verne knew his best chance at a job was to find work as a chipper in one of the many piano factories in Toronto (in the early 20th century the city directory listed no fewer than sixteen piano manufacturers). The chippers were the first tuners to work on a newly strung piano, so incomplete in construction that it still had no keys. Those initial tunings are done, first with a pitch fork, then by ear, by plucking the strings with a small chip of wood.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne started out as an apprentice chipper in the factory of the Winter Company, one of piano manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span>He had a fishing tackle box that he had converted to a tuner’s toolbox. Over the years Verne collected dozens of tools. Some he bought from old-timers, and others he adapted from other trades. He had surgical forceps and dental explorers, which made dandy hooks, opticians’ screwdrivers for adjusting harpsichords, barber scissors for trimming felt, and shoemaker pegs for plugging holes. From the welding trade he took soapstone, a dry lubricant for the buckskin that can squeak in the action of older pianos.</span></p>
<p><span>After being laid off, Verne decided to go door-to-door, tuning pianos. He was systematic, choosing a sequence of different neighborhoods around Toronto that he could reach by street car. Verne soon grew bolder and began cold-calling at sergeants’ messes,&nbsp;asylums, and prisons. He would walk a mile and a half in a snowstorm to tune a piano, and charge $3 for a tuning. He was lucky to get one tuning a day. “That’s how things were,” he recalled years later. “I was glad to get the work. During that time you did what you could.”</span></p>
<p><span>In 1952, at the age of 21, Verne was hired as a fine-tuner in the Heintzman factory, then the largest piano manufacturer in Canada.&nbsp;Verne’s tuning always stood out, even when he was tuning pianos for the first time. To trained ears, the quality of Verne’s tuning was always superior.</span></p>
<p><span>In 1961, he moved to the T. Eaton Co., to take over as the concert tuner. Verne liked to think he could take a piano beyond mere sound, into realms of color. And he liked to think he was giving people a glimpse of that color every time he tuned a piano. Muriel Mussen, who ran the concert department, sat in a small office off the showroom floor,&nbsp;and&nbsp;came to recognize Verne’s spare style of tuning whenever she heard it. Unlike many tuners, who banged a key as hard as they could, he kept it gentle, careful not to hit the key any harder than he had to. Halfway into a piano, Verne would often hear Miss Mussen call out, “I know it’s you tuning out there, Verne.”</span></p>
<p><span>One afternoon about a year after Verne started at Eaton’s,&nbsp;Miss Mussen sent him across town to Glenn Gould’s apartment to tune Gould’s old Chickering. All Gould wanted, he told Verne, was for the tuner to do what had been done hundreds of times before: get the piano into playable condition, if only for the time being. But Verne refused, telling Gould that the tuning pins were so loose they needed to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne’s stubborn insistence on doing things his way had endeared him to Gould, and the encounter galvanized what was to become a decades-long association between a pianist and his technician.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne tuned for many famous musicians over the years, including Duke Ellington, Arthur Rubinstein, Rudolf Serkin, Victor Borge, and Liberace. But it was the business he got from Gould that eventually enabled him to quit Eaton’s employ and sustain his family for two decades.</span></p>
<p><span>Each tolerated the other’s idiosyncracies, which were in ample evidence in both men. Gould’s quirks, of course, were legion and legendary. One of their earliest conversations was about Verne’s physical limitations. “I can’t see very well, but I get the job done,” Verne told Gould. And Gould replied that of this he had no doubt. Nothing further on the topic was ever said.</span></p>

His new book, <em>Clean: The New Science of Skin</em>,&nbsp;asks readers to question the multitude&nbsp;of products they're being sold in the name of hygiene and personal care, and whether some of them may, in fact, be doing more harm than good.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He says&nbsp;a global pandemic could be&nbsp;a better time than ever to experiment with cutting back on those products — and on showering overall.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>The rapid expansion of personal hygiene products&nbsp;</h2>  <p>A hundred years ago, having running water and a bar of soap in the home was a new phenomenon, Hamblin said.</p>  <p>Nowadays, a single family's bathroom may be&nbsp;home to an&nbsp;incredible array of products — scented soaps, body washes, shampoos, conditioners, cream rinses, facial cleansers, and an assortment of creams, ointments and serums all meant for specific&nbsp;body parts.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It is a brilliant story of marketing," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It's basically a process of segmenting and growth by the big corporations that have sold us these things and found ways to make these&nbsp;products slightly differentiated so that they are maybe a little different colour, a little different scent, a little different concentration, and making whole new products out of them."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-walmart.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-walmart.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-walmart.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-walmart.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-walmart.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-walmart.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Shampoos, soaps and other hygiene products on display in a Walmart aisle. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>That original shift toward personal&nbsp;hygiene was based in science, Hamblin&nbsp;said, and helped&nbsp;curb the spread of disease and infections.</p>  <p>"But it really quickly devolved away from from actual disease prevention practices and toward wealth and class signifiers."</p>  <p>That linking of cleanliness to class, Hamblin&nbsp;says, has had devastating consequences for society at large.</p>  <p>"Throughout the history of the idea of cleanliness, it has been used maliciously as being used to justify racism and xenophobia, and we've we've called other groups unclean since before we had germ theory as a way of just differentiating ourselves and justifying plunder," he said.</p>  <p>Asked what he think of&nbsp;comments by U.S. President Donald Trump about&nbsp;<a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7271702/donald-trump-shower-hair/">increasing&nbsp;water pressure from showerheads</a> to have a more intense shower experience and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52407177">injecting disinfectant to combat COVID-19</a>, he said that "goes hand-in-hand with a lot of germaphobia."</p>  <p>"There are clear tropes with purity and cleanliness that become very easily tied up in toxic ways, toward thinking you just want to eradicate all foreign entities," he said.</p>  <p>"That is where you start to see very clearly a propensity to just think of all germs are bad and purity as good as this hyper-simplified version of the actual way that we should be thinking about our skin and our microbial worlds."</p>  <h2>Balancing your bacteria&nbsp;</h2>  <p>Human skin is covered in bacteria.

<p>Columnar storage is a proven way to speed up database query performance by greatly reducing I/O during query execution. It’s been a fundamental feature in analytic relational databases such as Vertica, Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, and many others for more than a decade. It’s also a fundamental feature of the PostgreSQL query-acceleration extensions of <a href="https://swarm64.com/swarm64-da/">Swarm64 DA</a>.</p>



<p>In Swarm64 DA 5.0 (<a href="https://swarm64.com/early-access-request/">now in beta</a>), compressed columnar storage is implemented as a columnstore index, which can easily be applied to any standard PostgreSQL table to speed up queries. </p>



<p><a href="https://swarm64.com/early-access-request/">Try the Swarm64 DA 5.0 beta for free</a></p><p>The columnstore index caches the data of the related table in a compressed column-oriented format, thus providing data locality for similar values. A query that uses the columnstore index benefits from more efficient I/O and improved CPU utilization. Both these properties lead to faster query execution.</p>



<h3>Why columnstore indexing is important for PostgreSQL</h3>



<p>The columnstore index provides a more performant way for PostgreSQL to retrieve data from large tables in queries that use a subset of all the columns in the table.</p>



<p>Columnstore indexing can be very useful if you are doing any of these things with PostgreSQL:</p>



<ul><li>Migrating applications from Microsoft SQL Server, which also implements columnstore indexes</li><li>Supporting mixed workloads, for example user reporting on an OLTP database or accelerating the occasional table scan</li><li>Improving query and reporting performance, especially at scale, for concurrent users</li><li>Implementing data warehouses and analytical databases on free, open source PostgreSQL</li></ul>



<h3>What is columnar storage, and how does it accelerate queries?</h3>



<p>Columnar storage is an established DBMS concept, but let’s start with a high-level primer on how columnar storage accelerates querying. Consider the following table containing data about pets:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-1024x455.png" alt="How columnar storage for PostgreSQL works" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-1024x455.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-300x133.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-768x341.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table.png 1143w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In row-oriented databases such as PostgreSQL, data pages (or blocks) store the values of an entire row together, sequentially for each column in the row. The rows-to-data pages ratio might be more or less than one, depending on the number and type of columns per row and the data page size setting. For illustration purposes, let’s assume that each data page in our Pets database contains one row in our table:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-1024x92.png" alt="" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-1024x92.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-300x27.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-768x69.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-1536x137.png 1536w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Row-oriented storage is optimal for OLTP performance, where transactions frequently read and write entire records. However, if you query one column of the row-store table, for example PetType, you see that all columns are read, which means the query wastes a lot of time scanning and filtering irrelevant data.</p>



<p>Column-oriented storage solves this problem by grouping values of the same column (PetType) together on disk:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-1024x90.png" alt="Columnar storage in PostgreSQL example" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-1024x90.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-300x26.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-768x68.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-1536x135.png 1536w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols.png 1602w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>For that same query on the PetType column, only the values of the relevant column are scanned, which results in fewer reads from storage and faster query results. In this simple case, each page read from storage contains PetType values for five rows instead of one, so I/O would be reduced by 5x.</p>



<h3>But wait, there’s less! (compressed columns)</h3>



<p>Since columns contain data of the same type, and especially when they contain relatively few unique values, they lend themselves well to compression. This further decreases I/O (and query time) by squeezing even more column values into each data page. In fact, compressed columns are often small enough to remain cached entirely in memory for very fast query performance.</p>



<h3>Accelerating TPC-H with PostgreSQL columnstore indexing</h3>



<p>When we run a 1-terabyte (SF1000) TPC-H benchmark on PostgreSQL with the Swarm64 DA extensions installed, you can see the effects of the columnstore indexing (along with other PostgreSQL acceleration features in Swarm64 DA, such as increased parallelism). The time required to run the whole benchmark is reduced by 19x with Swarm64 DA, with some queries executing as much as 60x faster:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-1024x722.png" alt="PostgreSQL columnstore indexes accelerate TPC-H benchmark by 19x" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-1024x722.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-300x212.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-768x542.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H.png 1175w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Swarm64 DA 5.0, with Columnstore indexing helps PostgreSQL 12 run TPC-H 19x faster </figcaption></figure>



<p>The following chart shows how much columnstore indexing reduces I/O. As the I/O bars show in the chart below, with columnstore indexes applied, 17x less data is read by PostgreSQL during the benchmark. This reduces scan time by up to 20x in some TPC-H queries.</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-1024x618.png" alt="Columnstore indexes in PostgreSQL reduce query I/O" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-1024x618.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-300x181.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-768x464.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1.png 1287w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Columnstore indexing reduces I/O by 17x in a 1TB TPC-H benchmark</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Creating a columnstore index in PostgreSQL with Swarm64 DA</h3>



<p>As mentioned, columnstore indexes can be defined for any PostgreSQL table. Let’s suppose we have the following table definition:</p>



<pre><code>CREATE TABLE orders (
o_orderkey bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
o_custkey int NOT NULL,
o_orderstatus "char" NOT NULL,
o_totalprice double precision NOT NULL,
o_orderdate date NOT NULL,
o_orderpriority character varying(15) NOT NULL,
o_clerk character varying(15) NOT NULL,
o_shippriority int NOT NULL,
o_comment character varying(79)
);</code></pre>



<p>A columnstore index should cover your most commonly accessed columns. Let’s suppose we want a columnstore index that covers all columns in the orders table except for an infrequently referenced o_comment column. In this case, we use the following create index statement:</p>



<pre><code>CREATE INDEX orders_columnstore_idx ON orders USING columnstore(
o_orderkey
, o_custkey
, o_orderstatus
, o_totalprice
, o_orderdate
, o_orderpriority
, o_clerk
, o_shippriority
);</code></pre>



<p>The specific order of the columns in the CREATE INDEX statement does not matter. The new columnstore index will initialize as soon as you execute a VACUUM statement or whenever autovacuum next kicks in.</p>



<h3>Columnstore indexes work like most any other PostgreSQL index</h3>



<p>After the columnstore index is created, the PostgreSQL planner uses it automatically in your queries. Like other PostgreSQL indexes, the columnstore index has full transaction safety, crash-safety, replication support, and it benefits from an often-vacuumed database for optimal performance.</p>



<h3>Try it out, and let us know what you think</h3>



<p>That’s a high-level overview of columnstore indexing and columnar data storage for PostgreSQL. </p>



<p>For more detail, check out this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Intro-Columnstore-Indexing-Postgres.pdf" target="_blank">slide deck on PostgreSQL columnstore indexing</a> from a <a href="https://swarm64.com/columnstore-index-webcast/">recent webcast</a> we ran.</p>



<p>In upcoming blog posts we will detail other aspects of columnstore indexing like compression and additional columnstore indexing best practices.</p>



<p>Columnstore indexing is available now in the preview release of Swarm64 DA 5.0. We’d love to hear your feedback. If you’d like to try it out for free, you can request a copy here:</p>

          <p>It’s often forgotten that graphic design revolves around communication. A visual way of communication, but communication nonetheless. There’s 4 things needed for successful communication: </p><ul><li>The Sender</li><li>The Message</li><li>The Medium </li><li>The Receiver</li></ul><p>This applies to all types of communication, verbal and non-verbal alike.</p><p>For a message to be successful (i.e. the sender is able to send out the message and have the receiver on the other end get it and decipher it), some criteria must be met:</p><ul><li><strong>A common language must be spoken.</strong> "Language” can be verbal or nonverbal. Following this logic, English is a language of course, but so are images, maths, and music! For any of these languages to be shared and understood by two or more people, organization is required. This organization ensures that the communication can be deciphered by the receiver in the way that the sender intended.</li><li><strong>The medium mustn’t have noise or noise must at least be minimal.</strong> By “noise” I mean interference - something that could alter the message or in some way prevent the message from being deciphered. An example of this is the game telephone we used to play as kids. In this game a message is whispered from one kid to another and, without a doubt, by the time it gets to the last person it will have been changed from the original message. Another more straightforward example is trying to talk to someone across a noisy and crowded room: the message will most likely arrive deformed (or not at all).</li></ul><p>It’s interesting to think about the different ways in which communication can be established. Imagine none of us spoke the same spoken language: we would need another type of language in order to establish communication. This is one of the areas where graphic design is applied. The study really should be called “graphic <em>communication</em>”, but it’s shinier to say “design” so that stuck. </p><p>As I mentioned earlier, images are a form of communication in themselves. There’s certain conventions that need to be established for them to be used as a language. For example, if I drew a stick figure, then there is a great chance that everyone will know that it’s a loose interpretation of a person. How do we know this? By convention.</p><p>We unconsciously learn a lot of things by convention just by being immersed in the society that we live in. Graphic design exploits those conventions in order to create communication. It’s why it’s so important to never re-invent the wheel. Not only is it a waste of time, but it would also go against convention, creating interference in the medium, and prohibiting the receiver from deciphering the message.</p><p>On the other hand though, imagery can be a tricky way of communicating. Images are associated to symbols and concepts rather than a concrete “thing”. For example the stick figure I drew means “person” to me, but, to someone who doesn’t share any of the same social and cultural conventions as me, it might not. Sometimes even images literally don’t translate.</p><p>Today I wanted to talk about a piece of graphic design which to me is the epitome of AWESOME in both communication and aesthetics. It’s a piece that was created to send a message to beings with whom we don’t know anything about. Scratch that, we don’t even know if they’re there. To me, this piece fully encompasses what graphic design is. Not only that but it accomplishes this in the sphere of one of my other passions, space!</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qCUtBHhJCNJc3PslYbqkQ1Z4SZNkoomxSEYAV534bgQhNNCWrnPFrOKptsiO21TxsVq5kh_t5oW7KPUJrd_cdXjwYV4p7PkmBEOQwMLihziGYa1nD3HBnDcU8etp49rBGQU2YD0b" alt="Aliens"></figure><p>In 1972 and 1973 NASA sent off the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecrafts to explore Jupiter and Saturn. After their core objectives were completed, they continued their route and flew out of the Solar System. Attached to the spacecrafts they added a golden plaque with a message. There’s over 7000 spoken languages on Earth (and a few more of unspoken nature), so how on earth (ha!) would we be able to send out a message that could be deciphered by beings that we can only assume do not share any of our Earthly conventions?</p><p>The answer is <em>science.</em></p><p>Science uses the language of mathematics to express itself. One can only assume that any civilization advanced enough to explore the universe and bump into the spacecrafts that NASA launched in the 70’s will know a thing or two about science and maths.</p><p>The Pioneer plaque was a last minute addition by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake. It’s also an important piece to me because the person who actually drew it was a woman: Linda Salzman Sagan, Dr Sagan’s wife.</p><p>The plaque is broken down into 4 sections and can be “read” using maths.</p><h3 id="section-1-the-key">Section 1: The Key</h3><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JT_zuZTxrPj7sCsaTEUSZ--bdeGrTnJcBOWtQIz1pB0rMOm9BdXMaBLnCDAuNQDagi3lZNXhUAdJ7fMj54WWTcYYRG95-DR48SJIml2uNvXuhpZPNiLedPENnJ3JUd-Q954ff1qC"></figure><p>The first section shows two hydrogen atoms and represents the key to deciphering the whole plaque. The design team and the scientists postulated that hydrogen, being the most abundant element in the cosmos, would be one of the first elements to be discovered and studied by a civilization. The hydrogen atoms are shown changing from one energy state to another, a process called hyperfine transition where electromagnetic radiation is released. That wavelength can be traced (it’s approximately 21cm), serving as the first clue by giving a spatial measurement. The period of the transition can also be calculated to approximately .7 nanoseconds, serving as the second unit given, a unit of time. The next clue is the small tick between the atoms, that assigns the values of space and time to the binary number 1.</p><h3 id="section-2-the-address">Section 2: The Address</h3><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cbTM1HQp21jmqc6fJYW2NCzn9yVxzv4ik7yboPq58gEBtnSxQUv2ZGeiDwvQdPrVkpriMQo-L3SrNR_rKriBv45kBNuef_gS_MNfXdwQUMHpvKCn_Ev6Kas69-orNVNBhSkC6j2I"></figure><p>The second part of the plaque is a bundle of lines extending radially from a common centre: our star, the Sun. This is our interstellar address. The lines indicate the direction of the 14 most significant pulsars (a type of rotating star) near our Solar System. The little dashes and lines represent the period of the respective pulsar, in binary. Not only is this a map communicating the position from which the message originated, but time as well. With this information, a civilization advanced enough to decipher this part of the message could triangulate our position in time and space.</p><h3 id="section-3-the-origin">Section 3: The Origin</h3><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5IZgnT-GDfSgI4-BkSrHM-ay1SK8E1sCr6SYftns-hd9k-YtCZZvJHT4LL-6rh9bY_B6om85iB0g2aZbg8iafNtUsyiqmb_jhqiNUk6W_491zSOFn_a0B-lf9rdlpzMW84Q3yDK0"></figure><p>The next section of the message is a zoomed out view of our Solar System, with the Sun at the far left, followed by the 9 planets (Pluto was still considered a planet when the spacecrafts were launched) orbiting the star. Their respective distances to the Sun are written in binary above or below each planet. The third planet, the Earth, shows the path the spacecraft took when launched, which gives evidence of the origin of the Pioneer spacecrafts.</p><h3 id="section-4-the-sender">Section 4: The Sender</h3><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/c9RbDfaTK-tI1dcKMorsan91YbVYFuKNd3kbuRPodlJYZkm8SYwVjZAOI966mmGEKf1paQQGWZ-tEckwmCO-mo7xrZ-57v-CJM5zYZAxsTLD_BMFi5ajwlCJqtAnfkiTBloS0Yt_"></figure><p>The final section shows what’s found in that planet. The image of a man and a woman, the man bends his arm and extends his open palm as a sign of 'hello', which admittedly could be meaningless to another civilization. No detail in this plaque has been by chance, as seen in the woman’s stance, her arms are down and her weight is shifted to one side to show we are mobile and flexible. They stand by a diagram of the probe for scale, but if that wasn’t enough, on the far right of the image there is a binary number 8, meaning the woman is 8 units tall (or, 8 x 21cm = 5.5 feet tall).</p><p>The last signal from Pioneer 10 was received in 2003, when it was 12 billion kilometers from Earth.</p><p>I love this piece not only because it combines two of my greatest passions, but also because it’s one of the most ambitious pieces of communication ever created. The receiver is unknown, the common language is a big assumption, and we’ll probably never know for certain whether the message was deciphered like the sender intended. </p><p>Having said that, it may sound like this was a fruitless exercise by the very smart folks at NASA. From a graphic design point of view however, it’s incredibly poignant how communication can be established (or, at the very least, initiated) by learning as much possible about those who will be deciphering the message. In this case, the assumption that a learned civilization would know of the hydrogen atom allowed experts to work backwards from that point and attempt to establish a common language (science) so that whoever might be out there could understand our message: "We're here!"</p><hr><p>If you liked this article by our Chief Design Officer, Vicky, <a href="https://blog.codelitt.com/cdo-victoria-jaime/">check out this interview with her!</a></p>

September 8, 2020 | https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/09/06/work.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/09/06/work.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>In 2002, my mom started a new job in finance. One day, I visited her office. As part of the grand tour, she showed me her Lotus Notes setup on her PC, and explained that she received around 400 emails a day. This <em>baffled</em> my eleven year old mind: “why don’t you guys just use MSN?” My friends at school used Microsoft’s Messenger for everything. Some of my friends in the US had me hopping on AOL, but either one seemed obviously better than my mom and her highly-paid colleagues shooting one-line emails through their bulky setups. Nearly twenty years later, Slack and Microsoft Teams are finally making real-time chat commonplace even among the most traditional enterprises.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, I was deep in MMO gaming (specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape">RuneScape</a>). I joined and led clans of hundreds of other players, sometimes in PVP, but most often just to make money. For us kids, these were remarkably successful group efforts: large groups of teenage strangers around the world organized themselves, mostly over text chat, to work together for hours every day. I still know my major timezone overlaps off by heart from back then. We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB">phpBB forums</a> for longer-form discussion and official matters, and set up internal Wikis for knowledge management. We used IRC to chat in real-time, and set up dozens of custom scripts to integrate with external services. If we needed audio to chat in real-time, we’d use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventrilo">Ventrilo</a>, which would support up to 400 people simultaneously. For sharing short screen recordings, we used <a href="https://gyazo.com/">Gyazo</a> and <a href="https://puush.me/">Puush</a>, a decade before <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a> was founded.</p> <p>As such, the past few months of COVID quarantine have been a real throwback for me. As a teen, I sat at my desk for fourteen hours a day, coordinating buyouts of ingame items, playing on one screen, watching IRC and forums on the other, while chatting over Ventrilo.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">1</a></sup> Now, as an adult, I am doing the same, just with real work, Slack, and Zoom instead.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p> <p>The rest of the world has been adjusting to this new normal, and venture/tech Twitter (mostly people who were <em>not</em> obsessive online-gaming teens in the early 2000s) has been abuzz with theories about what collaboration in this new world looks like. To me, it looks a great deal like the toolset I used to very competitively<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup> play online games. Some tools, like Notion, GitHub, and Roam Research are genuinely unprecedented in that they have no prior product analogies, but for the most part, you can predict the 2020 remote work toolkit by looking at the 2010 gaming toolkit.</p> <p>It’s unsurprising that there would be a strong correspondence between online gaming and work tools. Both are collaborative team efforts, and require low-latency communication over text, audio, and video. Both make use of complex external services to manage recruiting, onboarding, collective knowledge, and to solve complicated coordination problems over multiple timezones for dozens, if not hundreds of teammates.</p> <p>Let’s look ahead. What does gaming in 2020 tell us about collaborative work in the future?</p> <h3 id="twitch">Twitch</h3> <p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> is a livestreaming/social platform, most popular for video games. Streamers on Twitch have slowly expanded to now include real-life vlogging, teaching, live coding, painting, writing, and other non-gaming genres. What’s most interesting is that streamers are starting to use Twitch to share their <em>creative efforts</em> as they build: some people are now even <a href="https://24hrstartup.com/">building businesses</a>, all in public, on Twitch.</p> <p>I believe this style of content production and engagement is going to shift <em>how work is done</em> in a few years. Most employees will be streaming as they work, and their colleagues may drop in on their streams with ideas and suggestions. It’ll feel weirdly invasive at first. There’s certainly a hump to get over when live-streaming your thoughts and showing your intimate, unfinished work-product drafts. However, once people get used to it, it’s collaboration supercharged. You’ll work, take a break, peruse your coworkers’ streams, find something interesting, drop in, chat for five minutes, share context, and get back to your own stuff. The feedback loop of creation becomes much tighter.</p> <h3 id="video-as-institutional-knowledge">Video as Institutional Knowledge</h3> <p>Closely related to Twitch is YouTube – after you’ve done a stream, you’ll upload a copy for posterity. This solves a problem in how companies deal with the loss of institutional knowledge – namely, <em>how to do stuff</em> – as they grow. As people leave, so do all the little procedures and processes that glue together a large operational organization. All companies try to remedy this through written knowledge bases, and the vast majority fail. Screen recordings of <em>how employees work</em> can be powerful stores of institutional knowledge.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">4</a></sup></p> <h3 id="audio-preferred">Audio Preferred</h3> <p>Face-to-face communications for routine meetings are going away. I’m in a lot of Zoom meetings these days, and I don’t want to stare at another person’s face, and try to read their expressions. It wears me out. I don’t want to carefully adjust my background to look presentable. Most people I know who are on 3+ calls a day will subtly push toward audio-only. New users may start off excited about video meetings and seeing other people’s faces, but as they become power users, video becomes too taxing and they move toward audio only. Outside of important/first-time external meetings, power users and well-acquainted teammates don’t want all the baggage of video calls, they want <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeamSpeak">TeamSpeak</a>.</p> <h3 id="splinter-groups">Splinter Groups</h3> <p>As far as meetings go, the current big open problem is that it is extremely difficult to replicate the experience of meeting as a group, splintering into smaller conversations, and hopping from conversation to conversation, the way you might at a professional event (or a party in Silicon Valley; the two are identical). Ventrilo solved this problem over a decade ago:<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">5</a></sup> create ephemeral channels/groups within your VoIP server that people can join, and that close when they have no members. Supporting this is the next big step for Zoom. If they fall short, they very seriously open up the market for any other entrant that can facilitate this.</p> <h3 id="arvr">AR/VR</h3> <p>For all the talk about shifting paradigms under remote work, there’s been little talk of AR/VR collaborative solutions. There are tons of vendors! But they’re all uncanny-valley experiences that very imperfectly try to replicate the experience of face-to-face meetings, or (even worse) conferences. All of these collaborate-in-VR solutions feel awkwardly skeuomorphic, and I expect that nothing will come of them.</p> <p>Why? Because, just like in the above point, face-to-face comms are an <em>artifact</em>, not a <em>goal</em>. The goals are always to exchange information, build trust, and to make decisions. Strapping into an Oculus Rift to sit in a virtual meeting room with a bunch of Lara Croft lookalikes doesn’t advance the goal, it only distracts. Even a perfect VR experience would only distract.</p> <p>Going out on a limb, I expect that if users do end up going for 3D interaction, it’s going to look a lot more like a blend of traditional MMORPGs and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/get-started-hubs-mozilla">Mozilla Hubs</a> than anything requiring an AR or VR device.</p> <h3 id="discord">Discord</h3> <p>If Discord starts marketing itself for a more professional crowd, it will destroy Slack. It’s a far superior software product – lighter-weight, faster, and it natively supports audio and video chat inside the platform. Discord is a $10B+ company in the making. Perhaps controversially, I think if users adapt to audio being more important than video, Discord is a serious competitor to Zoom.</p> <h3 id="lighter-weight-applications">Lighter-Weight Applications</h3> <p>All good gaming-adjacent software is light and fast. Bulky software would slow down your computer and you’d lose in games! Similarly, we’re enduring an epidemic of slow enterprise software. Asana, JIRA, Confluence, Slack, Google Drive, and so forth: using any of these tools is like wading through molasses. There’s lag when you enter keystrokes, interfaces load slowly due to hundreds of API calls under the hood, and so on.</p> <p>I desperately hope that as SaaS providers try harder to provide mind-melding interfaces between man and machine, they’ll eventually realize that a lack of speed is the biggest barrier between the two; that the speed of response and navigation is the single most important feature to a serious user.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>Right now, we are in a strange period of adjustment as people learn to work remotely. Users cling to representations of real life, meetings, and face-to-face Zooms. But this is an inconvenience, and it’ll become more rare for routine work. Audio is king in the remote world work; video – of actual humans – is less relevant, simulacrum of a past paradigm. On the other hand, video of <em>work</em> is of paramount importance, and the combination of live streaming and video storage will reshape how employees work, collaborate, and share institutional knowledge.</p> <p>In this world, AR and VR are somewhat counter-intuitive losers, only useful in very niche applications. If people collaborate in some kinds of 3D spaces, it’ll be mostly for rapid prototyping, sketching, etc. It is clear that collaborative, multi-user, version-controlled/historied software will succeed in this paradigm; I expect more products like Figma and Google Docs to arrive, and single-user software like PhotoShop to quietly leave the scene. And I pray that this new, glorious software will be fast.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we are going to discuss a change to server security that is going to make waves in the home lab and secondary markets for servers and components in the future. During our recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 review</a> we briefly mentioned that AMD EPYC CPUs in the system are vendor locked to Dell EMC systems. This is not a Dell-specific concern. We have confirmed that other vendors are supporting the feature behind this. For the large vendors, their platform security teams are pushing to build more secure platforms for their customers, and that is going to have future impacts on the secondary server market and home labs.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to cover the basics of what is happening. We are going to discuss the motivations, and why this is going to be more common in the future. Finally, we are going to discuss what those in the industry can do to keep the secondary server market operating well. If you work with partners or resellers who dip into used parts bins or even have the potential to purchase grey market CPUs, send them this article or accompanying video. The current market has a large disconnect between what some large customers are asking for, and large vendors are delivering on and what others in the market know is happening.<span id="more-46716"></span></p>
<h2>Accompanying Video</h2>
<p>This is an important topic. To ensure that we can cover those who like to read/ skim and those who like to get information via audio, we have an accompanying video:</p>
<p><iframe title="Vendor Locking AMD EPYC CPUs Great for Security at a Cost" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNVuTAVYxpM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Feel free to pop open that video on YouTube and check it out or to send to those who prefer not to read.</p>
<h2>Background: How we learned this was a “thing”</h2>
<p>In 2018 we did a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-r7415-review/">Dell EMC PowerEdge R7415 review</a> and as part of that review, we started our normal process of trying different CPUs in the system. Early in that process, we used an AMD EPYC 7251 CPU, the low-end 8-core model, and noticed something curious. It would not work in our other test systems after.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, we found it was because Dell EMC was vendor locking the chips to Dell systems. We did not know exactly why, but we were told was a security feature. At this point, and even to this day two years later, not every vendor takes advantage of all of the AMD EPYC security features. What that practically means is that what we saw with the Dell EMC system is not what we saw with other systems. For example, we were able to interchangeably use CPUs in Supermicro and Tyan systems, but we could not use those systems once they went into a Dell EMC server.</p>

<p>We found we were not alone. Laboratories, VARs, and other organizations were finding that transferring AMD EPYC CPUs from one vendor’s system to another, was not the simple process it was on the Intel Xeon side. It did not always work.</p>
<p>We knew it was a security feature and thought that most who are buying servers would be informed of this by their sales reps or channel partners. After I personally got a lot of texts, e-mails, instant messaging, and comments on our C6525 video and article, I realized that this actually may be a situation where many people do not know what is going on.</p>

<p>This experience that we had, apparently is one that is not overly common yet. That makes sense because the systems that utilize the enhanced security levels are still largely new, and being used by their first buyers. Also, AMD still has a smaller market share than Intel. A big reason, by the way, that Intel Xeon does not have this issue is that they do not have the security feature that AMD has. Vendors have come out and stated that their AMD EPYC systems are more secure than their Intel Xeon systems, and this behavior is a byproduct of that enhanced security.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to dive into the feature of AMD processors (and what will be more common in future CPUs from other vendors.)</p>
<h2>AMD EPYC Secure Processor Platform Secure Boot (PSB)</h2>
<p>Let us start with the high-level slide. This is effectively the same slide on the AMD Secure Processor that we saw with the AMD EPYC 7001 series launch, but this is from the EPYC 7002 series. AMD EPYC CPUs may be x86, but they have an embedded Arm Cortex-A5 microcontroller that runs its own OS that is independent of the main system. This AMD Secure Processor is the backbone of AMD’s security push as it provides features such as key management and hardware root of trust for the platform.</p>

<p>AMD spends time <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-confirms-cts-labs-exploits-requiring-admin-access/">patching this solution</a>&nbsp;to make it more secure, but it is generally fairly hard to reach without some extremely low-level access in a system. We are going to come back to the “Enables hardware validated boot” line shortly, but it is important to understand that this secure processor underpins many of AMD’s best security features.</p>
<p>For example, at STH we use EPYC’s Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization heavily. With AMD EPYC, we do not have to manually manage keys. Instead, the ephemeral keys are managed for us by the AMD Secure Processor. This is the basis for what is really the building wave of confidential computing offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-cloud-confidential-computing-enabled-by-amd-epyc-sev/">Google Cloud Confidential Computing Enabled by AMD EPYC SEV</a>. Intel has its secure boot features and SGX that will be enhanced greatly with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake Xeons</a>, but for now, AMD has this capability while Intel does not. When big vendors say AMD is more secure, the AMD Secure Processor is a cornerstone of those offerings.</p>

<p>Let us discuss that “Enables hardware validated boot” line. While traditionally CPUs just fire up in whatever platform they are in, AMD has intelligence in their CPU due to the Arm-based AMD Secure Processor. EPYC CPUs are designed to be a bit more intelligent about the platforms they are in, and interact with server platform security to act as this root of trust that would not be possible if they effectively just booted up in any system.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from AMD describing the AMD Platform Secure Boot.</p>
<p><em>The AMD Platform Secure Boot Feature (PSB) is a mitigation for firmware Advanced Persistent Threats. It is a defense-in-depth feature. PSB extends AMD’s silicon root of trust to protect the OEM’s BIOS.&nbsp; This allows the OEM to establish an unbroken chain of trust from AMD’s silicon root of trust to the OEM’s BIOS using PSB, and then from the OEM’s BIOS to the OS Bootloader using UEFI secure boot. This provides a very powerful defense against remote attackers seeking to embed malware into a platform’s firmware.</em></p>
<p><em>An OEM who trusts only their own cryptographically signed BIOS code to run on their platforms will use a PSB enabled motherboard and set one-time-programmable fuses in the processor to bind the processor to the OEM’s firmware code signing key. AMD processors are shipped unlocked from the factory, and can initially be used with any OEM’s motherboard. But once they are used with a motherboard with PSB enabled, the security fuses will be set, and from that point on, that processor can only be used with motherboards that use the same code signing key. (<strong>Source</strong>: AMD statement to STH)</em></p>
<p>That is a lot to take in. We asked HPE about this. Their response mirrored what the above was describing. HPE firmware, when a system is first turned on, performs this binding process where the AMD EPYC CPU expects to see HPE signed firmware. If you alter the HPE firmware on the system, the check fails and the system will not work. That means if your HPE motherboard fails, you can replace it and put your CPU in another HPE motherboard with signed HPE firmware. It also means if the server platform’s firmware is not signed by HPE, the processor will see it as evidence of tampering and not work.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: 2020-09-09</strong> – HPE clarified that they are doing this in a different manner than Dell after initially confirming that they were using the AMD PSB feature. After this went live, HPE sent us the following:</p>
<p><em>HPE does not use the same security technique that Dell is using for a BIOS hardware root of trust. HPE does not burn, fuse, or permanently store our public key into AMD processors which ship with our products. HPE uses a unique approach to authenticate our BIOS and BMC firmware: HPE fuses our hardware – or silicon – root of trust into our own BMC silicon to ensure only authenticated firmware is executed.&nbsp; Thus, while we implement a hardware root of trust for our BIOS and BMC firmware, the processors that ship with our servers are not locked to our platforms. (<strong>Source</strong>: HPE)</em></p>
<p>What is at least interesting there is that HPE was initially claiming feature parity with Dell to us, and from the comments on this article were saying they used this feature in sales pitches, but now are saying they are not blowing the eFuses.</p>

<p>Here is where the concern develops, and not necessarily for AMD, the OEM, or most of the initial customer base. Customers want more security. The OEMs want to create a secure hardware environment because that is what their customers want. AMD is implementing an advanced security solution beyond what Intel Xeons have giving the OEMs and end-customers what they want. Effectively, when these are sold as new systems, this is exactly what everyone involved wants.</p>
<p>If everyone is getting what they want, then where is the concern, that is what we are going to cover next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Half-way through 2012, you’d have been forgiven for thinking that Facebook was doing a MySpace. In other words, Facebook was on a fast path to slow, painful decline.</p>
<p>Yahoo had just sued Facebook <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-facebook-lawsuit/yahoo-sues-facebook-for-infringing-10-patents-idUSBRE82B18M20120312">for patent infringement</a>. Zuck - like Steve Jobs before him - had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">bet too early</a> on the mobile web, and Facebook’s HTML5-powered apps were slow and buggy. Some argued that Zuck had overpaid for Instagram - $1billion for a 12 person company with no revenue, valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/right-before-acquisition-instagram-closed-50m-at-a-500m-valuation-from-sequoia-thrive-greylock-and-benchmark/">half that amount</a> a week before Facebook bought it.</p>
<p>The share price was tanking, having lost more than half its value just 3 months after going public. In Q3 2012 the company posted a net loss - it’s second quarter as a public company. And, though more than 50% of monthly active users visited Facebook on mobile, those users generated almost no advertising revenue.</p>
<p>If that wasn’t enough to finish Facebook off, advertisers weren’t exactly flocking to it, either.</p>
<p>Google’s search ads had earned a reputation as “the new standard” in the world of direct response advertising. They were easy to buy, easy to optimise, and it was easy enough to measure the impact of them. Google had tapped directly into a “standards-based” form of brand advertising, too. Adsense enabled advertisers to buy - through auction, at scale - display ads in standard IAB formats across hundreds of thousands of websites. Plug in your existing messages and creative, pick your audience, and go. SMBs loved it.</p>

<em>Exactly how many questions could be a in a Question ad?</em></p>

<p>In stark contrast, Facebook ads were almost impossible to buy. There were 27 different ad units to choose from. Facebook’s “Ads and Sponsored Stories Guide” was <a href="https://allfacebook.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Facebook-Ads-and-Sponsored-Stories-Guide-Januar-2013.pdf">45 pages long</a>. To ensure maximum reach to Facebook’s audience on desktop and mobile, advertisers were required to create a gazillion images of various different dimensions and ratios. An infestation of bugs paused ad campaigns for no discernable reason (usually on Fridays, for entire weekends). Even worse, GM - one of the biggest brand advertisers on Facebook - publicly said <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304192704577406394017764460">Facebook ads didn’t work</a>.</p>
<p>For a newly-listed company, with an advertising-based business model, the situation looked pretty bleak. Facebook was surely destined to join MySpace and Friendster in the dot-com deadpool.</p>
<p>Of course, as we now know, that never actually happened. Less than a year later, when Facebook announced Q2 2013 earnings, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/24/4553942/facebooks-q2-2013-earnings-beat-expectations-on-revenue-and-profit">stock shot up 21% in after hours trading</a> after an earnings beat. Mobile accounted for 41% of revenue, up from 30% the quarter before. Facebook reported its first quarter with over 1 million active advertisers. Advertising revenue in “International” markets (EMEA, APAC, and LATAM) was doubling year-over-year. ARPU - a helpful metric to understand advertising auction demand - was growing faster than ever ($1.60 in Q2 2013, it’s $7.26 today).</p>
<p>How the heck did that happen? Simple answer: some good old <a href="https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/wtf-is-a--platform/" title="What is a Platform?">platform thinking</a>. And rationalizing.</p>
<p>When Facebook’s Ads Product team solicited feedback from marketers, it came thick and fast. It wasn’t great. Creating campaigns was equally intimidating, confusing and time consuming. Marketers were already investing time and money to create “organic” content on Facebook, like Page Posts. Adding 27 ad formats to the mix would create additional “work-work” for them.</p>
<p>To build empathy with the people they were serving, Ads PMs started adding the likes of David Ogilvy and Marshall McLuhan to their “must read” lists. And they started talking to the Ads API ecosystem more. Turns out the “work-work” problem was affecting developers, too. There were multiple ways to do similar things - or the same thing - through Facebook’s Marketing APIs. Internal confusion had been externalised to them. Wasting time re-inventing the wheel and implementing a constant barrage of new, different ad formats ate up their innovation budget.</p>
<p>A simpler approach was required. Marketers, developers, and Facebook were counting on it.</p>

<em>Paul Adams (now SVP Product at Intercom) was a Facebook Ads PM around then, and used simple diagrams like this to explain the “messages, containers, channels” idea.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook’s Ads team quickly realised advertising on Facebook shouldn’t be all that different from advertising through any medium, old or new. It didn’t matter if was billboards, newspapers, magazines, leaflets, display ads, search ads, social ads, or emails, the basics were the same - marketers wanted to get messages in front of people, to drive a response.</p>
<p>The channels may vary, and containers within those channels may vary, but the messages and objectives were the same. And, of course, the best messages were those that started new relationships between businesses and customers.</p>
<p>This simple insight brought clarity to the conversation, and to the roadmap. Marketers were already creating “messages” on Facebook, after all - Page Posts. Instead of creating “ads” why not make it so that marketers could simply pay to get their existing messages in front of more people?</p>
<p>And, if these messages contained images - wasn’t that just the same thing as “ad creative?”</p>
<p>And, if these messages already appeared in users’ feeds, didn’t “feed” also mean “mobile feed”?</p>
<p>And, if marketers paid to promote these messages in “mobile feed,” aren’t they “mobile ads?”</p>
<p>The penny dropped.</p>
<p>For a self-proclaimed “platform company,” the approach to serving marketers and developers hadn’t been “platform-ey” at all. Lots of complexity, no consistency. Lots of distinct features were built, not rationalized capabilities. The feedback shared by marketers and developers was spot on - there <em>were</em> so many ways to do similar things - or the same thing - through every ads interface, not just Facebook’s APIs. An embarrassing oversight, but fixable with the right framework.</p>
<p>Changes came thick and fast. In June 2013, Fidji Simo penned - on behalf of the Ads Product team - “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2013/06/an-update-on-facebook-ads/">an update on Facebook Ads</a>.” She used words like <em>simplify</em>, <em>consistent</em>, <em>redundancies</em>, <em>streamline</em>, and <em>objectives</em> to describe what was changing. Messages and images would gracefully degrade, depending on where they were delivered to people. The number of ad units would be reduced from 27 to fewer than half of that. Her final sentence summarised the changes well:</p>
<p>“We think these updates will make it easier for them (marketers) to do what they do best: reach the right groups of people with the right message and drive the results they care most about.”</p>

<p><em>Different containers, different channels, same message.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To say that Fidji was right is a mild understatement. Since 2012, marketers have <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/2496/facebook-revenue-by-segment/">invested over $167billion in mobile advertising through Facebook</a>. In the 3rd quarter of 2019, mobile advertising represented 94% of Facebook’s overall advertising revenue. And, not all of that revenue came from the “big blue” Facebook app.</p>
<p>By simplifying the concept of a “message” reaching the “right groups of people” to “drive results,” advertisers could extend their advertising campaigns to Instagram and Facebook Audience Network with no additional effort. The messages they created would simply be presented in different types of containers, on different channels. When ads on Facebook Messenger appeared, the same messages created for Facebook and Instagram “gracefully degraded” to fit the containers on that new channel.</p>
<p>Even better, ads could quite literally be a new way to start a conversation with customers - through Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. It was easy. SMBs loved it.</p>
<p>It didn’t stop there - life for developers improved, too. The process of integrating with Facebook’s Ads APIs became easier, and - by rationalizing across interfaces, including APIs - developers had more headspace and capacity to innovate. New Facebook Marketing Partners emerged with innovative solutions. Some, like Wix, created solutions to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/07/14/wixs-integration-with-facebook-lets-you-create-page-post-ad-campaigns-via-wix-shoutout-newsletters/">extend the reach of email marketing campaigns to Facebook</a>. Others, like StitcherAds and Smartly.io enabled marketers to create <a href="https://stitcherads.com/digital-circulars/">digital circulars</a> and <a href="https://www.smartly.io/">data-fuelled ad creative</a>. As of March 2019, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2019/05/17/helsinki-born-kristo-ovaska-built-smartly-io-for-a-facebook-driven-ad-world/#799bce6d23df">almost $2 billion of Facebook’s annual revenue</a> flows through Smartly.io - just one partner, based in Finland. There are more like them.</p>
<p>Facebook may have solved the “reach the right groups of people with the right message” problem well for advertisers within their own walled garden, but that doesn’t mean they’ve solved it for every business in the world. These days, the volume of inbound and outbound messages - emails, SMS, WhatsApp, and the rest - is ever increasing. A challenge for everyone, not just marketers.</p>
<p>Every team, in every business, wrestles with an infinite stream of inbound messages, and outbound messages that need to land in various apps and inboxes, on a myriad of devices, formatted in different ways. The number of “channels” is exploding, not consolidating. These days, TikTok is the new Tencent, Twilio is the new Telephone. <a href="https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/browsers--not-apps--are-still-the-future-of-mobile/" title="Browsers, not apps, are still the future of mobile">WhatsApp and WeChat are the new browsers</a>. Email and SMS are alive and well. But, just like Facebook advertising back in the day, managing all of this can be equally intimidating, confusing and time consuming.</p>
<p>The likes of Twilio - now a $40billion market cap company - are using terms like <em>omni-channel</em>, <em>programmable conversations</em> and <em>conversational messaging</em> to describe their capability to process and route inbound messages to the right teams, and route outbound messages to recipients on the channels they are most engaged with. Channels they ingest from and output to include email, SMS, voice, WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, Telegram, and many, many more.</p>
<p>If this all sounds familiar, it’s because it should be. “Graceful degradation” and orchestration of inbound and outbound messages across channels is uncannily similar to the “platform thinking” Facebook applied to create an entirely new multi-billion dollar mobile ads business.</p>
<p>This challenge, by itself, creates a market opportunity far greater than Facebook or Google's market cap. These days, the opportunity can be sized in terms of $trillions, …</p></div></div></div></div>

                        <div><p>
                            There are a few reasons you may need to be able to prove who you are without revealing who you are.</p><p>
                            
                            Suppose you desire to share many different pieces of information online but must remain anonymous for security reasons. Since you are anonymous, you have no reputation online and therefore no trust or credibility.<br>
                            You can release one piece of information that will later prove to be true, thus gaining credibility for yourself. People will now take your information seriously, except you were fully anonymous, so that credibility is useless to you as you can't claim it in the future when sharing future information.<br>
                            What's worse, others may impersonate you, claiming to be the original author of the first piece of information, and then share bad information thus soiling all of the credibility you built up.</p><p>
                            
                            With AnoProof you can sign your first piece of information with an AnoProof signature using your AnoProof secret key.<br>
                            Now, once it gains credibility, you can sign your future informations with your same secret key.<br>
                            Using AnoProof, anyone can verify that the future information (signed) was authored by the same anonymous author as the original credible information.
                            </p></div><hr>
                            <p>
                            AnoProof doesn't always have to be used anonymously, another great use-case for AnoProof is in proving your known identity, online, in an ever increasing world of spoofing, deep-fakes, and general impersonation.</p><p>
                            
                            Consider the <a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/leoni-ag-email-scam-40-million-ceo-hack-september-2016/">case of Leoni AG</a>, in which the CEO instructed the CFO to wire transfer $40m to an offshore account, the only problem for the CFO, it wasn't a true eMail from the CEO, it was a hacker pretending to be the CEO.<br>
                            Had the company policy been that all instructions of such nature must be signed with an AnoProof signature, the CFO could have easily proven that the hackers weren't the CEO.</p><p>
                            
                            This example was just a simple eMail spoofing, but imagine a few years from now when DeepFakes, SIM spoofing, and a combination of other tools will allow a hacker to video call one of your employees, and pretend to be you not only with caller ID but visibly and audibly as well.<br>
                            Signing protocols like AnoProof will become more and more necessary in the identity verification crisis realm AI will bring us towards.</p><hr>
                            <p>
                            To use AnoProof, simply paste, verbatim, two messages that have AnoProof signatures, in the text boxes at the bottom of this page, then tap the 'Verify' button.</p><p>

<p><em>Written by Cody Burkard, Senior Security Consultant, mnemonic</em></p>

<h2>Tl;dr</h2>
<p>mnemonic researchers have discovered a new technique for escalating privileges within Azure environments through the abuse of dynamic groups in Azure Active Directory. Organizations that employ dynamic groups for assigning user roles and rights should review their Azure Active Directory configuration to ensure they are not susceptible to this attack.</p>

<h2>Cloud security != On-prem security</h2>
<p>As organizations continue to migrate parts or all of their infrastructure to the cloud, security personnel need to adapt and understand the threats related to this cloud transition. At first glance, this doesn’t appear all too complicated, and security teams can take similar approaches to networking security as they have in traditional on-premise networks: VPNs for connectivity, network segmentation, network security appliances, agents, hardened virtual machines, etc. While these are all valid security measures for cloud infrastructure, they don’t address security concerns related to the management of infrastructure and users in the cloud.</p>
<p>For example, consider an adversary that is targeting a VM on an internal Azure network. The adversary cannot gain network access to the private Azure VNet that the VM resides on, but finds the password to an account in Azure AD. If the compromised user account has access to modify the infrastructure within Azure, they can bypass network and host-level security controls. The adversary could simply update the VM so that they may access it, or directly execute code on it. This scenario is shown below:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/contentassets/1e70019b2fd44c0eaba8f5e8a3a88fff/managementplaneattack-1.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/contentassets/1e70019b2fd44c0eaba8f5e8a3a88fff/managementplaneattack-1.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>This is a very simple example of pivoting into infrastructure through Azure’s “management plane”, which is used by legitimate users to manage infrastructure. This scenario is dependent on an adversary compromising an account in AAD that has privileges to run commands on VMs within the Azure infrastructure.</p>
<p>This may seem like a somewhat naïve and simple example given the requirement for a pre-compromised AAD account with special permissions in Azure. However, commonly successful techniques such as phishing, password cracking or identification of leaked secrets can lead to the compromise of an AAD account. If an account compromised using one of those techniques does not have administrative permissions, then the goal of the adversary is to identify some privileged escalation that helps them gain higher permissions.</p>
<p>The remainder of this blog post focuses on the topic of elevating privileges in Azure infrastructure with a previously compromised Azure AD account. A full summary of previous work on this topic will be contained in a future post, whereas this post will focus on a new technique targeting AAD dynamic groups.</p>

<h2>Some background on Azure Active Directory</h2>
<p>Let’s start by clearing the air about Azure vs Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD).</p>
<p>When we talk about Azure, many folks jump straight to thinking about Azure Active Directory, or even Office 365. This is a common point of confusion. Microsoft has a large cloud ecosystem that is tied together with identity management and authentication through Azure Active Directory.</p>
<p>Azure Active Directory uses “tenants” to represent different organizations and environments within a company’s Microsoft cloud ecosystem, and includes a collection of users, groups and rights.&nbsp; Any one tenant may be connected to a single Office365 account, any number of Azure subscriptions, Dynamics365, Outlook, and other Microsoft cloud services.</p>
<p>So while the same Azure AD users may be used for all of these services, Azure AD is <em>not</em> a part of Azure nor a part of Office 365. Azure AD is a separate entity that handles user management and authentication, and has tight integrations with other Microsoft services.</p>
<p>With this straight, let’s briefly cover a few other basic topics that are relevant for the privilege escalation technique.</p>
<h3><strong>Azure AD Roles</strong></h3>
<p>Roles in Azure AD are top-level roles in the Microsoft Azure AD tenant for Azure AD users. At the time of writing this article, the assignment of some admin roles to Service Principal objects is also in preview. Azure AD roles allow users or service principals to perform actions including, but not limited, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing security groups</li>
<li>Managing users</li>
<li>Accessing Azure infrastructure</li>
<li>Creating and managing Azure AD applications (Service Principals)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot illustrates some of these Azure AD Roles in Azure Portal:&nbsp;</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/azure-2.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/azure-2.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<h3><strong>Azure RBAC Roles</strong></h3>
<p>Azure RBAC (role-based access control) roles govern access to the infrastructure deployed within Azure. This is a large and complicated topic, but the important thing to understand here is that RBAC roles determine what actions an Azure AD principal can take on specific resources deployed in Azure. For example, to deploy a VM, a user must be assigned an RBAC role that includes that action, such as owner or contributor.</p>
<h3><strong>Azure AD Security Groups</strong></h3>
<p>In Azure AD, users can be added into logical groups to help with user and access management. Azure RBAC roles and Azure AD roles can then be assigned to these groups (Azure AD role assignments to groups is in preview at the time of writing). This means that any user that is added to a group will then inherit the roles assigned to that group.</p>

<h2>The technique – abusing dynamic groups</h2>
<p>While researching and testing Azure deployments, I stumbled upon an interesting privilege escalation vector: the abuse of dynamic groups in Azure AD.</p>
<h3><strong>What are dynamic groups?</strong></h3>
<p>Dynamic groups in Azure AD allow administrators to automatically assign group memberships to users based on attributes of that user. For example, if a company has two offices in Oslo and London, they may create security groups for each of their offices. They can use dynamic groups based on the user’s “city” attribute for this purpose, so that whenever a new user is added to Azure AD, they will automatically be added to one of these two groups.</p>
<p>The following picture shows how you would do this with a dynamic group rule:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-3.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-3.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>This use case is fairly innocent. But let’s think of a more security sensitive case.</p>
<h3><strong>A real-world scenario for the attack</strong></h3>
<p>An organization creates a dynamic group called VM Contributors, which has VM Contributor Access scoped to the subscription:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-4.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-4.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now, this organization outsources all VM management to a company called “Bluefish”, and Bluefish uses the following naming convention:</p>

<p>To automate the process of Bluefish users being assigned VM Contributor, a rule is added to dynamically add any user with “bluefish” in the userPrincipalName (UPN) to the VM Contributor group. Seems reasonable and innocuous, since users cannot modify their UPN without appropriate access rights, and the organization has locked these down.</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-5.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-5.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<h3><strong>Time to escalate some privileges</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s assume for our scenario that an adversary gains access to a low-privileged user in Azure AD, which resides in no groups or Azure RBAC roles. The compromised user has the “Global Reader” role, so the attacker can read configurations in the directory, but cannot change settings, and therefore cannot use traditional methods to change access rights to their own user, or to other users.</p>
<p>The attacker finds the dynamic membership rule, and wants to find a way to trigger the dynamic rule for an account they control. In short, the attacker needs to get the name “bluefish” in the UPN attribute of their user:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/userprofile-6.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/userprofile-6.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Since users with the Global Reader role cannot edit any configurations, the attacker cannot edit their own UPN and is stuck.</p>
<h3><strong>UPN</strong></h3>
<p>User Principal Names are based on user email addresses. I have identified dynamic groups based on this attribute in the past, and on the surface seems to be okay because users generally cannot change their own email addresses. This requires administrative privileges within Azure AD and a role such as “User Administrator”. However, there is a way around this…</p>
<h3><strong>Abusing Guest Accounts</strong></h3>
<p>By default, users in Azure AD can invite guest users to the directory. Since the UPN of a guest user is still based on email addresses, an adversary can simply create a new email address from any email provider, such as Gmail, that contains “bluefish” in the address. For example:</p>

<p>If the attacker invites this email to the azure tenant:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/inviteguestuser-7.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/inviteguestuser-7.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>And then accepts the invite, the user will become a user in the local directory with an interesting UPN:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/newuser-8.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/newuser-8.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now we can go into the portal and check our group assignments:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/groupmembership-9.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/groupmembership-9.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now the attacker has access to the testDynamicGroup, which assigns the VM contributor role through a dynamic group membership.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>The attacker starts with a Global Reader in Azure AD</li>
<li>The attacker finds a dynamic group with the VM Contributor role assigned
<ol>
<li>Membership is dynamic based on the string “bluefish” existing in the UPN</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The attacker can invite guests, as per the default setting</li>
<li>The attacker invites a guest Gmail account with bluefish in the address - <span data-e="D8B5B7BBF6B4B1B9B5BF98B0ABB1BEBDADB4BABCAAB9B3AAADBABCBB"></span></li>
<li>The guest account triggers the dynamic group after accepting, and inherits the VM Contributor role in Azure RBAC</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Notes on dynamic group abuse</strong></h3>
<p>In this example, we show how dynamic groups based on a UPN can be abused using a guest account. However, there are many other attributes for determining dynamic group membership, and different types of attackers could abuse each. <strong>When setting up dynamic groups, consider whether lower privileged users or external attackers could modify the attributes that define that group.</strong></p>
<p>The following are other potential attack paths to modify user attributes on dynamic groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>AD Connect Sync – An attacker may modify user attributes in an on-premise system, and Azure AD Connect …</li></ul></div></div>

<a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a>. We won't go into detail about the design or
architecture of NestJS applications specifically, so if you're unfamiliar with
the framework I'd recommend you check out its docs first, or simply skip to
another one of our
<a href="https://github.com/architect-team/architect-cli/tree/master/examples/react-app">Node.js samples</a>
that uses <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> directly.</p>

<p>NestJS is an opinionated framework for developing server-side Node.js
applications, including, but not limited to, microservices. Their default walk
throughs and tutorials all show how to create and operate a REST API using
NestJS, but in this tutorial we'll show how to use some of their other helpful
microservice libraries to create and operate a TCP-based microservice.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.architect.io/images/blog/nestjs-microservices-simple/tcp-services.png" alt="TCP services"></p>
<p>To start, let's download NestJS's CLI to help us bootstrap our new microservice
project. The CLI will do all the work to build the project skeleton making it a
lot easier for us to make the changes we need:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new nestjs-microservice</code></pre></div>
<p>Once the application has been fully initialized, we're going to install the
NestJS microservices library to help us modify the boilerplate application from
an http-based REST API to a TCP-based microservice:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> i --save @nestjs/microservices</code></pre></div>
<p>Once installed, go ahead and replace the contents of your <code>src/main.ts</code> file
with the following:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> NestFactory <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/core'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> Transport <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> AppModule <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'src/app.module'</span><span>;</span>

<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>bootstrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      host<span>:</span> <span>'0.0.0.0'</span><span>,</span>
      port<span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>await</span> app<span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'Microservice listening on port:'</span><span>,</span> port<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>bootstrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you're already familiar with NestJS, this file should be easy to read
through. The only unique part is how we're initializing the application –
instead of using the default <code>NestFactory.create()</code> method, we're using
<code>NestFactory.createMicroservice()</code> which provides us additional controls over
the protocols and contracts our application responds to:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>const</span> app <span>=</span> <span>await</span> NestFactory<span>.</span><span>createMicroservice</span><span>(</span>AppModule<span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  transport<span>:</span> Transport<span>.</span><span>TCP</span><span>,</span>
  options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    host<span>:</span> <span>'0.0.0.0'</span><span>,</span>
    port<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above snippet, we're declaring that our microservice responds to <code>TCP</code>
requests and listens on our configurable port (defaults to <code>8080</code>). This means
our service won't be a REST API, but will respond to a more raw request format.</p>
<p>Next, let's take a look at the generated controller which defines the routes and
methods our API responds to, <code>src/app.controller.ts</code>. Since our microservices
responds to TCP requests instead of HTTP, we'll need to change the annotations
on our controller methods to respond to more relevant request structures. Go
ahead and paste the contents below into the file:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Controller <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/common'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> MessagePattern <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>

@<span>Controller</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppController</span> <span>{</span>
  @<span>MessagePattern</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> cmd<span>:</span> <span>'hello'</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>hello</span><span>(</span>input<span>?</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Hello, </span><span><span>${</span>input <span>||</span> <span>'there'</span><span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the way we define and annotate NestJS controllers remains the
same as the generated project code, but the way we annotate methods within our
controllers is different. Instead of using <code>@Get()</code>, <code>@Post()</code>, and other
http-specific annotations, we define our TCP interfaces using
<code>@MessagePattern()</code> – an annotation that maps controller methods to incoming
requests so long as they match the provided pattern. In our case, we've defined
the pattern to be any request that contains <code>{ cmd: 'hello' }</code>. We also expect
the request payload to be an optional string that will be used to enrich our
response:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>hello</span><span>(</span>input<span>?</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Hello, </span><span><span>${</span>input <span>||</span> <span>'there'</span><span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Great! Now let's make sure our microservice will start up. Our NestJS project
came pre-baked with a <code>package.json</code> file that includes all the appropriate
start commands, so let's use the one designed for local development:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> run start:dev
<span>[</span><span>5</span>:41:22 PM<span>]</span> Starting compilation <span>in</span> <span>watch</span> mode<span>..</span>.
<span>[</span><span>5</span>:41:27 PM<span>]</span> Found <span>0</span> errors. Watching <span>for</span> <span>file</span> changes.

<span>[</span>Nest<span>]</span> <span>6361</span>   - 08/31/2020, <span>5</span>:41:28 PM   <span>[</span>InstanceLoader<span>]</span> AppModule dependencies initialized +20ms

Microservice listening on port: <span>8080</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we know the application boots correctly, let's build a <code>Dockerfile</code> for
the service. Creating a <code>Dockerfile</code> will allow our service to be built into a
portable, scalable image that anyone (or any machine) can run consistently
without issues. This means we'll be able to run it ourselves in a stable virtual
environment, we'll be able to hand it off to team members to test more easily,
and we'll be able to deploy it to production-grade environments with ease.</p>
<p>Our <code>Dockerfile</code> will inherit from an open-source node image, install npm
modules, and will run our <code>npm run build</code> command to transpile our typescript
and minimize the code footprint. Simple copy the file contents</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code>
<span>FROM</span> node<span>:</span>13
<span>WORKDIR</span> /usr/src/app


<span>COPY</span> package*.json tsconfig*.json ./
<span>RUN</span> npm install


<span>COPY</span> src/ src/


<span>RUN</span> npm run build


<span>RUN</span> rm <span>-</span>r src


<span>CMD</span> <span>[</span><span>"npm"</span><span>,</span> <span>"run"</span><span>,</span> <span>"start:prod"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="creating-a-client-service"><a href="#creating-a-client-service" aria-label="creating a client service permalink"></a>Creating a client service</h2>
<p>Knowing that our microservice is booting up properly is great, but the best way
to test it in a practical setting is to see if we can extend it from another
microservice. So let's go ahead and create one!</p>
<p>Just like with the previous service, let's start by creating a new NestJS
project:</p>

<p>Let's also install two additional NestJS libraries. The first is the config
library to make it easier to parse and manage application variables, and the
second is the microservices library which contains several helper methods that
can be used to more easily access other NestJS microservices:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> i --save @nestjs/config @nestjs/microservices</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have our required libraries installed, let's use them both together
to create a client service for accessing the microservice we created in the
previous step. Open up <code>src/app.module.ts</code> and paste in the following contents:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Module <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/common'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> ConfigModule<span>,</span> ConfigService <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/config'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> ClientProxyFactory<span>,</span> Transport <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> AppController <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./app.controller'</span><span>;</span>

@<span>Module</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  imports<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigModule<span>.</span><span>forRoot</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  controllers<span>:</span> <span>[</span>AppController<span>]</span><span>,</span>
  providers<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      provide<span>:</span> <span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>,</span>
      inject<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigService<span>]</span><span>,</span>
      <span>useFactory</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>configService<span>:</span> ConfigService</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        ClientProxyFactory<span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
          transport<span>:</span> Transport<span>.</span><span>TCP</span><span>,</span>
          options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            host<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_HOST'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
            port<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_PORT'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
          <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppModule</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first thing to note from the file contents above is the import of the config
module. This import allows the <code>ConfigService</code> to be utilized throughout our
application module:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code>imports<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigModule<span>.</span><span>forRoot</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The next addition to the file is the <code>HELLO_SERVICE</code> provider. This is where we
use <code>ClientProxyFactory</code> from the nest microservices library to create a service
that allows us to make calls to our other microservice:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  provide<span>:</span> <span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>,</span>
  inject<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigService<span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>useFactory</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>configService<span>:</span> ConfigService</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> ClientProxyFactory<span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    transport<span>:</span> Transport<span>.</span><span>TCP</span><span>,</span>
    options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      host<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_HOST'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
      port<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_PORT'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above snippet, we're registering a <code>ClientProxy</code> instance to the provider
key <code>HELLO_SERVICE</code> that points to <code>HELLO_SERVICE_HOST</code> listening on
<code>HELLO_SERVICE_PORT</code>. These two values come from the ConfigService we imported
earlier, and the values are loaded up from environment parameters. This kind pf
parameterization is crucial to enable us to run the service in multiple
environments (like dev, staging, and production) without code changes.</p>
<p>Now that we've successfully created our proxy instance, let's open up
<code>src/app.controller.ts</code> and set it up with our proxy methods. Paste the
following content into the file:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Controller<span>,</span> Get<span>,</span> Inject<span>,</span> Param <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/common'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> ClientProxy <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>

@<span>Controller</span><span>(</span><span>'hello'</span><span>)</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppController</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>@<span>Inject</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>)</span> <span>private</span> client<span>:</span> ClientProxy<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

  @<span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>':name'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>getHelloByName</span><span>(</span>@<span>Param</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>)</span> name <span>=</span> <span>'there'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>client<span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> cmd<span>:</span> <span>'hello'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first thing you'll see is that we've injected an instance of our client
proxy into the controller. We registered with client under the key
<code>HELLO_SERVICE</code>, so this is the key we use to indicate which client instance we
want injected:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>constructor</span><span>(</span>
  @<span>Inject</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>)</span> <span>private</span> client<span>:</span> ClientProxy
<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Armed with a client that points to our TCP microservice, we can start sending
requests that match the <code>@MessagePattern</code> we defined in the service:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code>@<span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>':name'</span><span>)</span>
<span>getHelloByName</span><span>(</span>@<span>Para…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

But hold on. The argument for taking Vitamin D assumes a few things. First, that low Vitamin D actually causes all of the conditions it is associated with. This is not necessarily true. Low Vitamin D could cause (or contribute to) heart disease, but it could also be that heart disease causes low Vitamin D. Another possibility is that some third factor causes both low Vitamin D and heart disease. </p><p id="viewer-9g65f">Even if we can prove some causation, we then need to assume that correcting the Vitamin D deficiency will prevent the disease. This may not be true either. Low Vitamin D may be an indicator of overall poor health, which increases the risk for cardiac disease. It could appear that low Vitamin D contributes to the condition. But raising the Vitamin D will not help because it will just fix the symptom, not the underlying problem. </p><h3 id="viewer-399rj"><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-4p68a">Fortunately we have studies that can help figure this out. Currently the best way to answer a question of clinical relevance is with a large, well-executed <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT).</strong> An RCT works like this: enroll the participants you want to study and randomly assign half of them to receive a treatment and the other half to receive a placebo. Those receiving the treatment are called the intervention group. The other group is the control group. Ideally, the two groups will be similar in every way except the treatment – they will have the same distribution in age, income, race, gender, and health status. They will even receive pills that look identical, though half will be placebos. If, at the end of the study, there are differences between the two groups, we can attribute those differences to the treatment. </p><div id="viewer-3aoj5"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Simple randomized controlled trial "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1674,h_920,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Simple randomized controlled trial "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">Simple randomized controlled trial</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-fvrr">RCTs are costly and time intensive, so generally we will only be able to study the interventions and outcomes that have the highest chance of showing a benefit. We base this on prior studies; if several large observational studies show a correlation between Vitamin D and heart disease, then this is something we should study with an RCT. </p><p id="viewer-1ofc5">
We now have results for over 1500 RCTs on Vitamin D supplementation. Some of the largest and most significant trials are listed and summarized at the end of this article. When tested on its ability to prevent disease, <strong>Vitamin D has failed to live up to expectations</strong>. </p><div id="viewer-b7fav"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Results of Vitamin D Trials "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1206,h_878,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Results of Vitamin D Trials "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">For more details, see the list of high-quality RCTs at the bottom of this page</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-en75e">One of the largest and best studies we have is called <a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VITAL</u></a>, led by Dr. JoAnn Manson at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Over 25,000 adults (men age 50 and older, women age 55 and older) with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer participated in the study. They received either 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 or placebo daily for five years. Researchers evaluated the rates of cancer and major cardiovascular events including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. </p><p id="viewer-f6k24"><strong>The result: Vitamin D failed to prevent cancer, stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death. </strong>These conditions occurred at the same rate in those receiving Vitamin D and those receiving placebo. There was one positive finding, though: in a post hoc analysis, it seemed that Vitamin D decreased the mortality from cancer when the initial two years were excluded. Post hoc (“after the event”) analyses can be quite useful, but need to be viewed with some skepticism. In high-quality RCTs (like VITAL), the outcome measures and statistical analyses are specified prior to data collection. Sometimes, as in VITAL’s case, an unexpected outcome may appear at the time the data are evaluated, prompting a post hoc analysis. In this case, when results from the first two years were excluded, the rate of cancer death was 1.2% in the placebo group, and 0.9% in the Vitamin D group - 25% reduction in cancer mortality, though the absolute numbers were low. It is not possible to draw too many conclusions from this, but it is something to note for future studies. </p><p id="viewer-3cooc"><strong>Even in studies of bone health, Vitamin D has been disappointing.</strong> We already know that Vitamin D is essential in calcium metabolism, and Vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets and osteomalacia. Taking Vitamin D to treat severe Vitamin D deficiency is necessary for the treatment of these conditions. But in the large trials looking at Vitamin D's ability to prevent bone loss, the participants were taken from the general population, many of whom had normal Vitamin D levels. For severely deficient individuals (only a small percentage of the population), there are clear benefits to supplementation. These benefits do not appear to extend to those with normal levels or mild deficiencies.</p><h3 id="viewer-ct6r5"><strong>Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ek5t0">Large randomized controlled trials are currently the best way to evaluate a treatment, but they are difficult to do. If done well, an RCT is expensive, time intensive, and challenging to coordinate. It is worth it if we can answer our question adequately, but sometimes we realize after the trial that we needed to account for something else, or that we need more people in the study before we can really answer our question. In addition, RCTs will not always give definitive answers. Sometimes two or more small trials of the same treatment will show opposite results, and we need to reconcile those. Simply redoing an RCT is usually not an option. Instead, scientists have developed a method of combining similar RCTs and analyzing them together, in what is called a meta-analysis. </p><p id="viewer-ab05u">Meta-analyses have exploded in popularity over the last few decades.<span> If done well, a meta-analysis of a group of trials can reveal insights that cannot be seen in the individual trials. Unfortunately there are potential problems. The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality of the studies it includes, which can lead to erroneous results when poor quality studies are present (garbage in, garbage out).</span></p><p id="viewer-9nlvf"><span>In addition, <strong>publication bias</strong> may incorrectly amplify a treatment effect. Publication bias occurs when researchers decide to publish only “positive” findings – studies that show a treatment effect. Suppose ten small trials of Vitamin D are performed. Five show a benefit to Vitamin D and five do not. Researchers and journals are much more inclined to publish positive results than negative, so it is possible that only the five positive studies will make it into the medical literature. A meta-analysis on the five published positive studies will show a much stronger effect of Vitamin D than a meta-analysis that included all ten studies. </span></p><div id="viewer-9ul9t"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_373,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a6n1n"> <em>Where negative studies go to die. </em></p><p id="viewer-a6bj6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosenthal_(psychologist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Robert Rosenthal </u></em></a><em>called publication bias "the file drawer problem" because important negative studies often end up here.

One of the major challenges in performing these analyses is deciding which studies to include or exclude. Ideally only high-quality, well-designed, well-executed studies will be included.

<p>I have recently come into possession of a series of exquisite miniatures which I pray are worthy of your esteemed attention. While my employers are familiar with your <em>unusual tastes</em>, they also appreciate your desire for privacy- this showing was arranged with the utmost discretion, I assure you.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, the pieces might <em>appear</em> remarkably similar. Each canvas is a digitally-reproduced composition measuring ten pixels in height and ten pixels in width, illuminated in a strikingly intense blue.</p>

<p>To an, ahem, <em>avid collector</em> such as yourself, it is no doubt obvious that each print possesses unique <em>qualia</em>, as expounded upon by the artist’s extensive footnotes. Please, take as long as you need…</p>

<figcaption>Becoming and Unbecoming. Macintosh Operating System 10.14.6, Preview.App 10.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist used a carefully selected vintage of the <em>Macintosh</em> operating system. The desktop wallpaper color was customized to consist entirely of the desired blue, and then the <em>Preview</em> application was employed to take a screenshot and perform the necessary trimming. Tragically, <em>Preview</em> cannot save files in the <em>Graphics Interchange Format</em> (GIF).</p>

<figcaption>Pointillism I. Sublime Text 3.2.2, ImageMagick 7.0.8–59</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist manually constructed the image in the <em>Portable PixMap</em> (PPM) format using the <em>Sublime</em> text editor, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>P3

<p>The <em>ImageMagick</em> application was then used to convert it into a GIF file:</p>

<pre><code>$ convert ii.ppm ii.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Pointillism II. Vim 8.0.1365, FFmpeg 4.1.4</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For this piece, the artist once again created a PPM image, this time using the <em>Vi, Improved</em> text editor, giving the source code a subtly crisper affect:</p>

<pre><code>P3

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group</em> application was then used to generate a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i iii.ppm iii.gif
</code></pre>

<figure>

<figcaption>Searing Light. Nano 2.0.6, POV-Ray 3.7.0</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist composed this piece using the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> language, composing the following script in the <em>Nano’s Another</em> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>background { rgb &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>The scene was then raytraced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ povray +Iiv.pov +W10 +H10 +Oiv
</code></pre>

<p>As with <em>Preview</em> above, the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> is intentionally designed not to support the creation of GIF files; output is a <em>Portable Network Graphics</em> file instead.</p>

<figcaption>The Cobbler. Sublime Text 3.2.2, as 10.0.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This image was composed by the <em>Macintosh Operating System X Mach-O Gnu’s Not Unix-based assembler</em>, a utility for the creation of binary files. The <em>Sublime</em> text editor was once again employed for its neutral tone:</p>

<pre><code>.ascii "GIF89a" # magic number
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0xF0     # 2-entry global color table
.byte  0        # background color index
.byte  0        # 1:1 pixel aspect ratio

.byte  0x00     # color 0: blue
.byte  0x00
.byte  0xFF
.byte  0x00     # color 1: black
.byte  0x00
.byte  0x00

.ascii ","      # image descriptor
.long  0        # x/y offsets
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0        # no local colortable
.byte  0        # minimum LZW code size
.byte  0        # end of frame

.ascii ";"      # finish
</code></pre>

<p>Curiously, the output of this assembler is prefaced with an entirely useless header, which must then be trimmed. (Hopefully future revisions of the tool will correct this obvious usability gaffe!) The composition was thus carried out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ as v.s -o assembled.o
$ dd bs=1 skip=208 if=assembled.o of=v.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Camera Obscura. oK, iKe, Safari 12.1.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, the artist employed the <em>Interactive K Environment</em> (iKe), a tool based around the unfathomably esoteric programming language <em>K</em>. The tool can be used to save animated GIF images of program output; in this case, a single frame as indicated by <code>fc:1</code>. Note that <em>iKe</em> automatically doubles the size of pixels within images when rendering.</p>

<pre><code>w:h:5
fc:1
draw:{,(;,"blue";5 5#0)}
</code></pre>

<p>For this work, the artist composed an electronic mail message to a colleague as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Dear [REDACTED],
I pray this letter finds you well.

I am in grave need of your assistance. I require an opaque image file in the .GIF format,
measuring precisely 10 pixels square, consisting entirely of the hexadecimal RGB color #0000FF.
If you could provide me with such a file as an attachment, I would be immensely grateful.

Warmest Regards,
[REDACTED]

(P.S. This will make more sense later.)
</code></pre>

<p>Some time later, the artist used their electronic mail client to save the final print.</p>

<!-- For the record, this GIF was created in the Windows version of Krita 4.30. Thanks, Michal! -->

</figure>

<p>Here, the artist constructed a virtual machine- a sort of computing matryoshka, if you will- running the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution of the <em>Linux</em> operating system. They then proceeded to install the <em>GIMP</em> application. Despite frequent threats by the developers to remove them, the <em>GIMP</em> application had (at time of composition) some obscure and infrequently-used features permitting the creation and manipulation of image files. After its painstaking creation, the file was then transferred between the virtual machine and its host by way of a physical Universal Serial Bus mass-storage device. The mass-storage device was prepared in advance by formatting it with the 32-bit <em>File Allocation Table</em> filesystem and labeling it <em>Charon</em>, in recognition of its role in transporting the soul of the artwork between worlds.</p>

<figcaption>Composition in Blue and Blue. Gnuplot 5.2, Sublime Text 3.2.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist generated this work using the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em>, based on the following description:</p>

<pre><code>set terminal gif size 10,10
set output 'ix.gif'
set margins 0,0,0,0
unset key
unset tics
unset border
unset label
set style rectangle fs border lc rgb 'blue'
set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb 'blue' behind
plot 1 lt rgb 'blue'
</code></pre>

<p>Note in particular how easily a user of the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em> may customize the background color of a plot. The plot description may then be rendered as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ gnuplot ix.gp 
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-382" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Lots of applications require a Postgres database. Before you can install them, you will need a Postgres database. How do you pick the right Postgres for your application? There are a bewildering variety of possible ways to acquire a database running on a Postgres instance, but the biggest choice is “build or buy”: whether to install a Postgres version on your own or to purchase it as a service.</p><p>lakeFS is yet another Postgres application, so it requires a Postgres database. At Treeverse we decided for now to buy Postgres as a service. I’ll explain the factors why we decided, and how you might decide to whether or not to follow us.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#got-a-postgres"></a>Got a Postgres?</h2><p>If your organization already runs Postgres instances, they may well be the best choice: there can be extensive in-house experience and expertise already present. And you probably don’t need this guide.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#expensive-as-a-service"></a>Expensive as a Service?</h2><p>The most common objection to buying a database as a service is sheer price: a DB instance from your cloud provider can cost more than&nbsp;<em>twice</em>&nbsp;the cost of the virtual machine instance that it runs on. Obviously you pay extra to get much more than just the virtualized resources: you get expertise, much of the ops, easier backup and clustering, sometimes even some features.</p><p>For pricing I believe we should prefer to&nbsp;<em>buy</em>&nbsp;what is not a core part of our business. Pricing can actually make this decision easy. If the cost of buying Postgres as a service is a significant expenditure, then necessarily it is a core part of business — and clearly we need to develop the requisite in-house capability to support it. Otherwise cost is not a driving factor in the decision.</p><p>Even if you decide Postgres is a core capability for your organization, you may wish buy Postgres as a service for an initial ramp-up period, planning to move away later. While migrating database installations generally requires some downtime, this too is often a good choice.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#choices"></a>Choices</h2><p>Every cloud provider provides managed Postgres as a service:</p><ul><li>AWS provide RDS as well as clustered Postgres-compatible Aurora;</li><li>Azure provide Azure Database for PostgreSQL;</li><li>GCP provide Postgres on Cloud SQL</li></ul><p>Similarly, some hosting providers also have a Postgres as a service offering. If you are already using a hosting provider that offers Postgres — Heroku is one example — this can be a convenient choice.</p><p>Postgres maintain a page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/professional_hosting/">PostgreSQL: Hosting Providers</a>&nbsp;that list a wide range of options for purchasing hosted solutions along with support. Additionally, many hosted application platforms offer Postgres.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#expertise-and-ops"></a>Expertise and Ops</h2><p>Developing in-house expertise is often desirable, and not only as a means to save costs. For instance, by allowing rapid resolution of issues without having to go outside the organization, expertise reduces risk.</p><p>On the flip side, managing your in-house database carries an ops burden, which will include monitoring, backup, clustering, and versioning. The last can be particularly troubling: occasionally you&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;need to upgrade Postgres on a running system.</p><p>A middle ground between buying a service and building it yourself is to contract the setup but manage ops in-house. I believe that unless you do database-related development, databases are generally a poor fit for this middle ground alternative. Contracting only the setup means you will take longer to build expertise in the database. Meanwhile you already start carrying the ops burden of the database.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#versions-and-extensions"></a>Versions and Extensions</h2><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#versions"></a>Versions</h3><p>Buying from a large service provider appears to limit available versions. Currently, for example, the latest supported Postgres version is 12.4; the major release Postgres 12 was on 2019-10-03. Service providers have been slow to provide version 12:</p><ul><li>AWS RDS started supporting Postgres version 12 on 2020-03-31, and supports Postgres versions 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10, and 11; however Aurora clusters do not support version 12 yet;</li><li>Azure still supports only versions 9.5, 9.6, 10.11, and 11.6;</li><li>GCP started providing Postgres version 12 on 2020-05-21;</li><li>ElephantSQL supports Postgres version 12, but the free tier provides version 11.9.</li></ul><p>At the same time service providers can upgrade Postgres (and underlying OS) versions more transparently. This can be particularly useful for receiving patch releases. So low availability of newer Postgres versions is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a significant detriment. Of course, certain applications may require an absolutely latest version of Postgres, which may make it impossible to buy Postgres service.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#extensions"></a>Extensions</h3><p>Numerous extensions are available for Postgres. Service providers provide the most popular of these. But they cannot provide all of them, and typically it is not possible to install new extensions that require compilation.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#applicability-to-lakefs"></a>Applicability to lakeFS</h3><p>To allow users flexibility, lakeFS requires only Postgres 11. So availability of versions and extensions does not influence choice of provider for a database intended to run only lakeFS.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#provisioning"></a>Provisioning</h2><p>Creating a new database instance with a service provider requires plenty of time. For example, on AWS RDS creating a small empty database instance can take 10 minutes. This is very reasonable for one-time setup of long-lived production and even staging environments.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#fast-setup-of-small-databases"></a>Fast setup of small databases</h3><p>For short-lived environments or for testing, it can take too long to set up a hosted database. Luckily Postgres is an isolated component and one installation may easily be replaced with another installation. If the database is small and the generated data is not particularly valuable then there are good alternatives with quick setup times. These include creating a new database on an existing Postgres database instance or even — when database instance performance is not critical — running a database instance inside a container. If you have permission to create a new database, both of these alternatives have equivalent setup times that are typically less than a second.</p><p>Using an existing database instance allows you to take advantage of existing setup and ops on that database instance. For example, it will be easy to backup your new database if the database already has backups, and clustering exists at the instance level. By the same token, an existing database instance will offer significantly lower isolation than a container.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>An example of creating new databases inside an existing database instance is the ElephantSQL free tier: you are allocated a database inside an existing instance and can see that other databases exist inside that instance. It uses Postgres roles to prevent data leakage (a side effect is that some operations are impossible, for instance any application that requires multiple roles).</p><p>An example of running a database instance inside a container is when running tests. Every test can create its own blank container running Postgres. This is probably the best solution for component testing: it offers complete isolation between tests, the database container is small, and it scales directly with the number of running tests.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#what-did-we-pick"></a>What did we pick?</h2><p>All our lakeFS instances currently use plain or Aurora Postgres on RDS:</p><ul><li>Our database usage is currently not high enough to justify the cost savings of running our own instances..</li><li>We build lakeFS, and supporting Postgres as a service is important to the product. So by design, lakeFS does not require latest-version features or esoteric extensions.</li><li>Our core business is currently to develop rather than to operate lakeFS; this is essentially the “ramp-up” time above.</li></ul><p>For isolation and speed of setup, our unit and component testing use a containerized Postgres instance.</p><figure><img src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="407" srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-24x18.jpg 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-36x27.jpg 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-48x36.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg" data-srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-24x18.jpg 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-36x27.jpg 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-48x36.jpg 48w"><figcaption>Picking a database, like picking an elephant, can be hard but need not be intimidating</figcaption></figure></div><!-- .entry-content .clear --></div></article></div>]]>

<section id="mc_embed_signup">

</section>
<p>I read a post online recently about how some software engineer was asked to complete a technically complex, jargon-filled coding challenge over the phone in order to get a job. He did well enough on the call to get an offer, but after he started the new job, he realized it wasn’t going to be the academically challenging role he was hoping for. No, he’d just be building basic CRUD applications for the web with a legacy system haphazardly running on whatever virtual machine could be found.</p>
<p>This happens all the time during job-screening. We put engineers through rigorous screening processes and ask them intellectually stimulating questions, only to hire them and put them into the admittedly dull task of wiring up 5 or 6 services and making the screen look pretty. I’m not saying there aren’t skills involved in those tasks - I’m simply saying that those aren’t the same skills being tested for in most whiteboarding-style challenges.</p>
<p><em>PS: <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/rethinking-hiring">Here’s how I revamped my hiring process with this trend in mind</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="lets-stop-sugar-coating-it">Let’s stop sugar-coating it</h2>
<p><strong>Software is created when its presence provides more business value than its absence.</strong></p>
<p>While it’s appealing to read about software craftsmanship and strive for excellence in everything we do, when it really comes down to it, our job wouldn’t exist if we didn’t make money (or save money) for some business somewhere.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the industry’s state makes sense. Just like plumbers, <strong>we are paid to know our tools and understand how they work together to make a usable piece of equipment</strong>, not to reinvent working technology or spend 80 hours optimizing something that 5% of our users will use.</p>
<h2 id="put-it-in-perspective">Put it in perspective</h2>
<p>Small to medium sized businesses rarely deal with scaling or optimization problems anymore - partly because hardware has gotten so cheap, and partly because foundational open source software has gotten so good. This is a great thing, and we as software developers should embrace it.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the plumbing example. Imagine you owned a small restaurant with one bathroom and 10 employees. You get a few hundred customers per week and maybe 10% of them use your bathroom. Obviously, you’ve got to have a working bathroom, but does it need to be anything fancier or more advanced than your home toilet? <strong>Do you need 10 stalls, motion-activated faucets, Dyson hand dryers, and marble counters?</strong> Probably not, unless you’re just trying to project some facade of success.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9bS3JGQ.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>We do this all the time in the world of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto">startup software engineering</a> though.</strong></p>
<p>A small business with 5-10 employees building a software-as-a-service web app needs to have a reliable, secure system, but does it need to be that much more robust than an off-the-shelf service provides? <strong>Do you really need AI-powered search, real-time dashboards for every internal team member, microsecond optimizations on your home page, and split testing for every feature you release?</strong> Probably not unless you’re just trying to project a facade of success…</p>
<p>Just as a good small business owner should hire a humble plumber who knows the standard tools required for small bathrooms, and will pay him market rate, <strong>a good engineering manager should hire <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hero-myth">humble team players</a> who use industry-standard tools to build reliable software, and pay them market rate.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, what I’m seeing is a lot of false projections from engineering managers. They give the impression during the interview that every person they hire must be a senior engineer, has to have “big data” experience, or has to know every sorting algorithm by heart.</p>
<h2 id="we-engineers-are-guilty-of-over-engineering">We (engineers) are guilty of over-engineering</h2>
<p>Part of the problem is that we over-engineer the software we work on. I am guilty of this as well.</p>
<p>I came to the Graide Network and immediately started breaking our legacy app into microservices. Now I’ve had to build custom tooling just to help new developers get things running on their local machines - not something that is truly worth my time this early on in our business’ lifecycle.</p>
<p>I’ve also made it harder on myself to hire people. I don’t want to limit my hiring pool to engineers who know multiple specific web frameworks, Docker containers, microservices, Redis, and MySQL, but I’ve built myself into a corner with all these choices. Lately I’ve realized this, and been starting to think of ways to simplify our stack, but that will have to come in a future blog post.</p>
<h2 id="investors-are-guilty-of-pushing-it-on-us">Investors are guilty of pushing it on us</h2>
<p>The other side is investor and media pressure. In the startup world this is especially pronounced as I’ve found investors as likely to latch onto buzzwords as reporters are.</p>
<p>“Oh, so you’re building an app? Does it use AI? Blockchain? <insert hot="" buzzy="" tech="" here="">? Take my money and do it!"</insert></p>
<p>Now you’ve sold yourself to an investor as an AI/Blockchain/etc. company, so you’ve got to hire engineers who do that thing, even if you’re not sure it’s actually going to help you build a better business or not. This means you’re going to shun candidates with 10+ years of experience in existing tech to hire slick kids who jump from buzz-word to buzz-word chasing trends. <strong>It’s like hiring a plumber with 3 years of experience who invented his own tools: high risk, very low reward.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-do-about-it">What do we do about it?</h2>
<p>So we’re here, living in a world where most “software engineering” is essentially plumbing. What should we do about it? What does it mean for our careers? Will the money keep flowing forever?</p>
<p><strong>First, we should recognize and embrace the fact that we can build more with less.</strong> What it will mean is that the crummy parts of our job will probably get automated or tools will be built that will make it possible for business people to do them for us. For example, I used to have to make code changes every time someone on our team wanted to change an automated email’s copy. Now, they just have to edit a template in Sendgrid’s nice visual editor, and I never even know that a change has been made.</p>
<p><strong>Second, we should consider the complexity required when designing systems.</strong> If an off-the-shelf solution exists, grab it, don’t build it from scratch. Get good at soldering pieces together so that you seem more productive, faster, and better at your job than the software artisans out there who have to custom-build their own framework every time they start a project.</p>
<p><strong>Third, we should set realistic expectations in our job listings.</strong> No more coding exercises that require a CS degree for jobs that require little more than importing libraries and understanding HTTP requests. Yes, some jobs will require micro-optimizations, and that’s fine, but recognize that those are few and far between. Your software is likely not as special as you think it is.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-notenough-karl-l-hughes/">don’t get comfortable</a>.</strong> This isn’t a popular opinion among software engineers, but I believe that many in the field are overpaid relative to the difficulty of the work they do. Sometimes it’s because they are the only people who know some obscure corner of their field, sometimes it’s because their company’s gatekeepers are preventing full access to the talent market, and sometimes it’s because other engineers insisted they overbuild things such that junior devs will take a long time to understand it. In any case, <strong>we can’t stop learning if we want to remain relevant and well-paid.</strong> Keep going deep and wide in your knowledge, and learn how to filter out the hype from the truly ground-breaking technology.</p>
<p>What do you think? I imagine many of you in the field will have a different opinion, so let me hear it on <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

But hold on. The argument for taking Vitamin D assumes a few things. First, that low Vitamin D actually causes all of the conditions it is associated with. This is not necessarily true. Low Vitamin D could cause (or contribute to) heart disease, but it could also be that heart disease causes low Vitamin D. Another possibility is that some third factor causes both low Vitamin D and heart disease. </p><p id="viewer-9g65f">Even if we can prove some causation, we then need to assume that correcting the Vitamin D deficiency will prevent the disease. This may not be true either. Low Vitamin D may be an indicator of overall poor health, which increases the risk for cardiac disease. It could appear that low Vitamin D contributes to the condition. But raising the Vitamin D will not help because it will just fix the symptom, not the underlying problem. </p><h3 id="viewer-399rj"><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-4p68a">Fortunately we have studies that can help figure this out. Currently the best way to answer a question of clinical relevance is with a large, well-executed <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT).</strong> An RCT works like this: enroll the participants you want to study and randomly assign half of them to receive a treatment and the other half to receive a placebo. Those receiving the treatment are called the intervention group. The other group is the control group. Ideally, the two groups will be similar in every way except the treatment – they will have the same distribution in age, income, race, gender, and health status. They will even receive pills that look identical, though half will be placebos. If, at the end of the study, there are differences between the two groups, we can attribute those differences to the treatment. </p><div id="viewer-3aoj5"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Simple randomized controlled trial "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1674,h_920,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Simple randomized controlled trial "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">Simple randomized controlled trial</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-fvrr">RCTs are costly and time intensive, so generally we will only be able to study the interventions and outcomes that have the highest chance of showing a benefit. We base this on prior studies; if several large observational studies show a correlation between Vitamin D and heart disease, then this is something we should study with an RCT. </p><p id="viewer-1ofc5">
We now have results for over 1500 RCTs on Vitamin D supplementation. Some of the largest and most significant trials are listed and summarized at the end of this article. When tested on its ability to prevent disease, <strong>Vitamin D has failed to live up to expectations</strong>. </p><div id="viewer-b7fav"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Results of Vitamin D Trials "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1206,h_878,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Results of Vitamin D Trials "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">For more details, see the list of high-quality RCTs at the bottom of this page</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-en75e">One of the largest and best studies we have is called <a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VITAL</u></a>, led by Dr. JoAnn Manson at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Over 25,000 adults (men age 50 and older, women age 55 and older) with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer participated in the study. They received either 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 or placebo daily for five years. Researchers evaluated the rates of cancer and major cardiovascular events including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. </p><p id="viewer-f6k24"><strong>The result: Vitamin D failed to prevent cancer, stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death. </strong>These conditions occurred at the same rate in those receiving Vitamin D and those receiving placebo. There was one positive finding, though: in a post hoc analysis, it seemed that Vitamin D decreased the mortality from cancer when the initial two years were excluded. Post hoc (“after the event”) analyses can be quite useful, but need to be viewed with some skepticism. In high-quality RCTs (like VITAL), the outcome measures and statistical analyses are specified prior to data collection. Sometimes, as in VITAL’s case, an unexpected outcome may appear at the time the data are evaluated, prompting a post hoc analysis. In this case, when results from the first two years were excluded, the rate of cancer death was 1.2% in the placebo group, and 0.9% in the Vitamin D group - 25% reduction in cancer mortality, though the absolute numbers were low. It is not possible to draw too many conclusions from this, but it is something to note for future studies. </p><p id="viewer-3cooc"><strong>Even in studies of bone health, Vitamin D has been disappointing.</strong> We already know that Vitamin D is essential in calcium metabolism, and Vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets and osteomalacia. Taking Vitamin D to treat severe Vitamin D deficiency is necessary for the treatment of these conditions. But in the large trials looking at Vitamin D's ability to prevent bone loss, the participants were taken from the general population, many of whom had normal Vitamin D levels. For severely deficient individuals (only a small percentage of the population), there are clear benefits to supplementation. These benefits do not appear to extend to those with normal levels or mild deficiencies.</p><h3 id="viewer-ct6r5"><strong>Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ek5t0">Large randomized controlled trials are currently the best way to evaluate a treatment, but they are difficult to do. If done well, an RCT is expensive, time intensive, and challenging to coordinate. It is worth it if we can answer our question adequately, but sometimes we realize after the trial that we needed to account for something else, or that we need more people in the study before we can really answer our question. In addition, RCTs will not always give definitive answers. Sometimes two or more small trials of the same treatment will show opposite results, and we need to reconcile those. Simply redoing an RCT is usually not an option. Instead, scientists have developed a method of combining similar RCTs and analyzing them together, in what is called a meta-analysis. </p><p id="viewer-ab05u">Meta-analyses have exploded in popularity over the last few decades.<span> If done well, a meta-analysis of a group of trials can reveal insights that cannot be seen in the individual trials. Unfortunately there are potential problems. The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality of the studies it includes, which can lead to erroneous results when poor quality studies are present (garbage in, garbage out).</span></p><p id="viewer-9nlvf"><span>In addition, <strong>publication bias</strong> may incorrectly amplify a treatment effect. Publication bias occurs when researchers decide to publish only “positive” findings – studies that show a treatment effect. Suppose ten small trials of Vitamin D are performed. Five show a benefit to Vitamin D and five do not. Researchers and journals are much more inclined to publish positive results than negative, so it is possible that only the five positive studies will make it into the medical literature. A meta-analysis on the five published positive studies will show a much stronger effect of Vitamin D than a meta-analysis that included all ten studies. </span></p><div id="viewer-9ul9t"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_373,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a6n1n"> <em>Where negative studies go to die. </em></p><p id="viewer-a6bj6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosenthal_(psychologist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Robert Rosenthal </u></em></a><em>called publication bias "the file drawer problem" because important negative studies often end up here.

<p>I’ve been reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44719608-refactoring"><em>Refactoring</em></a> and two things have gotten my gears turning.</p>



<p><strong>Thing one: refactoring moves understanding from your head back into your code.</strong> When you finally grok how something is working, refactor the code to make that understanding obvious.</p>



<blockquote><p>Read the code, gain some insight, and use refactoring to move that insight from your head back into the code. The clearer code then makes it easier to understand it, leading to deeper insights and a beneficial positive feedback loop.</p><cite>Martin Fowler</cite></blockquote>



<p>For example, if you realize that a chunk of code is determining the pricing for a soccer match, extract that into a <code>determinePrice()</code> function so that next time it’ll be obvious. </p>



<p>Or if discover two different types of Articles (Text and Video), make <code>TextArticle</code> and <code>VideoArticle</code> classes that extend the <code>Article</code> class. That way, no one will ever need to learn that lesson the hard way again.</p>



<p>Whenever you think “ah, so <em>that’s</em> what this is doing” use that as a mental trigger that you should refactor to make it self evident.</p>



<p>It’s embarrassing how obvious this seems in retrospect. I’ve used that as a trigger to write documentation or do some knowledge sharing, rather than improve the code.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Thing two: refactoring should be done in tiny steps, and the code should never be in a broken state.</strong> You make a little change, compile-test-commit, and repeat. The changes will be small, but they add up.</p>



<blockquote><p>Whenever I’ve shown people how I refactor, they are surprised by how small my steps are, each step leaving the code in a working state that compiles and passes its tests. The key to effective refactoring is recognizing that you go faster when you take tiny steps, the code is never broken, and you can compose those small steps into substantial changes.</p><cite>Martin Fowler</cite></blockquote>



<p>I never realized that I could change so much without breaking stuff in the process. I always assumed refactoring was the code equivalent of cracking eggs to make an omelette. </p>



<p>Last week, I spent a couple hours moving code around and creating classes and changing method definitions. Then I spent the next 4 hours trying to make it all work again. Oh how I wish I had read this book before that.</p>



<p>Important note: this depends on having solid and fast automated tests. <em>Writing tests is often the first step of refactoring.</em> Remember, you should compile-test-commit after each change. That’s going to be brutal if you can’t make robots do your testing for you. </p>



<p>I’m not even halfway through <em>Refactoring</em> but so far it’s fantastic. Have you read it? What did you think? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet me</a> and let me know. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599532527250/Gm0E0xbTo.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>The most successful companies are built upon great working cultures that are thoughtful about the <a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-new-analytics-of-culture">cultural contribution</a> each hire will make to their company. If you're a candidate looking to land your dream job, you'll need to be well prepared for these cultural or behavioral interviews. </p>
<p>As a hiring manager, I've interviewed over 200 engineering candidates and a significant portion of that  has been evaluating the soft skills each candidate embodies. I've rejected extremely strong technical performers and and fought to hire some more junior candidates based on the signal I've identified from the culture interview. Because every company has their own culture, their own values, and their own questions, the culture interview can be extremely hard to prepare for. However, there's still plenty you can do to set yourself up for success instead of jumping in blind.</p>
<p>While my interviewing experience as both a hiring manager and a candidate have been primarily within engineering, I believe the tools in this kit will be mostly applicable across product, design, and other disciplines within product development organizations. </p>
<h2 id="stories-to-prepare">Stories to Prepare</h2>
<p>Why should you prepare stories instead of answers to specific questions? The simple reason is that you can't prepare and memorize an answer to every question an interviewer might ask. Often times these conversations are organic and the real signal comes from how you respond to follow-up questions. The best answers are rooted in real examples from your personal experience and by "loading" these stories into your brain ahead of time, you'll be better equipped to handle questions on the spot.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599089431543/WeopvfKLq.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599089431543/WeopvfKLq.png"></p>
<h3 id="story-1-your-career-narrative">Story #1: Your career narrative</h3>
<p>Almost everyone you talk to will give an intro of themselves and then ask you to share a brief intro as well. Depending on who you're talking to, that intro can be anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes. In some cases, a hiring manager or recruiter might ask you to go deeper into your background and spend up to 30 minutes digging into your experiences.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ol>
<li>A narrative that connects your career together. While many careers are not linear, it can help to show that you were deliberate about the jobs you took and what you wanted to learn at each one. You may find that as you look back on your career, there's a story you can weave together that ties together where you started, where you're at now, and the trajectory you're on. A story that shows strong growth, surmounting challenges, and a high forward trajectory can help get companies excited about you. Finish your story such that the company you're talking to easily makes sense as the next step on your career journey.<ul>
<li>A weak narrative merely lists what's on your resume, e.g., "in 2013 I joined X and did these projects, in 2014 I joined Y and did these projects, and recently I've done Z and B. I want to join this company because it's doing really well."</li>
<li>A stronger narrative gives context on your decisions and motivations, e.g., "In college, I was excited about electronics and human-computer interfaces, so I looked for companies that specialized in consumer hardware. X company was one of the companies that stood out, and when I joined I got to work on the interface for Product P. This taught me [so and so] but after 2 years there, I really wanted to get better at [this other thing], so I reached out to Company Y. From there, I grew into [some role], helped the company do [these things], and now I'm [doing something impressive]. Going forward, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can put my front end architecture skills to good use while learning how to build complex systems at scale. I admire [company name] for being able to build high quality user interfaces while being super fast and reliable. I think this might be a great fit for my expertise and give me opportunities to grow my backend skills."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What specific things you're looking for in your next role. These should apply to more than one company to show that you're not just pandering to the company, but try to be opinionated at the same time.<ul>
<li>A weak answer is too vague, uncertain, or demonstrates that you haven't put much thought to it.<ul>
<li>e.g., "I'm looking for a place where I can advance my career." or "I wanted to get into AI and Machine Learning because it's a really hot industry right now."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A stronger answer shows that you've clearly thought about what you want, have had enough experience to know what you don't want, and implicitly show why the company you're talking to is a good fit.<ul>
<li>e.g., "Over my career, I've found that it's really important for me to have a strong sense of ownership over my work. I enjoy taking an ambiguous customer problem, breaking it down with a PM or designer, and then being able to see the whole project through from start to finish. I like to solve problems and not just execute on tasks, even if that means working through some dealing with a lot of uncertainty at times and wearing many hats."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="what-the-interviewer-is-looking-for">What the interviewer is looking for</h4>
<ul>
<li>For quick intros, interviewers are generally not evaluating your storytelling ability. Instead, they want to know why you might be a good fit for the role and what your motivations are.</li>
<li>For hiring managers and recruiters, your career narrative can be a useful lens to interpret the interview feedback and make a decision on whether or not to move forward.<ul>
<li>For example, if your background is primarily backend engineering and the interviews demonstrate weakness in UI implementation, then your narrative can help interviewers focus more on your strengths over your weaker areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you under-represent yourself at this stage, you may miss an opportunity to move forward in the interview process or get an offer.<ul>
<li>On the flip side, you should avoid changing your narrative too much simply to suit the role or company you're talking to. It's often better to be rejected for a role that really doesn't fit you than to get a role doing something that doesn't actually align with what you want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-that-interviewers-may-ask">Questions that interviewers may ask</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
<li>What are you looking for in your next role?</li>
<li>Why are you interested in [company]?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png"></p>
<h3 id="story-2-two-impressive-projects">Story #2: Two Impressive Projects</h3>
<p>You should be prepared to talk in depth about at least two meaningful projects you've worked on where you played a significant role. Why two? If you use the same example for every question, the interviewer may think you're lacking experience or have a weak track record. Having at least two substantial projects in your pocket will help you balance breadth and depth to respond to a variety of questions.</p>
<p>Keep your initial explanation short (between 3-5 minutes) and offer to go deeper afterwards. This will help keep the conversation focused and avoid wasting time on unimportant details.</p>
<p>A good format to use whenever you're giving an example of something that happened is to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm">SBI framework</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf">STAR framework</a>. For these examples I'll use the SBI model. </p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Situation</strong>: Share context on the project before jumping into what you did.<ul>
<li>Where did the project come from?</li>
<li>Why was it important? How did you or your team prioritize it?</li>
<li>What were the goals of the project?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Behavior</strong>: Describe your specific role on that project. If you played a technical role, describe how the system was designed.<ul>
<li>Project management<ul>
<li>What was your role in defining the scope or solution?</li>
<li>How did you ensure the project was on track?</li>
<li>What obstacles came up during the project? How did you overcome them?</li>

<li>System design of the project<ul>
<li>How was the system architected?</li>
<li>What were the biggest points of failure?</li>
<li>How did you approach this design?</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: What was the result of this project?<ul>
<li>What went well on that project?<ul>
<li>Did the project succeed?</li>
<li>How did you measure success?</li>
<li>Can you share some of your success metrics and how they performed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What did you learn on that project?<ul>
<li>What skills did you build?</li>
<li>What didn't go well on that project?</li>
<li>If you were to do the project again, what might you do differently? Try to come up with at least one or two examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the project didn't succeed, why not?<ul>
<li>Demonstrate that you can take ownership of your mistakes and avoid blaming others. Most interviewers are looking for a growth mindset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-interviewers-are-looking-for">What interviewers are looking for</h4>
<ul>
<li>Does the work align with the level and scope of the role?<ul>
<li>Are they applying for a role that's realistic with what they've done historically?</li>
<li>What kind of domain expertise do they have?</li>
<li>Have they had enough technical leadership experience for the role? (More relevant for senior/tech lead roles and above.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can the candidate clearly articulate the benefit and impact of their work?<ul>
<li>It's surprising how often some people don't know or think about the result of their work beyond completing the tasks that were assigned to them. Strong candidates think about the entire workflow, from idea conception to evaluating success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do they have a growth mindset?<ul>
<li>Are they able to reflect on both the successes and misses of that project?</li>
<li>Do they take credit for all the things that went well and blame others for all the things that didn't go well? (This would be a red flag.)</li>
<li>Can they clearly explain both the technical and non-technical portions of their work?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-that-interviewers-may-ask">Questions that interviewers may ask</h4>
<ul>
<li>What's the most significant project you worked on in the last year?</li>
<li>Tell me about a project that didn't go as well as you had hoped. What happened?</li>
<li>Give me an example of how you learned an area/product that you knew nothing about. What was the outcome?</li>

<h3 id="story-3-resolving-a-conflict">Story #3: Resolving a conflict</h3>
<p>Delivering successful projects often require working with a lot of stakeholders and collaborators. Demonstrate that you can work well with others, share critical feedback, and resolve situations on your own.</p>
<p>I've been surprised at how often candidates talk about a situation where they ultimately failed to resolve a conflict. It can be hard to think of a good example on the spot, so definitely prepare this ahead of time and consider what you want the interviewer to take away.</p>

  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to

<p><span>T</span>he average fintech startup founder faces a taxing to-do list: raise seed funding, scope out a user base, recruit talent, build something people will actually use. For the Indonesian entrepreneur, the Muslim-majority market presents an additional hurdle: build an app that is compliant with Islamic religious law, or Sharia.</p>



<p>New fintech startups must present themselves before the Indonesian Ulema Council (Majelis Ulama Indonesia, or MUI, in Bahasa Indonesian), composed of religious clerics from across the archipelago, for Sharia certification, in order to reach Indonesia’s 220 million Muslim users, who generally seek out products that fit their faith.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MUI shapes much of Indonesian life. The body has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/bjpwwm/indonesia-just-got-its-first-halal-fridge-heres-a-list-of-everything-else-that-needs-a-stamp">conducted halal audits on household products</a>, verifying that milk, moisturizer, and instant ramen meet strict religious criteria. Its <em>fatwa</em> commission also regularly intervenes in the moral life of Indonesians, promulgating headline-making rulings on <a href="https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/87440-bhimanto-suwastoyo-fatwa-homosexuality-indonesia-death-penalty">homosexuality</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jis/article-abstract/18/2/202/726927">secularism</a>. Since the late 1990s, when Indonesian politics began a turn toward Islamic conservatism, the council’s influence has grown, according to Syafiq Hasyim, a Jakarta-based scholar of MUI and the political economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now MUI is using its policing power to shape a new sector of Indonesian society: consumer technology. In November 2019, Vice President Ma’ruf Amin declared the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3044601/how-sharia-economy-shapes-democracy-indonesia">“Shariatization” of the economy</a> — i.e., the growth of digital financial services catering to Muslim users — a priority for the country’s development. Indonesian Muslim consumers currently spend $224 billion annually. When fintech companies build platforms for these users — whether peer-to-peer lending apps, mobile money services, or online stock-trading portals — MUI acts as the arbiter of their religious legitimacy. MUI’s National Sharia Council (Dewan Syariah Nasional, or DSN) issues certificates that verify platforms are compliant with Sharia. The chairman of DSN just happens to be the vice president himself.</p>



<p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech. New fatwas are added every year on digital finance topics that now include commodities trading online and cryptocurrencies. In the certification process, MUI’s religious scholars become embedded in the early evolution of a company’s digital products, their background not in software engineering or UX design but the traditions and teachings of Islam.</p>

<p>In Sharia, for example, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riba.asp#:~:text=Riba%20is%20prohibited%20under%20Shari,and%20helping%20others%20through%20kindness.">charging interest, or <em>riba</em></a><em>,</em> is strictly prohibited. Sharia promotes charitable financial dealings and labels interest and guaranteed profits inherently unjust. Instead of a conventional credit model, Sharia lending platforms operate according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091931230X"><em>mudarabah</em></a>. Under this model, rather than a lender extracting a profit from a borrower, the borrower and lender enter a more equitable contract. For a small-business loan, for example, the lender receives a predetermined share of profits but must also share in the losses, since the borrower has invested labor and knowledge in the business. This model underpins a host of peer-to-peer lending apps targeting Muslim users in Indonesia.</p>



<p>For Sharia stock trading, MUI mandates, under <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxTl-lNihFyzZUxIbkR3RXV4TWc/view">Fatwa No. 80</a>, that traders invest only in halal companies. Online stock trading platforms like MNC Trade Syariah vet all potential listings accordingly, removing any that deal in gambling, alcohol, or pork products.</p>



<p>For some companies, compliance is more of a challenge. Take LinkAja. <a href="https://kr-asia.com/linkaja-ceo-danu-wicaksana-ready-to-be-the-biggest-mobile-payment-platform-in-indonesia">Launched in June 2019</a> and currently serving 45 million registered users, it’s one of the country’s largest mobile money services <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/adv-longform/2019/12/27/why-gojek-users-leave-their-cash-behind-and-turn-to-gopay.html">behind leaders like GoJek’s digital wallet</a> GoPay and OVO. Customers can send, store, or receive electronic money on the LinkAja app. </p>



<p>Late last year, the company announced it was building the first Sharia mobile money product in Indonesia, a digital wallet for Muslim consumers to be called LinkAja Sharia Services. Standard LinkAja app users would be able to go into their settings and switch to a parallel platform built for Sharia compliance. But before they even created a prototype, LinkAja’s team knew they needed to consult MUI.</p>



<p>Most Islamic fintech companies have an appointed head of Sharia, a taskmaster who manages the compliance process. At LinkAja, that person is Widjayanto Djaenudin. While he had no experience in Sharia technology per se, he spent more than a decade at Telkomsel, Indonesia’s largest telecoms operator, developing mobile products for the unbanked. His task at LinkAja was to liaise with MUI and guide the company through its certification process, a challenge, considering the tenuous status of Sharia scholarship on mobile money apps. </p>



<p>Some clerics have argued that <a href="http://www.ikim.gov.my/new-wp/index.php/2019/08/22/some-sharia-considerations-concerning-e-wallet/">digital wallets are a form of <em>haram</em></a>, a term for practices forbidden by Islamic law<em>. </em>The<em> </em>digital-only cash-back rebates and other discounts with partner retailers commonly found on these apps are considered, by some clerics, a form of interest payment between businesses — riba in disguise. MUI has ruled sending and storing money in digital wallets acceptable, but only under strict terms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>After conducting a rigorous product-proposal review, MUI appointed a three-member supervisory board to Djaenudin’s team well-versed in the nuances of its rulings. The board included Anwar Abbas, chairman of an Islamic reformist organization in Southern Java’s Yogyakarta and author of a national bestseller promoting the vice president’s “Shariatization” worldview, <a href="https://www.tokopedia.com/dojobuku/ma-ruf-amin-way-sahala-panggabean-by-anwar-abbas"><em>The Ma’ruf Amin Way</em></a><em>. </em>“They are all Sharia experts,” said Djaenudin. “They gave us guidance and consultations about the product.” </p>



<p>Starting in November 2019, shortly after the vice president’s Shariatization initiative, Djaenudin was required to brief these scholars on market research, product testing, and the ins and outs of engineering every month. MUI’s supervisory board would share their insights and ensure the technological infrastructure of the app followed MUI’s rulings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An MUI fatwa issued in 2017 was of particular concern to Djaenudin. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KPAvhhziJ61Pt8EFxxTFfDPNmRHJoQDG/view">Fatwa No. 116</a> begins with verses from the Quran published in both classical Arabic script and Bahasa Indonesian. “O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write it between you in justice,” reads one verse. They are followed closely by <a href="https://yaqeeninstitute.org/emadhamdeh/are-hadith-necessary/">quotations from books of <em>hadith</em></a>, records of the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad: “Do not sell gold for gold, and do not sell silver for silver, except in case of like for like.”</p>



<p>These threads of theological precedent are woven together to create a set of rulings reinterpreting classical verse for the new digital economy. According to the fatwa, these Quranic lines have a specific implication for fintech: floating funds must be housed in certified Islamic banks. Contracts between all parties — users, banking institutions, or the app itself — must be grounded in Sharia contract law. Any promotional campaign cannot include riba.</p>

<p>The supervisory board had other suggestions for LinkAja’s parallel Sharia platform, Djaenudin told <em>Rest of World</em>. The new version of the app embedded a <em>zakat </em>payment feature, <a href="https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/zakat/">a form of religious tithing and worship</a> performed through charitable donations, customarily amounting to 2.5% of one’s total savings. After the board signed off on the feature, LinkAja partnered with 240 MUI-approved charitable institutions and 1,000 mosques nationwide <a href="https://news.detik.com/adv-nhl-detikcom/d-5019749/wahai-umat-muslim-ini-cara-mudah-berzakat-lewat-layanan-syariah-linkaja">to launch the zakat feature</a>. Months of vetting culminated in a full audit of LinkAja’s operations at its Jakarta headquarters by MUI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Widjayanto, LinkAja paid a $300 (4 million rupiah) charge to MUI for its Sharia certificate, which lasts three years, including a $20 transportation fee for the auditor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LinkAja Sharia Services <a href="https://www.idnfinancials.com/news/33503/link-aja-launches-linkaja-sharia-services">launched on April 14</a>, just one week before the start of Ramadan. In its first month, it saw 100,000 user registrations. Djaenudin credits the MUI Sharia certificate for this first wave of customers. Most Indonesians prefer to use a Sharia-branded service, even if few understand the particulars of riba or mudarabah, according to LinkAja market research. “From the customer’s perspective, as long as they see the halal logo or Sharia certificate from a trusted body, which is MUI, it gives them clearance and trust,” said Djaenudin.</p>



<p>For Indonesian fintech entrepreneurs hoping to establish their Sharia credentials, the MUI certificate has become the gold standard. Ronald Yusuf Wijaya, the founder of two Sharia-compliant crowdfunding startups, converted to Islam while building his business. “It’s been almost nine years, and I’m learning all of this from the day I started my business,” he said. Wijaya is chairman of the <a href="https://fintechsyariah.id/en">Indonesian Sharia Fintech Association (AFSI)</a>, a trade association that lobbies on behalf of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-digitalpayments-islam/sharia-fintech-startups-race-to-tap-indonesia-growth-by-aligning-with-islam-idUSKBN20Q0IA">this burgeoning pocket of the Indonesian economy</a>. Since converting, Wijaya has successfully navigated MUI Sharia certification with both his companies. “Some customers, they ask, ‘Are you certified, or are you just Sharia?’”&nbsp;</p>

<p>For most Sharia fintech startups, MUI certificates are not only commercially advantageous but legally required by the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK), the state financial regulator. Other areas of the Sharia digital economy, like <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesian-e-commerce-giant-tokopedia-aiming-for-10-of-total-transactions-to-come-from-new-islamic-m">halal e-commerce</a> and <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesia-gets-first-diy-umrah-platform-e-commerce-giant-starts-selling-pilgrimage-packages"><em>umrah </em>sites</a>, travel-booking platforms for Islamic pilgrimages, do not require this certificate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ir. H. Nadratuzzaman Hosen, vice chair of DSN MUI, told <em>Rest of World</em> that MUI is a passive actor in the development of new apps — waiting idly for companies to seek its approval rather than imposing fatwas on companies as a theocratic …</p></div></div>

        <p>Navigation menus are one of the most-viewed and most-clicked-on pieces of interface. Let’s look at some principles of nav design that will help our users have a better experience.</p>

<h2 id="1-placement-matters">1) Placement matters</h2>

<p>The web has developed a clear pattern for where navigation goes (very top, left side, or in the footer). When menus are placed outside of these areas, it feels awkward, confusing, and hard to find.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-1.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="2-show-them-where-they-are">2) Show them where they are</h2>

<p>Clearly communicate the user’s current location. Use multiple clues, like the ones below, to help them orient themselves. Our users should never have to wonder where they are.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-2.png">
</figure>



<p>Research shows that mega menus provide a better experience than list dropdowns because they show everything at a glance, are able to utilize imagery, allow for better grouping, and feel more engaging.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-3.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="4-effective-link-titles">4) Effective link titles</h2>

<p>A user should be able to easily predict where a link will take them before they click it (this is called information scent). The single biggest factor in this is how good of a job we do at link labeling.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-4.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="5-how-many-items">5) How many items?</h2>

<p>The right number of items in your menu depends on a few things, like how complicated your product is or how savvy your users are. But try to get to fewer than 6 or 7 items. The order also matters.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-5.png">

<p>Navigation menus are one of the most-clicked-on pieces of interface, and they provide major contextual information to the user, so it should always be visible.</p>

<p>The default on mobile these days seems to be the hamburger menu, but there are alternatives that don’t hide the nav completely: tabs, progressive collapsing, scrollable lists, and so on.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started being developed internally at Facebook back in 2012, before being publicly released as open-source in 2015. <strong>GraphQL is a query language for APIs</strong>, its main advantage is allowing clients to query exactly for the type of data that is required. The definitions of all the data clients can query through the service are stored in GraphQL schema. Each field in the schema is attached to a function, called a resolver, which gets called to produce the values when a query is executed.</p>
<p>GraphQL is language-agnostic which makes it fairly easy to be adopted across different technologies, one of its successful implementations is done in Rust, by a library called Juniper.</p>
<h2>Code- first, fast &amp; type-safe GraphQL Servers in Rust</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper">Juniper</a></strong> is a code-first approach that allows you to write <strong>type-safe and super fast GraphQL servers in Rust</strong>, keeping declaring and resolving GraphQL schemas as easy as possible.</p>
<p>GraphQL query language is fully supported, including interfaces, unions, schema introspection, validations, as well as some basic Rust crates integrations allowing you to use popular Rust types as <code>uuid</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>chrono</code>, or <code>bson</code> out of the box. </p>
<p>As previously mentioned <strong>Juniper is a code-first library</strong>, if you prefer the schema-first approach you can use <a href="https://github.com/davidpdrsn/juniper-from-schema">juniper-from-schema</a> to <strong>auto-generate resolvers</strong> for your GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>Although Juniper does not provide a built-in web server functionality it comes with building blocks to make integration with your servers as seamless as possible, as well as optionally providing pre-built integration for popular Rust web frameworks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actix,</li>
<li>Hyper,</li>
<li>Iron,</li>
<li>Rocket, </li>
<li>Warp.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example of Juniper integration for Actix</h2>
<p>Below you can find a sample Juniper integration with the <strong>Actix web framework</strong>. The servers run on <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> and has built-in GraphiQL for easier testing. Star it with:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>The LinkedIn Ads network is likely awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic that make the platform’s value extremely dubious, according to a new study from global digital agency RMG that the company shared exclusively with me.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, RMG founding partner Ryan Gellis <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryan-gellis_theory-the-linkedin-ad-network-is-full-of-activity-6700077824360910848-LysO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a thread</a> wondering if LinkedIn “is full of fraudulent accounts and unchecked misclicks that artificially inflate the cost of advertising and result in poor performance compared to other ad networks.” The ensuing discussion inspired him to look into the issue further.</p>
<center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKuyxgWuiRM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><p>Gellis goes through his findings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKuyxgWuiRM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this YouTube video</a>. For the test, RMG promoted a webinar by targeting c-certain c-suite executives at large companies in the United States based on their job titles. The ad encouraged them to click to sign up for for event for free.</p>
<p>The first issue the agency found was the projected versus actual cost per click. LinkedIn estimated a $25 average CPC. The actual campaign CPC was nearly $45.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of forecasting if you project one cost and then the actual cost ends up being 200% the projection?” Gellis asks in the video.</p>
<p>But the real issue was the source of the clicks themselves. LinkedIn’s ad platform reported 11 clicks. RMG’s logs showed ten clicks. <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStory</a>, the digital experience analytics platform that RMG uses, stated that eight people registered for the webinar. However, the true number of registrations was zero.</p>
<p>“Zero people signed up for the webinar from that specific campaign,” Gellis told me in an interview. “That’s kind of the punch line and why I believe this is newsworthy. Nobody signed up. In fact, nobody even exhibited what I believe is real user behavior on the site after clicking the ad. That is also true of all the other ads we ran on LinkedIn. We had a total of 0 people ever “sign up” on any ad we ran during our testing on LinkedIn — regardless of the ad format or messaging.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rmgmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RMG</a> suspects bot activity or misattributed misclicks had been the cause because visitors would bounce away from the webinar’s landing page before it even had a chance to render — in other words, they would click the LinkedIn advertisement and then leave the website in less than 1.3 seconds. In addition, FullStory reported mouse movements that were nothing like what an actual human would do.</p>
<p>“As far as we’re concerned, the LinkedIn ad network basically has fraudulent clicks and/or misclicks that don’t get attributed to the users that are being passed through as leads in campaigns,” Gellis says in the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the simple size in RMG’s one-day test was extremely small. The target audience size was 16,000. The number of impressions would be between 680 and 2,000. The cost was $250. But Gellis told me that the results match a prior, larger test.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png" alt="linkedin ads" width="660" height="197" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 660 197'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png"></p>
<p>During a $3,000 campaign in March, LinkedIn reported 256 clicks with an average CPC of $11. The company received zero leads from all of the clicks.</p>
<p>“You’ll see the call to action is ‘Request Demo,'” Gellis said. “So, arguably, a user who sees this ad and clicks legitimately on it will be looking to get a demo of the analytics tool we were marketing. If the ads were giving us behavior like this on a $3,000-per-month budget, it’s unlikely they would have performed any better with additional budget.”</p>
<p>RMG charges that LinkedIn’s advertising is on a closed network and does not follow the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-measurement-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards for digital advertising</a>. (The IAB did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>
<p>After reviewing RMG’s findings, a LinkedIn spokesperson sent me the following company statement.</p>
<p>“LinkedIn is a members-first organization and our&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFsmfrYAHwHhV6tM-nG54kogFWEw">Ads program</a></u>&nbsp;is designed to ensure that only high-quality, relevant ads are served to our members. We prohibit the use of bots or other automated fraudulent methods to access our services, as they are in violation of the&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNErEgCF6J2mC2B2u6Rnd32Ialafiw">User Agreement.</a></u>&nbsp;Additionally, LinkedIn is a&nbsp;member of the IAB&nbsp;and works closely with the organization and its members to help develop standards for the digital advertising industry.”</p>
<p>But when summarizing his findings in the video, Gellis is skeptical of LinkedIn.</p>
<p>“As far as we can tell, LinkedIn is basically a money pit,” he says. “You’re not going to get the performance that you would expect out of the network.”</p>
<p><strong>(Note: For more, <a href="https://www.samueljscott.com/2019/02/26/fake-online-fake-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see my recent talk on how much of the Internet is fake</a>.)</strong></p>

In this post we’ll show you how to set up a practical computer vision analytic system using the $99 Nvidia Jetson Nano Developers Kit, running OpenDataCam. With OpenDataCam we can recognise, track and count people and a variety of vehicles from a USB webcam feed. We will send the collected data to InfluxDB for visualization and analysis, and set up the Jetson Nano for remote operation and management using a cellular modem and a Hologram SIM.<br></p><p>The video below shows a recording of a live field test I did outside a filling station, counting vehicles and pedestrians travelling in different directions.<br></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/bjrMs8JFYdo">https://youtu.be/bjrMs8</a><br></p><p>To get started, you will need the following hardware:</p><ul role="list"><li>Jetson Nano Developers kit</li><li>5V 4A Power Supply with barrel connector</li><li>Micro SD Card, class 10 or better, 64 GB recommended</li><li>Wi-Fi adaptor (<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15449">Edimax N150</a> or <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15841">Intel 8265.NGWMG M.2 card</a> recommended) or Ethernet cable</li><li>USB Webcam</li><li>4G Modem - USB or Raspberry Pi Hat (Tested with D-Link DWM-222)</li><li>Hologram SIM Card</li><li>HDMI monitor</li><li>USB Mouse and Keyboard</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f2c5dacd16d7c48f0c455f9_20200724_143026.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><h2>How to set up the Nvidia Jetson Nano<br></h2><p>The Nvidia Jetson Nano is a powerful little single board computer with a GPU for running neural networks to do things like image classification, object detection or speech processing. It’s size and low cost means that it’s perfect for edge computing applications like retail analytics or various industrial uses. Combined with a cellular modem and USB webcam, it allows for quick and easy remote deployments, with the only field requirement being a power supply.<br></p><p>The Jetson Nano has no shortage of documentation and online resources, with Nvidia really having put effort into making machine learning approachable for almost anyone. It’s possible to get a basic object demo running in <a href="https://news.developer.nvidia.com/realtime-object-detection-in-10-lines-of-python-on-jetson-nano/">10 lines of python code</a>.</p><ol role="list"><li>Download the latest <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads">SD card image</a> for the Jetson Nano</li><li>Flash the image to the SD Card from your computer.

On the user setup page select the “Log in automatically” to allow all services to start without user intervention.<br></p><p>Once done, you should see the desktop. Open a terminal window and do the following:</p><p>Check for updates, and update all packages. This might take a while.</p><p><code>
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>Install the Nano text editor and curl</p><p><code>
sudo apt install nano curl
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>For deployment a cellular connection is really convenient, but for testing and initial setup and ethernet or WiFi connection is quicker to set up. If you are using a Wi-Fi adaptor for testing, disable Wi-Fi power management to improve connection stability.</p><p><code>
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>It will open a file with the following file</p><p><code>
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 3
</code></p><p>Disable Wi-Fi power saving by changing <strong>3</strong> to <strong>2</strong>.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>Get the IP address of your Jetson Nano by running</p><p><code>
ifconfig
</code></p><p>Restart the Jetson before continuing. Any command line operation from this point forward can be done either directly on the Nano with the keyboard, mouse and monitor, or you can use SSH from any computer on the same network.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that you have a running Nano, it’s time to jump into the computer vision software.<br></p><h2>How to Install OpenDataCam</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam">OpenDataCam</a> is an open source tool for computer vision analytics, that can track and count objects in almost any video feed. It is probably the easiest to use and setup tool that I have seen for this purpose. It is licensed under the permissive MIT license, which allows for use in commercial products.</p><p>‍<br>OpenDataCam runs on the Docker platform, and requires access to CUDA, Nvidia’s tool for running parallel processing tasks on GPUs. First we need to make sure CUDA is defined in the PATH on the Nano, by editing the <em>.bashrc</em> file</p><p><code>
sudo nano .bashrc
</code></p><p>‍<br></p><p>Add the following two lines to the end of the file, then save and close it.</p><p><code>
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
</code></p><p>Increase swap partition size of the Jetson to 6 GB to improve performance and reliability</p><p><code>
git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installSwapfile
cd installSwapfile
chmod 777 installSwapfile.sh
./installSwapfile.sh
</code></p><p>‍<br></p><p>Install Docker-compose and dependencies</p><p><code>
sudo apt install -y python3-pip libssl-dev libffi-dev python-openssl
sudo pip3 install docker-compose
</code></p><p>Allow docker to run on startup</p><p><code>
sudo systemctl enable docker
</code></p><p>Install OpenDataCam. You will be asked for your sudo password during this process, and it may take a while.</p><p><code>
mkdir ~/opendatacam
cd ~/opendatacam
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/v3.0.1/docker/install-opendatacam.sh
chmod 777 install-opendatacam.sh
./install-opendatacam.sh --platform nano
</code></p><h2>How to configure OpenDataCam</h2><p>Once the installation is complete, open Chromium and go to <em>localhost:1880</em> from the Jetson, or <em>*JetsonIP*:1880</em> from any computer on the same network. Once OpenDataCam has started, you will see the following video feed. It is a demo file included in OpenDataCam and demonstrates its object detection capabilities. We’ll use this as an example to get familiar with the interface before changing the video feed for our specific use case.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889973b49b0b09f6e922_UFzR3FTem-uv1i--ef_6ImhdEpBDpt2KfhSRH-nKZV0pb-fzcXfRg8O0PQY3TbOj2PztqHk-4w3Vd2TxSfclRoaW-4s2Y4LzfuUgjATLtWqQF4bczSNDX8J6xo4QGwdqlm1tRpqq.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Click on the “Pathfinder” button in the upper left corner, and you will see the “tracks” generated by each car as it’s identified and tracked.<br></p><p>To count the vehicles, click the “Counter” button to add counting lines as shown below. These lines act as checkpoints, counting objects that pass over them. In the example below, I’ve added lines for oncoming, leaving, and crossing traffic. You can also toggle the direction of travel for objects to be counted, by clicking on the arrow in the centre of the line. To start counting, click the “Start recording” button.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f298899354fcf9d9df68f0d_GLWKyNi1Xs8Jq7lWGDHkCKCNnvh9syNBk2Lk-1gC1OEQEvHgJEs21VJ8oPYtk1Wc-nbns8Kj_GdcqaA25lKE2UaPU82ZRAQzUcFRCuBuUh23XW0RZsZaK3c3CIqIKH6-UhMRzuhd.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>To increase the reliability of the counters, it is important to place them in areas with high detection confidence. By clicking the hamburger menu in the upper right-hand corner, you can activate the tracker accuracy heatmap, which will highlight the areas with the <strong>lowest</strong> detection confidence levels.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f2988983b96a20a4ae37c21_D6BXJhyf_Dj-V7Ee6Xfa5q2Np7CTB_E5WITOkrOwuLSi73JBZjK2gWLf5Iz36E1Bn71D6-om6ao_-lE2HugxczT_NT_y0ojc_2DHNJGRQnvQ3adJOsHddTUM8LhB3z7tXt8GVYzL.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889972d197251894544b_BuLB_wQ_upuv3Vg3rZMNuyXJmQ0GNx0UyaJB5cmIJ-uJbQEcKPVdKE56PmnNvJBW_ft_Dl2oio5QcaScWLRZoK506Yx-L4BfFnNc8uAo4cmMGXlW1jBLDMBAA_D5DD02V-ZifngK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This means that you should avoid these areas when placing counting lines. It might also be a good idea to move the camera to a different perspective, or even improve the detection model using <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/training-yolo-for-object-detection-in-pytorch-with-your-custom-dataset-the-simple-way-1aa6f56cf7d9">transfer learning</a>.<br></p><p>If you have a sample video file that you want to test, you can simply drag and drop it into the OpenDataCam window and it will start playing the new file.<br></p><p>To use a webcam or IP camera stream, you need to <a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/CONFIG.md#video-input">edit the config.json</a> file in ~/opendatacam/ to specify the desired video source. Complete details are available on the <a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/CONFIG.md#video-input">OpenDataCam Github page</a>, including all the other settings you can change. For now will stick to the demo file while we link all the different parts of the project together, and I will describe the final setup I did for deployment at the end of the post.</p><p>To load and updated config file, restart the Docker container</p><p><code>
sudo docker-compose restart
</code></p><h2>How to Install Node-RED for Cloud Data Collection and Analysis</h2><p>I want to collect traffic data in set intervals and store it for analysis. InfluxDB is a database solution built specifically for time series data, which is exactly what we get from OpenDataCam. It also has some built-in visualisation tools. You can install and run InfluxDB locally on the Jetson, but in a production environment we will likely have multiple sources of data, so sending it to the cloud for analysis makes more sense.<br></p><p>OpenDataCam provides a simple but effective <a href="https://opendatacam.github.io/opendatacam/apidoc/">API </a>for interacting with it and extracting data, but we need to create a simple app to do this. I’ll be using Node-RED, flow-based GUI wrapper for Node.js, which also allows us to see at a glance how data flows through the app, and quickly make changes</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f298898cf4cb2839161f831_wUmPP-WAF2sNZpv2qt-pTAv6j4twJzsVmUR3MPQSDpX9roRV8JLq8PxcGqSejBnJc7z-RTxFWb7XIFEDAJNGIBgcPjBmHh4DDmMNuapQ3jL2agcDopb5UghwI4yRnsSB_TFLrEIp.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The above screenshot gives you a good idea of how the flow works. First it checks the status of OpenDataCam (ODC), and starts it if it is not running yet, and if no recording is active, it starts one. If a recording is running, it retrieves the recording and then stop it, and immediately starts a new recording. The data from the completed recording is retrieved, and sent to InfluxDB.<br></p><p>This process is repeated at intervals set in the blue <em>timestamp</em> inject node. The dark green nodes provide output for debugging purposes.<br></p><p>To install Node-RED, open a terminal on your Jetson, and run:</p><p><code>
bash (curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
</code></p><p>Install additional nodes for easy interaction with InfluxDB</p><p><code>
cd ~/.node-red &amp;&amp; npm install node-red-contrib-stackhero-influxdb-v2
</code></p><p>We want to let Node-RED start automatically when the Jetson starts</p><p><code>
sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
</code></p><p>Start Node-RED as a background service</p><p><code>
node-red-start
</code></p><p>Open the Node-RED UI by going to <em>localhost:1880</em> from the Jetson, or <em>*JetsonIP*:1880</em> from any computer on the same network.</p><p>To import the flow, click the menu icon in the upper right corner, and select <em>Import</em>.</p><p>Copy the flow code from this <a href="https://github.com/CuriousMongoose/opendatacam-nodered-influxdb/blob/master/nodered-flow.json">GitHub repo</a>, paste it into the import window, and click <em>Import</em>. The flow will now show in your Node-RED editor. Before we can deploy it, we need to set up InfluxDB to receive data, and get its authentication details.</p><h2>How to configure InfluxDB Cloud</h2><p>Now we need to set up a InfluxDB instance to receive the data. First go to the <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/">InfluxDB Cloud page</a>, register for a free account, and create an instance on the cloud platform of your choice. I used AWS.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889817f6f13ef9861283_iy66hKVJonggHuEE97zGCmEVwrBnvAR0HzJKug2-sTenFZKkAqmzCzpErKJZ_FLEBe6JGaS8v3kr9Kg05pUCwDJKJtK-cwoFw27Jr4ULD90M90_tiYSn5X5kffZhbMXp1udSCsFR.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Once the instance is created and you are logged in, go to the <em>Buckets</em> tab on the <em>Dat…</em></p></div></div></div>

                    <p>Secrets in version control systems (VCS) like git is the current state of the world <strong>despite widely being recognized as a bad practice</strong>. Once source code enters a git repository, it can organically spread into multiple locations. This includes any secrets that may be included within. But why then are secrets in git repositories so common? </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><em>This is the second in a series of articles about secrets within source code and will look specifically at why secrets within git repositories is such a plague, why it is so dangerous and how to prevent it. </em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="1"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="why-secrets-end-up-in-git">Why secrets end up in git</h2><p>A seasoned developer may be scratching their heads wondering why anyone may put secrets inside a git repository. <strong>But the fact is, secrets inside git repositories is the current state of the world. </strong></p><p><a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secret-sprawl/">Last article</a> we talked about how it is common to choose the path of least resistance when it comes to accessing and distributing secrets. <strong>Git acts as the central point of truth for a project</strong>, so it makes sense, at least from a convenience point of view, that secrets are stored inside a private git repository to make distribution and access easy. </p><blockquote>But storing secrets like this is playing with fire, it only takes a very small incident to get burnt. </blockquote><p>In addition to intentionally storing secrets in git, <strong>when secrets are not managed properly, it is very easy to lose track of them</strong>. Secrets may be hardcoded into source code, stored as text file, shared over Slack or buried inside a debug application log. In addition, developers can be in large distributed teams with access to a plethora of secrets while being faced with reduced release cycles and an ever growing number of technologies to master. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="2"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="why-secrets-in-git-is-dangerous">Why secrets in git is dangerous</h2><p>Source code, we have to remember, is very leaky. Code is copied and transferred everywhere. Git is designed in a way that allows, even promotes, code to be freely distributed. </p><p>Projects can be cloned onto multiple machines, forked into new projects, &nbsp;distributed to customers, made public so on and so forth. <strong>Each time it’s duplicated on git, the entire history of that project is also duplicated.</strong></p><p>Why storing secrets in public repositories is bad will be obvious. They are freely available to everyone on the internet and it is very easy to monitor public repositories, GitHub has a public API to fetch all public commits for example. <br></p><p><strong>But what about private git repositories?</strong><br></p><p>Private repositories don’t publish your source code to the internet openly, but it doesn’t have adequate protection to store such sensitive information either. <strong>Imagine if there was a plain text file with all your credit card numbers within it, you hopefully wouldn’t put this into the companies git repository, secrets are just as sensitive. </strong></p><p><strong>A few things to consider when storing secrets in private repositories:</strong></p><ul><li>Everyone in the organization with access to the repo has access to the secrets within (one compromised account can provide an attacker access to a trove of secrets).</li><li>Repositories can be cloned onto multiple machines or forked into new projects.</li><li>Private repositories can be made public which can have secrets buried in the git history.</li></ul><p>Another important consideration is that <em><strong>code removed from a git repository is never actually gone.</strong></em></p><p>Git keeps track of all changes that are made. Code that is removed - or more technically correct: code that is committed over - still exists within the git history.</p><p>Interestingly enough, code is removed from a project at near equal volume that is added. This means that the code within repositories are much deeper than the first layer and secrets could be buried deep within the git history under a mass of commits that have been long forgotten. </p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iPPNU4jrj_CRg3G1zdZ8dFranXUHL7uDUvUk3c3IoLgp-Ub4iNPrpxe8JGjXBl1ntarRIy1Izu5FByy8OFzOOQr8gQA5OCnnvaG_p20IOPQQmaDpHX2LyLJ6IRI0laPFlIs-Ez0O" alt="git history added files and deleted files"><figcaption>git contributions graph</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/graphs/code-frequency"><em>https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/graphs/code-frequency</em></a><em> </em><br></p><blockquote>Comment: The contributions graph that you see above from HashiCorp Vault repository is a typical view of a project's history.

In one example, <strong>bad actors scanned GitHub for AWS keys and used them to mine cryptocurrency, leaving <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots/">developers with thousands of dollars in debt</a></strong>.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[RESEARCH IN PROGRESS] We "forgot" to hide AWS keys in the code of a public repo on <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a> .

It’s therefore common to believe that if secrets are leaked in source code, they of course will be detected within a code review or in a pull request.</p><blockquote>Code reviews are great for detecting logic flaws, maintaining good coding practices and keeping code quality high. But they are not adequate protection for detecting secrets. </blockquote><p>This is because reviews generally only consider the net difference between the current and proposed state. Not the entire history of a branch. Branches are commonly cleaned before being merged into the master branch, temporary code is added then deleted, unnecessary files added then removed.. But now these files, which are high risk candidates for containing secrets, are not visible to the reviewer (unless they want to go through the entire history of a branch). <br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XZOq-SU3EwpmQM6YEo52h7jk1vUM99PL-IJSs5wbRfioPpiAqIl8Ss2zm6MhZPWGLQ8bv_52YMcMB-qPGhb98e0b52cYMNJQYJB8-FXTE1URxxa9g5_2gpwmqT2iqySjDYXhrfCe" alt="Looking for secrets in git history"><figcaption>Git code review diagram</figcaption></figure><p>Let's walk through the example above. While this is over simplified it tells a familiar story. </p><p><br>Commit B a file named main.py is added. A new branch is created to add a new function to main.py in commit C, this feature uses an API key so to save time for testing this is hardcoded. Once the feature is working the hardcoded API key is replaced with an env variable and the file is cleaned. Finally a pull request is made and accepted because the reviewer looks at the net difference between commit B and D, ignoring commit C. Now undetected secrets are buried in the git history of the project.</p><p>While this scenario is very basic, add in hundreds of commits and files between master and a development branch and you can see how easy it is to miss secrets in code reviews. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow.

While automation is not always the answer, detecting secrets, in particular secrets inside git, automated secrets detection is a clear solution to this widespread problem. </p><p>Unfortunately detecting secrets in git is not quite as easy as it first seems because of the probabilistic nature of secrets.

A great dashboard with native GitHub and GitLab integrations, a CLI tool called <a href="https://github.com/GitGuardian/gg-shield">GG-Shield</a> or you can even build custom your own git secrets scanner using the <a href="https://api.gitguardian.com/">GitGuardian API</a>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2><p>Let’s have a quick review of what we have gone through. Git repositories are very common places to find secrets and they remain the perfect incubator for secrets to sprawl into multiple locations. Git keeps a track of a project's history which can be deep making finding secrets difficult. Because of the workflow git creates, it is common for any secrets to be missed during manual checking procedures and automated secrets detection should be introduced into the SDLC.</p><p>Curious of how secrets detection works? Next episode in the secrets in source code series we are going to dive into the mechanics of secrets detection including why probabilistic algorithms are so tricky and the secret sauce behind making them work.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->

        <p><span>E</span>ven though mathematicians have spent over 2,000 years dissecting the structure of the five Platonic solids—the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron and dodecahedron—thereâ€™s still a lot we donâ€™t know about them.<br></p>

<p>Now, a trio of mathematicians has resolved one of the most basic questions about the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Suppose you stand at one of the corners of a Platonic solid. Is there some straight path you could take that would eventually return you to your starting point without passing through any of the other corners? For the four Platonic solids built out of squares or equilateral triangles—the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron—mathematicians&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012365X16302254?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">figured out</a>&nbsp;that the answer is no. Any straight path starting from a corner will either hit another corner or wind around forever without returning home. But with the dodecahedron, which is formed from 12 pentagons, mathematicians didnâ€™t know what to expect.</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jathreya/" target="_blank">Jayadev Athreya</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://userhome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/aulicino/" target="_blank">David Aulicino</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/people?name=Pat_Hooper" target="_blank">Patrick Hooper</a>&nbsp;have shown that an infinite number of such paths do in fact exist on the dodecahedron. Their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10586458.2020.1712564" target="_blank">paper</a>, published in May 2020&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Experimental Mathematics,</em>&nbsp;shows that these paths can be divided into 31 natural families.</p>
<p>The solution required modern techniques and computer algorithms. â€œTwenty years ago, [this question] was absolutely out of reach; 10 years ago it would require an enormous effort of writing all necessary software, so only now all the factors came together,â€� wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~anton.zorich/" target="_blank">Anton Zorich</a>, of the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris, in an email.</p>
<p>The project began in 2016 when Athreya, of the University of Washington, and Aulicino, of Brooklyn College, started playing with a collection of card stock cutouts that fold up into the Platonic solids. As they built the different solids, it occurred to Aulicino that a body of recent research on flat geometry might be just what theyâ€™d need to understand straight paths on the dodecahedron. â€œWe were literally putting these things together,â€� Athreya said. â€œSo it was kind of idle exploration meets an opportunity.â€�<br></p>
<p>Together with Hooper, of the City College of New York, the researchers figured out how to classify all the straight paths from one corner back to itself that avoid other corners.</p>
<p>Their analysis is â€œan elegant solution,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~masur/" target="_blank">Howard Masur</a>&nbsp;of the University of Chicago. â€œItâ€™s one of these things where I can say, without any hesitation, â€˜Goodness, oh, I wish I had done that!â€™â€�</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Symmetries</strong></p>
<p>Although mathematicians have speculated about straight paths on the dodecahedron for more than a century, thereâ€™s been a resurgence of interest in the subject in recent years following gains in understanding â€œtranslation surfaces.â€� These are surfaces formed by gluing together parallel sides of a polygon, and theyâ€™ve proved useful for studying a wide range of topics involving straight paths on shapes with corners, from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-shapes-solve-infinite-pool-table-problem-20170808/" target="_blank">billiard table trajectories</a>&nbsp;to the question of&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2975" target="_blank">when a single light</a>&nbsp;can illuminate an entire mirrored room.</p>
<p>In all these problems, the basic idea is to unroll your shape in a way that makes the paths you are studying simpler. So to understand straight paths on a Platonic solid, you could start by cutting open enough edges to make the solid lie flat, forming what mathematicians call a net. One net for the cube, for example, is a T shape made of six squares.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_b5cfddf2f49d5db00b5bd785f76c12dc.jpg" alt="nautilus paper dodecahed"><figcaption><span>A paper dodecahedron constructed in 2018 by David Aulicino and Jayadev Athreya to show that straight paths from a vertex back to itself while avoiding other vertices are in fact possible. </span><br><span>Patrick Hooper</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine that weâ€™ve flattened out the dodecahedron, and now weâ€™re walking along this flat shape in some chosen direction. Eventually weâ€™ll hit the edge of the net, at which point our path will hop to a different pentagon (whichever one was glued to our current pentagon before we cut open the dodecahedron). Whenever the path hops, it also rotates by some multiple of 36 degrees.<br></p>
<p>To avoid all this hopping and rotating, when we hit an edge of the net we could instead glue on a new, rotated copy of the net and continue straight into it. Weâ€™ve added some redundancy: Now we have two different pentagons representing each pentagon on the original dodecahedron. So weâ€™ve made our world more complicated—but our path has gotten simpler. We can keep adding a new net each time we need to expand beyond the edge of our world.</p>
<p>By the time our path has traveled through 10 nets, weâ€™ve rotated our original net through every possible multiple of 36 degrees, and the next net we add will have the same orientation as the one we started with. That means this 11th net is related to the original one by a simple shift—what mathematicians call a translation. Instead of gluing on an 11th net, we could simply glue the edge of the 10th net to the corresponding parallel edge in the original net. Our shape will no longer lie flat on the table, but mathematicians think of it as still â€œrememberingâ€� the flat geometry from its previous incarnation—so, for instance, paths are considered straight if they were straight in the unglued shape. After we do all such possible gluings of corresponding parallel edges, we end up with what is called a translation surface.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_14ff01eeeec2fbef4da8d0a223f2a3e2.jpg" alt="nautilus arthreya"><figcaption><span>Athreyaâ€™s right arm bears a tattoo of his favorite translation surface — a double pentagon. </span><br><span>Radhika Govindrajan</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The resulting surface is a highly redundant representation of the dodecahedron, with 10 copies of each pentagon. And itâ€™s massively more complicated: It glues up into a shape like a doughnut with 81 holes. Nevertheless, this complicated shape allowed the three researchers to access the rich theory of translation surfaces.<br></p>
<p>To tackle this giant surface, the mathematicians rolled up their sleeves—figuratively and literally. After working on the problem for a few months, they realized that the 81-holed doughnut surface forms a redundant representation not just of the dodecahedron but also of one of the most studied translation surfaces. Called the double pentagon, it is made by attaching two pentagons along a single edge and then gluing together parallel sides to create a two-holed doughnut with a rich collection of symmetries.</p>
<p>This shape also happened to be tattooed on Athreyaâ€™s arm. â€œThe double pentagon was something that I already knew and loved,â€� said Athreya, who got the tattoo a year before he and Aulicino started thinking about the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Because the double pentagon and the dodecahedron are geometric cousins, the formerâ€™s high degree of symmetry can elucidate the structure of the latter. Itâ€™s an â€œamazing hidden symmetry,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/" target="_blank">Alex Eskin</a>&nbsp;of the University of Chicago (who was Athreyaâ€™s doctoral adviser about 15 years ago). â€œThe fact that the dodecahedron has this hidden symmetry group is, I think, quite remarkable.â€�</p>

</center>
<p>The relationship between these surfaces meant that the researchers could tap into an algorithm for analyzing highly symmetric translation surfaces developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/iag3/~finster/en" target="_blank">Myriam Finster</a>&nbsp;of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. By adapting Finsterâ€™s algorithm, the researchers were able to identify all the straight paths on the dodecahedron from a corner to itself, and to classify these paths via the dodecahedronâ€™s hidden symmetries.<br></p>
<p>The analysis was â€œone of the most fun projects Iâ€™ve gotten to work on in my whole career,â€� Athreya said. â€œItâ€™s important to keep playing with things.â€�</p>
<p>The new result shows that even objects that have been studied for thousands of years can still hold secrets, Eskin said. â€œI think even for [the three mathematicians], it was very, very surprising to say something new about the dodecahedron.â€�</p>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond

We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

<p>The algorithms you'll use to create models use the error metric to perform optimizations. Your choice of error metric will affect the final model and the way you evaluate its performance, so it's important to understand the difference between error metrics.</p>
<p>MAE and RMSE are both extremely common in practice, that's why we will talk about them in this article. Before starting, let's have a quick recap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A regression model is a model that predicts a continuous value. The most common way of training a regression model is using supervised learning: you have a set of examples with the 'right answers'. You use this training set to teach the model how to produce those answers with a set of inputs in the hopes of finding general rules you can apply outside of the training set.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="meanabsoluteerrormae">Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</h2>
<p>The mean absolute error (MAE) is defined as the sum of the absolute value of the differences between all the expected values and predicted values, divided by the total number of predictions. In equation form, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/12/MAE.png" alt="MAE"></p>
<p>The expected values are the answers you already know that are part of the training, validation or test sets, and the predicted values are the results predicted by the model for such inputs.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you run your model on a validation set and get the following result:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Expected value</th>
<th>Predicted Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td>19</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>37</td>
<td>32</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>21</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>48</td>
<td>43</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>33</td>
<td>21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>25</td>
<td>22</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each row in the table represents a prediction and its associated expected value.</p>
<p>For example, in the first prediction, the right answer is 5, but our model predicted a 10, the prediction is off by 5. In the third prediction, our model predicted a 32, where the right answer is 37, the prediction is off by -5.</p>
<p>You can summarize this in another table with the results of the error for each prediction.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Expected value</th>
<th>Predicted Value</th>
<th>Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td>19</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>37</td>
<td>32</td>
<td>-5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>21</td>
<td>30</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>48</td>
<td>43</td>
<td>-5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>33</td>
<td>21</td>
<td>-12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>25</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>-3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>How do we calculate the mean absolute error?</p>
<p>Easy, just average the absolute value of the errors. With the data of our table, it would be like this:</p>
<p>MAE = (|5|+|8|+|-5|+|0|+|9|+|-5|+|-12|+|-3|+|3|)/9 = (5+8+5+0+9+5+12+3+3)/9 = 50/9 =~ 5.55</p>
<p>You might be wondering why we use absolute values. This is important to take into consideration the fact that we have two types of errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The predicted value is lower than the expected value.</li>
<li>The predicted value is higher than the expected value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The absolute value ensures that both types contribute to the overall error. Without it, the positive and negative errors would cancel each other. This is bad: your regression model might perform terribly and still return a very low overall error.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, repeat the calculation for total error using the data in the table, but this time don't use the absolute values:</p>
<p>Total Error = (5 + 8+ -5 + 0 + 9 + -5 + -12 + -3 + 3)/9 = 0</p>
<p>Yes, a total value of 0 despite making several mistakes.</p>
<p>MAE is a very simple and useful metric for error, and now you know almost everything there is to know about it.</p>
<p>Let's talk about RMSE.</p>
<h2 id="rootmeansquareerrorrmse">Root-Mean Square Error (RMSE)</h2>
<p>RMSE is defined as the square root of the average of the squared errors. In equation form, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/12/RMSE.png" alt="RMSE"></p>
<p>Don't worry if that sounds a bit confusing, it's much easier to understand with an example. Let's calculate it, step by step, using the same error table from before.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Square the error values</strong></li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Error</th>
<th>Squared Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>64</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-5</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>81</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-5</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-12</td>
<td>144</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-3</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2: Sum the squared errors and divide the result by the number of examples (calculate the average)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>MSE = (25 + 64 + 25 + 0 + 81 + 25 + 144 + 9 + 9)/9 =~ 42.44</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3: Calculate the square root of the average</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>RMSE = square_root(42.44) =~ 6.51</p>
<p>Calculating both the MAE and RMSE is quite simple, and both summarize the total error as a single number. Now that we know how to calculate both, let's discuss their main differences and when to use each one.</p>
<h2 id="maeorrmse">MAE or RMSE?</h2>
<p>First, let's list the things they both have in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both are used to measure the error produced by a predictive model.</li>
<li>Both are quick and easy to calculate.</li>
<li>Both summarize the error as a single numeric value that is easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference between the two metrics is the <strong>contribution of individual error values to the final result</strong>.</p>
<p>In the case of MAE, the contribution follows a linear behavior. This means that an error of 10 contributes twice as much as an error of 5. An error of 1000 contributes 10 times as much as an error of 100.</p>
<p>RMSE has a different behavior: due to the squaring operation, very small values ( between 0 and 1) become even smaller, and larger values become even larger. This means that big error values are magnified, whereas small ones are ignored.</p>
<p>If you were to plot the contribution of single values to the error in our example, MAE and RMSE would follow a behavior like the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/12/MAE_RMSE.png" alt="MAE_RMSE"></p>
<p>In brief, you want to use MAE for problems where the error gets worse linearly, like a model that predicts monetary loss. An error of $100 is twice as bad as an error of $50. MAE doesn't have a <em>predilection</em> for small errors or big errors.</p>
<p>RMSE is used when small errors can be safely ignored and big errors must be penalized and reduced as much as possible. RMSE gives much more importance to large errors, so models will try to minimize these as much as possible.</p>
<p>MAE and RMSE are both very simple and important concepts, and now you are another step ahead in your data science literacy.</p>
<p>I hope this information will be useful in your professional life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.empirical.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the_losers_game.pdf">this essay</a> which discusses changes in investment strategy in the 1970’s. In it, Charles Ellis talks about the difference between a <strong>winner’s game</strong> and a <strong>loser’s game</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Expert tennis is what I call a Winner’s Game because the ultimate outcome is determined by the actions of the winner. Victory is due to winning more points than the opponent wins – not, as we shall see in a moment, simply to getting a higher score than the opponent, but getting that higher score by winning points.</p><p>Amateur tennis, Ramo found, is almost entirely different. Brilliant shots, long and exciting rallies and seemingly miraculous recoveries are few and far between. On the other hand, the ball is fairly often hit into the net or out of bounds, and double faults at service are not uncommon. The amateur duffer seldom beats his opponent, but he beats himself all the time. The victor in this game of tennis gets a higher score than the opponent, but he gets that higher score because his opponent is losing even more points.</p><p>…</p><p>In other words, professional tennis is a <strong>Winner’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the winner – and amateur tennis is a <strong>Loser’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser.</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to talk about winning or losing in programming? What does success look like? I think that is a hard question, which could probably fill several blog posts, but I think a good working definition for us is “producing high quality code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, either by oneself or as part of a team, that helps to solve some problem for an end user”. Based on this definition, it seems to me that professional programming is somewhat of a losers game, at least for most of us.</p><p>I will concede that perhaps in fast moving startups, or for those involved in bleeding-edge research, there is an element of succeeding by “winning points”. Developing a faster algorithm, or determining some incredibly innovative way to implement a feature may help you succeed. However, I believe for a lot of professional programmers, succeeding comes from focusing on not “losing points” - causing bugs or producing unfathomable code, for example<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>When we consider programming with this in mind, it highlights the importance of some of the less glamorous elements of our field as a viable strategy for success. As you approach your next project, ask yourself, how can you avoid losing?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Which itself was taken from the work of Simon Ramo in his book <em>Extraordinary Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>By “high quality code” I mean code that is clean, understandable and that produces few bugs in normal operation. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote"><p>There has been some discussion on this piece on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iqctuy/programming_is_losers_game">lobste.rs</a> and it has highlighted a point that I need to clarify. I am not trying to claim that programming <em>is</em> a game, but rather it represents a scenario where we are working towards a goal, and perhaps one of the best strategies for achieving that goal is to avoid actions that frustrate your attempts to reach it. In tennis, that goal would be to win the match and a strategy you can pursue is to avoid hitting the net, rather than focussing on trying to outsmart your opponent with a clever backhand. For programmers, that goal may be to produce high quality software, and a strategy to pursue is to be extra careful to avoid bugs, rather than implement some very complex algorithm. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></section></div>]]>

<p><a href="https://veloren.net/">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In August, Veloren 0.7 was released! Airshipper, Veloren's launcher, also got
updated to 0.4.0. Veloren was featured in the inaugural episode of the <a href="https://rustgamedev.com/episodes/interview-with-team-veloren">Rust
Game Dev Podcast</a>. Although the 0.7 release party saw the
largest number of concurrent players at 57, it ran into some significant issues
which you can read about below.</p>
<p>The largest merge in Veloren so far also happened in August. It included
monumental changes to lighting and added level of detail functionality to see
far-off mountains. Lots of work has been done on the animation, combat, SFX, and
UX front. Animations for movement and combat were added and improved. Work
continued on particle systems, which have been added to Veloren in places like
campfires, fireworks, and weapons.</p>

<p>In September, work on 0.8 will continue. Some large systems being worked on
include networking, improved persistence stability, and player experience. Game
design is working on improving the connection between the experience a new
player has, and the current game design. The in-progress 0.8 version will likely
be completed more quickly than 0.7, as to not include too many changes.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://douady.paris/blog/egregoria_5.html">5th devlog</a> was published, talking about
the renaming, project management, buildings and scripting.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://discord.gg/CAaZhUJ">Discord</a> server was launched to discuss the project.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://specificprotagonist.itch.io/cary">Cary</a> the player has to bring the titular character to the exit by carrying
them or otherwise making sure they don't – nor the player themselves –
touch any of the traps.
Easier said than done when you have limited stamina and Cary keeps running
into spikes.</p>
<p>Made with hecs and wgpu (no framework), but uses WebGL on the web
because of the current implementation status of WebGPU.</p>
<p>Made during the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/extra-credits-game-jam-6">Extra Credits game jam</a>,
it's a rather small game.
It can be played in the browser or downloaded at <a href="https://specificprotagonist.itch.io/cary">itch.io</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1110620/Way_of_Rhea/">Way of Rhea</a> is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world where you can
only interact with items that match your current color.</p>
<p>Way of Rhea has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1110620/Way_of_Rhea/">free Steam demo</a> temporarily available as part of
<a href="https://www.play-nyc.com/">Play NYC</a>!
The new demo includes a level that wasn't part of the Steam Game Festival,
showing off how circuit puzzles will work in the game. Since Play NYC
couldn't be in person this year, the devs temporarily themed this level to look
like last year's Play NYC venue, included placing virtual booths for other games
throughout the level.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kvark/vange-rs">vange-rs</a> is the project of re-implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vangers">Vangers</a> game (from 1998)
in Rust using modern development practices, parallel computations, and GPU.</p>
<p>This month vange-rs got real-time shadows!
See <a href="https://reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/i32p6r/realtime_hybrid_shadows_in_vangers">video on /r/rust_gamedev</a> and technical description
on the <a href="https://kvark.github.io/vange-rs/2020/08/04/shadows.html">Hybrid Shadows</a> post of the blog.</p>
<p>Another exciting development - the new bruteforce rendering technique allowing
to shift the camera behind the mechos as in 3rd person view.

<p><a href="https://epcc.itch.io/garden">Garden</a> is an upcoming game centered around growing realistic plants.
Some of the updates from <a href="https://cyberplant.xyz/posts/july-august/">the July &amp; August devlog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new player inventory system;</li>
<li>Better collision detection and camera movement;</li>
<li>Minimalist, scrollable text-based GUI for choosing which species to plant
or the type of material to build with (or destroy) something;</li>
<li>Plant growth now depends directly on the amount of light
every individual leaf receives, calculated on the GPU;</li>
<li>Variable leaf alignment and ease of creating variety;</li>
<li>Better bark, detailed trunks, and new species;</li>
<li>Completely new lighting using GI.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/khonsulabs/chillscapes">Chillscapes</a> is a lo-fi
rhythm experience created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/neoc03-rhythm-jam">NEOC#03 Rhythm Game Jam</a>. Using
layerable lo-fi music tracks, the game has you tap with the rhythm of the loops
being added, before changing the music up by adding another loop into the mix.
Last week, <a href="https://community.khonsulabs.com/t/chillscapes-retrospective-and-kludgine-update/28">a retrospective update was published</a>
reflecting on what the developer's takeaways were from the experience.</p>
<p>Chillscapes is written using an early-in-development 2d engine,
<a href="https://github.com/khonsulabs/kludgine">Kludgine</a>. For audio playback, rodio was utilized. The source code is
<a href="https://github.com/khonsulabs/chillscapes">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>When linking to a page for the <strong>purpose of reference</strong>, it seems better to me to <em><strong>link to the <a href="https://archive.org/">archive</a> of a given page</strong></em>, rather than to the original site itself.</p>
<p>This ensures that after some years have gone by, <strong>my article is guaranteed to be consistent</strong>. Due the  changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link could lead to a:</p>
<ul>
<li>404 /  Not Found (most common)</li>
<li>Changed or edited content, or entirely replaced content</li>
<li>Content that, due to a rise in popularity, is now shielded, demanding the user to make an account to read the entire article.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>Take defensive measures. To future-proof your content, rather than reference the general web, its far more reliable to link to an archive.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example:</h2>
<p>The Epoch Times wrote an article on Smartphones data-mining their users. This is the archived article here:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190214015500/https://www.theepochtimes.com/smartphone-app-users-are-data-mined-even-when-not-using-the-apps_2787202.html">The Archive Version (fully readable)</a></p>
<h3 id="article-content-before">Article Content Before</h3>
<p>You can see its perfectly “normal” readable useful  content.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-before.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<h3 id="article-content-after">Article Content After</h3>
<p>Now it’s spam from a site suffering financial need.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-after.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<p>So in Feb 14 2019 your users would have seen the content you intended. However in Sep 07 2020, your users are being asked to support independent Journalism instead.</p>
<h2 id="if-an-archive-record-doesnt-exist-make-one">If an Archive Record Doesn't Exist, Make One</h2>
<p>Its worth the extra moment, in referencing a site, to make an archive of the page you wish to reference, if one does not exist. After that, immediately use the link from the archive.org entry, rather than the blog, news, info, or forum site you wish to refer to.</p>
<h2 id="in-unstable-times-take-measures-for-stability">In Unstable Times, Take Measures for Stability</h2>
<p>The web is a fast changing place. Even more during the Covid pandemic and suffering financial markets. Since times are financially harder, websites are disappearing, heaping up advertising, demanding user response, and things like this.</p>
<p>To avoid your content losing quality due to these things, linking to a solid, unchanging static copy of the page is far more reliable.</p>

Making attempts to measure each engineer and team against the same yard stick not only hurts culture, but gives no true indication of productivity to begin with.</p><p>‍</p><p>To date, the industry has been attempting this 'holy grail' of software development metrics from the wrong perspective. By focusing on drivers and blockers of productivity rather than KPIs and stack ranking; we can start to measure engineers and teams in a healthy way. More importantly, this new perspective enables engineering leaders to introduce a software development metrics to help improve while maintaining the highest impact driver of productivity (culture).</p><p>‍</p><p>Check out Haystack's approach <a href="https://usehaystack.io/">here</a>!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5ef130052901e5cad8432b81_Haystack_Designed_Presentation.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><a href="https://usehaystack.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=3%20git%20signals%20to%20identify%20blockers&amp;utm_campaign=inside%20blog">Haystack</a> helps engineering leaders identify blockers and trends.

<p>In this post, we're going to take a look at some cool stuff that can be done using HTML. Let's look at some of the html tags, you might not be knowing even existed.
ould be making use of today.</p>
<p>Let's get started 💪</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-the-lessfiguregreater-tag">1. The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>This can be used to mark up a photo. The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element can also contain a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593642634315-48f5414c3ad9"</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"Person using lack laptop computer on brown wooden table"</span> <span>style</span>=<span>"width:100%"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figcaption</span>&gt;</span>Person using lack laptop computer on brown wooden table<span>&lt;/<span>figcaption</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="2-the-lessaudiogreater-tag">2. The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>⁣<code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element provides a way to add audio resources to a web page without the need to use any other plugin.⁣ It's used to play a sound much as music or an audio stream. It supports mp3, wav and ogg.
⁣
A fallback text is enclosed within the tag to be shown to browsers that don't support the element.⁣
⁣
By default, the browser does not show any controls. ⁣
To add the ability for users to play, pause, adjust volume, etc. the 'controls' attribute can be used.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>audio</span> <span>controls</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"music.mp4"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"audio/mp4"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"mucis.ogg"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"audio/ogg"</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>audio</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="3-the-lessvideogreater-tag">3. The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>This allows you to embed a media player for video playback. 
It's used to play a video clop or a video stream without embedding youtube or vimeo videos. It supports mp4, webm and ogg.</p>
<p>For example, you can upload your video on AWS S3 and use the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag to embed it on your website.</p>
<p>You can also specify certain attributes, such as width, height, autoplay, loop, controls, etc.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>video</span> <span>width</span>=<span>"960"</span> <span>height</span>=<span>"540"</span> <span>controls</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"video.mp4"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"video/mp4"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"video.ogg"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"video/ogg"</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>video</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-the-lessprogressgreater-tag">4. The <code>&lt;progress&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;progress&gt;</code> tag represents the progress of a task.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;progress&gt;</code> tag should not be confused with the <code>&lt;meter&gt;</code> tag (which represents a gauge). It has two attributes value and max.⁣⁣</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>progress</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"57"</span> <span>max</span>=<span>"100"</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>progress</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="5-the-lessmetergreater-tag">5. The <code>&lt;meter&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>You can use the meter element to measure data within a given range (a gauge).</p>
<p>This can be achieved with min and max values or with a percentage.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>meter</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"7"</span> <span>min</span>=<span>"0"</span> <span>max</span>=<span>"10"</span>&gt;</span>7 out of 10<span>&lt;/<span>meter</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>meter</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"0.4"</span>&gt;</span>40%<span>&lt;/<span>meter</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="6-the-lessdatagreater-tag">6. The <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>It specifies the machine-readable translation of the content of the element. It also provides a human-readable text.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>data</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"010"</span>&gt;</span>Dogs<span>&lt;/<span>data</span>&gt;</span>

</code></pre>
<h2 id="9-the-lessdetailgreater-tag">9. The <code>&lt;detail&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;⁣detail&gt;</code> tag is used to make collapsible sections when it is required to provide extra information about a subject that users can hide or view by their choice.
⁣
It uses the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag which specifies the title that can be clicked to expand or collapse the details.⁣</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>details</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>summary</span>&gt;</span>Click To Open<span>&lt;/<span>summary</span>&gt;</span>
  Hey, I am natively collapsable section. My content remains hidden till you click on summary.

<p>By now, many people have run across the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016.pdf">Invisible Salamander</a> paper about the interesting property of AES-GCM, that allows an attacker to construct a ciphertext that will decrypt with a valid tag under two different keys, provided both keys are known to the attacker. On some level, finding properties like this isn’t too surprising: AES-GCM was designed to be an AEAD, and nowhere in the AEAD definition does it state anything about what attackers with access to the keys can do, since the usual assumption is that attackers don’t have that access, since any Alice-Bob-Message model would be meaningless in that scenario.</p>



<p>What is interesting to me is that this property comes up more often than one would think, I ran across it several times now during my work reviewing cryptographic designs, it’s far from an obscure property for real world systems. The general situation these systems have in common is that they involve three parties: Alice, Bob, and Trent. Trent is a trusted third party for Bob, who is allowed to read messages and scan them, with details like when and why depending on the crypto system in question. While Trent and Bob agree on the ciphertext<em>—</em>say because Trent hands Bob the ciphertext or because Alice presents Trent’s signature on it<em>—</em>Alice has the option of giving Trent and Bob different keys. The challenge for Alice is to come up with a ciphertext that has a valid authentication tag and still decrypts to different messages for Trent and Bob.</p>



<h4>Mitigations</h4>



<p>Before I dive deeper into how to construct invisible salamanders for AES-GCM and AES-GCM-SIV, a few words on how to defend against these problems. The easiest option here is to add a hash of the key to the ciphertext. This technically violates indistinguishability, as the identity of the key is leaked, i.e. an attacker now knows which key was used for the message. If indistinguishability is necessary, using the IV as a salt for the hash works well, constructions like <code>HMAC-SHA-2(key=IV, message=key)</code> (i.e. aka HKDF-expand) work well here, as long as attention is paid on whether or not this key hash can be used in any other context. In general, it shouldn’t because the key already should only be used for AES-GCM/AES-GCM-SIV, but real world systems sometimes have weird properties.</p>



<h4>Constructing Salamanders</h4>



<p>With the mitigation out of the way, onto the fun part: Constructing the messages. In order to understand why and how these attacks work, we first have to talk about <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{F}_{2^{128}}</span> and the way AES-GCM and AES-GCM-SIV use this field to construct their respective tags. As a finite field <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{F}_{2^{128}}</span> supports addition, multiplication, and division, following the usual field axioms. The field has characteristic 2, which means addition is just the xor operator, and subtraction is the exact same operation as addition. Multiplication and division is somewhat more complicated and not in scope for this article, it suffices to say that multiplication can be implemented with a very fast algorithm if the hardware supports certain instruction sets (carryless multiplication). The division algorithm uses the Euclidean algorithm and will at most take 256 multiplications in a naive implementation, so while slower than the other operations, it will still be extremely fast. I will use <span data-katex-display="false">+</span> for the addition operation and <span data-katex-display="false">\cdot</span> for the multiplication operation. The most important caveat is to not confuse these operations with integer arithmetic.</p>



<h5>AES-GCM</h5>



<p>Next, on to <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf">AES-GCM</a>. This AEAD is a relatively straightforward implementation of an AEAD that uses a UHF based MAC for authentication. Our IV is 12 byte long, we use a 4 byte counter and CTR mode to encrypt the message. The slightly odd feature is that we start the counter at 2, for reasons we will see later. For authentication, we first derive an authentication key <span data-katex-display="false">H</span> by encrypting the zero block (This is why we don’t start the counter at zero, otherwise the zero IV would be invalid). Now, using the ciphertext blocks, additional data blocks (both padded with zeros as needed for the last block), and adding a special length block containing the size of the additional data and the ciphertext, we get a collection of blocks, all of which I will refer to as <span data-katex-display="false">C_i</span>. To compute the tag, we now compute the polynomial</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">GHASH(H, C, T) = C_0\cdot H^{n+1} + C_1\cdot H^{n}+\dots + C_{n-1}\cdot H^2+C_n\cdot H+T</span></p><p>The constant term, <span data-katex-display="false">T</span> is the encrypted counter block associated to the counter variable of 1 (Which is why we started at 2 for the CTR mode). Remember that in characteristic 2 <span data-katex-display="false">+</span> is xor, so we could equivalently say that we compute the polynomial without the constant term and then encrypt it with CTR mode as the first block.</p>



<p>Now, how do we get two different plaintexts to agree on both ciphertext and tag, we first choose two keys and produce the corresponding keystreams, choosing the plaintexts so that the ciphertexts agree (If you want two plaintext that make sense, this part is the hardest step, you first brute force the first few bytes in order to be valid in one format and a comment opening statement in the other, so that you can switch which parts of the ciphertext will appear as valid plaintext and which parts appear as commented out). We leave one ciphertext block open for now, as a sacrificial block that we will modify in order to make the tags turn out to be the same. Next derive the corresponding authentication keys <span data-katex-display="false">H_1</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">H_2</span> and our constant terms <span data-katex-display="false">T_1, T_2</span>. This means, we have <span data-katex-display="false">C_i</span> fixed, except for a specific index, say <span data-katex-display="false">j</span>, and can now solve</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">GHASH(H_1, C, T_1) =GHASH(H_2, C, T_2)</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">\sum_{i=0}^n C_i\cdot H_1^{n+1-i}+T_1=\sum_{i=0}^n C_i\cdot H_2^{n+1-i}+T_2</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">C_j\cdot\left(H_1^{n+1-j}+H_2^{n+1-j}\right)=\sum_{\substack{i=0\\i\neq j}}^n C_i\cdot \left(H_1^{n+1-i}+H_2^{n+1-i}\right)+T_1+T_2</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">C_j=\left(H_1^{n+1-j}+H_2^{n+1-j}\right)^{-1}\cdot\left(\sum_{\substack{i=0\\i\neq j}}^n C_i\cdot \left(H_1^{n+1-i}+H_2^{n+1-i}\right)+T_1+T_2\right)</span></p><p>by solving for the sacrificial block <span data-katex-display="false">C_j</span>.</p>



<h5>AES-GCM-SIV</h5>



<p>So far so good, but, what about <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8452">AES-GCM-SIV</a>? GCM is famous for having many weird properties that make it extremely fragile, like leaking the authentication key on a single IV reuse, or allowing for insecure tags smaller than 128 bits. In many ways, AES-GCM-SIV is how AES-GCM should look like for real world applications, much more robust against IV reuse, only revealing the damaging properties of an UHF with a reused IV if both IV and tag are the same. This is accomplished through using the tag as a synthetic IV, meaning the tag is computed over the plaintext, and then used as IV for CTR mode to encrypt. Even though this kind of SIV construction uses MAC-then-Encrypt, they are secure against the usual downsides due to CTR mode always succeeding in constant time, independent of the plaintext. This means the receiver can decrypt the message and validate the tag without revealing information about the plaintext in case of an invalid tag. The library needs to take care that the plaintext is properly discarded and not exposed to the user in case the tag does not validate.</p>



<p>The actual IV for AES-GCM-SIV is used primarily derive a per message key. This means that if the IV of two messages is different, both encryption and authentication keys will be unrelated and can not be used to infer things about each other.</p>



<p>All in all AES-GCM-SIV works like this:</p>



<ul><li><span data-katex-display="false">H, K_E = \operatorname{KDF}(K, IV)</span></li><li><span data-katex-display="false">T=\operatorname{AES}(K_E, P_0\cdot H^{n+1}+\dots+P_n\cdot H)</span></li><li><span data-katex-display="false">C=\operatorname{AES-CTR}(K_E, IV=T)</span></li></ul>



<p>where the plaintext blocks <span data-katex-display="false">P_i</span> again contain additional data and length, and some extra hardening and efficiency tricks having been stripped for clarity.</p>



<p>Our previous approach of first creating the ciphertext and then balancing things out to get the tags to agree clearly cannot work here anymore. The keystream, and therefore the ciphertext, depend on the tag, so if we want to have any chance of finding a salamander, we have to fix the tag before we do any calculation at all. So after having chosen <span data-katex-display="false">T</span>, we decrypt it under each of our keys to get the result of our polynomial <span data-katex-display="false">S_i=\operatorname{AES}^{-1}(K_{E,i}, T)</span>. What we are left with is finding plaintexts <span data-katex-display="false">P_1, P_2</span> such that</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">S_i=\sum_{j=0}^n P_{j, i} H_i^{n+1-j}</span></p><p>which gives us a system of two linear equations with <span data-katex-display="false">2n</span> unknowns. But this isn’t all constraints we need to satisfy, since we still need to encrypt these plaintexts once we have the tag balanced. Here, we are lucky that everything is over characteristic 2: The CTR encryption is just an addition of the plaintext and the encrypted counter block <span data-katex-display="false">C_i=\operatorname{AES}(K_E, CB_i)+P_i</span>. To say that two plaintexts result in the same ciphertext under two different keys is just fulfilling the equation</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">\operatorname{AES}(K_{E, 1}, CB_{j, 1})+P_{j, 1}=\operatorname{AES}(K_{E, 2}, CB_{j, 2})+P_{j, 2}</span>.</p>



<p>This, like our two equations for the tag, is a linear equation. So in the end, for a plaintext that has a size of <span data-katex-display="false">n</span> blocks, we get <span data-katex-display="false">n+2</span> linear equations with <span data-katex-display="false">2n</span> variables. This means, in almost all cases, we can construct an invisible salamander with only adding two sacrificial blocks, with the same caveat that the two plaintexts need to be partially brute forced.</p>



<h4>Test Code</h4>



<p>I’ve put this to the test and have written code to produce <a href="https://github.com/sophieschmieg/fun-with-gcm/blob/master/FunWithGcm.java">AES-GCM</a> (Java) and <a href="https://github.com/sophieschmieg/fun-with-gcm/blob/master/fun_with_gcm_siv.cc">AES-GCM-SIV</a> (C++) salamanders.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Anyone with any programming experience understands that computers are deterministic machines. If you provide the same input, you’ll always get the same output. That’s why having computers generate something by chance is trickier than it may seem.</p>
<p>Computers use random numbers for everything from cryptography to gambling, generative algorithms, video games, and more. However, computers are inherently incapable of being random. Instead, programmers rely on pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). These are simply a category of algorithms that programmatically generate new random numbers from a given starting value called the seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These algorithms are not without their own limitations. Since the random numbers are programmatically generated, if someone were able to identify the seed value and the PRNG algorithm you were using, they’d be able to predict the next random number in the sequence. This would allow an attacker to break encryption, predict the next playing card in a sequence, cheat in a video game, etc. </p>
<p>Despite this concern, PRNGs are extremely useful in situations involving modeling and simulations as it allows you to “replay” a series of random events by initializing your random number generator with the same seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In situations where the randomness of the random numbers is critical, we use a “true” random number generator (TRNGs). Unlike PRNGs that have an arbitrary seed value, TRNGs pick a seed value from their environment / external data. </p>
<p>Here are a few potential options:</p>
<ul><li>Mouse movements</li><li>Fan noise</li><li>Atmospheric pressure</li><li>Number of microseconds since the last whole second</li></ul>
<p>We just need to pick a seed that an attacker wouldn’t be able to predict. This seed value will then be passed into an algorithm, similar to PRNGs, that will generate a random number to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use case will generally dictate whether a PRNG will suffice or if a “true” RNG is needed. Regardless, it’s important to understand the practical differences between both approaches. </p>
<p>PRNGs are faster than TRNGs and their determinism is extremely useful in cases where you want to replay a series of “random” events. Additionally, some PRNGs are periodic in nature, but modern PRNGs with the right initialization parameters have a period long enough that it’s not a major concern. Conversely, TRNGs are slower than PRNGs, are non-deterministic, and are not periodic.</p>
<h2>Linear Congruential Generator</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at implementing a simple PRNG. We’ll implement a variant called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> (LCG) algorithm. LCG was previously one of the most commonly used and studied PRNGs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">more info</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the recurrence relation for LCG:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iNcDHvHA6BvD1fpYntUkZ-11dzW6EYoW5dHv7mMhPZhDNo5fJaIMZXUh7SmZq0AoobvHxg7K5MMvqoWav7ee0xHase0fhAjWmNWoW7RcT5GzAao1jVwtGY11q2yL6iuvWiYFgyHS" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">Wikipedia page on LCG</a> documents a few commonly used values for modulus, multiplier, and increment. There’s no consensus on the best values to use hence the differing values across implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to be mindful of what values we use for these parameters. Choosing the wrong values can create a period that is too short which would render our random number generator useless. </p>
<p>In the image below, you can see that small changes to our parameters can greatly impact the period length.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FVum2kuYt4oMYjOdzHx2txpQH0NgheDDSUSxyQJamzGbZgPcUALt3Mmv4H-BElodwXwTzcLaqicG8IdsPFAgolV4DK8NkZXtghDQ_hX6MyMsxU_irWeOxR1ijaoYgecOU3fbuPbQ" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>For our implementation, we’ll use the values documented in previous standards of the C languages (C90/C99/ANSI C,&nbsp; and C11).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>a = 1103515245</code></p>
<p><code>m = 2³¹</code></p>
<p><code>c = 12345</code></p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever PRNG algorithm you choose should result in a uniform distribution of random numbers and a sufficiently long period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a simple implementation in Swift:</p>

<h2>Simulating Dice Rolls</h2>
<p>Let’s say you wanted to simulate a dice roll. </p>
<p>It might seem reasonable to change the modulus to 6, but this would create a period far too short to be usable. We need to stick with well-chosen and tested values for our parameters. </p>

<p>Instead, using the approach in the code above, we can simulate 10,000 dice rolls:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uVT2lMlmWHcYIio5WmgkMMXz9nkkA_P4lzIVWeyVETxasCDn5s_5qQWgBh5FAvfPDwHipyMaqHWmb_lOp_J7oOXiRdxo_3lywqvrIo4Ky40QoDUYIrJ15w5mC6B9XWVLWvyySRWr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Dice Value: 10,000 Roll Simulations</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking at the results, we can see that it is indeed a uniform distribution of values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Generating Random Numbers In A Range</h2>
<p>Next, let’s consider generating random numbers that fall in a range. Again, we shouldn’t change our parameters without fully understanding how it affects the period. </p>
<p>Instead, we should map our PRNG’s results to values in our desired range.&nbsp;</p>

<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/A2h_s4Z_eN-qGkjEZabgPwWpOjMmIDdD9fQlYcdM344voNTlxPIvammtm6RRXJ6aDgG83h67zZYf4E4olN7jz5VRiIK10D_XeRTf0whcfHLZhn8Q9142vJBZU9Ma40DIvFVw7FdU" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>After a million simulations across the specified range [30, 80)</p>
<h2>Further Reading</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators">more modern PRNGs</a>, I’d recommend exploring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne-Twister</a> approach. It’s currently the most popular PRNG algorithm and currently used in Python (numpy), Ruby, PHP, R, and C++.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Azure Bicep is an abstraction built on top of Azure ARM Templates and Azure Resource Manager that offers a cleaner code syntax with better support for modularity and code re-use. Azure Bicep moves away from the JSON syntax used by ARM Templates and is much easier to both read and write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Azure! This is the latest tool from Microsoft for deploying Azure resources in a DevOps process, and its even open source!</p>



<p>Let’s get started!</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: Before you start using Azure Bicep, know that it is in an early Alpha state and is not supported for use in production environments just yet. Also, it doesn’t support all the functionality it eventually will. However, it does support some really great features already that makes Azure<a href="https://build5nines.com/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/"> Infrastructure as Code </a>(IaC) even easier to write and read!</p></blockquote>







<br><h2><span id="what_is_azure_bicep"></span>What is Azure Bicep?<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Bicep is a new declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources. The goal of this new language is to make it easier to write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) targeting Azure Resource Manager (ARM) using a syntax that’s more friendly than the JSON syntax of Azure ARM Templates.</p>



<p>Azure Bicep works as an abstraction layer built on top of ARM Templates. Anything that can be done with Azure ARM Templates can be done with Azure Bicep as it provides a “transparent abstraction” over ARM (Azure Resource Manager). With this abstraction, all the <code>types</code>, <code>apiVersions</code>, and <code>properties</code> valid within ARM Templates are also valid with Azure Bicep.</p>

<p>Azure Bicep is a transpiled language. This means that the Azure Bicep code converted into ARM Template code. Then, the resulting ARM Template code is used to deploy the Azure resources. This transpiling enables Azure Bicep to use it’s own syntax and compiler for authoring Azure Bicep files that compile down to Azure Resource Manager (ARM) JSON as a sort of intermediate language (IL).</p>



<p>The way that Azure Bicep is transpiled into ARM JSON is similar to how there are many different languages that can be written in, then transpiled into JavaScript that can be run within the web browser. One popular example of this type of transpiled language is TypeScript. A transpiled language offers benefits of adding an abstraction layer to make it easier and / or more feature full to write code that then gets compiled down to IL code that gets executed. This is also similar to how C# and VB.NET code compile down to MSIL in .NET code.</p>



<p>In the development world, it’s common to encounter the use of transpiled languages. It’s also common in the DevOps world where YAML and JSON are converted between one or the other. Azure Bicep offers some similarity in how it’s transpiled into ARM JSON. This enables you to use an alternative syntax and feature set for writing declarative Infrastructure as Code than the often-cumbersome ARM JSON syntax.</p>



<blockquote><p>Azure Bicep offers some similarity in how it’s transpiled into ARM JSON. This enables you to use an alternative syntax and feature set for writing declarative Infrastructure as Code than the often-cumbersome ARM JSON syntax.</p></blockquote>



<p>Azure Bicep will have limits in its ability to support features that are not natively supported by ARM Templates when deploying Azure resources. However, Azure Bicep will also be able to implement additional code reuse and other features that the Azure Bicep compiler will be able to translate into valid ARM JSON features. Through all this, Azure Bicep has a goal of offering a cleaner syntax along with better support for modularity and code re-use than is offered by ARM JSON.</p>



<h2><span id="why_use_azure_bicep"></span>Why use Azure Bicep?<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Resource Manager and ARM Templates are written in a JSON syntax that can be cumbersome to work with. Azure Bicep is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that offers a transparent abstraction over Azure Resource Manager and ARM Templates that offers support for a cleaner code syntax with better support for modularity and code re-use. Azure Bicep offers a few improvements for authoring Azure IaC over the use of ARM Template JSON.</p>



<br><h3><span id="azure_bicep_benefits"></span>Azure Bicep Benefits<span></span></h3>



<p>Here are the primary benefits of using Azure Bicep that are integrated as core goals into the Azure Bicep project and are the foundations for why Microsoft is building Azure Bicep:</p>



<ol><li>Create a better language for writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for describing, validating, and deploying Azure resources.</li><li>The Azure Bicep language is a transparent abstraction that does not require any updates or onboarding to the underlying platform in order to support a new Azure resource <code>type</code> and / or <code>apiVersion</code>.</li><li>Azure Bicep code should be easily understood and straightforward to learn for those both new and experienced with other programming languages.</li><li>Code re-use should be a primary feature allowing users freedom to modularize and re-use code without ‘copy/paste’.</li><li>Azure Bicep tooling should offer a high level of discoverability and validation. The tooling should also be developed alongside the compiler; rather than added afterwards.</li><li>Azure Bicep should enable users to have high confidence that the code is ‘syntactically valid’ before it’s deployed.</li></ol>



<p>Also, Azure Bicep is being specifically designed so that it is not a general-purpose language for meeting any need. It is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) meant for writing declarative IaC. It’s also not meant to provide a model for non-Azure related tasks.</p>



<h2><span id="install_azure_bicep"></span>Install Azure Bicep<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Bicep is a DevOps tool built for authoring IaC used to deploy Azure resources from any environment. As a result, this means Azure Bicep supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>



<p>The primary component for Azure Bicep is the Bicep CLI. This is the required tool used for compiling Bicep code into ARM JSON; plus, it’s open source and cross-platform.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at installing Azure Bicep in different environments!</p>



<h3><span id="download_bicep_cli_binaries"></span>Download Bicep CLI Binaries<span></span></h3>



<p>When installing Azure Bicep, you will need to first download the Bicep CLI binary built for your operating system. All the binaries for the different supported operating systems can be downloaded from the official <a href="https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases page</a> of the Azure Bicep open source project.</p>



<p>You can either manually download the Bicep CLI binary and install it, or you can use the following helper script examples to install Azure Bicep more easily.</p>



<h3><span id="install_on_windows"></span>Install on Windows<span></span></h3>



<p>On Windows machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using PowerShell with the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Create the install folder
$installPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\.bicep"
$installDir = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $installPath -Force
$installDir.Attributes += 'Hidden'
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-win-x64.exe", "$installPath\bicep.exe")
# Add bicep to your PATH
$currentPath = (Get-Item -path "HKCU:\Environment" ).GetValue('Path', '', 'DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames')
if (-not $currentPath.Contains("%USERPROFILE%\.bicep")) { setx PATH ($currentPath + ";%USERPROFILE%\.bicep") }
if (-not $env:path.Contains($installPath)) { $env:path += ";$installPath" }
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command.
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_on_macos"></span>Install on macOS<span></span></h3>



<p>On macOS machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using the terminal with the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-osx-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep
# Add Gatekeeper exception (requires admin)
sudo spctl --add ./bicep
# Add bicep to your PATH (requires admin)
sudo mv ./bicep /usr/local/bin/bicep
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_on_linux"></span>Install on Linux<span></span></h3>



<p>On Linux machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-linux-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep
# Add bicep to your PATH (requires admin)
sudo mv ./bicep /usr/local/bin/bicep
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_in_azure_cloud_shell"></span>Install in Azure Cloud Shell<span></span></h3>



<p>The Azure Cloud Shell runs on Ubuntu server, so to install Azure Bicep, you will need to install the Linux binary for the Bicep CLI. However, you cannot simply use the above script for installing Azure Bicep on Linux due to a limitation of the Azure Cloud Shell that prevents you from modifying the PATH.</p>



<p>Here are some steps you can follow to basically “install” Azure Bicep for use in the Azure Cloud Shell environment:</p>



<ol><li>Connect to the Azure Cloud Shell; either within the Azure Portal or at <code><a href="https://shell.azure.com/" rel="nofollow">https://shell.azure.com</a></code>.</li><li>First, you likely want to create a directory within the Azure Cloud Shell environment to save the Bicep CLI to. For example, creating a <code>~/tools</code> directory:<br><code>mkdir ~/tools</code></li><li>Next, navigate to the directory created and download the Linux binary for the Bicep CLI into the Azure Cloud Shell environment into this directory:</li></ol>



<pre><code># Navigate to "tools" directory
cd ~/tools
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-linux-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep</code></pre>



<p>Using the above steps will place the Azure Bicep CLI in the location of <code>~/tools/bicep</code> within you Azure Cloud Shell environments. Once placed here, you can execute the Bicep CLI from anywhere within the Azure Cloud Shell environment by referencing it within the <code>~/tools</code> directory.</p>



<p>For example, when located within the <code>~/bicep</code> directory, you can run the following command to utilize the <code>~/tools/bicep</code> executable to build some Azure Bicep code in the <code>main.bicep</code> file:</p>



<pre><code>chris@Azure:~/bicep$ ~/tools/bicep build main.bicep</code></pre>



<p>With the Azure Bicep CLI installed into the Azure Cloud Shell environment, then you’ll be able to utilize Azure Bicep easily from anywhere without the need to install it on your local machine.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599532527250/Gm0E0xbTo.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>The most successful companies are built upon great working cultures that are thoughtful about the <a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-new-analytics-of-culture">cultural contribution</a> each hire will make to their company. If you're a candidate looking to land your dream job, you'll need to be well prepared for these cultural or behavioral interviews. </p>
<p>As a hiring manager, I've interviewed over 200 engineering candidates and a significant portion of that  has been evaluating the soft skills each candidate embodies. I've rejected extremely strong technical performers and and fought to hire some more junior candidates based on the signal I've identified from the culture interview. Because every company has their own culture, their own values, and their own questions, the culture interview can be extremely hard to prepare for. However, there's still plenty you can do to set yourself up for success instead of jumping in blind.</p>
<p>While my interviewing experience as both a hiring manager and a candidate have been primarily within engineering, I believe the tools in this kit will be mostly applicable across product, design, and other disciplines within product development organizations. </p>
<h2 id="stories-to-prepare">Stories to Prepare</h2>
<p>Why should you prepare stories instead of answers to specific questions? The simple reason is that you can't prepare and memorize an answer to every question an interviewer might ask. Often times these conversations are organic and the real signal comes from how you respond to follow-up questions. The best answers are rooted in real examples from your personal experience and by "loading" these stories into your brain ahead of time, you'll be better equipped to handle questions on the spot.</p>

<h3 id="story-1-your-career-narrative">Story #1: Your career narrative</h3>
<p>Almost everyone you talk to will give an intro of themselves and then ask you to share a brief intro as well. Depending on who you're talking to, that intro can be anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes. In some cases, a hiring manager or recruiter might ask you to go deeper into your background and spend up to 30 minutes digging into your experiences.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ol>
<li>A narrative that connects your career together. While many careers are not linear, it can help to show that you were deliberate about the jobs you took and what you wanted to learn at each one. You may find that as you look back on your career, there's a story you can weave together that ties together where you started, where you're at now, and the trajectory you're on. A story that shows strong growth, surmounting challenges, and a high forward trajectory can help get companies excited about you. Finish your story such that the company you're talking to easily makes sense as the next step on your career journey.<ul>
<li>A weak narrative merely lists what's on your resume, e.g., "in 2013 I joined X and did these projects, in 2014 I joined Y and did these projects, and recently I've done Z and B. I want to join this company because it's doing really well."</li>
<li>A stronger narrative gives context on your decisions and motivations, e.g., "In college, I was excited about electronics and human-computer interfaces, so I looked for companies that specialized in consumer hardware. X company was one of the companies that stood out, and when I joined I got to work on the interface for Product P. This taught me [so and so] but after 2 years there, I really wanted to get better at [this other thing], so I reached out to Company Y. From there, I grew into [some role], helped the company do [these things], and now I'm [doing something impressive]. Going forward, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can put my front end architecture skills to good use while learning how to build complex systems at scale. I admire [company name] for being able to build high quality user interfaces while being super fast and reliable. I think this might be a great fit for my expertise and give me opportunities to grow my backend skills."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What specific things you're looking for in your next role. These should apply to more than one company to show that you're not just pandering to the company, but try to be opinionated at the same time.<ul>
<li>A weak answer is too vague, uncertain, or demonstrates that you haven't put much thought to it.<ul>
<li>e.g., "I'm looking for a place where I can advance my career." or "I wanted to get into AI and Machine Learning because it's a really hot industry right now."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A stronger answer shows that you've clearly thought about what you want, have had enough experience to know what you don't want, and implicitly show why the company you're talking to is a good fit.<ul>
<li>e.g., "Over my career, I've found that it's really important for me to have a strong sense of ownership over my work. I enjoy taking an ambiguous customer problem, breaking it down with a PM or designer, and then being able to see the whole project through from start to finish. I like to solve problems and not just execute on tasks, even if that means working through some dealing with a lot of uncertainty at times and wearing many hats."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="what-the-interviewer-is-looking-for">What the interviewer is looking for</h4>
<ul>
<li>For quick intros, interviewers are generally not evaluating your storytelling ability. Instead, they want to know why you might be a good fit for the role and what your motivations are.</li>
<li>For hiring managers and recruiters, your career narrative can be a useful lens to interpret the interview feedback and make a decision on whether or not to move forward.<ul>
<li>For example, if your background is primarily backend engineering and the interviews demonstrate weakness in UI implementation, then your narrative can help interviewers focus more on your strengths over your weaker areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you under-represent yourself at this stage, you may miss an opportunity to move forward in the interview process or get an offer.<ul>
<li>On the flip side, you should avoid changing your narrative too much simply to suit the role or company you're talking to. It's often better to be rejected for a role that really doesn't fit you than to get a role doing something that doesn't actually align with what you want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-that-interviewers-may-ask">Questions that interviewers may ask</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
<li>What are you looking for in your next role?</li>
<li>Why are you interested in [company]?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png"></p>
<h3 id="story-2-two-impressive-projects">Story #2: Two Impressive Projects</h3>
<p>You should be prepared to talk in depth about at least two meaningful projects you've worked on where you played a significant role. Why two? If you use the same example for every question, the interviewer may think you're lacking experience or have a weak track record. Having at least two substantial projects in your pocket will help you balance breadth and depth to respond to a variety of questions.</p>
<p>Keep your initial explanation short (between 3-5 minutes) and offer to go deeper afterwards. This will help keep the conversation focused and avoid wasting time on unimportant details.</p>
<p>A good format to use whenever you're giving an example of something that happened is to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm">SBI framework</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf">STAR framework</a>. For these examples I'll use the SBI model. </p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Situation</strong>: Share context on the project before jumping into what you did.<ul>
<li>Where did the project come from?</li>
<li>Why was it important? How did you or your team prioritize it?</li>
<li>What were the goals of the project?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Behavior</strong>: Describe your specific role on that project. If you played a technical role, describe how the system was designed.<ul>

<li>Are they applying for a role that's realistic with what they've done historically?</li>
<li>What kind of domain expertise do they have?</li>
<li>Have they had enough technical leadership experience for the role? (More relevant for senior/tech lead roles and above.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can the candidate clearly articulate the benefit and impact of their work?<ul>
<li>It's surprising how often some people don't know or think about the result of their work beyond completing the tasks that were assigned to them. Strong candidates think about the entire workflow, from idea conception to evaluating success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do they have a growth mindset?<ul>
<li>Are they able to reflect on both the successes and misses of that project?</li>
<li>Do they take credit for all the things that went well and blame others for all the things that didn't go well? (This would be a red flag.)</li>

<h3 id="story-3-resolving-a-conflict">Story #3: Resolving a conflict</h3>
<p>Delivering successful projects often require working with a lot of stakeholders and collaborators. Demonstrate that you can work well with others, share critical feedback, and resolve situations on your own.</p>
<p>I've been surprised at how often candidates talk about a situation where they ultimately failed to resolve a conflict. It can be hard to think of a good example on the spot, so definitely prepare this ahead of time and consider what you want the interviewer to take away.</p>

<p>In this blog post we will take a look inside the Wyze Outdoor Base Station and see whats going on. Many people were very excited to hop on board the Wyze train when they announced the outdoor camera – however it has mostly been met with bad reviews and buggy, half baked features. </p>

<p>We can see that the board is labeled 9531_HL_CORE_AM7</p>

<p>Qualcomm marketing says:</p>

<p>The Specifications sheet on Qualcomms website is very light on details, but this looks like a common SoC for low end networking and cheapo wireless routers. </p>

<p>It seems like this might be a board built by Nova Electronics that Wyze is putting into a nice package. Looks Familiar right?</p>



<p>The 3 pins on the right side of the board look like they could be SPI – so we tried to solder some pins on and get a terminal open</p>



<p>I guessed the TX / RX pins, and the ground was labeled nicely on the board. For Reference: </p>



<ul><li>Ground to GND (Duh!)</li><li>TX is L1</li><li>RX is L2</li></ul>

<p>I connected with a cheapo CP2102 USB to UART adapter, set the baud rate to 115200 and was off to the races… kinda</p>

<p>Well this is interesting, this little guy is running OpenWRT.  I guessed all of the normal user / password combos I could think of and didn’t get anywhere – If anyone has any ideas on how to get into this shoot me a message / comment!</p>



<p>Lets watch it boot up and see if there is anything interesting going on here: </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Rust is increasingly used as a programming language for smart contracts.
Whereas the first generation blockchains used specialized VMs,
newer blockchains are running general purpose VMs,
especially <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a>.
And of course,
Rust is a modern language that runs just about everywhere,
and is especially good at targetting WASM.
Somewhat serendipitously,
this has made Rust one of the best candidate languages for writing
smart contracts on the new generation of blockchains.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been learning more about the smart contract programming landscape,
and this post is about my first dive into smart contract programming in
Rust on the <a href="https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore">NEAR</a> platform.</p>

<p>NEAR is a sharded, proof-of-stake blockchain that runs WASM.
It not only supports smart contracts written in Rust
(in addition to <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a>),
but is also itself written in Rust.
While one the most prominent Rust blockchain projects,
it is perhaps not yet widely known in the broader blockchain development community.</p>

<p>Based on my experiences here though,
I’m quite enthusiastic about the NEAR developer experience,
and I intend to spend more time hacking on NEAR.</p>

<p>These are my first impressions of NEAR,
as someone with moderate knowledge of blockchains,
but limited previous blockchain programing experience.
I have previously written similarly about my first experiences
with other blockchains: <a href="https://talk.nervos.org/t/experience-report-first-time-building-and-running-ckb/4518/">Nervos</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Aimeedeer/bigannouncement/blob/master/doc/hacklog.md">Ethereum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-at-the-start-of-the-docs">Starting at the start of the docs</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.near.org/">NEAR documentation</a> seems refreshingly thorough,
if a bit confusing to navigate.
There are different docs to follow depending on your role in the network,
whether a validator,
smart contract programmer,
etc.
and I find myself jumping between multiple sections,
without quite understanding how the docs are organized overall,
perhaps because there isn’t a single table of contents that covers the entire site.</p>

<p>Anyway, after browsing the docs to get a general idea of their organization,
I go back to the front page and I click “Basics”.
This seems to be leading me down the path of being a smart contract developer,
not running my own local node,
not building NEAR itself.</p>

<p>For sake of understanding,
I generally want to build the entire stack I’m working on,
but for now I’m going to follow the docs exactly and see where that gets me,
and not build NEAR on my own.</p>

<h2 id="account-creation">Account creation</h2>

<p>Setting up an account is done through a web interface at:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://wallet.testnet.near.org/">https://wallet.testnet.near.org/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I create a testnet account,
<code>floopy.testnet</code>,
and a recovery phrase.</p>

<p>The NEAR explorer page for my account is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/floopy.testnet">https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/floopy.testnet</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of a hash for an ID,
as in most blockchains,
you get an actual string name.
And the system can optionally do account recovery over email or phone.
While this is convenient, it seems suspiciously centralized for a public blockchain,
and I wonder if it is possible to create accounts without any central authority.
I imagine it is, and this website is mostly a convenience, but don’t know yet.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Following <a href="https://docs.near.org/docs/development/near-cli">the docs</a>, I install <code>near-cli</code>, a Node app.</p>

<p>Semes to work fine.</p>

<p>From previous doc reading I know that running a full node typically involves running <a href="https://github.com/near/nearup">nearup</a>.
It appears though that I don’t need that now,
so probably for the purposes of developing on near,
<code>near-cli</code> will just talk to existing public nodes.</p>

<p>At this point I seem to hit the end of the “basics” documentation flow,
without really accomplishing anything,
but I remember <a href="https://docs.near.org/docs/quick-start/new-to-near#how-do-i-get-started">from the beginning of these docs</a> that “choose a starter project”
is step 2.</p>

<p>I back up and choose the <a href="https://examples.near.org/rust-status-message"><code>rust-status-message</code></a> starter project.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-contract">Running a contract</h2>

<p>The examples say to install <code>near-shell</code>,
but that project has been renamed to <code>near-cli</code>.
I see that there are already PRs submitted to fix this,
but they are about a month old.
There are a number of relatively old PRs in NEAR repos that haven’t been reviewed.</p>

<p>I clone the example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/near-examples/rust-status-message
$ cd rust-status-message
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And build per the instructions:</p>



<p>This is an npm build that wraps a cargo build.
I’m curious if there’s any JavaScript involved,
but I suspect they are just using npm as the primary interface
for the sake of familiarity and for consistency with
the build process for AssemblyScript smart contracts.</p>

<p>Looking at <code>package.json</code> it’s true that npm isn’t doing much here,
but it <em>is</em> adding a post-build step that cargo is incapable of:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>  </span><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"build"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"postbuild"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/status_message.wasm ./res/"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is an error in the build:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target may not be installed

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an easy error to understand to somebody familiar with embedded Rust development,
but probably not to other newbies.
The toolchain just doesn’t have the <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> target installed.
I don’t know if I missed the documentation that explained this,
but the user experience here could be better.</p>

<p>I add the wasm target:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
info: downloading component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-unknown-unknown'
info: installing component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-unknown-unknown'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that the build works:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ npm run build

&gt; rust-status-message-builder@1.0.0 build /home/ubuntu/near/rust-status-message
&gt; cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

&gt; cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/status_message.wasm ./res/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I try to deploy to the testnet using a temporary developer account:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ near dev-deploy --wasmFile res/status_message.wasm --helperUrl https://near-contract-helper.onrender.com

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>NEAR wants me to opt in to telemetry.
I’m sympathetic,
but since this command presumably will have access to private keys,
I’m not confident that the developers have been suitably careful
about avoiding collection of private data.
For now I say “n”, until I can review that code.</p>

<p>The command continues:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ near dev-deploy --wasmFile res/status_message.wasm --helperUrl https://near-contract-helper.onrender.com

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>URL query parameters and how laxness creates de facto requirements on the web</h2>

	<p><small>September  7, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the ways that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a> (the code behind <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a>) is unusual is that it strictly validates the query parameters
it receives on URLs, including on HTTP <code>GET</code> requests for ordinary
pages. If a HTTP request has unexpected and unsupported query
parameters, such a <code>GET</code> request will normally fail. When I made
this decision it seemed the cautious and conservative approach, but
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CautionIsAMistakeToday">this caution has turned out to be a mistake on the modern web</a>. In practice, all sorts of sites will
generate versions of your URLs with all sorts of extra query
parameters tacked on, give them to people, and expect them to work.
If your website refuses to play along, (some) people won't get to
see your content. <strong>On today's web, you need to accept (and then
ignore) arbitrary query parameters on your URLs</strong>.</p>

<p>(Today's new query parameter is 's=NN', for various values of NN
like '04' and '09'. I'm not sure what's generating these URLs, but
it may be Slack.)</p>

<p>You might wonder how we got here, and that is a story of lax behavior
(or, if you prefer, being liberal in what you accept). In the
beginning, both Apache (for static web pages) and early web
applications often ignored extra query parameters on URLs, at least
on <code>GET</code> requests. I suspect that other early web servers also
imitated Apache here, but I have less exposure to their behavior
than Apache's. My guess is that this behavior wasn't deliberate,
it was just the simplest way to implement both Apache and early
web applications; you paid attention to what you cared about and
didn't bother to explicitly check that nothing else was supplied.</p>

<p>When people noticed that this behavior was commonplace and widespread,
they began using it. I believe that one of the early uses was for
embedding 'where this link was shared' information for your own web
analytics (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/AnalyticsVsSecurity">cf</a>), either based on your logs
or using JavaScript embedded in the page. In the way of things,
once this was common enough other people began helpfully tagging
the links that were shared through them for you, which is why I
began to see various 'utm_*' query parameters on inbound
requests to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a> even though I never
published such URLs.
Web developers don't leave attractive nuisances alone for long, so
soon enough people were sticking on extra query parameters to your
URLs that were mostly for them and not so much for you. Facebook
may have been one of the early pioneers here with their 'fbclid'
parameter, but other websites have hopped on this particular train
since then (as I saw recently with these 's=NN' parameters).</p>

<p>At this point, the practice of other websites and services adding
random query parameters to your URLs that pass through them is so
wide spread and common that accepting random query parameters is
pretty much a practical requirement for any web content serving
software that wants to see wide use and not be irritating to the
people operating it. If, like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a>, you stick to your guns and
refuse to accept some or all of them, you will drop some amount of
your incoming requests from real people, disappointing would be
readers.</p>

<p>This practical requirement for URL handling is not documented in
any specification, and it's probably not in most 'best practices'
documentation. People writing new web serving systems that are
tempted to be strict and safe and cautious get to learn about it
the hard way.</p>

<p>In general, any laxness in actual implementations of a system can
create a similar spiral of de facto requirements. Something that
is permitted and is useful to people will be used, and then supporting
that becomes a requirement. This is especially the case in a
distributed system like the web, where any attempt to tighten the
rules would only be initially supported by a minority of websites.
These websites would be 'outvoted' by the vast majority of websites
that allow the lax behavior and support it, because that's what
happens when the vast majority work and the minority don't.</p>

September 7, 2020 | https://www.dollartrak.com/negotiate-salary-to-achieve-your-financial-goals/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dollartrak.com/negotiate-salary-to-achieve-your-financial-goals/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Many people concentrate on saving and investing as a way to achieve their financial goals.  Both of these are easier to grow with a higher income.  No matter what your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a> are, negotiating a higher salary will make them easier to achieve.</p>



<p>The time you spend researching your fair market value, preparing requests for raises, and making requests for adjustments might very well be the most valuable use of your time.</p>



<p>Considering the importance of salary you would think that people would constantly be on top of their market value ensuring they are compensated fairly.  In my experience this is often not the case.</p>



<h2>Many People are Underpaid and Don’t Even Know it</h2>



<p>Like most people I knew, I never talked about my salary with my friends or co-workers.  It’s taboo for many Americans.  This lack of transparency makes it easy to be underpaid while being unaware of it.  This benefits your employer, but not you!</p>



<p>Once I took on a senior leadership position I begun to understand the severity of differences in how people are compensated for similar positions.  In some cases employees with the same job title were compensated double what others were.</p>



<p>I am sure that most people are aware these inequities exist and might blame them on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-finds-salary-history-bans-boost-pay-for-african-americans-women-11592472602?mod=e2fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discrimination</a>, differences in quality of work, education or level of education.  In my experience a lack of salary negotiation and keeping their salary up to date is the main driver. </p>



<p>Negotiating your salary can be uncomfortable, and asking for raises can be even more so.  This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it though!  Many will shy away from it and those that do not will end up making much more money over time to do the same job.</p>



<h2>Increases in Salary Compound Over Your Career</h2>



<p>As people get further along in their careers these differences can grow to nearly overwhelming numbers.  Employees can literally make over double what others make for the same job.  This is because of the compounding nature of raises on your salary over the course of your career.</p>



<p>Raises are generally given on a percentage basis of your current salary.  What this means is every single time you get a raise you are also getting a raise on all of your previous raises.  This adds up the same way compound interest adds up.  Over time the numbers can get large and with a 40 year long career for many there can be a lot of time for this to happen.</p>



<h2>Examples of Compounding Salary</h2>



<p>Lets look at a few simple scenarios over a 20 year job with a company.  The first scenario shows the affect of negotiating a higher starting salary and the second one shows the affect of negotiating occasional large raises.</p>



<h3>Affect of Negotiating a Higher Starting Salary</h3>



<p>Jack and Jill both were offered the same job, but Jill negotiated a very modest 10% higher salary than Jack.  They both did well and received 3% raises over the course of 20 years working for the company.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$57,963</td><td>$67,195</td><td>$77,898</td><td>$90,305</td><td>$1.43M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>The $5,000 starting difference turns into a little over $9,000 a year difference over 20 years.  This resulted in Jill making an extra $140,000 over the course of her job with this company.</p>



<h3>Affects of Negotiating Larger Raises</h3>



<p>Here we will modify the above table to show Jill negotiating a 10% raise for herself every 5 years while Jack happily accepts the standard 3%.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$61,903</td><td>$76,640</td><td>$94,884</td><td>$117,473</td><td>$1.63M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years, Jill get’s 10% every 5 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>After 20 years with a salary of $81,275 jack would need a whopping 45% raise just to catch up to Jill and still would be behind by $340,000 in lifetime earnings!</p>



<h2>How do I Keep My Salary Up to Date</h2>



<h3>Know Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>This always starts with knowing what your fair market value is.  There are several websites that can help here.  I like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.glassdoor.com/" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.salary.com/" target="_blank">Salary.com</a>.  Do a little research and come up with a range that you feel is reasonable.  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="548" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" alt="salary chart" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?w=731&amp;ssl=1 731w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=300%2C257&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Taken from salary.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>You should be honest with yourself about your skills and experience, but I recommend starting at the high end of the range and working down from there.  If someone else can make $100,000 a year doing your job, why not you?</p>



<h3>Getting Your Salary Right to Start</h3>



<p>In my experience the majority of people will accept the first salary offer given.  This is generally a mistake.  Why would a hiring manager make you his absolute top dollar offer to start?  He is generally wise to leave a little room for negotiation for the candidates that do counteroffer.  Some candidates will want to counteroffer no matter what you offer them first!</p>



<p>Once you accept a lower salary it is VERY difficult to get it corrected.  You may have some success here at smaller companies but with larger companies and their bureaucracy don’t get your hopes up.  In my experience the best way to fix this is to find a new job.  You can avoid it by knowing your market value and negotiating a proper base to start.</p>



<h3>Constantly Update Skills</h3>



<p>The job market is always changing.  You need to keep up with it and try to stay out in front of it to maximize your earning potential.  Whatever field you are in set annual goals to achieve certifications, complete continuing education, learn a new tool or attend a conference.  </p>



<p>While one of these things by itself may not change your career, the culmination of annual self improvement over 5 to 10 years can make a massive difference in your marketability.  Senior level employees with relevant certifications and experience can be worth many times what an entry level employee is.</p>



<h3>Take Advantage of Your Time at Work</h3>



<p>You are going to be there for 8 hours a day so you might as well make the most of it.  Always seek out new projects that allow you to learn and develop your skills.  Ask about company paid training, certification or tuition.  Look for ways to add value above and beyond normal for your task.</p>



<p>Most employers will provide you with the tools, money or time to improve your skills because it directly benefits them.  If they won’t help you out here, you may want to re-consider if working there is good for your long term success.</p>



<h3>Write Down Accomplishments as They Happen</h3>



<p>Many companies do a once per year salary adjustment.  Isn’t it basically impossible to remember what all you did when walking into this conversation?</p>

<p>The best way to remember it all is to write it down as it happens.  Keep a running log of your accomplishments. Write them all down and come into the annual review process armed with the information you need.</p>



<h3>Frequently Update Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>Your fair market value is likely always changing.  Make sure to check the websites and understand if you are compensated fairly on a regular basis.  Always do this before an annual review.  </p>



<p>If the market has shifted for your skill set, or a new skill you learned is valuable, make sure your employer knows!  This is the time to ask for a larger than standard raise.  That new certification you acquired could be a great reason to go after a 5 or 10% raise this year.</p>



<h2>Asking for an Adjustment When You are Underpaid</h2>



<p>If you want to stick it out with your company, but found that you were underpaid you will need to ask for an adjustment to market value.  I find that the request should have the following basic supporting documentation:</p>



<ol><li>Report’s on salary range for your job from multiple sources.  If you are underpaid, show them multiple sources that validate this.  The more you can find the better.</li><li>Detail any recent skills you have developed or certifications that you have obtained. </li><li>List of recent accomplishments at work that show you have gone above and beyond.  You have been keeping the list like I recommend above right?</li></ol>



<p>I have asked for larger raises(&gt;10%) multiple times in my career and always gotten what I wanted by using the above method.  I have also been asked for raises by quite a few employees over the years.  Those with accompanying documentation like above were taken much more seriously.</p>



<h2>Leave If Your Employer Doesn’t Value You Correctly</h2>



<p>Some employers will never pay you fair market value.  This could be because they don’t value you fairly or because they don’t need the skills you have.  They may also just not have the money in the budget for someone of your skill level.  </p>



<p>Don’t let their decisions hold you back.  If they won’t pay you fairly then be prepared to get up and leave.  If you have been updating your skills regularly as I mentioned above you may find that moving to a better position is surprisingly easy.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this has shed a little light onto the importance of salary negotiations when being hired and frequently during the course of your career.  If you ignore these conversations because they can be uncomfortable you will pay dearly for it over the long term.  </p>



<p>Ultimately, your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/06/09/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> can be dramatically reduced and result in you having to work for many extra years in order to meet your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a>.  You should take charge of this part of your career before you look back and wish you had.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>A while ago, I released <a href="https://orib.dev/git9.html">git9</a>, a git client for
Plan 9. However, it always felt like it was missing something: A git server.
over a few weekends of work, I sat down and put one together. This Labor
Day weekend, I took the opportunity to labor on it, and got something working.</p>

<h3>usage</h3>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> is a git server designed to fit into the Plan
9 ecosystem, allowing hosting of, and interacting with, code on a Plan 9
server, while still allowing legacy clients running on Unix to get a copy
of the code.</p>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> only speaks the <code>git://</code> protocol.
But because it runs behind
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/listen">aux/listen</a>
and 
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/tlssrv"><code>tlssrv</code></a>, we
effectively get two additional protocols for free: <code>gits://</code>, or
TLS-encrypted <code>git://</code>, and <code>hjgit://</code>, which is
<code>git://</code> but with Plan 9 authentication to support user login
over TLS. Unfortunately, only the unencrypted <code>git://</code> protocol
is supported out of the box by upstream git. There may be ways to solve
this, using <a href="https://rovaughn.github.io/2015-2-9.html">custom
transports</a>, and a unix port of tlsclient</p>

<p>To start a <code>git://</code> server, just run it under aux/listen1.
To enable encryption and user authentication, run it under
<code>tlssrv -a</code>. This doesn't need a certificate, because
the Plan 9 authentication generates the secret used for TLS. And,
finally, if you just want encryption, you can use <code>tlsclient</code>
with a certificate.</p>

<pre># git:// server, serving every repository under the current directory
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' git/serve -r `{pwd}

# gits:// server, doing the same: But with encryption.
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -c /path/to/cert.pem git/serve -r `{pwd}

# hjgit:// server doing the same: Requires account on server to connect
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -a git/serve -r `{pwd}
</pre>

<p>If you want to allow people to write, you can just add the
<code>-w</code> flag to git/serve. While you can do this on
any of the protocols, keep in mind that only <code>hjgit://</code>
authenticates the users. Push to the world, but don't let the
world push to you!</p>



<p>All the protocols git uses are closely related. The <code>ssh://</code>
protocol is just the <code>git://</code> protocol, with the command selected
sightly differently. The smart <code>http://</code> protocols are the same
as the <code>git://</code> protocol, with a different handshake, and split
over multiple post requests.</p>

<p>Git9 implements the git protocol in under 500 lines of C. The
full code is available on github, in
<a href="https://github.com/oridb/git9/blob/24abe6c00b6f65e7241763399fc72c043b7d9bbf/serve.c">serve.c</a>.
</p>

<p>The protocol look something like this for pushing:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 0086:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 009d:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 refs/heads/master\n"
&lt;=w= 0076:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\0report-status\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= <pack-data>
=r=&gt; 000e:	unpack ok
=r=&gt; 0019:	ok refs/heads/master
</pack-data></pre>

<p>And this for pulling:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-upload-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
<pack-data>
</pack-data></pre>

<p>The git protocol consists of pkt-lines, which are strings with a
hex-formatted length prefix.  The length prefix includes itself.  So,
the string <code>"hi"</code> would be formatted as
<code>0006hi</code>. A zero lenth packet where the length prefix
is not included is special. This is called a 'flush packet', and
is used to terminate a phase of negotiation.</p>

<p> All negotiation is with these packet lines, at
which git flips over to pure binary mode to transfer a pack file
over.</p>

<p>In the <code>git://</code> protocol, the client always starts off
by saying which action it wants to do: Either it wants the server to
fetch a pack from the client, or it wants the server to upload a pack
to the client.  That's this line:</p><pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
</pre>

<p>The upload side of this protocol is simpler on the server side so
we'll go through it first.</p>

<h3>pushing</h3>

<p>In the upload protocol, the server begins by sending a list of
references that the client may update. In <code>git/serve</code>
we grab all the refs in the repository, and filter down to just
the ones beginning with <code>heads/</code>.</p>

<pre>	if((nrefs = listrefs(&amp;refs, &amp;names)) == -1)
		sysfatal("listrefs: %r");
	for(i = 0; i &lt; nrefs; i++){
		if(strncmp(names[i], "heads/", strlen("heads/")) != 0)
			continue;
		if(fmtpkt(c, "%H refs/%s\n", refs[i], names[i]) == -1)
			goto error;
	}
	if(flushpkt(c) == -1)
		goto error;
</pre>

<p>With the first phase of the protocol, the client then
sends the list of references it wants to update. This
takes the form of:</p>

<pre>	OLDHASH NEWHASH heads/refs/updateme\n"
</pre>

<p>Because the client knows what the reference versions are on
the server, it can compute what commits are between the version
on the server and the version that it has. If the new hash
is the zero hash, this signals to the server that the reference
should be deleted. This list of updates is terminated with a
flush packet. The code in git9 that handles this is below:

</p><pre>	while(1){
		/* Did we get a packet? */
		if((n = readpkt(c, pkt, sizeof(pkt))) == -1)
			goto error;
		/* Was it a flush packet? */
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		/* Split it up into the 3 parts: old, new, reference */
		if(getfields(pkt, sp, nelem(sp), 1, " \t\n\r") != 3){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR  protocol garble %s\n", pkt);
			goto error;
		}
		/* verify that these are valid hashes */
		if(hparse(&amp;old, sp[0]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad old hash %s\n", sp[0]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(hparse(&amp;new, sp[1]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad new hash %s\n", sp[1]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and valid refs */
		if(!validref(sp[2])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR invalid ref %s\n", sp[2]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and then remember them for when we do the update */
		*cur = erealloc(*cur, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*upd = erealloc(*upd, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*ref = erealloc(*ref, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		(*cur)[*nupd] = old;
		(*upd)[*nupd] = new;
		(*ref)[*nupd] = estrdup(sp[2]);
		*nupd += 1;
	}
</pre>

<p>Next, the client uploads the pack. This is a blob containing
the commit data. It goes into <code>.git/objects/packs/recv-$pid.pack</code>,
at least until we can index it and rename it.</p>

<pre>	while(1){
		n = read(c-&gt;rfd, buf, sizeof(buf));
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		if(n == -1 || write(pfd, buf, n) != n)
			return -1;
		packsz += n;
	}
	if(checkhash(pfd, packsz, &amp;h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "hash mismatch\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(indexpack(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "indexing failed\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(rename(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "rename failed: %r\n");
		goto error2;
	}
</pre>

<p>Finally, we update the references. Note that we haven't
locked the repository yet. This is because none of the data
we have here can conflict: All objects are addressed by hash,
so a race would simply leave us with a duplicate hash in the
packfile. Eventually, a <code>git/repack</code> will clean
that up.</p>

<p>However, updating the references can conflict. So,
for updating the references, we acquire a lock file.
We then read all the references, make sure that they
match the old reference, and then write in the new
reference.</p>

<pre>	for(i = 0; i &lt; nupd; i++){
		if(resolveref(&amp;h, ref[i]) == 0 &amp;&amp; !hasheq(&amp;h, &amp;cur[i])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR old ref changed: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((o = readobject(upd[i])) == nil){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR update to nonexistent hash %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(o-&gt;type != GCommit){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR not commit: %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		unref(o);
		if(snprint(refpath, sizeof(refpath), ".git/%s", ref[i]) == sizeof(refpath)){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR ref path too long: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((fd = create(refpath, OWRITE, 0644)) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR open ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		if(fprint(fd, "%H", upd[i]) == -1){
			close(fd);
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR upate ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		close(fd);
	}
</pre>

<p>And that's pushing.

</p><h3>pulling</h3>

<p>Pulling takes more work on the server side, because the
server needs to compute a reasonable packfile to send to
the client. The protocol itself is still fairly simple.</p>

<p>It begins the same way as pushing, by sending all the
branches that a client may want to obtain from the git
repository.</p>

<pre>=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
</pre>

<p>The client then starts telling us what commits they want,
and what commits they have. This lets us find a graph difference
between the server and client graph, and generate a pack file
that contains few, if any, extraneous commits. </p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
</pre>

<p>Computing the commits that go into a pack is not always trivial.
The comits that the client may be on may have "bubbles" in the graph,
so simply walking back from the start of the graph to the commits
that the client has may end up walking around the commit, leading
to nearly the whole history of the repository being sent, instead
of just one or two commits.</p>

<p>Consider a repo where the server is ahead of the client, and
now the client is trying to pull the changes. The client has commits
<code>c</code>, and we're trying to compute a pack with only the
commits <code>o</code>.</p>


<pre>                o---o
               /     \
    --c---c---c---c---o---o &lt;-- server
                  ^
                client
</pre>

<p>The client does a git/pull, and sends that it has the
commit marked <code>[c]</code>. Since the server has
every commit the client does, and more, it can look at
all ancestors of the client commit. If we're smart, we
would, but a naive …</p></div>

September 7, 2020 | https://www.drb.ie/essays/the-seamus-heaney-experience | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.drb.ie/essays/the-seamus-heaney-experience">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>On Seamus Heaney</em>, by RF Foster, Princeton University Press (Writers on Writers series), 228 pp, £14.99, ISBN: 978-0691174372</p> <p>Karl Miller always disclaimed credit for being the first person – first in the UK anyway – to spot the merit in Seamus Heaney’s early work. Others had got there before him, he said. But, in 1964, and in defiance of opposition from colleagues at the <em>New Statesman</em>, where he was literary editor, Miller published three Heaney poems, including “Death of a Naturalist” and “Digging”. The poems were subsequently read and admired by Charles Monteith of Faber (coincidentally, a fellow Ulsterman), who wrote to Heaney inviting him to submit a manuscript. <em>Death of a Naturalist</em> duly appeared, and hindsight shows its publication to be a momentous event in literary history. From this point on, you might say, Heaney never looked back.</p> <p>But of course looking back was precisely what had brought him into the limelight, and looking back remained central to his literary impetus. However, as time went on, the process was negotiated with increasing virtuosity, density, and transformative power. “Remember everything and keep your head.” This line, attributed to the ghost of William Carleton in Section Two of the “Station Island” sequence, is advice the poet always abided by, with his new-minted “themes of locality and memory” and his rural minutiae, down to the ox-eye daisies and dandelions in the middle of the road to school, or the milk poured for cats in a rank puddle-place in a stone kitchen floor. The “scraggy farm and moss” aspect of Heaney’s Co Derry childhood is recreated with an intensity and assurance as far removed as possible from the picturesque or facile associations of country – and in particular, Northern Irish country – verse. If “bogs, bulls and buckets” persist in the Heaney lexicon (as one faintly sarcastic reviewer of <em>Wintering Out</em> had it), they are tied up with the observer’s complex motivations and visionary brevity of style.</p> <p>Indeed there was nothing about Seamus Heaney’s early life, or his wonderfully throughother boyhood environment, to indicate the route his astonishing career would follow. “By the 1990s,” writes RF Foster in his astute new study, Heaney’s “work and reputation were positioned at the centre of the English canon, while operating emphatically from a base in Ireland (North and South).” How Heaney arrived at this position is a story of steady progress, of an unparalleled gift for illumination and evocation, of a way of being orthodox and utterly independent at the same time. (“At once complete insider and odd man out” in Paul Muldoon’s words.) The independence in is the output, the orthodoxy in the list of honours, awards and academic posts which piled up over the years and culminated in the Nobel laureateship in 1995. It should be said that nothing about his immense celebrity went to the poet’s head: he remained calm and down-to-earth in the midst of all the brouhaha and kept a steadfast demeanour – though at what cost to his psychological wellbeing one can only surmise.</p> <p>It was not, of course, a matter of uninterrupted acclaim. There were stumbling blocks as well as stepping stones along the way, and some of these had a distinctly local character. It was felt in some Northern Irish circles – and especially while his career was taking off – that Heaney needed constant reminding not to get above himself. If he’d been singled out – well, it was a lucky chance: others existed who were equally deserving of fame. There were subtle, and not-so-subtle, put-downs. Even his future friend and admirer Brian Friel, Foster notes, took a somewhat acerbic line about Heaney’s “easy manipulation [at the time] of a new audience in England”. But Foster’s most searing criticism is directed at the poet and founder of <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em> James Simmons, whom he accuses of harbouring a “festering jealousy” and of being “lazily obtuse” in his assessments of the Heaney <em>oeuvre</em>. Foster really does not like Simmons, and nor is the <em>HU</em>’s brand of bare-faced irreverence greatly to his taste.</p> <p>He has a point – though perhaps he misses Simmons’s occasional elan and fluency in his own poetry – and he is right to draw attention to the various misreadings, including Simmons’s, of Heaney’s pivotal collection <em>North</em> (his fourth). Hailed internationally as “a vital achievement” and enshrining its author as “the best Irish poet since W.B. Yeats” (Robert Lowell’s phrase), the book encountered a certain disparagement, not to say outright hostility, in Heaney’s home territory. Some of this had a political dimension. On the strength of one or two poems (in particular the desolating and striking “Punishment”), some Irish critics chose to attribute to him an excessive solidarity with the Catholic North and republican grievances (just to even things out, he was later taken to task for eschewing a supportive role in relation to republicanism). In fact, of course, Heaney is far from condoning violence or dissociating himself from any of his inherited allegiances. He did, as a poet, want to stand apart from both sides, he said, while acknowledging the inescapable, and inspirational, circumstances of his early life and times. Terence Brown, reviewing <em>Stepping Stones</em> in 2008 (the remarkable series of questions posed by Dennis O’Driscoll and answered comprehensively by Heaney), sums up the ways in which poetry – any poetry ‑ is a product of “life situations … cultural contexts … intellectual preoccupations and involvement with public issues”. </p> <p>Cultural contexts and public issues. These, during Heaney’s lifetime, were emphatically bound up with the thirty-year conflict known as the Troubles; and part of the poet’s driving force involved a quest – as he famously put it – “for images and symbols adequate to our predicament” (echoing Yeats’s “befitting emblems of adversity”). Not obvious images and symbols, indeed, but those which would carry the utmost resonance and work their effect at different levels. Some he found in an enlarged idea of “Northernness”, taking in iron-age excavations and a pared-down Viking connection. When he was questioned by O’Driscoll, many years later, Heaney stood by the poems in <em>North</em>, which he judged to be appropriately “odd and hard and contrary”.</p> <p>It wasn’t only in Irish literary circles that the odd swipe was directed at Heaney and his poetry. Among prominent anti-Heaneyites Foster names Ian Hamilton of <em>The New Review</em>, for example, along with A Alvarez, who scrutinised <em>Field Work</em> for “verbal affectations” (he found a few), and blamed the poet for cultivating an overdone “charm and rhetoric”. And he didn’t stop there, going on to mock Heaney’s “fine way with the language” – a phrase suggesting a showiness and slickness of which the poet was incapable. Actually, the Alvarez appraisal (in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>), and others in the same mode, suggest nothing more than a wilful declaration of independence from the laudatory chorus. Some critics were exasperated by what they considered the undue elevation of Heaney – the “Heaney Phenomenon”, as they dubbed it, investing the phrase with a sardonic intonation.</p> <p>This is what Foster is referring to when he mentions “the half-suppressed current of begrudging comment”. But the expression of misgivings died away as Heaney’s place in the canon of contemporary literature became unassailable. Those who had spotted something strong and original and compelling in his work from the start – who had simply noticed “how good Heaney’s poems were” (Karl Miller) – could congratulate themselves on their discernment. For Michael Longley – for example – reviewing <em>Death of a Naturalist</em> in 1966, Heaney’s childhood landscapes had already acquired “the validity of myth”, while the collection as a whole announced the inauguration of “a true poet of considerable importance”. Heaney was not the only one, of course: there was Longley himself, and Derek Mahon; and, in the eyes of the poetry-reading public, the three newcomers on the scene were soon to coalesce into a poetic triumvirate, before its separate components went their separate, and superlative, ways. Things, in the cultural sphere, were astir in mid-1960s Belfast, after the doldrums of the previous decade; and the Heaney household, up until 1972, was a particular centre of ebullience and expansiveness.</p> <p><em>On Seamus Heaney</em> treats the poet’s life and work with thoroughness and dispassion. The story of what happened to Heaney is deftly retold by RF Foster, and retold in a way that makes sense of the poet’s prodigious journey, from Bellaghy to Belfast to Berkeley, and onwards and upwards thereafter to a kind of poetic apotheosis. The year Heaney spent (with his family) as a visiting professor at Berkeley in California was crucial to his development in all sorts of ways – “Something changed, all right,” he told Dennis O’Driscoll – and it’s likely that the experience deepened his dissatisfaction with goings-on in Belfast, once he had returned to the city. At any rate, within a year or so, Heaney had taken himself, with his wife and children, out of the North and into a cottage in Co Wicklow. The cottage at Glanmore was rented from the Canadian academic and Synge scholar Anne Saddlemyer, and – although the Heaneys bought it later – it represented a staging post on the way to Dublin, eventual international renown, and endless demands on the poet’s time and stamina.</p> <p>There were many distractions – but through it all, the poetry continued to work its spellbinding effect. It is wonderfully idiosyncratic in its rhythms and allusions and cross-currents. We have the celebrated sequences, the Bog Poems, the Glanmore Sonnets, the Station Island encounters with significant revenants. And the farm at Mossbawn in Co Derry, the childhood abundant in grace and exhilaration and plentiful food for thought, the sectarian dimension and neighbourly accommodations worked out expediently, the ultimate wreckage of the North, with – for the poet – …</p></div></div>

              <article>
                  

<p>Each year, I try to set a few personal goals that stretch me in some way.</p>

<p>In 2017, for example, I <a href="https://forrestbrazeal.com/2017/12/03/how-to-read-100-books-in-a-year-and-still-have-a-life/">read one hundred books</a>, which turned out to be more a test of endurance than skill.</p>

<p>This year, I decided to see if I could write a fictional short story and get it published somewhere. Though I do a fair amount of technical writing in the course of my work, I’d never seriously attempted to write and sell a short story before, or even taken a creative writing class.</p>

<p>This meant I had no knowledge of the market, no connections, and generally no idea what I was doing.</p>

<p>So, a challenge!</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>I decided to focus on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction">speculative fiction genre</a>, partly because it seemed more accessible and mostly because unlike literary journals, the best speculative fiction magazines still pay their authors.</p>

<p>My goals, in descending order of likelihood, were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get something published somewhere, even if unpaid</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published and get paid something for it, even a token amount</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published at <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#short">Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) professional rates</a> (currently 6 cents a word)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least 1000 words published at SFWA-qualifying markets (the standard for <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#associate">SFWA associate member status</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least three stories published, totaling more than 10,000 words, at SFWA-qualifying professional markets (<a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#active">SFWA Active Member status</a>, my self-imposed standard for a legit “professional” science fiction writer)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="results-through-nov-8">Results (through Nov. 8)</h2>

<p>After many form rejections on several terrible stories, I sold my <a href="https://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/biotech/forrest-brazeal/memory-foam">first story</a> on March 23rd, 2018, to Daily Science Fiction (an SWFA pro market). At 1010 words, this sale actually crossed the first four goals off my list at once.</p>

<p>However, I continued to write and improve over the spring and summer of 2018, selling several more stories along the way, eventually totaling more than 16,000 words of fiction. Some publications have long wait times, but by the time “Empathy Bee” <a href="http://www.diabolicalplots.com/the-diabolical-plots-year-five-fiction-lineup/">is published</a> in March 2019, I should have the wordcount needed for active SFWA membership status, my most insane stretch goal.</p>

<h3 id="by-the-numbers">By the numbers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Stories Written: 22</p></li>

<li><p>Total Wordcount: ~60,000, the length of a medium-sized novel</p></li>

<li><p>Total Submissions: 70</p></li>

<li><p>Stories Sold: 8</p></li>

<li><p>SFWA-qualifying professional sales: 6</p></li>

<li><p>Rejections: 50 (15 personal)</p></li>

<li><p>Withdrawals: 2</p></li>

<li><p>Still Pending: 10</p></li>

<li><p>Other Results: <a href="https://www.writersofthefuture.com/writers-of-the-future-3rd-quarter-standings-for-year-35/">Honorable Mention, Writers of the Future</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>

<h3 id="have-no-ego">Have no ego</h3>

<p>It turns out writing short stories that sell is really, really hard. It’s hard to think of good ideas, it’s hard to write them down in a form that anyone would want to read, and it’s even harder when those readers are magazine editors who get literally hundreds of unsolicited submissions every month. Don’t attempt it if you have an easily bruised sense of self-worth, or you will be depressed a lot.</p>

<p>I’m grateful to have sold some stories this year, but my identity is not tied up in “being a writer”. It can’t be, because I have to…</p>

<h3 id="embrace-failure">Embrace failure</h3>

<p>I learned to view rejections as a badge of honor, which is a helpful mental trick to keep from going insane after a few dozen forms. As I told Jason Bougger in an <a href="http://www.themeofabsence.com/2018/11/author-interview-forrest-brazeal/">author interview</a> over at Theme of Absence, rejections are like the good soreness you feel after working out – it means you’re growing.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-feedback-loop-short">Keep your feedback loop short</h3>

<p>Early on, when I was getting form rejections from big magazines with no accompanying feedback, I got really frustrated because I knew my work was obviously not up to par – I just didn’t know why. A submission to a smaller publication, Abyss and Apex (who I later ended up selling a different story to!) brought back a personalized rejection with a helpful piece of advice: try signing up for the <a href="https://sff.onlinewritingworkshop.com/">Online Writing Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>At the time I had never heard of writers’ workshops and didn’t really understand why they would be helpful. But I paid a few dollars and signed up. The other writers there provided generous feedback on how to improve my work, and I learned just as much from critiquing their pieces. The OWW membership more than paid for itself when several readers pointed out an obvious plot hole in my story “Empathy Bee”, which subsequently sold in revised form to Diabolical Plots.</p>

<p>Later, once I had professional credits, I was able to join the wonderful <a href="http://www.codexwriters.com/">Codex</a> writers’ community, which has hugely expanded my horizons and understanding of the industry. The more I write, the less I trust myself to be a good judge of my work’s quality, and the more I seek out and appreciate feedback from others.</p>

<h3 id="write-smart-not-just-hard">Write smart, not just hard</h3>

<p>Some writers recommend keeping insane writing regimens, cranking out thousands of words a day, saying it’s the only way to improve. And I wrote a fair amount this year. But stepping back and getting feedback on my work was just as important.</p>

<p>I had a music teacher who used to ask: “Did you practice ten hours, or just the same hour ten times?” When I took time to evaluate my work and deliberately build on it, I improved faster than just by vomiting words indiscriminately onto the page.</p>

<h3 id="keep-reading-good-prose">Keep reading good prose</h3>

<p>No, I didn’t read a hundred books again this year. But I did try to keep my ear filled with good prose. For example, this summer I got on a southern realist kick: Flannery O’Connor, Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers. Studying how those writers crafted characters and situations helped me nail down a couple of southern-set stories that ended up selling. My science fiction writing improved more from reading good writers, period, than from reading science fiction.</p>

<h3 id="just-because-you-wrote-something-good-enough-to-get-published-somewhere-that-doesn-t-mean-the-next-thing-you-write-won-t-be-terrible">Just because you wrote something good enough to get published somewhere, that doesn’t mean the next thing you write won’t be terrible</h3>

<p>This sounds stupid in hindsight, but for a long time I had it in my head that once I sold a story, I’d have figured out what it took to get published, and I wouldn’t have any trouble after that. Instead, I still get tons of rejections, and often my writing seems just as lifeless and terrible to me as it did before I sold my first story.</p>

<p>The good news is that with practice, the overall trend appears to be upward. At least, when I look back at my work from the beginning of the year, I can’t believe how bad it is. So I must be improving, right?</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Like many people who start out in the short fiction game, I would love to publish a novel. So I think that might be a 2019 goal. But I’m sure I’ll continue to write short stories, too. There’s real satisfaction in creating something that you can hold in your head all at once, knowing how it will turn out and why it’s effective.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In my line of work, we talk a lot about security warning design and
effectiveness. Usually, the task of a warning is to prevent a user from doing
something dangerous, such as accepting an invalid certificate or installing
malware. There’s another class of warnings which tell users that something bad
has <em>already</em> happened, with the aim of helping them recover. I’ll call this
category <strong>after-the-fact warnings</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t know much about after-the-fact warnings, such as best practices for how
to design them or how effective they can be. In fact I know so little that I had
to make up a name for this category of warnings, when there probably already
exists a fancy academic name. So I
<a href="https://twitter.com/estark37/status/1301545990848094208">asked</a> for some
research pointers on Twitter and collected an interesting reading list. I’ll
summarize some of my observations here. Note that this isn’t a comprehensive
survey – just some thoughts from the papers that caught my eye the most.</p>



<p>To set the stage, here are some real world examples of after-the-fact warnings.
Again, this isn’t comprehensive, just some examples that I can think of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Antivirus notifications telling people that they have malware on their device</li>
  <li>Password breach notifications, either from a first-party (LinkedIn notifying
users that their LinkedIn password has been leaked) or third-party service
provider (<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned</a>,
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/12/better-password-protections-in-chrome.html">a web browser</a>)</li>
  <li>Chrome has a feature
(“<a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/new-security-protections-tailored-you/">predictive phishing protection</a>”)
that notices when you type a saved password on a suspected phishing site and
warns you that you may have been phished and should change your password. This
is similar to a password breach notification, but has some different
considerations because the suspected attack is phishing rather than credential
stuffing.</li>
  <li>Other (non-password) data breach notifications, for example an email from
Equifax telling people that their personal data has been leaked</li>
  <li>Some browsers have persistent UI telling the user that they’ve bypassed a
security warning in the past. For example, after a person clicks through a
certificate, phishing, or malware warning in Chrome, the address bar shows a
red “Not Secure” chip to let them know that they’re in an unsafe state. It
might be a bit of a stretch to call this an after-the-fact warning, as it’s
not clear what action the warning is asking the user to take.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/after_cert_error.png" alt="Chrome UI after bypassing a certificate error">
  <figcaption><i>Google
Chrome UI after bypassing a certificate error. The page loads normally but the
address bar shows a red “Not Secure” chip to emphasize that the user is in an
unsafe state.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, there are some interesting hypothetical examples of after-the-fact
warnings, which is what originally got me interested in this area.
<a href="https://emilymstark.com/2020/07/20/certificate-transparency-a-birds-eye-view.html">Certificate Transparency</a>
introduces an asynchronous certificate verification step. The browser might
accept a certificate as valid, but then find out that it was actually not valid,
days or weeks later. It’s generally been considered beyond the pale for the
browser to warn the user at this point. How might the browser communicate that a
website the user visited in the past was potentially compromised? What is the
user supposed to do about it? I think the answer to these questions is probably
that the browser shouldn’t try to communicate this message, because it’s too
hard to understand and there’s nothing the user can be expected to do about it.
But I’m not totally sure that’s the right answer, and that’s what got me
interested in how successful after-the-fact warnings can be.</p>



<p>I read 5 papers on this topic:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.mobsec.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/mobsec/veroeffentlichungen/2018/09/10/ccsf266-finalv1.pdf">“What was that site doing with my Facebook password?” Designing Password-Reuse Notifications</a> <em>Golla et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper describes two surveys about notifications that companies send
when they discover a user’s password in a password dump from another
service. The first survey studies representative examples of real-world
notifications, and the second survey uses a model notification designed
using the lessons from the first survey. Comprehension was pretty poor
across the board. Most users reported that they would change their
password upon receiving the model notification, but very few said they
would change their password to something unrelated. (And of course,
surveys don’t always give us the best information about what someone would
do in real life.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2020/ConPro/papers/bhagavatula-conpro20.pdf">(How) Do People Change Their Passwords After a Breach?</a> <em>Bhagavatula et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper makes use of the Security Behavior Observatory, which is a
large group of participants who have agreed to run research software on
their machines to collect information about their security behaviors. This
allowed the researchers to observe how many users changed their password
when their accounts were actually breached in real life. The answer is
that not so many participants did change their passwords (33%), and of
those, many participants didn’t do so for quite a long time after the
breach.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8835359">“Should I Worry?” A Cross-Cultural Examination of Account Security Incident Response</a> <em>Redmiles</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper describes a set of interviews with Facebook users from 5
countries. The interviewers asked participants about how they responded to
notifications from Facebook that their account had a suspicious login.
These notifications tell the user that their account may have been
compromised and then ask them to complete a secondary authentication task,
such as identifying photos of their friends. One finding that particularly
caught my eye was that, when asked what alerted them to the suspicious
login, participants sometimes identified the secondary authentication task
rather than the initial notification. The paper hypothesizes that this may
be due to warning fatigue blinding users to the initial notification.
(Warning fatigue is when users see many warnings and get habituated to
them, ceasing to take action on them.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://lersse-dl.ece.ubc.ca/record/316/files/CHI-17_huh_paper.pdf">I’m too Busy to Reset my LinkedIn Password: On the Effectiveness of Password Reset Emails</a> <em>Huh et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper describes a Mechanical Turk survey of participants who had
received password breach notifications from LinkedIn. For a methodological
contrast, “‘What was that site doing with my Facebook password?’ Designing
Password-Reuse Notifications” asked people what they would do
hypothetically, and “(How) Do People Change Their Passwords After a
Breach?” observed what people actually did (with a slight caveat that
there were some heuristics used to figure out what people actually did
from the available data). In this Huh et al. paper, the researchers asked
people to recall what they did. Each of these methods has its pros and
cons; asking people to recall what they did can suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_bias">recall
bias</a>, though in this case the
authors took some steps to combat this bias by asking participants to
provide screenshots to verify that they had actually received the
notification and changed their password (if applicable). The results
showed a somewhat higher rate of password change (~50%) than other work,
but identified some other themes in common with other work: a substantial
delay before participants took action, and a tendency to choose weak or
related passwords when they did eventually change their password.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://yixinzou.github.io/publications/chi2019-zou.pdf">You ‘Might’ Be Affected: An Empirical Analysis of Readability and Usability Issues in Data Breach Notifications</a> <em>Zou et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper analyzes a dataset of real-world data breach notifications
downloaded from government databases. Most were mailed notifications.
Because I’m mostly interested in experimental results from electronic
notifications, I only skimmed this paper. The paper compiles a list of
best practices and recommendations for notification design (such as using
clear and concise language and highlighting key information visually) as
well as public policy (such as encouraging that notifications are
delivered across multiple channels). These recommendations seem to broadly
make sense, but I would be hesitant to apply them too dogmatically to
computer security warnings without verifying them experimentally.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, there’s a body of adjacent work about vulnerability and
misconfiguration notifications sent to server operators. For example, Durumeric
et al. conducted an experiment notifying 150,000 server operators that their
servers were vulnerable to the Heartbleed vulnerability. I’m more familiar with
this area of research because I’ve done work in it
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/06a75f932595f27a60092007965934c957b5de21.pdf">myself</a>.
My overall impression is that the effectiveness of this type of notifications
varies quite widely depending on the severity and urgency of the issue and the
effort needed to remedy it. Regardless, I view this area as mostly tangential
because I’m particularly interested in after-the-fact warnings for end users,
which is a substantially different population than server operators.</p>



<p>Here’s a collection of questions that I was hoping to find in these papers but
didn’t:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s a bit of an elephant in the room: <strong>is it possible for users to
actually recover once they’ve been compromised?</strong> Most of the work I described
above focuses on getting users to complete a particular action, such as
changing their password to a new, strong, unique password. But what if that’s
not enough? Data may have already been leaked or the account’s integrity
violated. The Redmiles paper (“‘Should I Worry?’”) touches on this issue by
describing follow-up actions that participants performed to verify their
account integrity, such as checking whether any unauthorized messages had been
sent from their account. But I think the research community hasn’t grappled
with what’s involved in truly recovering from an account compromise, and I
could spend a long time meditating on whether it makes sense to do
after-the-fact warnings at all if we don’t know what to tell users to do to
recover. (Also relevant: my colleague Chris Palmer pondering
<a href="https://noncombatant.org/2019/08/24/recoverability/">recoverability</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>How well do antivirus notifications work?</strong> When AV software pops up a
warning that the user has some malware installed, how likely are users to
comprehend the risks and respond effectively? (And, reiterating the elephant
in the room, what does “effectively” even mean in this case?) …</li></ul></div></div>

      <div>
        <p>When I first started programming, especially when asked for code
samples, my comments lacked purpose and would often duplicate in
English what the code clearly indicated. I knew that "commenting is
good" but as a beginner I had no further insight.</p>
<p>Over time with the help of books like Clean Code, I grew disdainful of
comments. Good code should be self-documenting. Whenever I needed to
write a comment to explain something, I'd realize I could easily
rename some key variable or function. I grew more comfortable with
variables and functions with a few words in the title. Better to spend
time on good code structure and naming.</p>
<p>
  I have always left TODOs though, since TODOs can't so easily be
  expressed in variable names. But even these TODOs concerned me
  because they existed in my issue tracker, or maybe should have.
</p><p>As I watched mature open source projects and mature engineers, I came
to value well-documented pull requests. Solid pull requests include or
link to all necessary background, opportunities failed or ignored, how
to use, links to external bugs requiring workarounds and the results
of performance evaluation.</p>
<p>Beyond pull request descriptions, when I really wanted to grease a
pull request I'd use the pull request UI to add comments calling
reviewer attention to key changes in lines of the diff.</p>
<p>Both kinds of guidance are a massive aid to reviewers, saving a lot of
time.</p>
<p>But when I'd find a bug in code -- and I knew there was good pull
request documentation, even for pull requests as recent as six months
ago -- I've been repeatedly failed by the pull request and <em>pull
request comment</em> search exposed by Github and Gitlab.</p>
<p>I <em>knew</em> there were links to documented oddities or bug reports in
pull request threads. But practically speaking, for historic pull
requests, pull request comments are useless.</p>
<p>This is the single biggest reason I've started to push for more
comments in code. More so than all other tools (issue tracker, code
management system, etc.) comments in code have the greatest chance of
still being around and <em>easily searchable</em> if they haven't been
deleted.</p>
<p>
  Don't get me started on pull request documentation in an external
  medium like Slack. It's so rewarding to get or give instant feedback
  on changes on instant messengers, but good luck finding that
  discussion 3 months later.
</p><p>Every time I have to call out a line of code in a pull request, that's
immediate cause for that code to be modified with comments.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn't do this if Github/Gitlab exposed a Google Docs-like
interface for browsing code line by line with links to all pull
request comment threads.</p>
<p>Please reply on Twitter with questions or comments.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The biggest reason to add comments in code (often linking to documented oddities or bug reports) is because it's impossible to search pull request threads historically in every source control management UI I've used.<a href="https://t.co/JlHWfbUH5z">https://t.co/JlHWfbUH5z</a></p>— Phil Eaton (@phil_eaton) <a href="https://twitter.com/phil_eaton/status/1303130504993136642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

I'm your host Lukas Biewald. Jeremy Howard created the Fast.ai course, which is maybe the most popular course to learn machine learning and there are a lot out there. He's also the author of the book Deep Learning for Coders with Fast.ai and PyTorch and in that process, he made the Fast.ai library which lots of people use independently to write deep learning. Before that, he was the CEO and co-founder of Enlitic, an exciting startup that applies deep learning to health care applications. And before that, he was the president of Kaggle, one of the most exciting earliest machine learning companies. I'm super excited to talk to him. So Jeremy, it's nice to talk to you. And in preparing the questions, I realized that every time I've talked to you there have been a few gems that I've remembered that I would never think to ask about. Like one time you told me about how you learned Chinese and another time you gave me Dad parenting advice, very specific advice and it's been actually super helpful. </p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh great. Tell me what Dad parenting advice worked out?</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Well, what you told me was when you change diapers, use a blow dryer to change a really frustrating experience to a really joyful experience and it's like such good advice. I don't know how you.. I guess I can imagine how you thought of it, but it's...</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, yeah, I know they love the whooshing sound, they love the warmth. I'm kind of obsessed about Dad things. So I'm always happy to talk about Dad things. That is this podcast.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Can we start with that? Now that my daughter is eight months old. Do you have any suggestions for her?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh my goodness! Eight months old. You know, it's like the same with any kind of learning. It's all about consistency. So I think that the main thing we did right with Claire was just, you know, this delightful child now is we were just super consistent. Like if we said you can't have X unless you do Y, we would never give her X if she didn't do Y. If you want to take your scooter down to the bottom of the road, you have to carry it back up again. We read this great book that was saying if you're not consistent, it becomes like this thing, it's like a gambler. It's like sometimes you get the thing you want, so you just have to keep trying so that's my number one piece of advice. It's the same with teaching machine learning. We always tell people that tenacity is the most important thing for students. To stick with it, do it every day.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I guess just in the spirit of questions, I'm genuinely curious about, you know, you've built this amazing framework and teaching thing that I think is maybe the most popular and most appreciated framework. I was wondering if you could start by telling me the story of what inspired you to do that and what was the journey to making Fast.ai, the curriculum and Fast.ai, the ML framework.</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>So it was something that my wife Rachel and I started together. Rachel has a math PhD, super technical background, early data scientist and engineer, Uber. I don't. I have just scraped by a philosophy undergrad and have no technical background. But from both of our different directions, we both had this frustration that neural networks in 2012 were super important, clearly going to change the world, but super inaccessible and so we would go to meetups and try to figure out like how do we... Like I knew the basic idea, I'd coded neural networks 20 years ago, but how do you make them really good? There wasn't any open source software at the time for running on GPUs. You know, Dan Seresen's thing was available, but you had to pay for it. There was no source code and we just thought, oh, we've got to change this, because the history of technology leaps has been that it generally increases inequality because the people with resources can access the new technology and then that leads to societal upheaval and a lot of unhappiness. So we thought, well, we should just do what we can. So we thought how are we going to fix this? Basically the goal was, and still is, to be able to use deep learning without requiring any code so that, you know, because the vast majority of the world can't code, we kind of thought, well, to get there, we should, first of all, see what exists right now? Learn how to use it as best as we can ourselves, teach people how to best use it as we can and then make it better, which requires doing research and then turning that into software and then changing the course to teach the hopefully slightly easier version and repeat that again and again for a few years. And so we're kind of in that process.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>That's so interesting. Do you worry that the stuff you're teaching, you're sort of trying to make it obsolete, right? Because you're trying to build higher level abstractions? Like I think one of the things that people really appreciate your course is that it's really clear, in-depth explanations of how these things work. Do you think that that's eventually going to be not necessary or how do you think about that?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, to some extent. I mean, so if you look at the new book and the new course, chapter one starts with really, really foundational stuff around what is a machine learning algorithm? What do we mean to learn an algorithm? What's the difference between traditional programming and machine learning to solve the same problem? And those kinds of basic foundations I think will always be useful, even at the point you're not using any code. I feel like even right now, if somebody is using like PlatformAI or some kind of code-free framework, you still need to understand these basics of an algorithm can only learn based on the data you provide. It's generally not going to be able to extrapolate to patterns it's not seen yet, stuff like that. Um, but yeah, I mean, we have so far released two new courses every year, you know, a part one and part two every year because every year, it's totally out of date. And we always say to our students at the start of part one, Look, you know, none of the details you're learning are going to be of any use in a year or two's time. There's a time when we're doing Piano and then TensorFlow and Keras, and then playing PyTorch. We always say, look, don't worry too much about the software we're using because none of it's still any good, you know, it's goal changing rapidly, you know, faster than JavaScript frameworks, but the concepts are important and yeah, you can pick up a new library and I don't know by weekend, I …</p></div></div>
