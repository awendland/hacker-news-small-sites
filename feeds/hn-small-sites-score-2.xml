                    <p>I know you don’t want to hear it. But multitasking isn’t effective. In this day and age of extreme busyness and “how much can we get done in a day” mentality, everyone is trying to do more — all at once. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>"We claim to be multitasking, but in reality, we are just tackling several tasks in a far less effective way than we would if we simply focused on one at a time."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We seem to think that <em>doing more</em> gives us more value as human beings. That somehow the <em>doing</em> gives us meaning and purpose (as opposed to what is actually accomplished). And we have trouble distinguishing between what is truly important and what is not. Or perhaps the problem comes in making the <em>choice</em> of what is important — in other words: choosing the priority.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.doit.io/content/images/2020/06/MythOfMultitasking-1.jpg" alt="The myth of multitasking"><figcaption>The myth of multitasking</figcaption></figure><p>Notice I said <em>priority</em>, singular. In essence, the definition of the word <em>priority </em>means <em>something of highest importance that comes before other things</em>. When you truly think about it, it is impossible to have more than one. If you claim to have, for instance, ten priorities, then there is really no priority. They all become of equal importance and none of them is coming before the other. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>"When we try to multitask, we are basically refusing to choose a priority in that moment."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We are forcing our brain to battle it out, and unfortunately, it is a losing battle.</p><h2 id="the-brain-s-reality">The Brain’s Reality</h2><p>So is it really totally impossible to multitask? After all, people claim to be doing it all the time. In fact, many of us pride ourselves on it. We look at younger generations — those growing up immersed in technology — as being experts in multitasking. </p><p>Well, it’s possible to do some simple tasks at the same time — like walking and talking. But when it comes to concentrated work, multitasking just isn’t scientifically possible. Instead, when we try to do two types of work at the same time that require our concentration, our brain switches back and forth from task to task. </p><p>Okay, so maybe we switch back and forth. But we’re still getting both things done right? Possibly. But the cost is often not worth it. Your brain is working much harder than it needs to. In fact, it’s overwhelmed with the constant switching of information. </p><h2 id="the-cost-of-the-switch">The Cost of the Switch</h2><p>Each time your brain switches from focus on one thing to focus on another, it takes time to recalibrate. Imagine it as refocusing a camera lens on two different subjects, back and forth. It takes a few seconds to change the focus each time, and those seconds add up. And when the tasks are really high-information tasks, like coding, for instance, it takes even longer to get back to full focus.</p><p>So you actually <strong>lose valuable time</strong> when you attempt to multitask. Not only that but your attention is divided. The switch puts you in an attention debt that takes a toll on your mental state. You are more likely to make mistakes and produce lower-quality work than <a href="https://blog.doit.io/focus-on-one-thing-leads-to-better-work/">if you were to simply do one thing at a time.</a> </p><h2 id="the-challenge-of-focus">The Challenge of Focus</h2><p>Despite the facts laid out in front of us, we continue to attempt multitasking. We churn out the work and check off the boxes like we are competing for a prize at the end of the day. And our lives are set up to encourage this. </p><p>Our smartphones are mini-computers that we carry with us everywhere. Sure, they are very convenient, but they are also constant distractions pulling at our attention. Many of us also compulsively check our email and text messages. The pace of communication today is such that we feel like we can’t afford not to. Some workplaces are set up in such a way that we are <em>expected</em> to respond immediately to any messages sent. Unfortunately, this takes a toll on our focus, too.</p><h2 id="narrowing-down-your-priorities">Narrowing Down Your Priorities</h2><p>Streamlining your priorities is a choice. And it may well be a tough one. But if you want to produce higher-quality work and reduce the stress on your brain, it’s worth it. Perhaps it’s too much to expect you to choose one single priority. But it starts with narrowing down your total priorities. And then simply choosing ONE priority for a specific chunk of time. One single thing to focus on.</p><p>So, take a step back and zoom out to the bigger picture of your life or your job. What is <em>truly</em> important to you or to your role? You may want to have a ranking system so you place areas of life or goals in order of importance. When you put some thought into it and make these choices “ahead of time,” it allows you to stay true to your priorities in the heat of the moment. When something comes up in your day and you have to choose what gets your full attention, you have already decided on your priorities.</p><h2 id="weed-out-the-multitasking">Weed Out the Multitasking</h2><p>Start eliminating the multitasking moments and improving your focus and work quality by choosing one time-slot per day where you will focus on one single task. Just start with one. Don’t make it too big — 30-45 minutes is enough to start. (Your brain needs breaks, too.) As you discover the value in doing this, you’ll likely want to add more chunks of focused time.</p><p>As you work on weeding out the multitasking, think of consolidating other things you do during a given day. Because another thing that weakens our focus is role-switching. So when we switch from making phone calls (which is one type of skill) to writing a brief (which is another skill) to filling out a form (which is another), it also tires our brains unnecessarily. Instead, look at how you can group similar types of tasks together. </p><p>This means email, too.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>"Instead of keeping your browser open all day and responding as they come in, give yourself set times to handle email."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If that makes you nervous (<em>“What if I don’t respond to someone right away?!”</em>), then perhaps include in your email signature a line that says, “I check email at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 4 p.m.” This gives them an indication of when they can expect a response. Checking email constantly might be a tough habit to break, but remember it <em>is</em> a habit that we’ve built up. Don’t forget there was a time when there was no email and no smartphones. And everyone survived.</p><p>We have incorporated distractions into our lives, and they are disguised as a means to be “connected” and “more productive.” Be aware of what is truly helping you be productive and what is actually keeping you from the goals you really care about.</p><h2 id="systems-to-try">Systems to Try</h2><p>Choosing priorities and improving focus have been issues for many people for a very long time. So know you are not alone in the struggle. Luckily, those before you have also created systems and processes to help simplify things. </p><p>If you are in the market for a more structured approach to deciding on priorities and focusing, perhaps try David Allen’s <a href="https://blog.doit.io/getting-things-done-gtd-method/"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a> system to give you some fresh clarity. Or try the <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-pomodoro-technique-boost-your-productivity/"><em>Pomodoro technique</em></a> to give you a framework for focused work. The <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-ivy-lee-method/"><em>Ivy Lee Method</em></a> helps you to minimize your daily priorities, and the <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-eisenhower-matrix/"><em>Eisenhower Matrix</em></a> helps you determine what is truly important vs. urgent.</p><p>There are many systems and processes to choose from, all with slightly different approaches for improving your productivity. None are right or wrong — it’s all about what will work for you. I suggest you choose one to try and give it a few weeks to see whether it helps you or not. Ultimately, the change will need to come from within you and your own desire to produce higher quality work with less stress. And remember that the way we work is habit, and we have the power to transform our habits for the better. But it doesn’t happen overnight. So matter how you choose to approach it, remember to give it time and stay committed.</p><h2 id="the-benefits-of-single-tasking-and-fewer-priorities">The Benefits of Single-Tasking and Fewer Priorities</h2><p>There is a state that is possible to reach <em>only</em> when your focus is pure and your attention is on a single task. That is the state of <strong>Flow</strong> (discussed in detail by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his book of the same name). Creative thinking is at a maximum and you are completely <em>in the zone</em>. The quality of work is usually very high. And not only that, but the feeling you get when you are able to work in this state is truly wonderful. </p><p>Accomplishment. Pride. Fulfillment. </p><p>Fewer priorities means you can give your <strong>all</strong> to your goals. It means you waste less time and undoubtedly feel more energetic. It equals lower levels of stress and reduced anxiety. With the facts laid out before you, it seems ridiculous to keep attempting the false process which is multitasking! Give single-tasking a try and experience the wealth of benefits to your workflow and quality.</p><p><a href="https://blog.doit.io/what-is-productivity/">&lt;- Go back to The Productivity Guide</a><br></p>

<p><i>January 28, 2021</i></p>


<p>
I sometimes get asked whether it makes sense to implement <i>XYZ</i> in C,
especially compared to using some language that is more advanced
(C++, Julia, Python, Haskell or Rust) or perfect (Lisp).
</p>

<p>
I suspect that a lot of people are a bit intimidated by C and believe that
it requires some kind of superhuman hacker ability to wield.
That's at least how I felt about C
before I started really using it.
Other people believe that C is a horrible
language that inherently produces defective software
and which should be cast back into the abysses of UNIX from whence it came
(they are not necessarily wrong).
I personally think that C's simplicity
is an advantage that
often outweighs its disadvantages,
but there are clearly domains where C is a bad choice.
In domains where C works well, there are also good
alternatives, and choosing C then just comes
down to personal preference.
</p>

<p>
In this post, I will attempt to answer why you should or shouldn't use C,
and I will give some general advice that may be helpful if you end up using C.
This is based on my own experience developing
mathematical software in C (mainly <a href="https://flintlib.org/">Flint</a>,
<a href="https://arblib.org/">Arb</a> and <a href="https://fredrikj.net/calcium/">Calcium</a>), in an academic setting.
This experience will not necessarily transfer well to other settings.
</p>

<h2>Why you should use C</h2>

<p>Why should you write your next library
in C, or perhaps contribute to some existing C library?
I will offer four simple arguments.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>
Reason number one is that C is stable, universally supported,
and has reliable tooling.
Your plain C library will compile and run
almost anywhere, can be developed anywhere,
and will require minimal dependencies. Users of virtually
any other programming language can easily interface with your code
through their language's C foreign function interface,
at least if you take basic precautions to design a decent external API.
Not only will your C library run anywhere
<i>right now</i>; it will still run 20 years from now,
and if you had a time machine, probably 20 years ago too.
</p>

<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>
Reason number two is that it will run very, very fast.
I don't just mean that
benchmark loops will
go <i>VROOOM</i>; your software will also start up instantly
(no need to load a bloated dynamic runtime or JIT-compile code),
and there will be no hidden overhead for things like automatic
garbage collection
(well-written C code spends a negligible fraction of its overall
execution time doing allocations and deallocations,
precisely at the points in time where they are needed).
This is, of course, <i>if you know what you are doing</i>.
Writing efficient C, while not exactly rocket surgery, does require
proficiency with the language and a solid understanding
of fundamental algorithms and data structures.
</p>

<h3>Readability</h3>

<p>Reason number three is that you will be able to read your
own code, and others will incidentally be able to read it too.
Some people are going to disagree with me here, arguing that higher
level languages are better for readibility.
That is trivially true in the sense that higher level languages
provide abstractions that allow expressing complex ideas more
succinctly.
A simple example is providing operator overloading so that you
can write <tt>a + b * c</tt> instead of something like <tt>add(a, mul(b, c))</tt>,
or in C, often something even more verbose like the following typical <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> snippet:
</p>

<pre>mpz_t tmp;
mpz_init(tmp);
mpz_mul(tmp, b, c);
mpz_add(a, a, tmp);
mpz_clear(tmp);
</pre>

<p>This
would seem like an especially important point for mathematical software.
However, hiding details can also
hide useful information.
In an object-oriented, memory-managed,
operator-overloaded language, information that may be
hidden by the infix arithmetic notation includes
where and how memory is allocated;
how methods are resolved and how coercions are made
when the operands have different types
or when class hierarchies are involved;
what algorithms are used to perform the arithmetic operations
(irrelevant for machine integers, but potentially very important
details if you are multiplying huge matrices).
The infix notation is usually good for understanding the intent
of the code, but something more verbose can be
better for reasoning about performance
and for dealing with cracks in the abstractions.
Put concisely, C is good for making implementation details explicit
when implementation details matter.
</p>

<p>Viewed in this light, C's omission of certain conveniences
such as namespaces, overloading and generics is actually a feature,
not a bug.
Figuring out what any given piece of C code does tends to be
a straightforward process because of, and not despite, the fact
that it is verbose: everything that happens is explicit and functions and types can only have a
single definition which is easy to grep for.
I can't recall ever really having trouble diving into someone else's C code
or reading C code that I wrote a long time ago.
The same can't be said for Python, for example, where it can be
a real struggle to understand which method on which class gets called and how
and when and in what context.
Granted, you <i>can</i> obfuscate C code by abusing macros, doing
complicated runtime generics, or using cryptic names,
but even something like the rather dense
and idiosyncratic <a href="https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">Pari/GP</a>
codebase is penetrable after a short familiarization process.
</p>

<h3>Educational value</h3>

<p>
Reason number four is that you will learn a lot in the process of writing C.
Implementing algorithms in C instead of a higher-level language
can lead to a deeper understanding since you have
to do more of the groundwork yourself. You will also probably have to
think things through more carefully; when I write Python, I can often
get away with implementing something half-broken and fixing it piecemeal,
but C more often forces me to be correct up-front.
</p>

<h2>Why you shouldn't use C</h2>

<p>Now on to the far more interesting case <i>against</i> C,
or rather, a fair and balanced evaluation of C's weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Mathematical understanding</h3>

<p>
Since we are talking about <i>mathematical</i> software, it is likely
that implementing <i>XYZ</i> actually involves solving two problems: understanding the
mathematics of <i>XYZ</i>, and translating that understanding
to concrete algorithms and code. If you don't understand the mathematics,
you might be better off exploring the problem
using a high-level language or a computer algebra system
and postponing a C implementation (if you need it) until
your mathematical understanding has crystallized.
If you decide to start a C project right away
to figure out the mathematics in parallel with the software development,
you will probably still want to use
another language for experimentation (more on this later).
Be prepared to continuously reevaluate your assumptions, and
expect having to rewrite code from scratch more than once.
</p>

<h3>Portability and deployment</h3>

<p>The following comments mainly apply to starting a new project
intended to be used by other people.</p>

<p>
In practice, the claims about C's amazing portability are somewhat
exaggerated.
As a C library maintainer,
you will have a lot of fun gradually discovering
new inconsistencies in build systems and standard library implementations
between different operating systems and hardware configurations.
You will probably run into the occasional rare compiler bug (though C might be
one of the better languages in this regard).
Over time, your header files will probably accumulate hundreds
of <tt>#ifdef</tt>s intended to work around compatibility problems
that may or may not still exist.</p>

<p>The large majority of your prospective users will probably
be unable or unwilling to
build and install your library from source, so
you will either have to distribute binaries yourself or
rely on distribution via third-party
package repositories such as those of the major Linux distributions.
In the interest of stability
or because of a lack of manpower,
such repositories typically keep software 1-10 years out of date.
(Yes, I once found <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>'s default Ubuntu configuration sporting a nearly 10 years old
Flint-1.6.)
In other words, you can't count on users having access to the latest features
and bugfixes
in your library, and it goes without saying that you should work
very hard to preserve backward compatibility.
I suppose this lag in deployment has one advantage for reproducible research: if
you submit a journal paper based on the cutting edge version of your software,
readers will probably still have access to that version in Debian LTS
by the time the publishing process completes three years later
(hi, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/toms">ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software</a>).</p>

<p>
A good idea for widespread deployment is to get your mathematical library into
<a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>.
SageMath is maintained by a large community
and tested on many platforms, and packages in SageMath are usually only several months out of date.
</p>

<p>Deploying software written in more modern programming languages is
typically easier since they have more sane build processes
and standard libraries that eliminate most of C's platform-dependent
headaches.
Nowadays many languages also have their own easy-to-use packaging systems
and centralized package repositories.
In practice, the best languages for portability and easy distribution
right now are probably (1) JavaScript (in the browser), and (2) Python.
Julia is not far behind, and in many respects better designed than Python,
but Python currently has the benefit of being preinstalled on many systems.
All of this being said,
<a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> is a promising
alternative distribution method for C code which may change the equation,
especially if you think a browser-based interface makes more
sense than linking together libraries and running code
in the terminal in the traditional way.
</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>
C has a reputation of leading to buggy, crash-prone software
and disastrous security vulnerabilities.
Commonly criticized aspects of C include its
manual memory management, weak type system, and
deviously undefined or implementation-defined semantics.
This reputation is generally deserved,
though in C's defense, I think the problems often</p></div></div>

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<p>Since the release of<a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases/tag/v5.6.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 5.6.0</a> there are have been a number of distinct improvements, all aimed at reducing the amount of data written to disk. Why focus on disk usage? First because it’s long been obvious that disk IO is the performance bottleneck for rqlite, due to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/fsync" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fsync’ing</a> to the <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raft log</a>. Secondly, rqlite aims to be a <em>lightweight</em> database, so keeping its disk footprint low is desirable. 5.10.0 now contains the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol Buffer (Protobuf)</a> encoding of the SQL commands before they are written to the Raft log. Generally speaking protofbuf encoding is more space-efficient than JSON, which is what used in 5.6.0.</li>
<li>Compression of SQL queries (and batches of SQL queries) above a <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/v5.10.0/command/marshal.go#L14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain threshold</a>, which happens before the Protobuf-encoding, and before the commands are written to the Raft log. The savings from compression are greater the larger the SQL queries sent to rqlite. This also has the nice affect of reducing network traffic from the leader node to other nodes in the cluster.</li>
<li>Compressing the copy of the SQLite database that becomes part of the <em>Raft snapshot</em>. Snapshotting is a critical step in <em>truncating</em> the Raft log, a process that ensures that the log doesn’t grow without limit. This snapshot is written to disk, for restart and recovery purposes.</li>
<li>No more use of disk for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scratch space</a>, during creation of the snapshot. Snapshot-creation now takes place entirely in memory.</li>
<li>During normal operation rqlite can use either an <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/v5.10.0/README.md#in-memory-databases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-memory (the default)</a> or on-disk SQLite database. However restarting an on-disk node could previously take a long time, because applying changes from the Raft log to an on-disk database is significantly slower than writing to an in-memory database. Now 5.10.0, when running in on-disk mode, first rebuilds the SQLite in memory and only when that is complete does it move the database to disk. This means disk-based restarts are basically as fast as memory-based restarts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Measuring the impact</h2>
<p>While it’s fairly easy to predict the impact the changes above will have, it’s always important <a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/a-prayer-for-distributed-systems-developers/">to confirm the results</a>. So I ran a simple, 6-hour load test against a single rqlite node, which used an in-memory SQLite database. The load test involved inserting a simple record into a table, over and over again. I used <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v5.10.0/cmd/rqbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rqbench</a> to perform the writes:</p>
<pre>rqbench -o 'CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)' -m 100 -n 1500000 'INSERT INTO foo(name) VALUES("fiona")'</pre>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfluxDB</a>, <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegraf</a> (specifically the <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/http" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http</a> plugin) to collect (via the rqlite <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/DIAGNOSTICS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diagnostics endpoint</a>) and display the results.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at 5.6.0 performance first (technically <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v5.6.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a patched version of 5.6.0</a> so the required metrics were collected).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated.png"><img src="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1024x543.png" alt="" width="474" height="251" srcset="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1024x543.png 1024w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-300x159.png 300w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-768x407.png 768w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1536x814.png 1536w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated.png 1872w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></a></p>
<p>Nothing too out of the ordinary. The CPU is never that busy and mostly waiting for IO. The amount of data being written to disk — and rate it is being written — steadily increases however, as the SQLite snapshots grow in size. The Raft subsystem operated normally — committing log entries, and performing a snapshot every couple of minutes or so.</p>
<p>Compare the results of the same test, this time for 5.10.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated.png"><img src="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-1024x543.png" alt="" width="474" height="251" srcset="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-1024x543.png 1024w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-300x159.png 300w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-768x407.png 768w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-1536x814.png 1536w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated.png 1872w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></a></p>
<p>This time disk activity is significantly down, but the trade-off is more CPU activity during the snapshot-compression cycles. This is exactly the trade-off I wanted to make, but it’s good to see that it is actually happening. Note that the disk footprint is much smaller too — it’s only 30% as large for (roughly) the same amount of SQL insertions.</p>
<h2>What didn’t change?</h2>
<p>The write-performance of rqlite generally hasn’t changed that much between versions, not with these relatively small SQL statements. Mildly disappointing perhaps. However snapshotting should put much less burden on the system, meaning much less disruption to the write-performance during that periodic process. And larger SQL statements should see a much bigger write-performance improvement relative to 5.6.0, as the compression wins should also be bigger.</p>
<p>It’s also good to see that write performance remained steady throughout each test. This wasn’t something I had explicitly tested before, and didn’t receive reports of any issues, but again, it’s good to see.</p>
<p>5.10.0 adds some other small features, as well as some more diagnostics. I also expanded the test suite, as code quality is very important to me. So <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a> it and check it out.</p>

<p>In March 2020, unregulated crypto exchanges, led by Binance, switched to USDT as collateral for margin trading. This has led to a progressive release of around 1 million Bitcoins previously locked as collateral. The fact these newly available Bitcoins didn’t crash the price only makes sense if Tether scooped them up and is now holding them as reserves.</p>



<p>The price of Bitcoin is determined, same as for all assets, at the margin. The price is a market equilibrium between how many Bitcoins are available for trading, and how many Bitcoins are needed for daily flows:</p>



<p><strong>$BTC = Turnover / Supply</strong></p>



<p>This formula is quite straightforward: the price of Bitcoin rises with increasing use cases, and decreases with the amount of Bitcoins competing for these use cases. Note that Supply only means “Bitcoins available for trading” – all the Bitcoins sitting in HODL wallets don’t take part in the price discovery process.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin price and turnover</h3>



<p>There are three types of Bitcoin turnover:</p>



<ul><li>short term (a few days), for transfers (capital flight from China, unregulated exchange account funding, remittances)</li><li>medium term (a few months), for collateral and arbitrage (margin trading, Grayscale premium arbitrage)</li><li>long term (a few years), for HODLing</li><li></li></ul>



<p>There are also two types of one-way flows, impacting the amount of Bitcoins available:</p>



<ul><li>lost coins (reducing the Supply, positive for price)</li><li>mining rewards (increasing the Supply, negative for price)</li></ul>



<p>The first three flows compete for the Bitcoins that are available for trading at that time (“S” for Supply). For instance, if Bitcoins were only used for transfers, and people were using Bitcoin to transfer $10 billion per day, assuming an average transaction length of 1 day, the price of Bitcoin would be:</p>



<p><strong>$BTC = $10B / S</strong></p>



<p>If the Supply is 1 million Bitcoins, that would give you a $BTC market equilibrium price of $10,000. The idea is that people who use Bitcoin for real world use cases don’t care about its price, and will simply buy an amount in fiat that they need for their purpose, while the Bitcoins available for trading will compete for that fiat.</p>



<p>All things remaining equal, you have two rules:</p>



<ol><li>The lower the Supply, the higher Bitcoin’s price, and vice versa</li><li>The higher the flows, the higher Bitcoin’s price, and vice versa</li></ol>



<h3>The impact of USDT replacing Bitcoin</h3>



<p>Ever since exchanges started replacing Bitcoin by USDT for margin trading collateral, the amount of Bitcoins at exchange-controlled wallets has steadily decreased:</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ep6Hw6cXcAUYSYJ?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Image"></figure>



<p>This trend has, of course, been compensated by a relentlessly increasing amount of USDT in circulation, to the tune of Bitcoin outflows multiplied by their price:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02.png 772w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02-300x138.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02-768x354.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px"></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, most of these new USDTs sit on exchanges, Binance being on the top of the list, as they’re being used as collateral:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-1024x380.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-1024x380.png 1024w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-300x111.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-768x285.png 768w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37.png 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This move has greatly increased the Bitcoin supply, to the tune of 1 million Bitcoins. These are Bitcoins that have been gradually released from being frozen as collateral, and are now available for other types of use.</p>



<p>The increased acceptance of USDT are also replacing Bitcoin for the transfer use case, as they aren’t volatile, and can be sent almost instantly. This has reduced Bitcoin turnover.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin to the moon… HOW?</h3>



<p>Given the rise of USDT in circulation has increased Bitcoin supply and reduced its turnover, the impact of the Tether collateral flippening on $BTC should have been disastrous. Yet, Bitcoin is up tenfold since the start of the trend. How is this possible?</p>



<p>The knee-jerk response from Bitcoiners will be that a lot of new demand for Bitcoin has emerged at the same time, citing Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy and Grayscale. But we’re talking about 1.3 million Bitcoins (released from collateral and newly mined) in less than a year! That’s one hell of an exogenous event that should have crushed the price, right?</p>



<p>Well, no – because the event wasn’t exogenous; it was decided by the crypto community insiders – mostly Binance, Bitfinex and Tether. They knew that by releasing all this Bitcoin into the market, they would crush the price. So, they didn’t.</p>



<p>If you were to follow Tether’s own advertised rules, where new USDTs are issued only against matching USD deposits, the Tether collateral flippening should have followed this path:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08.png 878w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08-300x141.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08-768x362.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></figure>



<p>Instead, what happened is this:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34.png 853w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34-300x69.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34-768x176.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px"></figure>



<p>This path has two huge advantages:</p>



<ul><li>no fiat is needed</li><li>no Bitcoins are released into Supply</li></ul>



<p>It also has one small disadvantage:</p>



<ul><li>Tether has to lie about how USDTs are issued and what its reserves are made of</li></ul>



<p>Note that this disadvantage can be easily solved by round-tripping, a practice that was once dear to Wirecard, where a very small amount of fiat circulates a lot of times between everyone involved, to make it look like there are transactions. Meaning that Binance doesn’t send Bitcoins in exchange of USDT directly to Tether. They first put these Bitcoins as collateral for a loan from Tether, then wire the proceeds of the loan to Tether, and get USDTs in return. Exactly the same result as buying Bitcoin with USDT, but very different appearances and paper trail.</p>



<h3>USDTs are backed by Bitcoin</h3>



<p>More accurately, Tether’s reserves are loans to exchanges, collateralized by Bitcoin. The Bitcoins that were used as collateral for margin trading, are now used as collateral for USDT. This way, exchanges know that USDTs are actually worth something, and accept to maintain the 1:1 peg. And no fiat needs to be deposited at Tether, a small and shady company with no offices, under investigation by the NYAG, with a shaky banking relationship with Deltec that’s not even a real bank.</p>



<p>This is the only way the Tether collateral flippening wouldn’t have crushed Bitcoin’s price. The question that remains to be answered is, if exchanges accept that Tether issues USDTs backed by Bitcoin, why not print some USDT out of thin air to buy Bitcoin with it, and pump $BTC in an effort to ignite another round of FOMO?</p>

<p>It is time for our annual bulletin to <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/tag/capex/">CAPEX obsessives</a> (previous updates from <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/www.platformonomics.com/2017/04/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes/">2016</a>, <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2018/04/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2017-edition/">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2019/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2018-edition/">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2019-edition/">2019</a> as well as <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/tag/capex/">earlier</a> installments). The hashtag for CAPEX 2020 is “#bonkers”.</p>



<p><strong>The three hypercloud companies – Amazon, Google, and Microsoft – collectively spent almost $97 billion on CAPEX in 2020</strong>, up 32% from 2019’s $73.5 billion. Amazon and Microsoft’s spending again hit new highs (bonkers new highs in Amazon’s case) while Google’s spending declined for the second year in a row. <strong>Amazon spent more on CAPEX than <u>any </u>company (not just cloud companies) in 2020 </strong><a href="#*" data-type="internal" data-id="#*">[*]</a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Standard caveat: The reported numbers are the companies’ total CAPEX spend, not just cloud infrastructure, so includes land, office buildings, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/emptied-pandemic-overtaken-cranes-microsoft-hq-symbol-changing-world/">campus redevelopments</a>, warehouses, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-adds-palm-reading-biometric-id-scanner-physical-retail-stores-seattle/">panopticonvenience stores</a>, manufacturing tooling, self-driving cars, delivery trucks, flying machines, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazons-project-kuiper-drops-hints-customer-terminals-satellite-internet/">satellite constellations</a>, hardware that both is and is not required for quantum computing, and – the dream is admittedly on life support – a Google space elevator. The numbers include finance leases for both Amazon and Microsoft, as well as build-to-suit leases for Amazon (these are debt instruments used to finance specific CAPEX expenditures, namely servers and buildings).</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.png"><img loading="lazy" width="868" height="504" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.png 868w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5-300x174.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>In 2020, Amazon’s CAPEX was up a mere 69% to just shy of an absolutely bonkers $54 billion, Google’s spend declined over 5% to $22.3 billion and Microsoft’s increased 14% to $20.6 billion. </strong>Amazon (company slogan: “a penny of free cash flow is a terrible thing to waste on abstract accounting constructs like profits”) is accelerating its spending and may soon achieve orbital escape velocity on the back of its CAPEX trajectory, rendering Jeff Bezos’ personal space program unnecessary.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="572" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png 940w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-300x183.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-768x467.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>



<p>It is beyond bonkers that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/vmware-targets-rival-bookseller-amazon-with-its-own-public-cloud/">“a company that sells books”</a> spends more on CAPEX than any other company <a href="#*" data-type="internal" data-id="#*">[*]</a>. And the idea that our other two “software companies” have a CAPEX spend in the same league or beyond the biggest automakers, energy companies, semiconductor manufacturers, and telcos in the world is likewise bonkers.</p>



<p><a name="*">[*]</a> Where “any other company” is defined as the random set I looked up and charted above. Are there other big spenders I’ve missed? I didn’t look at Chinese companies, mostly because I’m lazy, but also because often their investments are non-economic, accounting dodgy, and audits optional, even for companies listed in the US (if only domestic companies had that luxury, but Wall Street still dreams of selling a collaterized debt obligation to each and every person in China).</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7.png"><img loading="lazy" width="854" height="504" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7.png 854w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7-300x177.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7-768x453.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>The three hyperclouds’ cumulative CAPEX spend since 2000 is almost $444 billion</strong>, with over $170 billion of that occurring in the last two years. Efforts to find an amusing comparable failed.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png"><img loading="lazy" width="856" height="506" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png 856w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8-300x177.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8-768x454.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px"></a></figure>



<p>As a percentage of revenue, hypercloud CAPEX is clustered between 12 and 14% of revenue, with Amazon edging out Microsoft for the top spot this year.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14.png"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="436" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14.png 724w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></a></figure>



<p>Azure and Google Cloud (which includes both Google Cloud Platform and whatever they are calling Google Docs this week) have both seen growth accelerate slightly since “<a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/03/the-geopolitical-game-board-march-2020/">a bat out of Wuhan</a>” became the new “butterfly effect”. The AWS growth rate is lower, but they grew revenue by over $10 billion in 2020, so their dollar growth alone is bigger than GCP.</p>



<h2><strong>Amazon #bonkers</strong></h2>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10.png"><img loading="lazy" width="858" height="504" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10.png 858w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10-300x176.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10-768x451.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px"></a></figure>



<p>By most standards, Amazon had an absolutely magnificent pandemic year (some might say “bonkers”). Revenue growth nearly doubled to 38% from 20% growth the previous year, bringing in over $386 billion. Profits almost doubled. And they spent the aforementioned bonkers CAPEX to support that growth while providing an essential lifeline to hundreds of millions of people in isolation amidst a global pandemic. Not bad.</p>



<p>Amazon’s cash out of pocket for CAPEX exploded: 2020 spending was 238% of the previous year, with over $23 billion incremental spent on hard assets. Debt-funded CAPEX declined 8% (with capital leases — probably AWS servers — down 15% while the smaller sum of built-to-suit real estate leases increased as they grew their warehouse space by 50%). Over the past couple years, Amazon’s CAPEX outlay was split roughly half cash and half debt. In 2020, the cash spend ballooned to 75%. There clearly was a push to spend as much as possible on hard assets (“Quick, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-air-makes-first-outright-purchase-planes-buying-11-boeing-jets-expand-cargo-fleet/">buy as many wide-body airplanes</a> as you can before the end of the year!”).</p>



<p>Amazon has always managed for free cash flow, as opposed to profits. Despite the numbers above, the pandemic year was an all-time low when measured against their financial priorities. Even though they stuffed an additional $23 billion into CAPEX, the company was unable to reinvest most of its cash flow into the business and (embarrassingly) reported profits of over $21 billion. One could almost speculate that Bezos’ departure as CEO is not so much his choice, but reflects the board’s disappointment in his dismal 2020 cash flow performance.</p>



<p>At this point, AWS accounts for a small fraction of Amazon’s CAPEX spending, and examining overall Amazon CAPEX – except as an excuse to use the word bonkers– is ever less relevant to cloud infrastructure discussions. The finance leases historically have been the best tell on AWS cloud infrastructure investments, as they reflected server purchases.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11.png"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="436" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11.png 724w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></a></figure>



<p>If we look at AWS revenue vs. finance leases, we can see they have decoupled, particularly in the last two years. The company probably paid cash in 2020 to convert some of its pandemic windfall into servers, and has less need to use debt to realize its CAPEX ambitions.</p>



<h2><strong>Google</strong></h2>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12.png"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="474" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12.png 940w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12-300x151.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>



<p>Following Amazon last year, Google is now moving to depreciating their servers over four years:</p>



<blockquote><p>As noted in our earnings press release, we have adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in 2021. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2021 operating results by approximately $2.1 billion for assets as of year-end 2020.</p></blockquote>



<p>That bold bean counter move has a multi-billion impact on their accounting earnings, but as seen by their CAPEX/revenue number, Google has been on a four-year server cycle for a long time. Yet more evidence that accounting can be distracting. CAPEX obsessives care about the gross spend on silicon, glass, steel and concrete, and don’t waste time netting out accounting abstractions like depreciation.</p>



<p>Based on that four-year cycle, we expect Google’s next CAPEX up-cycle in 2022. The company has highlighted they are investing heavily in Google Cloud, but we don’t see it in the CAPEX numbers. Even as they <a href="https://www.itprotoday.com/iaaspaas/google-expanding-google-cloud-regions-2021" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.itprotoday.com/iaaspaas/google-expanding-google-cloud-regions-2021">expand their footprint</a> into more geographies, the infrastructure for search and YouTube are vastly larger. Google’s commentary on Google Cloud emphasizes most of that investment is in people.</p>



<p>Google (why does the Alphabet conceit still exist?) also stopped breaking out CAPEX for Other Bets this year, as Loon joined Makani and Titan in the aerial wing of the <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Killed By Google</a> cemetery. Google continues to <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/07/can-brian-hall-fix-what-ails-google-cloud/">shed its Googley-ness</a> and will fail to deliver a space elevator, calling into question their entire existence and social contract compliance. I await Congressional hearings on what went wrong with the space elevator.</p>



<h2><strong>Microsoft</strong></h2>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="474" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png 940w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-300x151.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>



<p>Microsoft’s CAPEX remains boring, monotonic and inscrutable, as I have not been able to tease apart their spending on Azure, Office 365 and Bing (which may be a distant number two to Google, but search still has huge infrastructure requirements to store all those copies of the entire Web). There was a brief moment of <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/10/pandemic-capex-q3-2020-update/">excitement</a> right after the pandemic broke when Microsoft was short on servers due to supply chain disruptions, but that was remedied the next quarter and boringness restored. Hopefully they can do more CAPEX-wise this year to stand out in this annual commentary.</p>

<p>As an operating system GNU/Linux has become a mess because of the fragmented nature of the project, the bloatware in the kernel, but mainly because of the manipulation by corporate interests. There exist <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/technical-reasons-to-choose-freebsd-over-linux.html">several technical reasons</a> for when a migration from GNU/Linux to BSD make sense, but this article isn't about that, it's an "analyzes" of the current status in Linux-land, and it is an opinionated rant, more than anything else.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past I have always been a favorite of choosing operating system and tools based upon technical merit. However, in today's world of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many others, compromising user privacy, and conducting controversial activities, I don't believe that to be the right cause of action.</p>
<p>Proprietary operating systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#Privacy_and_data_collection">Microsoft Windows 10</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/iosecure/357e724811fe04167332ef54e736670d">Apple MacOS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Security_and_privacy">Google Android</a> have become famous for their ill conduct, and even companies like Lenovo is using UEFI boot to inject custom Windows components, so that the system can phone home to Lenovo.</p>
<p>I have been a proponent for the open source alternatives, like GNU/Linux and BSD, for a very long time. Not only that, I also believe that the open source alternatives are much better in many technical areas.</p>
<p>I have also always been very much against <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/the-typical-discussions-about-bsd-vs-linux.html">The typical discussions about BSD vs Linux</a>, and as I wrote in my article back then, I have always believed that the different open source projects can help each other and cooperate, and that end-users should only debate such issues from a technical stand point rather than personal preference.</p>
<p>Whenever it has been possible, I have proposed people, both private and in the industry, to change the operating systems they use to open source alternatives, and when people have been receptive to my advocacy I have helped them migrate from Microsoft Windows on their workstations to BSD or Linux. And likewise on the server side. This has been a truly successful endeavor and I have honestly never experienced a dissatisfied person or company.</p>
<p>However, things are beginning to change in the GNU/Linux world as more and more corporations want to control the direction of Linux as an operating system. Due to the structure and organization of GNU/Linux as an operating system, it is unfortunately susceptible to these influences, and while it is still open source, and still not anywhere near the bad things that is going on with the proprietary alternatives, some opt-out features have slowly been introduced into both the kernel and systemd.</p>
<p>You can still choose to opt-out of these features and go your merry way, but as an open source enthusiast and proponent, and as a privacy concerned individual, perhaps the better approach is to migrate systems to something where you don't have to concern yourself with "creepware".</p>
<p>As a system administrator I don't want to worry about whether I am going to be surprised the next time I upgrade a system, and I don't want to keep a list of spyware I have to remember to opt-out of whenever I run one of these systems.</p>
<p>Several Linux distributions have decided (not only because of privacy opt-out issues, but other issues as well) to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_distributions_without_systemd">other init solutions than systemd</a>, but with the situation going on in the kernel development, and with many third party applications becoming more and dependent upon systemd, the problems are spreading to other parts of the operating system and I believe this is becoming an uphill battle.</p>
<p>From a community perspective, and from a security perspective, I don't believe the future of GNU/Linux looks very bright, and as a possible alternative solution I suggest migrating everything (when possible) to something a bit more sane, like one of the BSD projects.</p>

<h2 id="fragmented">Linux is fragmented</h2>
<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman announced his intent to start coding the GNU Project in a Usenet message. By June 1987, the project had accumulated and developed free and open source software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C compiler (GCC), an editor (GNU Emacs), and various Unix utilities, such as ls, grep, awk, make and ld.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Linux kernel appeared, developed outside the GNU project by Linus Torvalds, and in December 1992 it was made available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Combined with the operating system utilities already developed by the GNU project, it became the GNU/Linux operating system, better known as just "Linux".</p>
<p>Then came the Linux distributions. Different projects took the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and libraries, additional third party software, documentation, the X Window System, a window manager, and a desktop environment, and combined those components into the distributions. Different distributions focused on different goals, some put focus on the desktop while others put their main focus on servers, and again others tried to provide a multi-purpose operating system.</p>
<p>In the past all these different components and projects where developed by open source enthusiasts and communities and the passion for programming and open source was the driving force.</p>
<p>This is no longer the case! Please see <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-real-motivation-behind-systemd.html">The real motivation behind systemd</a>.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds has many times made it very clear that he doesn't care about what goes on in the "Linux world", all he cares about is the kernel development, and on January 6, 2020 in the "Moderated Discussions" forum at <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=189711&amp;curpostid=189841">realworldtech.com</a>, Linus Torvalds answered a user's question, with an absolute jaw-dropping comment, about a year-old kernel maintenance controversy that heavily impacted the <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/">ZFS on Linux</a> project.</p>
<p>After answering the user's actual question, Torvalds went on to make very wrong and damaging claims about the ZFS filesystem. Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
It (ZFS) was always more of a buzzword than anything else.
</blockquote>
<p>By that statements Linus Torvalds has just reduced more that 15 years of development of one of the most robust and popular filesystems in the world into a "buzzword"!</p>
<p>ZFS is described as "The last word in filesystems". It is a combined filesystem and logical volume manager originally designed by Sun Microsystems. ZFS is a stable, fast, secure, and future-proof filesystem. It is scalable, and includes extensive protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, a maximum 16 Exabyte file size, and a maximum 256 Quadrillion Zettabytes storage with no limit on number of filesystems (datasets) or files, efficient data compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z, native NFSv4 ACLs, and can be very precisely configured.</p>
<p>The two main implementations, by Oracle and by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenZFS">OpenZFS</a> project, are extremely similar, making ZFS widely available within Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Wikipedia article, OpenZFS is an umbrella project aimed at bringing together individuals and companies that use the ZFS file system and work on its improvements, aiming as well at making ZFS more widely used and developed in an open-source manner. OpenZFS brings together developers from the illumos, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS platforms, and a wide range of companies. High-level goals of the project include raising awareness of the quality, utility and availability of open-source implementations of ZFS, encouraging open communication about ongoing efforts toward improving open-source variants of ZFS, and ensuring consistent reliability, functionality and performance of all distributions of ZFS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commits/master">OpenZFS on Linux</a>, which is the Linux part of the project, has currently 345 active contributors with more that 5.600 commits, and commits are being made on an almost daily basis!</p>
<p>Some of the worlds biggest CDN and data storage services runs ZFS on either FreeBSD or Linux!</p>
<p>In another situation Linus Torvalds gave an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mysM-V5h9z8">TFiR: open source and Emerging Tech YouTube channel</a> about Linux on the desktop in which he makes another amazing statement saying that Linux still isn't ready for the desktop and that perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS">Chrome OS</a> is the solution to that problem.</p>
<p>These and many other statements by Linus Torvalds show that Linux as an operating system has no real direction and no clear management because the kernel development is performed in isolation from the rest of the Linux world.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds is generally also very open to the rapid influence by corporate interests and his perspective on security is also worrying.</p>
<p>In 2009 Linus Torvalds admitted that the kernel development is getting out of control.</p>
<blockquote>
We're getting bloated and huge. Yes, it's a problem ... Uh, I'd love to say we have a plan ... I mean, sometimes it's a bit sad that we are definitely not the streamlined, small, hyper-efficient kernel that I envisioned 15 years ago ... The kernel is huge and bloated, and our icache footprint is scary. I mean, there is no question about that. And whenever we add a new feature, it only gets worse.
</blockquote>
<p>At LinuxCon 2014, he said that he thinks the bloat situation is better because modern PCs are a lot faster!</p>
<blockquote>
We've been bloating the kernel over the last 20 years, but hardware has grown faster.
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very problematic attitude.</p>
<p>When software gets bloated it not only becomes more insecure and more error prone, but it also becomes much slower. Thinking that the problem goes away because hardware becomes faster is an immature attitude. In this day and age we need to optimize software so that less power is required, we need to save power and limit pollution.</p>
<p>In a 2007 interview "Why I quit": kernel developer Con Kolivas he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
If there is any one big problem with kernel development and Linux it is the complete disconnection of the development process from normal users. You know, the ones who constitute 99.9% of the Linux user base. The Linux kernel mailing list is the …</blockquote></article></div>

</ul>
  <p>For a while, I’ve had notes from <a href="https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/how-to-change-mac-address/">Change or Spoof a MAC Address in Windows or OS X</a> saved, so if I am using a wifi connection that limits me to thirty minutes or an hour, I can “spoof” a new MAC address, and when I re-connect to the wifi, the Access Point thinks I’m on a new, unique device.</p>

<p>For the record - when I’m posted up at a coffee shop for an extended period of time, I make sure to <em>buy products regularly</em> in payment for my time. So, if you’re spoofing your MAC address to use wifi for a longer period of time, maybe make sure to spend $5 or $10 when you run the script.</p>

<p>Now, in case you think that I’m actually saving myself time here, I’m totally not. Here’s why:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png" alt="XKCD Automation" title="'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'."></p>

<p><em><a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">XKCD: Automation</a></em></p>

<p>And:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png" alt="XKCD Is it worth the time?" title="Don't forget the time you spend finding the chart to look up what you save. And the time spent reading this reminder about the time spent. And the time trying to figure out if either of those actually make sense. Remember, every second counts toward your life total, including these right now."></p>

<p><em><a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">XKCD: Is it worth the time?</a></em></p>

<p>Here’s the steps, for someone who’s on a MAC, to spoof your MAC address:</p>
      <h3 id="get-your-current-mac-address">
        
        
          Get your current MAC address <a href="#get-your-current-mac-address">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Hold down <code>option</code> key, click your wifi icon:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/2019-12-11-bash-basics-01.jpg" alt="wifi details"></p>
      <h3 id="figure-out-which-adapter-your-machine-is-using-to-connect-to-the-wifi">
        
        
          Figure out which adapter your machine is using to connect to the wifi <a href="#figure-out-which-adapter-your-machine-is-using-to-connect-to-the-wifi">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>ifconfig en0 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># one of these will return a MAC address that matches</span>
ifconfig en1 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># the value you saw when looking for your current</span>
ifconfig en2 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># mac address.</span>
ifconfig en3 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># Keep incrementing the `en0` value until you run out of </span>
                          <span># devices</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s me working through the list:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/2019-12-11-basic-bash-02.jpg" alt="checking all ports"></p>

<p>For me, the very first result matched the MAC address I got from <code>option+click</code>ing the wifi network.</p>

<p>That means I’ll be using <code>en0</code> as the [E]ther[N]et adapter I’ll update shortly.</p>

<!--more-->
      <h3 id="generate-a-random-new-mac-address">
        
        
          Generate a random new MAC address <a href="#generate-a-random-new-mac-address">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>A MAC address has a standard-looking format.</p>

<p>It looks like six blocks of two digits, which happen to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal representations</a> of <code>00000000</code> through <code>11111111</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s some randomly-generated MAC addresses:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>e2:81:f6:f6:f9:e8
1f:24:37:47:d6:25
03:20:3f:48:46:ad
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To generate a random string of characters that produces a <a href="http://sqa.fyicenter.com/1000208_MAC_Address_Validator.html">valid MAC address</a>, run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/.$//'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And boom. You’ve got a MAC address.</p>

<p>Now we need to update our current MAC address to this new MAC address.</p>
      <h3 id="set-current-mac-address-to-temporarynew-mac-address">
        
        
          Set current mac address to temporary/new MAC address <a href="#set-current-mac-address-to-temporarynew-mac-address">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>You can use <code>ifconfig</code> to set the ethernet address (is that interchangable with the MAC address?) to the randomly-generated string you got from the <code>openssl</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># you need to sudo it, unfortunately. No quotes around the mac address</span>
<span>sudo </span>ifconfig en0 ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

<span># here's the full command</span>
<span>sudo </span>ifconfig en0 ether 8c:85:90:5a:79:56
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And with that, you can re-connect to the wifi network, and it <em>should</em> recognize you as a new device, and let you onto the network.</p>

<p>Here’s what I first ended up with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"Hi! lets change our mac address."</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Step 1: hold down option key, click wifi logo. Note the mac address"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Step 2: click 'disconnect from network' "</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Step 3: note which ethernet adapter lines up with the mac address you just saw"</span>

<span>en0</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en0 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en1</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en1 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en2</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en2 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en3</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en3 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en4</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en4 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en5</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en5 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

<span>echo </span>en0 is: <span>$en0</span>
<span>echo </span>en1 is: <span>$en1</span>
<span>echo </span>en2 is: <span>$en2</span>
<span>echo </span>en3 is: <span>$en3</span>
<span>echo </span>en4 is: <span>$en4</span>
<span>echo </span>en5 is: <span>$en5</span>

<span>read</span> <span>-p</span> <span>'Step 4: Enter which ethernet device lined up with the given mac address: '</span> ether_adapter
<span>export </span><span>ether_adapter</span><span>=</span><span>$ether_adapter</span>

<span>mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> openssl rand <span>-hex</span> 6 | <span>sed</span> <span>"s/</span><span>\(</span><span>..</span><span>\)</span><span>/</span><span>\1</span><span>:/g; s/.</span><span>$/</span><span>/"</span> <span>)</span>
<span>export </span><span>mac</span><span>=</span><span>$mac</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"btw, here's the new mac address we're going to use: </span><span>$mac</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"OK, we will change the mac address associated with: </span><span>$ether_adapter</span><span>"</span>

<span>old_mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"The old value was: </span><span>$old_mac</span><span>"</span>

<span>sudo </span>ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> ether <span>$mac</span>

<span>new_mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"The new value is: </span><span>$new_mac</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"go ahead and re-connect to the wifi. You should be able to join the network."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Believe it or not, this script was far from perfect.</p>

<p>First off, not all randomly-generated mac addresses are valid, even though they were passing an online mac address validator I was testing against. <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/536221">AskUbuntu</a> nicely shared what was going on.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to deal with manually building a valid MAC address; I just noticed that about 2 out of 3 attempts to change my mac address, using the above script, the MAC address didn’t change.</p>

<p>So, my next version of this script pulls the <code>generate mac address</code> and <code>set current mac address to generated mac address</code> steps into a function, and keeps calling the function until the mac address has changed.</p>

<p>Why be elegant and precise when you can brute force a crappy solution?</p>

<p>Here’s my finished “solution”:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span># skipping some lines</span>
<span>read</span> <span>-p</span> <span>'Step 4: Which device lined up would you like to change? (hit return for en0) '</span> ether_adapter

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>-z</span> <span>$ether_adapter</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then
  </span><span>ether_adapter</span><span>=</span><span>"en0"</span>
<span>fi

</span><span>export </span><span>ether_adapter</span><span>=</span><span>$ether_adapter</span>

  <span>mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> openssl rand <span>-hex</span> 6 | <span>sed</span> <span>"s/</span><span>\(</span><span>..</span><span>\)</span><span>/</span><span>\1</span><span>:/g; s/./0/2; s/.</span><span>$/</span><span>/"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>export </span><span>mac</span><span>=</span><span>$mac</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"OK, we will change the mac address associated with: </span><span>$ether_adapter</span><span>"</span>

  <span>old_mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

  <span>echo</span> <span>"The old value was: </span><span>$old_mac</span><span>"</span>
  <span>sudo </span>ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> ether <span>$mac</span>

  <span>new_mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"The new value is: </span><span>$new_mac</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>$new_mac</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>$old_mac</span>

<span>while</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$new_mac</span><span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"</span><span>$old_mac</span><span>"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>do
  </span><span>echo</span> <span>"not the same"</span>
  generate_and_set_new_mac_address
<span>done

</span><span>echo</span> <span>"go ahead and re-connect to the wifi. You should be able to join the network."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and this seems to work pretty well:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/2019-12-17-bash_script_success.jpg" alt="success"></p>

<p>I hope that in the near future, I’ll look at this bash script and have many ways to improve it. For now, it’ll do the trick.</p>

          Feb 9, 2021 update <a href="#feb-9-2021-update">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Following <a href="https://twitter.com/serent/status/1359208380435361792">this tweet</a> by <code>@serent</code>, I updated the script a little. To generate a valid MAC address:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@@ -160,7 +162,7 @@</span> fi
 export ether_adapter=$ether_adapter

 generate_and_set_new_mac_address() {
<span>-  mac=$( openssl rand -hex 6 | sed "s/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/.$//" )
</span><span>+  mac=$( openssl rand -hex 6 | sed "s/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/./0/2; s/.$//")
</span>   export mac=$mac
   echo "OK, we will change the mac address associated with: $ether_adapter"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s other pain points in the script. I’ll fix them at some point.</p>

    <article>
  
  <p>Nov 11, 2020</p>
  <p>Some time ago I wrote a reddit comment explaining the benefits of IDEs.
Folks refer to it from time to time, so I decided to edit it into an article form.
Enjoy!</p>
<p>I think I have a rather balanced perspective on IDEs.
I used to be a heavy Emacs user (<a href="https://github.com/matklad/.emacs.d/tree/475de5db99f8729c57fed7e6fde4cd06f5ccb62f">old config</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/d555642a5a9e4e8b0ca0c77f188ffd976f06327c/home/.emacs.d/init.el">current config</a>).
I worked at JetBrains on <a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust">IntelliJ Rust</a> for several years.
I used evil mode and vim for a bit, and tried tmux and kakoune.
Nowadays, I primarily use VS Code to develop <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/">rust-analyzer</a>: LSP-based editor-independent IDE backend for Rust.</p>
<p>I will be focusing on IntelliJ family of IDEs, as I believe these are the most advanced IDEs today.</p>
<p>The main distinguishing feature of IntelliJ is semantic understanding of code.
The core of IntelliJ is a compiler which parses, type checks and otherwise understands your code.
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PostIntelliJ.html">PostIntelliJ</a> is the canonical post about this.
That article also refutes the claim that “Smalltalk IDE is the best we’ve ever had”.</p>
<p>Note that “semantic understanding” is mostly unrelated to the traditional interpretation of “IDE” as <em>Integrated</em> Development Environment.
I personally don’t feel that the “Integrated” bit is all that important.
I commit&amp;push from the command line using Julia scripts, rebase in magit, and do code reviews in a browser.
If anything, there’s an ample room for improvement for the integration bits.
For me, <strong>I</strong> in “<strong>I</strong>DE” stands for “intelligent”, smart.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this terminology difference.
I feel it is a common source of misunderstanding.
“Unix and command line can do anything an IDE can do” is correct about integrated bits, but is wrong about semantical bits.</p>
<p>Traditional editors like Vim or Emacs understand programming languages very approximately, mostly via regular expressions.
For me, this feels very wrong.
It’s <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454">common knowledge</a> that HTML shall not be parsed with regex.
Yet this is exactly what happens every time one does <code>vim index.html</code> with syntax highlighting on.
I sincerely think that almost every syntax highlighter out there is wrong and we, as an industry, should do better.
I also understand that this is a tall order, but I do my best to change the status quo here :-)</p>
<p>These are mostly theoretical concerns though.
The question is, does semantic understanding help in practice?
I am pretty sure that it is non-essential, especially for smaller code bases.
My <a href="https://github.com/matklad/rustraytracer">first non-trivial Rust program</a> was written in Emacs, and it was fine.
Most of rust-analyzer was written using pretty spartan IDE support.
There are a lot of insanely-productive folks who are like “sometimes I type vim, sometimes I type vi, they are sufficiently similar”.
Regex-based syntax highlighting and regex based fuzzy symbol search (<a href="https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags">ctags</a>) get you a really long way.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that features unlocked by deep understanding of the language help.
The funniest example here is extend/shrink selection.
This features allows you to extend current selection to the next encompassing syntactic construct.
It’s the simplest feature a PostIntelliJ IDE can have, it only needs the parser.
But it is sooo helpful when writing code, it just completely blows vim’s text objects out of the water, especially when combined with multiple cursors.
In a sense, this is structural editing which works for text.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/98809232-80e3db00-241d-11eb-883a-5aece9a1dbfc.gif" alt="98809232 80e3db00 241d 11eb 883a 5aece9a1dbfc">
</p>
</div>
<p>If you add further knowledge of the language into a mix, you’ll get the “assists” system: micro-refactoring which available in a particular context.
For example, is the cursor is on a comma in a list of function arguments, you can <span><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd></span> &gt; “swap arguments”, and the order of arguments will be changed in the declaration and on various call-sites as well.
(See <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/09/28/how-to-make-a-light-bulb.html">this post</a> to learn how assists are implemented).</p>
<p>These small dwim things add up to a really nice editing experience, where you mostly express the intention, and the IDE deals with boring syntactical aspects of code editing:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/98812121-37e25580-2422-11eb-8541-2c5a32926845.gif" alt="98812121 37e25580 2422 11eb 8541 2c5a32926845">
</p>
</div>
<p>For larger projects, complex refactors are a huge time-saver.
Doing project-wide renames and signature changes automatically and without thinking reduces the cost of keeping the code clean.</p>
<p>Another transformative experience is navigation.
In IntelliJ, you generally don’t “open a file”.
Instead you think directly in terms of functions, types and modules, and navigate to those using file structure, goto symbol, to do definition/implementation/type, etc:</p>

<p>When I used Emacs, I really admired its buffer management facilities, because they made opening a file I want a breeze.
When I later switched to IntelliJ, I stopped thinking in terms of a set of opened files altogether.
I disabled editor tabs and started using editor splits less often — you don’t need bookmarks if you can just find things.</p>
<p>For me, there’s one aspect of traditional editors which is typically not matched in IDEs out of the box — basic cursor motion.
Using arrow keys for that is slow and flow-breaking, because one needs to move the hand from the home row.
Even Emacs' horrific <kbd>C-p</kbd>, <kbd>C-n</kbd> are a big improvement, and vim’s <kbd>hjkl</kbd> go even further.
One fix here is to configure each tool to use your favorite shortcuts, but this is a whack-a-mole game.
What I do is remapping <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> to act as an extra modifier, such that <kbd>ijkl</kbd> <strong>are</strong> arrow keys.
(There are also keyboards with <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">hardware</a> <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">support</a> for this).
This works in all applications the same way.
Easy motion / ace jump functionality for jumping to any visible character is also handy, and usually is available <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9803-acejump-lite">via</a> <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucax88x.codeacejumper">a plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Recent advancements with LSP protocol promise to give one the best of both worlds, where semantic-aware backend and light-weight editor frontend are different processes, which can be mixed and matched.
This is nice in theory, but not as nice in practice as IntelliJ yet, mostly because IntelliJ is way more polished.</p>
<p>To give a simple example, in IntelliJ for “go to symbol by fuzzy name” functionality, I can filter the search scope by:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is this my code/code from a dependency?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is this test/production code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is a symbol a type-like thing, or a method-like thing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>path to the module where the symbol is defined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>VS Code and LSP simply do not have capabilities for such filters yet, they have to be bolted on using hacks.
Support for LSP in other editors is even more hit-and-miss.</p>
<p>LSP did achieve a significant breakthrough — it made people care about implementing IDE backends.
Experience shows that re-engineering an existing compiler to power an IDE is often impossible, or isomorphic to a rewrite.
How a compiler talks to an editor is the smaller problem.
The hard one is building a compiler that can do IDE stuff in the first place.
Check out <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">this post</a> for some of the technical details.
Starting with this use-case in mind saves a lot of effort down the road.</p>
<p>This I think is a big deal.
I hypothesize that the reason why IDEs do not completely dominate tooling landscape is the lack of good IDE backends.</p>
<p>If we look at the set of languages fairly popular recently, a significant fraction of them is dynamically typed: PHP, JavaScript, Python, Ruby.
The helpfulness of an IDE for dynamically typed languages is severely limited: while approximations and heuristics can get you a long way, you still need humans in the loop to verify IDE’s guesses.</p>
<p>There’s C++, but its templates are effectively dynamically typed, with exactly the same issues (and a very complex base language to boot).
Curiously, C looks like a language for which implementing a near-perfect IDE is pretty feasible.
I don’t know why it didn’t happen before CLion.</p>
<p>This leaves C# and Java.
Indeed, these languages are dominated by IDEs.
There’s a saying that you can’t write Java without an IDE.
I think it gets the causation direction backwards: Java is one of the few languages for which it is possible to implement a great IDE without great pain.
Supporting evidence here is Go.
According to <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2019-results#TOC_5.">survey results</a>, text editors are stably declining in popularity in favor of IDEs.</p>
<p>I think this is because Go actually has good IDEs.
This is possible because the language is sufficiently statically typed for an IDE to be a marked improvement.
Additionally, the language is very simple, so the amount of work you need to put in to make a decent IDE is much lower than for other languages.
If you have something like JavaScript…​
Well, you first need to build an alternative language for which you can actually implement an IDE (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>) and only then you can build the IDE itself (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">VS Code</a>).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>Dear Marie,</p>
<p>I am one of a handful of women engineers at my company and I have been interviewing 1-2 candidates per week for the past several months. Since I started interviewing, we have only hired white or Asian men.</p>
<p>Bringing in underrepresented identities to my workplace is important to me, and leadership at my company constantly says they value ‘Diversity and Inclusion’. I’ve offered ideas on how to attract a wider group of candidates, but I don’t feel like I am heard or taken seriously. I’m exhausted being part of the interview team with the results we have. At this point, I only want to interview underrepresented candidates, but that seems inappropriate to ask for.</p>
<p>Am I complicit in a racist, sexist system? How can I push for change and preserve my energy?</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- question -->

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Interviewing one or two candidates per week for months sounds absolutely exhausting. It’s no wonder that you’re tired and burnt out—especially if it seems like your company isn’t actually hiring anyone outside their established pattern, despite their avowed dedication to diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>I have found conducting interviews to be difficult and energy-consuming work, particularly if you are invested in treating candidates equitably and with empathy.</strong> It’s not just that the hour-long calendar block in the middle of the day, it’s also:</p>
<ul>
<li>preparing for the interview ahead of time, making sure you have all the resources you need and your environment is set up.</li>
<li>being deeply focused during the interview, paying attention to the smallest of interactions to discern signals (of varying reliability) about a person’s areas of technical expertise and approach to work and collaboration.</li>
<li>responding to candidates on the fly, figuring out the right balance of giving them a hint when they’re stuck and seeing how they solve a problem themselves, and ensuring they have an excellent experience with your company.</li>
<li>writing up feedback afterwards and deliberating your evaluation and whether you’ve let unconscious bias influence you and if your feedback is well-calibrated with the rest of the hiring group so that you’re not consistently scoring everyone higher or lower than the average.</li>
<li>participating in decisions and conversations around interviewing as a whole, and how to make it more equitable and inclusive.</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like you aren’t hiring specifically for roles on your immediate team, but rather part of a group of interviewers who support hiring across the whole company. This structure makes sense for larger organizations who have a steady stream of open roles. If everyone helps out a little bit all the time, then no one team’s productivity is completely sunk when they need to hire.</p>
<p>The downside, of course, is that the hiring never really stops. <strong>You don’t get to celebrate by welcoming your new teammate; you just keep interviewing. And interviewing. And interviewing.</strong></p>
<p>At one company, I completed over 100 technical interviews in about two years. I had prided myself on being a very good interviewer, in part because of all the practice. By the end, I was completely miserable and I hated everything about it. I couldn’t convince myself to care about candidates anymore and I was having trouble focusing and giving them my full attention. So, I stopped interviewing. And it was <em>such</em> a relief. It wasn’t even necessarily the time back that I cared about; it was <strong>letting go of the immense responsibility of contributing to hiring decisions, but with so little authority to change anything.</strong></p>
<p>Consider a few of these options, and what each one feels like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if you reduced your availability to one interview a week?</li>
<li>What if you reduced your availability to two interviews a month?</li>
<li>What if you stopped interviewing for a month?</li>
<li>What if you stopped interviewing for a quarter?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Did you feel a sense of relief or joy when you imagined those? Which ones feels the most like what you need right now?</strong></p>
<p>You say that you’ve offered ideas about how to improve your hiring practices and that you <em>“don’t feel like I am heard or taken seriously.”</em> I am guessing that you are not a manager, or any other person who makes the final call on hiring decisions. If you were, my advice would be very different<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But if I’m right, your main job responsibility is probably to write, release, and maintain software—<em>not</em> to build a team or manage their collective effectiveness. A manager <em>must</em> hire at some point if they want to ensure their team has the right balance of expertise and experience. You probably help out managers at your company by giving them quality feedback about the people they are considering hiring; but it’s unlikely that your annual evaluation centers on your participation in the hiring process or the hiring outcomes at your company.</p>
<p>So… take a break. Don’t stop entirely or forever; you are doing the important work of advocating for inclusion and equity, I would hate for you to give that up entirely. But it sounds like what you’re doing now isn’t working the way you had hoped, and you’re too tired to imagine a bigger and bolder approach right now.</p>
<p><strong>I have quipped that my main career goal is to do such outstanding work that I can be a complete and total pain in the ass about the things that truly matter, like accessibility and inclusion and equity.</strong> That doesn’t mean that I’m waiting until I’ve “arrived” to advocate for what I know is right and to put my privilege to use. It means that I don’t waste my battles on inconsequential things and I try to make myself valuable enough that I’m harder to push out when I do dig in my heels.</p>
<p>But in order to spend social capital, you have to build it up first—and for you, that might mean giving up interviewing for a bit, focusing on your main job responsibility and building relationships with your coworkers, then coming back with a fresh perspective, renewed energy, and a group of like-minded peers with a common goal of improving the hiring process.</p>
<p>Assuming that you don’t have the authority to make a hire/no-hire decision or to revamp your recruiting process, you’re a bit limited in what you can do on your own. <strong>But there is strength in numbers, and it’s harder to ignore a group.</strong> See if you can find or organize a few people who <em>also</em> care about diversity and inclusion in recruiting and hiring. It doesn’t have to be anything formal<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>, it can just be three people who all +1 each other’s ideas and bring up the same important questions again and again.</p>
<p><strong>You also asked: <em>“Am I complicit in a racist, sexist system?”</em> I’m not sure that I can answer that one for you.</strong> You know your situation much better than I do; if that’s a concern that keeps coming up for you, sit with it. It may be that there’s something you need to do that you haven’t yet.</p>
<p>I think you would definitely be complicit if you stopped raising concerns about inclusion entirely; if you ignored or minimized the concerns raised by other marginalized people because it makes you feel uncomfortable about your own choices or privilege; or if you had the authority to make a change for the better and you didn’t use it.</p>
<p><strong>If you do come to the conclusion that you have not been living up to your values and have instead prioritized your comfort or advancement over the equity of all—welcome to the club.</strong> We mess up a lot, and we learn with empathy and gratitude for the people who corrected us. That’s another benefit to finding some peers who can advocate alongside you—you’ll each have areas of insight the others won’t and you can teach each other.</p>
<p>I hope that you’re able to take a break from interviewing. I hope that when you’re ready to resume, it’s because you’re genuinely excited to have some influence over hiring at your company and you feel equipped to push for practices that you know are worthwhile<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. I hope you find support from other engineers who care about inclusion. I hope your company figures out a way to stop using whatever metrics they love that so consistently undervalue Black and Indigenous people, Hispanic/Latinx people, women and people with other minoritized genders, disabled people, LGTBQ+ people, and those who span more than one of those communities.</p>
<p>In short: I hope you get good rest, and that rest fuels you for another round. There is much work to be done. Let’s do it together. 💖</p>
<p>With so much warmth,<br>
Marie</p>

Why freemium? I think it's how the little guys can win against market leaders.</p><p>Basically, it's how you kill a unicorn.</p><p>Notion, Figma, Canva, Mailchimp, and Segment. What do all of these platforms have in common, besides being category leaders? Each one has unseated the previous category leaders with less money and smaller teams. Each has also opted for a product led growth strategy that is fueled by product virality and an innovative pricing strategy.</p><p>But let's back up. How did we get here?</p><p>The year is 2012 and the preeminent name in design isn't Sketch or Figma - it's Adobe. 2012 era Adobe is a much different beast to where we are now. There was no real SaaS model and licenses were hundreds of dollars each, locked to a machine, and didn't get upgrades. Still, Adobe is unequivocally the category leader. But in just a few years, that would all change due to an enterprising young entrepreneur and her new business model.</p><p>Canva launched in 2012 and spread like wildfire. In 3 years, the company was able to accumulate accumulated 10 million users, with almost 1 million coming in the first year alone. By the next year, they had 17 thousand videos about their product.</p><p>This kind of fervent user adoption is the stuff of legend. I started hearing about Canva around that time. My then-girlfriend (now wife) had put together a project and it looked much better than anything I could knock out in Photoshop or Illustrator. She mentioned it was not only really easy to use, but it was free! At the time I think I was still bouncing from Adobe license to Adobe license, each of which was half a month's rent, so I was blown away.</p><p>Then I started seeing it everywhere. It was being used for school projects, large advertising campaigns, and was the first recommendation in online groups whenever someone needed a design tool.</p><p>That space used to be occupied by Adobe, but in a matter of a few years, they were being overtaken in the B2C and even a bit in the B2B space by a brand new company with a limited amount of funding.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-768x427.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1.png 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-768x427.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1.png 1215w"></figure><figure><img width="1024" height="572" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-768x429.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2.png 1227w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-768x429.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2.png 1227w"></figure><p>Meanwhile, another company, Sketch, was eating away at their market share by offering design-focused tools for modern internet companies. Adobe had Photoshop and Illustrator, neither of which was purpose-built for the internet and both of which were expensive af. Adobe XD wasn't quite production-ready at that point, so Sketch was able to make inroads by offering a lower-priced license for its software.</p><p>Out of left-field comes the Canva of professional design tools: Figma.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="565" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-768x423.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-768x423.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3.png 1255w"></figure><p>Figma quickly overtakes Sketch by offering a few unique features and an unbeatable pricing model. Freemium, with a twist.</p><p>Figma, like Canva before it, quickly discovered the power that a free product with shareable outputs offers. Users create content with the tool, share the content and then inevitably get asked how it was made. Of course, the user is both happy to share and give a positive recommendation since the output content is being appreciated, and the platform gains another user.</p><p>A couple points to understand about the shiny world of marketing:</p><ul><li>Recommendations from trusted people always lead to higher conversion rates. It's easy to recommend free things since the only exchange is time.</li><li>Backlinks are everything, still. Google hasn't cracked how to build page authority without backlinks and having them everywhere, attached with positive recommendations and high user dwell time once a user clicks a link, is seen as a positive signal.</li><li>Creating content in the app means content can be shared outside the app. That's a simple growth mechanism that can be leveraged mightily once a certain user volume has been hit.</li><li>Finally, email is the best marketing channel still. Freemium platforms exchange email addresses for access and make lead generation a snap.</li></ul><p>So Adobe now is taking fire from all sides and they eventually pivot to a cloud-based subscription model while also focusing all their efforts upmarket on the professional landscape, effectively ceding their B2C audience to Canva.</p><p><em>Quick note: There are many other factors that go into making a platform successful, from the founder to tech to the support. Pricing is just one of the pieces.</em></p><h2><strong>How Freemium really works</strong></h2><p>The common misconception with freemium is that it’s an easy way to not generate any revenue. How many stories have you heard about independent projects that have been worked on for years, only to launch with only a few dollars in revenue, followed by months of slogging before eventually shutting down. That’s very likely&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a pricing problem, but a positioning problem. You need to position your product in front of the right audiences and the price becomes a natural fit for your expansion strategy.</p><p>In reality, there are a number of different ingredients in the recipe you need to nail before you can actually execute a freemium strategy effectively. You don’t need a team of hundreds of people, but it does help to lay out the strategy ahead of time.</p><p>Let's break out the different factors involved in setting up a freemium plan.</p><ul><li>Pricing that scales with usage</li><li>Shareable content</li><li>In-app upsells</li><li>Massive market opportunity</li><li>Pricing innovation on the primary value</li></ul><p>First, if you are missing even one of these, it might not be the pricing strategy for you. Each part is key in building out a converting freemium funnel.</p><p><strong>Pricing that scales with usage</strong></p><p>If a user wants to dip a toe in and play around with your platform, they can do that at zero cost (outside of an email address). That’s the basic premise of a freemium plan, but what happens when a user is converted and wants to expand their usage?</p><p>Your pricing should accommodate that natural urge and your product should gracefully allow them to expand their usage with as few barriers as possible.</p><p><strong>In-app upsells aka feature gating</strong></p><p>You need to rope off some of your app so there’s a reason to pay! However, you should charge based on either&nbsp;<strong>secondary user value or</strong>&nbsp;expanding the primary user value, but ideally both.</p><p>Let me explain. Google Analytics made analytics free and accessible to everyone. They charge based on primary user value, but only if you want to expand to a much higher tier of usage. For 99% of people, it will always be free.</p><p>That’s great, but really they only offer expanding their primary user value (analytics) as an upsell. Profitwell, one of my favorite companies utilizing this technique, charges entirely on secondary user value. They offer Profitwell Retain, a dunning service, on top of their analytics. Analytics are totally free. After all, you already have all your financial information integrated into it and onboarded your team.</p><p>Canva however offers all that and more. They let users expand their primary usage through additional templates, but also access other tools like scheduling posts on social media once you upgrade. Why pay 12K a year for Hootsuite when you can just upgrade Canva?</p><figure><img width="1024" height="673" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1536x1009.jpg 1536w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-2048x1346.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1536x1009.jpg 1536w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-2048x1346.jpg 2048w"></figure><p>With each of these product incentives, users are motioned into the next stage of the tool.</p><p><strong>Shareable content</strong></p><p>This could be considered a growth loop, since we’re building in some type of publishing into the platform so users can share links. Our goal with shareable content is to increase the k factor of a user, effectively turning a free user into a marketing machine. Every time they create content in the app and share it externally, you have another potential opportunity for user acquisition which helps balance out the slightly lower conversion rate you’ll see with a freemium plan.</p><p>You can do this with reports, tables, images, videos, etc. If it can be shared inside a team, you should enable it to be published from your platform.</p><p><strong>Massive Market Opportunity</strong></p><p>Freemium works best when you can boil the ocean. No really, let it rip. The ocean should be a massive existing user base or the early signs of a large user base. You will need the volume to make it work with freemium pricing. Here are the TAMs for a few of the examples.</p><ul><li>Canva: Anyone that needs to create images.</li><li>Profitwell: Anyone that wants to know their businesses metrics</li><li>Google Optimize: Anyone that wants to test anything on their site.</li><li>Microsoft Teams: Anyone that uses Slack. 😉</li></ul><p>Each of these audience segments is huge and represents uniquely large opportunities. Freemium pricing becomes much more difficult to pull off once you have to compete for a small audience with specific needs. You want to create a product that will work with 90% of users.</p><p><strong>Pricing Innovation on Primary Value</strong></p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>A competitive advantage that can’t be innovated against. This is the most important point. How does Slack compete with Teams when users have Teams included in their subscription? How does Baremetrics compete with Profitwell when most of what Baremetrics offered is free with Profitwell?</p><p>Well...they don’t. Baremetrics sold. Slack sold. You can’t compete against freemium when you’re able to offer the primary value for free. The existing market leaders can’t match your pricing without giving up millions in recurring revenue and they’re not going to do that.</p><p>That’s how you beat Adobe or fill-in-the-blank industry behemoth.</p><p>Create a great competitor (the hardest part), offer the primary value for free, then monetize on expanding that primary value or offer a secondary value.</p><h2><strong>I want to be free</strong></h2><p>So I'm putting my money where my mouth is. I'm switching over all my projects to freemium.</p><p>As of today:</p><ul><li><a href="http://snazzy.ai/">Snazzy.ai</a>, content marketing powered by GPT-3, now has a free tier</li><li><a href="http://ga-insights.com/">GA-Insights.com</a>, all your ad networks into Slack, has a free tier being built out</li><li><a href="http://weld.ai/">Weld.ai</a>, in beta as a Supermetrics alternative, will now be completely free at launch.</li></ul><p>The riskiest part of a freemium pricing tier as a bootstrapped founder is getting the volume you need to make up any initial drop in conversion rate.</p><h2><strong>Reference: The market leaders (and the victims)</strong></h2><ul><li>Profitwell: Baremetrics, Chartmogul</li><li>Canva: Photoshop, Illustrator, Word</li><li>Google Optimize: Optimizely, VWO</li><li>Microsoft Teams: Slack</li><li>Figma: Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch Invision</li></ul><p>Early …</p></div></article></div>

    <p>Currently your Arduino can only beep like a microwave oven. Mozzi brings
your Arduino to life by allowing it to produce much more complex and interesting growls, sweeps and chorusing atmospherics. These sounds can be quickly and easily constructed from familiar synthesis units like oscillators, delays, filters and envelopes.</p>

<p>You can use Mozzi to generate algorithmic music for an installation or
performance, or make interactive sonifications of sensors, on a small, modular and super cheap Arduino, without the need for additional shields, message passing or external synths.</p>

<p>Here are some sounds of the example sketches which come with Mozzi:</p>

<h2 id="weird-things">Weird things</h2>

<h3 id="avr">AVR</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While Mozzi is running, calling <code>delay()</code>, <code>delayMicroseconds()</code>, or other functions which wait or cycle through loops can cause audio glitches.
Mozzi provides <code>EventDelay()</code> for scheduling instead of <code>delay()</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>analogRead()</code> is replaced by <code>mozziAnalogRead()</code>, which works in the background instead of blocking the processor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mozzi interferes with <code>analogWrite()</code>.  In <code>STANDARD</code> and <code>STANDARD_PLUS</code> audio modes, Mozzi takes over Timer1 (pins 9 and 10), but you can use the Timer2 pins, 3 and 11 (your board may differ).  In <code>HIFI</code> mode, Mozzi uses Timer1 (or Timer4 on some boards), and Timer2, so pins 3 and 11 are also out.  If you need <code>analogWrite()</code>, you can do PWM output on any digital pins using the technique in <em>Mozzi&gt;examples&gt;11.Communication&gt;Sinewave_PWM_pins_HIFI</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The timers can be made available with <code>stopMozzi()</code>, which stops audio interrupts, until you call <code>startMozzi()</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stm32duino">STM32(duino)</h3>
<p>port by Thomas Friedrichsmeier</p>

<p>Compiles for and runs on a STM32F103C8T6 blue pill board, with a bunch of caveats (see below), i.e. on a board <em>without</em> a
real DAC. Should probably run on any other board supported by <a href="https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32">STM32duino</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will need a very recent (12/2017) checkout of the Arduino_STM32 repository, otherwise compilation will fail.</li>
  <li>Audio output is to pin PB8, by default (HIFI-mode: PB8 and PB9)</li>
  <li>If you want to use MIDI, be sure to replace “MIDI_CREATE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE()” with “MIDI_CREATE_INSTANCE(HardwareSerial, Serial1, MIDI)” (or Serial2)</li>
  <li>Timers 4 (PWM output), and 2 (audio rate) are used by default.</li>
  <li>The STM32-specific options (pins, timers) can be configured in AudioConfigSTM32.h</li>
  <li>Default audio resolution is currently set to 10 bits, which yields 70khZ PWM frequency on a 72MHz CPU. HIFI mode is 2*7bits at up to 560Khz (but limited to 5 times audio rate)</li>
  <li>HIFI_MODE did not get much testing</li>
  <li>STEREO_HACK not yet implemented (although that should not be too hard to do)</li>
  <li>AUDIO_INPUT is completely untested (but implemented in theory)</li>
  <li>Note that AUDIO_INPUT and mozziAnalogRead() return values in the STM32’s full ADC resolution of 0-4095 rather than AVR’s 0-1023.</li>
  <li>twi_nonblock is not ported</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="teensy-3031323435lc">Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2/3.4/3.5/LC</h3>

<p>Extra libraries required for use withTeensy 3.*:<br>
These are included in the standard Teensyduino install unless you explicitly disable them</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/loglow/IntervalTimer">Timer library</a> for Teensy 3.* by Daniel Gilbert</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pedvide/ADC">ADC library</a> by Pedro Villanueva</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the differences for Teensy 3.* which will affect users include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2 audio output is on pin A14/DAC, in STANDARD or STANDARD_PLUS audio modes. These modes are identical on Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2, as the output is via DAC rather than PWM.</li>
  <li>Output is 12 bits in STANDARD and STANDARD_PLUS modes, up from nearly 9 bits for Atmel based boards. HIFI audio, which works by summing two output pins, is not available on Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2.</li>
  <li><code>#include &lt;ADC.h&gt;</code> is required at the top of every Teensy 3 sketch.</li>
  <li>The examples come with this commented out, for Arduino compatibility.</li>
  <li>Serial baud rate for monitoring in the IDE needs to be set to 9600 to work with Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2. This slow rate can cause audio glitches.</li>
  <li>twi_nonblock code by Marije Baalman for non-blocking I2C is not compatible with Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="esp8266">ESP8266</h3>
<p>port by Thomas Friedrichsmeier</p>

<ul>
  <li>Since flash memory is not built into the ESP8266, but connected, externally, it is much too slow for keeping wave tables, audio samples, etc. Instead, these are kept in RAM on this platform.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous analog reads are not implemented. <code>mozziAnalogRead()</code> relays to <code>analogRead()</code>.</li>
  <li>AUDIO_INPUT is not implemented.</li>
  <li>twi_nonblock is not ported</li>
  <li>Several audio output modes exist, the default being PDM_VIA_SERIAL (configurable in AudioConfigESP.h):
    <ul>
      <li>PDM_VIA_SERIAL: Output is coded using pulse density modulation, and sent via GPIO2 (Serial1 TX).
        <ul>
          <li>This output mode uses timer1 for queuing audio sample, so that timer is not available for other uses.</li>
          <li>Note that this mode has slightly lower effective analog output range than PDM_VIA_I2S, due to start/stop bits being added to the output stream.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PDM_VIA_I2S: Output is coded using pulse density modulation, and sent via the I2S pins. The I2S data out pin (which is also “RX”) will have the output, but <em>all</em> I2S output pins (RX, GPIO2 and GPIO15) will be
affected. Mozzi tries to set GPIO2 and GPIO15 to input mode, and <em>at the time of this writing</em>, this allows I2S output on RX even on boards such as the ESP01 (where GPIO15 is tied to Gnd). However, it seems safest to
assume that this mode may not be useable on boards where GPIO2 or GPIO15 are not available as output pins.</li>
      <li>EXTERNAL_DAC_VIA_I2S: Output is sent to an external DAC (such as a PT8211), digitally coded. This is the only mode that supports STEREO_HACK. It also need the least processing power.
        <ul>
          <li>TODO: Untested!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There is no “HIFI_MODE” in addition to the above output options. For high quality output, either use an external DAC, or increase the PDM_RESOLUTION value.</li>
  <li>Note that the ESP8266 pins can output less current than the other supported CPUs. The maximum is 12mA, with a recommendation to stay below 6mA.
    <ul>
      <li>WHEN CONNECTING A HEADPHONE, DIRECTLY, USE APPROPRIATE CURRENT LIMITING RESISTORS (&gt;= 500Ohms).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<p>
The concepts I’m going to present in this article were featured in a
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/lisprepl/">presentation at FOSDEM 2021</a>.  The video demonstrates a rather novel paradigm how
to think the REPL as a “shell” interface to the machine.
</p>

<p>
In this article I’m going to dive into more in details in the theory, the setup,
as well as more advanced features.
</p>

<p>
Mind the title: this is <i>not</i> about another system shell implemented in Lisp
(such as <a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">scsh</a>, <a href="https://clisp.sourceforge.io/clash.html">clash</a> or <a href="https://github.com/SquircleSpace/shcl">shcl</a>); rather, I tried to approach the problem in the
opposite direction by trying to bring the “shell” to a programming language
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I want to emphasize that while I use <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">Common Lisp</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> as support technology
for my demos, the thesis of this article concerns itself with a new shell
interface paradigm.
</p>

<p>
Should you dislike Emacs or Lisp, never mind: the concept presented here can be
adapted using other (editor) interfaces and other programming languages (but not
all, as I will explain later).

This article is bordering the format of an extensive tutorial and as such it’s
rather long.  The various top sections starting from <a href="#org61b9eeb">SLY: A tour of a most-advanced REPL</a> are mostly independent so feel free to read them in any
order.  (I’ve interlinked them whenever necessary.)

<h2 id="org798c0b2">Challenging the dominating paradigm</h2>

<div id="outline-container-orgd923b32">
<h3 id="orgd923b32">The universal computer usage paradigm, and why traditional shells are poor tools</h3>
<div id="text-orgd923b32">
<p>
What a computer user (and in particular a technically minded user such as a
developer) does on a computer can be understood as one of three actions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Data collection and filtering.</li>
<li>Data visualization (which I also call “inspection” in this article).</li>
<li>Data transformation (which I also call “processing” in this article).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Opening a file or multiple files with a program, say, to play a music album, is
in effect “collection + visualization”.  Shrinking a bunch of photos is
“collection + processing”.
</p>

<p>
I believe that most, if not all our interactions with a computer can be summed
up in those three tasks.
</p>

<p>
More interestingly, there is a feedback loop between collection and
visualization, which is very common when manipulating large bunches of files
from a shell: the user first displays the file list to process, then filters it,
displays the filtered list, re-filters if needed, re-displays it, and so on.
When the file list is finalized, the user can process it and finally visualizes
the result.
</p>

<p>
This feedback loop that’s best represented by this simple diagram:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://ambrevar.xyz/lisp-repl-shell/feedback-loop.png" alt="feedback-loop.png">

<figcaption><span>Figure 1: </span>User interaction feedback loop</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
It turns out that traditional shells are particularly poor interactive tools
to deal with such a feedback loop.
</p>

<p>
To paraphrase the example in <a href="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-transcript.html">Howard’s presentation on piper</a>, typical
“collection + processing” in the shell happens with a pipeline and some control
structures:
</p>

<div>
<pre>for S in $(systemctl --all | grep openstack | sed 's/\.service.*//' | cut -c3-)
do
    systemctl restart $S
done
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the above example, as is customary in the shell, the whole “collection +
processing” step remains a blackbox to the user who can visualize the data only
before and after, but never for the intermediate steps.
</p>

<p>
While we are at it, shell languages from the <code>sh</code> family have poor control
structures, which make simple things like a <code>for</code> loop too cumbersome to write
and riddled with <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls">pitfalls</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgefc6efa">
<h3 id="orgefc6efa">The local minimal of terminals and shells</h3>
<div id="text-orgefc6efa">
<p>
There is a common misconception that terminals and shells are inherently bound
to each other, to the point that there is sometimes a confusion between the
two.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
A terminal, actually a terminal emulator, is a program that <i>visually</i>
emulates the hardware of the 1970s and 1980s, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a>.  These tools
are by definition stuck in the past.
</p>

<p>
(A common misconception is that they are fast.  Ironically, they are not:
emulators emulate the physical properties of the terminal such as the baud
rate, and this limits the speed at which text can be printed.)
</p></li>

<li>A shell is a programming language interpreter.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a> of a sort.
It often embeds interactive features such as a prompt with history support.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Terminals have no reason to continue to be used in my opinion.  Note that this
does not mean we shouldn’t use “textual” interfaces, quite the opposite: textual
data is a bliss to manipulate.  But we can very well manipulate text, along with
other types of data, in something other than a terminal, that is faster,
prettier, more powerful.  (Graphical Emacs is one such example.)
</p>

<p>
In the past I’ve discussed the drawbacks of using a terminal as an interface
(see my article <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/emacs-eshell/index.html">Eshell as a main shell</a>).  I won’t go into the details again, but
allow me to summarize terminal-induced limitations of traditional shells:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Can’t search the outputs.</li>
<li>Can’t interact with output (like opening a path under the cursor).</li>
<li>Can’t copy/paste without a mouse (barring a few hacks).</li>
<li>Can’t navigate the prompts.</li>
<li>Limited colors (barring a few hacks), formatting and rendering is convoluted and
not portable.</li>
<li>Can’t render anything beside text.</li>
<li>Interface toolkits like ncurses can’t render <i>structured</i> widgets (to see what
I mean, try selecting text in an ncurses frame: the selection will grab the
whole line, beyond the frame).</li>
<li>Slow text output.</li>
<li>Poor font support (single size).</li>
<li>No per-pixel elements (e.g. cannot draw a line separator).</li>
<li>Prompts and their output cannot be folded, moved arround, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbadcd2c">
<h3 id="orgbadcd2c">Readline-shells, “go-to scripts” and code composition</h3>
<div id="text-orgbadcd2c">
<p>
I was an <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/emacs-eshell/index.html">Eshell</a> user for a while, then I switched to <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/emacs-eshell-versus-shell/index.html">M-x shell</a>.  Both these
non-terminal-based shells rid me of most of the aforementioned terminal
limitations, since graphical Emacs is a full-blown graphical application.
</p>

<p>
But I still wasn’t satisfied, in particular with the programming language used
by the shell (I’ve used <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a>, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a>, <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish</a> and Eshell).
</p>

<p>
I fancy the Lisp programming languages, so why not use the language I’m most
comfortable with, say Common Lisp?
</p>

<p>
For a long time I tried really hard to stick to the paradigm of what I call the
“readline shells”.  Almost all shells are developed with the idea of running in
a terminal with a <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/readline/">readline</a>-based prompt (if not <code>readline</code>, then a similar
interface).
Even shells as exotic as <a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">scsh</a> or <a href="https://github.com/SquircleSpace/shcl">SHCL</a> are developed with this paradigm in mind.
</p>

<p>
This can only perpetuate the problem: these shells can’t really escape the poor
feedback loop problem I mentioned above because of the lack of interactivity
options in the user interface.  And it is still limited in terms of rendering,
prompt navigation and manipulation, etc.

<div id="outline-container-orgf490899">
<h4 id="orgf490899">“Go-to scripting languages”</h4>
<div id="text-orgf490899">
<p>
Power users and developers alike <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/csvje9/lisp_people_whats_your_goto_language_for_when_you/">fancy having their personal “shell scripts”</a>,
usually short and simple programs that don’t warrant an official distribution,
to perform every day tasks from file processing to shell helpers.
</p>

<p>
These programs can be written in various languages, but unfortunately the choice
must be restricted for practical reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Some languages are “compile-only”, so they won’t take scripts.</li>
<li>Some language interpreters are too slow to start (e.g. above 100ms), which
makes the script prohibitive to use in a tight loop from another script.</li>
<li>Some languages are poor at process management.</li>
<li>Portability may be a concern: if a script requires libraries to be
locally installed, it may hinder its use on another system, like your other
machine or a friend’s computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<code>Bash</code>, <code>POSIX sh</code> and friends address all these points rather well, which
probably explains why they are so ubiquitous (especially the point on
portability).
</p>

<p>
But is it enough a reason to surrender and keep using among the worst
programming languages out there today?
</p>

<p>
I believe it’s high time we challenged the status quo and stepped up in the
shell game.
</p>

<p>
As we will see in the rest of the this article, a required feature for a programming
language to be used as a shell is meta-programmability, or the ability to
redefine at least part of its syntax.  Here Lisp languages perform really well thanks
to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconicity</a> property.
</p>

<p>
Perl or Python are often quoted as good alternatives: It’s certainly more expressive and
less limited than Bash while enjoying a broad ecosystem of libraries.
</p>

<p>
Being a Lisper at heart, I’ve explored the surface of various options:
</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li><a id="orgcd44153"></a><a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">scsh</a>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">scsh</a> is an obvious choice since its name stands for the “Scheme shell”.  While a
Scheme, it seems that it is does not have a broad ecosystem of libraries, which
may make it a bit limiting in practice, or forcing the users to write most of
their own.  (Please correct me if I’m wrong.)
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="org61a9cff"></a>Guile
<p>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile</a> is a good contender: it’s reasonably fast, it has a developing ecosystem,
it has good support for scripting.
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="org905abc9"></a>Gauche
<p>
<a href="https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/index.html">Gauche</a> design goal is to be a fast scripting language.  So it could be ideal for
go-to scripts.
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="orga251c94"></a>TXR
<p>
I am mostly ignorant about <a href="https://nongnu.org/txr/">TXR</a>, so I can only tell from the little I’ve played
with it: it seemed rather slow (maybe in the ballpark of Bash), and I’m unsure
about its ecosystem.
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="orga4c3455"></a>Racket
<p>
At first, Racket startup time around 100ms on my machine seems prohibitive for
scripts.  But maybe there is a way to overcome this.  Any Racketeer around? :)
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="orge4aa10f"></a>Emacs Lisp<br>
<div id="text-orge4aa10f">
<p>
<a href="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-transcript.html">Howard’s piper</a> is very inspiring, but I decided not to go with Elisp which I
believe is too limiting (for now) to be used as a shell language.
</p>

<p>
Eshell cannot separate standard input from standard error.  This is a blocker in
my opinion, until we fix it or implement some other shell in Emacs Lisp.
</p>

<p>
As a scripting language, Emacs Lisp is not a great choice either because <code>emacs
--script</code> can only print to <code>stderr</code>.
</p>

<p>
Besides, as of Emacs 27, Emacs Lisp has poor threading support.  This is quickly
limiting, in particular when it comes to process management.
</p>

<p>
Finally Emacs …</p></div></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Forgiveness is one of the most, if not the most, essential virtue for any civilized society. And yet it seems to be one of the virtues most lacking in America today. Politicians who are disloyal to the party line are censured, despite being faithful to political principle and their conscience. Professionals who years earlier used an inappropriate slur are fired, despite sincere apologies. Public figures whose image is once tarnished by inappropriate behavior are consigned to permanent pariah status, despite their contrition. It seems that once you are out of society’s good graces nowadays, you have little hope of return.</p>



<p>This is a worrying trend because forgiveness is critical to maintaining the integrity of society by providing a way to reintegrate society’s lost sheep. Without the possibility of personal contrition and social rituals of repentance leading to a welcoming of these lost sheep back into the social fold, there is no possibility for social learning and improvement, only perfection or social exile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone makes mistakes. In the pre-internet era, an inopportune remark during the foolishness of teenagehood might have faded with the years as those hurt moved on and those guilty changed their ways. Now, a tonedeaf post on Twitter becomes part of a person’s permanent social record and decades later could lead to the loss of livelihood or opportunity, despite the individual having since renounced their youthful indiscretions.</p>



<p>Because of a lack of forgiveness, people are not allowed to mature, they are not allowed to change. Who you are today is judged by who you were at your worst moment instead of who you have grown to become. This has created social anxiety and fear in the youth of today, and many of the not-so-young as well.</p>



<p>Jesus’ disciple, Peter, once asked Jesus, “Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven” (Matthew 18:21-22, KJV). </p>



<p>The Jews of Peter and Jesus’ time had strict codes of behavior, according to the Law of Moses. Yet they also had well-established means of repentance and forgiveness for those who violated the Law. Here, Jesus reaffirmed the great importance of forgiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the America of today has fewer rules than the Jews under the Law of Moses, we have lost any meaningful mechanism for offenders of our social codes to repent and be reintegrated into respectable society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If processes of receiving forgiveness are not rediscovered in America, the group of social pariahs will only grow and contribute to the sense of hopelessness that leads to the social and political extremism already evident in our country today. After all, if you are an outcast or “deplorable,” what do you have to lose from tearing down the system that excludes you?</p>



<p>But forgiveness is about so much more than being brought back into society’s good graces for big, public mistakes. It is just as much about how we treat each other in our daily interactions. How do we treat the person who cut us off in traffic? How do we react to the person who failed to use our preferred pronoun? How do we respond when someone demonstrates ignorance of our own suffering or that of another?</p>



<p>The millions of daily acts of forgiveness or condemnation of the perpetrators of social misdemeanors weave the tapestry of social cohesion. If condemnation prevails, the social grace that makes up the very fiber of civilization unwinds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forgiveness does not require acceptance of bad behavior, quite the contrary. Forgiveness is a recognition that behavior is, in fact, bad, but also has the insight to see that everyone is imperfect and should be afforded the chance to try to do better next time. As such, forgiveness is the ultimate expression of love.</p>



<p>A great irony is that those who fail to forgive, at a personal level, often suffer much more than those in need of forgiveness. How often has a long-held grudge consumed its patron until the consequences are manifold greater than the original offense? This is perhaps most true when, at the personal level, we fail to forgive those who are <em>not</em> penitent.</p>



<p>Even those guilty of criminal behavior need the forgiveness of both society and the individuals harmed by the crime. This does not mean that criminals should not serve their time, simply that, for the good of society and the victims of crime, forgiveness needs to be granted for psycho-social resolution and progress.</p>



<p>Ultimately, forgiveness is the great arbiter, the reconciliator. It is forgiveness that allows society to be both just and merciful. It allows institutions to be created and people to be held accountable to those institutions, while also setting forth means for those who violate the rules to regain social acceptance. Without forgiveness, America will continue to devolve into Thomas Hobbes’ dystopian vision of the pre-civilized, natural state of life for man as, “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><div><article role="main"><p>One of the repeating motifs of recruiting in the software industry are mantras of “talent”: “We recruit the best talent”, “talent attracts talent”, “we value talent” and so on. Some companies have so called “head of talent”, “talent acquisition”, “talent development” professionals on their payroll - basically a re-branding of HR. With the amount of conversations, conference talks and hype going on around talent, you would expect people will have an answer to the question “what is talent?”. You’d expect, and you’d be wrong: “it’s like porn, you know it when you see it” is the answer I usually get - and as with porn, this only conveys that the word is merely an unhelpful judgemental label. If you cannot give <em>some</em> attributes of “talent”, how are you going to find it, develop it, keep it? Also, it’s not as if the subject of talent hasn’t been researched - quite the contrary! Although research is far from being exhaustive of the subject (or anything related to intelligence for that matter), there is plenty we do know. As it turns out, most of what we hear about “talent” in the software industry is just plain wrong and based on naive and deprecated models if not outright self delusions. For example, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/27/news-58/">Joel Spolsky has observed years ago</a> that almost all companies are somehow convinced they hire only the top 1% of developers - a clear case of selection bias. When people tell me they want to hire the top 1% of developers, I laugh. First because as Joel Spolsky noted everyone says that. Second, it implies we have some measurement of developers abilities - if we had that, why are we working so hard on interviews? Third, do they mean “top 1% of the population” of developers or the developers with top 1% of the skill scale? they are not the same. Fourth, it assumes that skill is static and when they hire a top 1% developer she will remain a top 1% developer - in other words that performance is dependent only on the identity of the developer.</p><p>All of these assumptions are completely wrong.</p><h2 id="talent-is-multi-dimensional">Talent is multi dimensional</h2><p>Suppose for a second we have some kind of metric by which we can sort developers on a scale to choose the best 1% of them. If such a metric exists, design a test for it and stop doing interviews! The reason why we have interviews, test projects and hiring committees is that there is no metric or even a group of metrics which can be measured and by which we can evaluate developers. In sports a large surrounding industry of gambling and statistics popped up because while the game itself has a clear score the relative strength and weaknesses of players and teams are far from being easily measurable - and it isn’t even clear which attributes impact the game and should be measured. Likewise, software engineering involves many different skills and let’s be honest here, we don’t really know what skills contribute to success and which of them are necessary or sufficient. But unlike sport matches, in software engineering we don’t know how to score relative performance of engineers - we have no measurement of goodness for code nor are we likely to ever have one. There are many different dimensions to goodness of code, and their relative important can change between projects or time. Even performance which is the most measurable of these is contextually defined, for one project performance means throughput while for another it’s the 99th percentile of latency.</p><h2 id="talent-isnt-static">Talent isn’t static</h2><blockquote><p>A genius is not born but is educated and trained….When a child is born healthy, it is a potential genius.</p></blockquote>Everyone wants to hire talent, but few people are asking “where does talent come from?”. There are a lot of evidence that “ingrained talent” is largely a myth. The more we learn about the brain the more we understand the answer to the nature vs nurture question is always “both”. On the one hand, we have Mozart: a brilliant musician from childhood; on the other side of the spectrum we have the Polgar sisters - geniuses by design. But Mozart was born to a musician father and grew up immersed in music, nurtured from an early age and no one can tell how he would have developed in another family. Conversely, how many potential Mozarts have we missed due to lack of nurture? no one knows.<p>None of us started proficient in programming, nor were we born with the ability to speak or think - we <em>developed</em> these abilities. If there’s one thing we know for sure about intelligence, it’s that it is adaptive - in fact, the general definition of intelligence is “adapting to provide better results predictably better than random”. The “better than random” part is important, because there’s nothing intelligent in winning 50% of coin tosses (or making profit in a rising market). The “adaptive” part is of particular interest though, as all strategies are specialized to some degree; being good at something doesn’t mean you’ll be good at something else, a fact worth remembering when hiring fresh graduates based on their University score - being good at University tests is not a transferrable skill to developing software. Intelligence is adaptation, and while it’s true that some individuals adapt faster than others it should be clear the reasons for that are mixture of innate abilities and environmental factors. All standard tests are remarkably bad at measuring this because they are focused on measuring specific skills and not adaptation. Personally I believe the best predictor of a person’s adaptive abilities are what we call “personality traits” - things like curiosity, openness and critical thinking (it turns out this belief has grounding in research). Anyway, if we accept that intelligence is adaptive it should be clear any measurement of current skill is less interesting than the adaptive potential of the individual. “Talent” is a network effect and exhibits all the familiar behaviors of network effects. It shouldn’t be surprising to learn that people <a href="https://blog.atomist.com/the-origins-of-opera-and-the-future-of-programming/">better develop their talent in groups</a>. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594485380">history of innovation</a> demonstrates that innovation isn’t driven by heroic geniuses but by intricate collaborative networks - although popular media would have you believe otherwise. Indeed, people augment each other not only in skill but in adaptation and learning as well.</p><blockquote><p>“we don’t have these Netflix superstar engineers to do the things you’re talking about”, and when I looked around the room at the company names my response was “we hired them from you and got out of their way”</p></blockquote><p>How often was someone who was thought to be talented in his previous company hired only to have them perform poorly in the new one? How many times have you seen “diamonds in the rough” who displayed no talent in one workplace but suddenly became a rising star after moving to a new one? The prevalence of these occurrences should be enough to convince you that talent development is highly linked to the environment. Understanding this, we shouldn’t say that “A graders hire other A graders, B graders hire C graders” but rather that “A graders create A graders, B graders create C graders”. You’ve witnessed this yourself for sure - the loss or rise of motivation, the challenges, mentoring or put downs by teammates can make a star a disgruntled moron or spark flames of wisdom and enthusiasm in a once mediocre person. <strong>You hire potential talent, but manifestation of talent is developed</strong>.</p><h2 id="talent-isnt-linear">Talent isn’t linear</h2><p>The entire world has an estimated 25-30 million developers, and Google reportedly employees over 100,000 of them. Even if we think this number is exaggerated, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and the rest of Silicon Valley giants employ hundreds of thousands of developers - well over the 1% mark. It’s obvious they can’t hire “the top 1%” simply because they are too big, but perhaps a small startup can?
</p><div><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://i0.wp.com/btwb.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/image1.png" alt="https://i0.wp.com/btwb.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/image1.png"></p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/btwb.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/image1.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></figure></div>This is what skill distributions looks like, for any measurement of skill I have ever seen. For natural skills or attributes the distributions tend to be normal or log-normal, but is this the case for <em>results</em> of applying these skills? We have argued before that talent is a network effect and for network effects power distributions reign, e.g. the Zipfian distribution of city sizes. Skill isn’t uniformly distributed - which means there’s a big difference between hiring the top %1 of the <em>population</em> and hiring the people with the top 1% of results and that difference is extremely large when power laws are involved. That’s the Pareto principle in a nutshell, 80% of results come from 20% of the effort. The developers producing the top 1% of results, for whatever measurement of results you choose, are a tiny fraction of the population. You are unlikely to ever meet one. So let’s assume people mean the top 1% of the population. Here’s what the compensation distribution chart looks like:<div><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/compensation-distribution.png" alt="/img/compensation-distribution.png"></p><a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/compensation-distribution.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></figure></div>This specific data is self reported from the San Francisco area and the tail goes well beyond the million $ mark. All compensation and wealth distributions have similar shapes, the top 1% of any free profession don’t make 50% or even 100% more than the mean, they make hundreds of percents more<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In other words, there is no way for a startup to pay a top 1% developer (but perhaps they can offer some other incentive, and I don’t mean stock options because that’s crap).<p>If all of these prevalent assumptions about talent are wrong, what does it say about our hiring and management practices? what do managers even mean when they set out to hire “good developers” given that their goodness cannot be measured and is highly volatile? And if talent is as László Polgár claimed not born but rather developed, what is the value of testing for <em>present</em> level of proficiency. Is it possible that <em>where we hire to</em> is more important than <em>who</em> we hire? It’s clear we need a better model of talent, one which focuses on the conditions suitable for development and nurture of talent rather than attracting talent. I have some hunches about what this model would look like, and there are definitely tell-tale examples out there to learn from. But this kind of new model …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>-The elimination of the WikiLeaks Shop on Facebook is strongly criticized for being considered “one more censorship action of social networks”</strong><br>
<strong>-WikiLeaks Shop sells t-shirts, hoodies and mugs with the organization’s logo, which carry messages such as: “Exposing crimes is not a crime”</strong><br>
<strong>-The site now offers discounted merchandise if buyers use the code “NOCENSORSHIP”</strong></p>
<p>The removal of the WikiLeaks Shop Facebook page is the latest example of high-profile organizations experiencing what critics argue: it’s the increasingly censorious nature of social media.</p>








<p>It has not been posted on the WikiLeaks Shop Facebook page for allegedly violating the “community standards” of the social networking site.  On February 2, 2021, the Facebook page belonging to the marketing arm of the transparency and news outlet was blocked from public view with a statement that read: “Your page, WikiLeaks Store, has not been published.” .</p>
<p>This would later be explained with a message that simply stated, “This is because WikiLeaks Shop is against our community guidelines.”  The Facebook page has existed since December 3, 2011.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks Shop sells T-shirts, hoodies and mugs with the organization’s logo, which carry messages such as: “Exposing crimes is not a crime”, “Free Julian Assange” and “1984 is not an instruction manual”, in reference to the dystopian novel about life in a totalitarian state written by George Orwell.</p>

<p>Related Notes: #Pizzagate: Pedophile Cult Now Trending Thanks to Justin Bieber Promotion </p>
<p>“I spoke with a person [a través del soporte empresarial de Facebook] and they told me that they couldn’t help me and that the appeal process was the only way ”, explains the person who runs the WikiLeaks store to the Russian media Sputnik.</p>
<p>The source added to the outlet that there was an appeal process but that it was fully automated.  “The appeal did not allow [ninguna opción para publicar] nothing, it was more of a ‘if you don’t agree with this decision, please click this button’ ”.  Possible attack by bots for supporting WikiLeaks founder</p>
<p>However, the WikiLeaks Shop manager “discovered something interesting,” he told Sputnik.  They realized that the decision to unpublish the Facebook page followed what appears to be an attack by apparent bots (automated accounts).  “Someone probably made it look like we were paying someone to share our posts with the bots,” the source explained.</p>
<p>The final post made by WikiLeaks Shop, before their page was taken down, simply contained a graphic with a black t-shirt and the words “Free Assange” on it.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s the content that would violate their policies,” explained the source.  “I read their policies, we do not participate in anything against them as far as I know,” they added.  The site now offers discounted merchandise if shoppers use the code “NOCENSORSHIP” through the website.</p>
<p>The management of the page contacted the Facebook press department to obtain a right of reply on the removal of their site from networks.  A member of Facebook’s press team responded asking for more information and a link to the unpublished page, explaining that they could not comment until they investigated further on the matter.</p>
<p>Julian Assange, co-founder of WikiLeaks, remains in Belmarsh prison while the US government appeals the decision of District Judge Vanessa Baraitser on the refusal to grant extradition.</p>

<div>

<p>
<a href="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/detail.php?id=projekte%3Advdlsm%3Astart&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:dvdlsm_full.jpg" title="projekte:dvdlsm:dvdlsm_full.jpg"><img src="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=450&amp;tok=16dc0d&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:dvdlsm_full.jpg" alt="" width="450"></a>
</p>

<p>
Due to an abundance of one specific type of DVD drives, plans were made to give a useful afterlife to these devices. A laser scanning microscope seemed to be the most useful project.
</p>

</div>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<div>

<p>
This project was inspired by the work done by Hannes Zöllner towards his Ph.D., during which he evaluated commercial DVD drives for fault injection in semiconductor devices. At some point, his system was also repurposed for imaging, with surprisingly remarkable results. An effort was made to optimize the system used in this project for imaging rather than for fault injection.
</p>

<p>
A DVD drive is a remarkable device, being able to discern the height of tiny pits of about 440 nm in length, laid out in tracks separated by only 780 nm. Of course, Blu-Ray technology decreased both these numbers further, but DVD drives tend to be thrown away in large quantities these days, which makes them available to the hobbyist basically free of charge.
</p>

</div>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<div>

<p>
The OPU (Optical Pickup Unit) of a DVD drive normally contains all the optical and most of the electrical components required to read data from a disk. Normally, it includes laser diodes (and sometimes their driver electronics), a multi-quadrant detector diode (PDIC or OPIC), the required optical elements (lenses, mirrors, prisms, gratings) and the actors for focus, tilt and tracking control (typically electromagnetic actuators moving the primary lens close to the disk). Normally, the OPU is mounted on a linear rail equipped with a stepper motor for one-axis position control.
</p>

<p>
In the available drives, all OPU components are interfaced using a single FFC (flat cable) to a custom board that houses a proprietary microprocessor and various components not quite available to the average consumer. Therefore a replacement for these electronics that utilizes commercially available components open source hardware/software should be created.
</p>

<p>
This replacement should provide the following basic functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Interface to PC for data acquisition</p>
</li>
<li><p> Driving of OPU actuators (lens coils)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Driving of laser diode(s)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Readout of the PDIC for focusing and image acquisition</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2 id="opu_architecture">OPU Architecture</h2>
<div>

<p>
The OPU in the available drives is a tightly integrated component, mostly consisting of a single cast-aluminum block, in which various optical components are glued. A top-down-view of the OPU after removing the cover can be seen below.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/detail.php?id=projekte%3Advdlsm%3Astart&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:opu_disassembled.jpg" title="projekte:dvdlsm:opu_disassembled.jpg"><img src="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=500&amp;tok=364a3d&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:opu_disassembled.jpg" alt="" width="500"></a>
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="laser_diodes_lens_and_actuators">Laser Diodes, Lens and Actuators</h3>
<div>

<p>
The OPU houses two laser diodes. As this is just a DVD/CD reader, the lasers are not very powerful but provide sufficient power for microscopy applications. The (red) DVD diode starts laser operation above approx. 60 mA and requires about 2-2.5 V of forward voltage. Its polarity can be easily determined by measurements.
</p>

<p>
The primary lens is positioned using electromagnetic actuators. These come in the form of three coils, which tilt or move the coil proportionally to the current flowing though them. Their polarity and required full-scale DC actuation current can be easily found by using a lab power supply.
</p>

<p>
The focusing control loop driving these coils is normally deriving its error signal from the astigmatic focus error detection method. It requires (in its basic form) a four-quadrant diode, and focus is optimized when all quadrants of the diode are equally illuminated. Deviation from this point will cause the circular illumiation to become elliptical and therefore illuminate two diagonal quadrants more strongly. A schematic explanation of that scheme can be found <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Astigmatic-detection-method-a-Schematic-diagram-of-the-optical-system-with-commercial_fig1_329138728" title="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Astigmatic-detection-method-a-Schematic-diagram-of-the-optical-system-with-commercial_fig1_329138728" rel="ugc nofollow">here</a> and in many textbooks.
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="pdic">PDIC</h3>
<div>

<p>
The PDIC (Photo Diode Integrated Circuit), in a DVD reader application, serves multiple purposes. These include gathering focus, tilt and tracking information from the disk as well as recovery of the RF data stored on the disk tracks. For this reason, PDICs typically consist of at least 6 active diode areas, sometimes even more. The PDIC used in the available drive type is seen below. Given its a very niche device, oftentimes custom-designed for a specific drive vendor, datasheets are hard to come by. Initial pinout probing revealed only the power supply pin locations and a number of analog output pins, but I was unable to find any matching ICs datasheets, so some reverse engineering effort was required to figure out its secrets.
</p>

<p>
First, the device was placed on a little break-out PCB to allow easy access to all of its pins, especially during microscope inspections.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/detail.php?id=projekte%3Advdlsm%3Astart&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:pdic_breakout.jpg" title="projekte:dvdlsm:pdic_breakout.jpg"><img src="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=63dc0c&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:pdic_breakout.jpg" alt="" width="600"></a>
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="pdic_reverse_engineeringoptical">PDIC Reverse Engineering: Optical</h4>
<div>

<p>
Using an IC inspection microscope, a die shot of the PDIC was produced. This was useful to get a better idea of the internal structure of the device. This process is made way easier by the fact that it is an optical integrated circuit, and is therefore housed inside a clear plastic package with good optical properties, suitable for direct microscope inspection without decapsulation. The picture below could be used to identify some functional blocks of the circuit, however full tracing from the bondpads through internal circuits to the diode quadrants didn't really go anywhere for me. However, it became apparent that the PDIC apparently houses at least independent eight photo diode channels. (Four quadrants in the center square, and at least two segments for each of the outer squares).
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/detail.php?id=projekte%3Advdlsm%3Astart&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:chip_res.jpg" title="projekte:dvdlsm:chip_res.jpg"><img src="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=2205d3&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:chip_res.jpg" alt="" width="600"></a>
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="pdic_reverse_engineeringelectro-optical">PDIC Reverse Engineering: Electro-Optical</h4>
<div>

<p>
On most of the pins, some change in output voltage could be seen when illuminating the device with a bright source of light. At first, the output behavior of each pin was simply put into different categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Low light sensitivity: 4 outputs</p>
</li>
<li><p> High light sensitivity: 4 outputs</p>
</li>
<li><p> Same magnitude, but opposite polarity outputs (differential pair): 2 pins</p>
</li>
<li><p> Negative output voltage: 1 pin</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It was conjectured that the smaller inner quadrants were responsible for the low-sensitivity outputs, while the outer segments would produce a large amplitude (due to their larger light collection area).
</p>

<p>
In a second reverse engineering session, the exact pinout was determined by means of selective illumination: For a given test, two IC output pins were compared using two DVMs, and an aperture was slowly moved along the surface, either vertically or horizontally. This would in result a change of the output voltage for one of the outputs slightly earlier than for the other one. In this way, the positional relationships between all output pins could be resolved, forming a final assignment of diode quadrants to output pins.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/detail.php?id=projekte%3Advdlsm%3Astart&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:pinout_bg.png" title="projekte:dvdlsm:pinout_bg.png"><img src="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=800&amp;tok=eea749&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:pinout_bg.png" alt="" width="800"></a>
</p>

<p>
The output producing negative voltages is not considered to be useful in the final application, while the differential output pair is likely a summed output of the four inner quadrants (the high bandwidth RF output). With the assignment of pins to diode quadrants done, the OPU could be modified to fan-out the required connections to custom electronics
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="opu_modification">OPU Modification</h3>
<div>

<p>
The whole top assembly of the DVD drive is reused. This includes not only the OPU, but also the linear (worm gear) axis driven by a stepper motor and its base plate. A breadboard header was added to the OPU, fanning out all required signals to the custom electronics on a ribbon cable. The analog output signals are separated on one side, while the current inputs for the laser diode and the lens actuators are kept to the other side. This should help mitigate electrical coupling between these signals, even though the diode outputs are actively driven by the PDIC.
</p>

<p>
The other axis (below the drive mechanism) is built from a commercial precision linear actuator that was donated to the project. Other people have simply used another DVD drive in its place, which would certainly be a possibility here.
</p>

<p>

</p>

</div>

<h2 id="electronics">Electronics</h2>
<div>

<p>
A PCB was designed that would fulfill all necessary interfacing between PC and the optical components. Those would be:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Drive motors for X/Y axes</p>
</li>
<li><p> Drive the lens actuator coils (constant current/voltage)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Drive the laser LEDs (constant current)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Provide power supply</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It was pretty obvious that at least all the mechanical actuation and laser driving could be handled by an IC foreseen for an optical drive. Texas Instruments offers a line-up of such chips, which are one of the few types that can easily be sourced from common distributors. The <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TPIC2050" title="https://www.ti.com/product/TPIC2050" rel="ugc nofollow">TI TPIC2050</a> was chosen due to its all-digital interface and flexible output options. Given it's a pretty high-quantity component, its cost is very reasonable (€2.50 in single quantities) and can hardly be beaten by any other integrated options.
</p>

<p>
A PCB was designed around this IC, with an additional 16 bit ADC plus analog MUX for the PDIC outputs. The PCB was built to house an <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/icebreaker-fpga" title="https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/icebreaker-fpga" rel="ugc nofollow">iceBreaker FPGA board</a> that would take care of all the interfacing. All electronics were designed in KiCad and are available publicly in its <a href="https://git.loetlabor-jena.de/dvdlaser/dvdlaser_hw" title="https://git.loetlabor-jena.de/dvdlaser/dvdlaser_hw" rel="ugc nofollow">GitLab repository</a>.

</p>

</div>

<h2 id="fpga_design">FPGA Design</h2>
<div>

<p>
The FPGA had to fulfill a couple of interfacing tasks, and the design uses the <abbr title="Free &amp; Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr> FPGA toolchain for the Lattice ice40 UP5k FPGA on the iceBreaker board. It mainly does the following things:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Automatically cycle through ADC MUX channels and read out photo diode currents</p>
</li>
<li><p> Provide register-level access to the TPIC2050 from the host software</p>
</li>
<li><p> Provide fast write access to the TPIC2050 DACs</p>
</li>
<li><p> Allow communications to the host PC using a 1Mbps USB-Serial connection</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The design itself is quite straight forward, but I had a bit of fun with the verification environment. I used <a href="https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/" title="https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/" rel="ugc nofollow">cocotb</a> and iverilog for all the simulations. The testbenches contain proper hardware device models for all ICs as well as the optical chain. The simulated UART interface can be connected to a virtual serial port, which can then be stimulated by the real host software. This allows running a full „simulated hardware in the loop“ test, which is quite a neat thing to have.
</p>

<p>
Setting a focus actuator current would alter the optical chain, resulting in different values digitized by the ADC for the various photo diode …</p></div></div></div>

</p>
<p>One of my friends recently brought up the idea of consulting for startups. He’s been working in software for almost two decades, and he’s worked for a few well-known startups in the area. He definitely has skills and knowledge that would be valuable for a startup, so he was surprised when I told him <strong>startup consulting is not a good idea.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve thought about this topic a lot. I have worked for early-stage startups, done some startup consulting, and met plenty of startup consultants. A few of them have actually been pretty successful.</p>
<p>That said, I steer consultants away from startups when they ask, and in this post, I’ll explain why. <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/working-at-startup">I love working with startups</a>, so please don’t read this as a knock against them. As you’ll see, they’re just an objectively poor target market for consultants.</p>
<p><em>Learning more about startups? I’ve compiled a list of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my favorite books for founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-startup-consulting">What is Startup Consulting?</h2>
<p>First off, when I say “consultant,” I’m not talking about freelancers or contract hires. Those two categories of employees are essentially tax shelters for small companies that can’t afford full-time people yet, and their work is typically very execution-focused.</p>
<p>I’m also not talking about advisors, mentors, or coaches. People in these roles are typically more focused on asking questions or serving as a sounding board. If you’re an experienced entrepreneur coaching a new founder, that’s great. I have several mentors, and they’re invaluable, but they don’t make a living from helping people like me.</p>
<p>A startup consultant is someone whose business is to come into a small company, ask some questions, analyze the data, prepare a report, and make recommendations based on their findings. They don’t execute tasks or manage team members directly (although there are exceptions) but focus instead on high-level strategy.</p>
<p>Startup consultants aren’t typically involved for the long-term (and are almost never offered equity), but the good ones might provide some follow-through to see how their recommendations pan out. They might also offer a retainer to answer questions about their recommendations as they come up, but they usually aren’t part of the day-to-day.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-people-start-consulting-for-startups">Why Do People Start Consulting for Startups?</h3>
<p><strong>The most lucrative piece of the consulting market is focused on Fortune 500 companies.</strong> That’s where giants like <a href="https://www.consultancy.uk/news/14018/the-10-largest-consulting-firms-in-the-world">PwC, Deloitte, E&amp;Y, KPMG, McKinsey, and BCG</a> all play, but for one-person consulting shops or small agencies, it’s pretty hard to land one of these customers.</p>
<p>So, many new consultants set their sites on startups. Some figure they can take their experience from a larger company (or, god forbid, <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/why-you-should-not-hire-mbas-for-startup/">an MBA</a>) to help early-stage startups “grow up.” Others trade on a former employer’s success (i.e., people who put “Formerly Google/Apple/Facebook/etc.” in their Linkedin bios), using name recognition to attract startups that like having a name brand behind their consultants.</p>
<p>These hopeful new consultants hang up their shingles, offering something vague like “Proven Growth Strategies” or “Scalable Product-Led Growth.” If they <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">have a deep personal network</a>, they’ll probably find enough clients to survive for a couple of years, but most of them won’t stick with the startup market long.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-against-startup-consulting">The Case Against Startup Consulting</h2>
<p>While startups can make decisions quickly - <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3006682/not-so-fast-10-hasty-mistakes-startup-founders-make">almost to a fault</a> - they aren’t an easy market to serve. They’re price sensitive, have high expectations, and prone to failure. Let’s dive into each of these points and see how they affect startup consulting.</p>
<h3 id="1-founders-have-unrealistic-expectations">1. Founders Have Unrealistic Expectations</h3>
<p>What consultants offer is squishy, and for big companies, it can be more political than practical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“CEOs that want or need to make an unpopular decision often bring in a consulting firm to help. This provides ammunition to recommend an unpopular or risky decision to the board. The CEO can also distance herself from an unpopular decision by blaming the consultants.” - <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-value-do-consulting-firms-like-McKinsey-Bain-et-al-really-add-to-an-operation-What-exactly-is-it-that-they-do-that-commands-such-premium-compensation-and-more-importantly-has-created-an-entire-sustainable-and-enduring-industry/answer/Raj-Ramanan">Raj Ramanan, Co-Founder at Loku</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>While large companies hire consultants to validate decisions or reassure institutional investors, startups hope you will solve their deepest, darkest problems.</strong> Your recommendation isn’t just a handy report for investors - they’re going to stake the future of their business on it.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YkVXgqm.png" alt="Large company vs. startup consulting"></p>
<p>While you will certainly send the startup off with the strategy document you promised, anyone who has worked with a startup knows that <strong>things change too fast for a static recommendation like this to make any difference</strong>. They’re going to need you to come back and revise the strategy as they learn new things. Unfortunately, you probably didn’t build that into the price, so now you’re annoyed that they won’t just follow your original plan, and they’re annoyed that they spent $20k for an outdated document.</p>
<h3 id="2-price-sensitivity">2. Price Sensitivity</h3>
<p>As a consultant, it would seem that the obvious solution to the first problem is to simply <em>charge the startup more for ongoing help</em>. The problem is that <strong>startups must be frugal to survive</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People who are cheap are much more likely to succeed. And not just because their money lasts longer; a frugal attitude seems to correlate with success.” - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=189830">Paul Graham, Y Combinator</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most funded startups are trading on borrowed time and get 12-18 months of runway per fundraise. Bootstrapped startups aren’t any better because the founders tend to be sacrificing more out of pocket to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>While large companies get budgets earmarked for hiring consultants or completing specific projects, small startups usually have to run all major expenditures by the founder. I’ve known founders who won’t let division heads charge so much as $100 to the company card without clearance from the CEO.</p>
<p>So while you look at your $200 per hour price tag as a bargain for startups (McKinsey is charging <a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/revealed-mckinsey-partners-charge-16-000-a-day-before-discounts-20190808-p52f2a">$16k per day, after all</a>), they see it as a significant line item on a razor-thin budget. Misalignment like this is bound to lead to disappointment on one side or the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pP8Astj.png" alt="Price sensitivity in startups"></p>
<h3 id="3-startups-need-more-hands-not-brains">3. Startups Need More Hands Not Brains</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“In truth, startups rarely need new ideas — they already have more than they know what to do with. So adding yet more ideas to the backlog is stressful, especially without the resources to execute them.” - <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-startups-hate-consultants-5b245ec275d3">Dave Bailey, CEO Coach</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently met with a startup that hired a very senior person from a big tech firm. He loved having a big title, but when the time came to build the product, he was unwilling to roll up his sleeves and write any code.</p>
<p><strong>“I’m the CTO who drives the Ferrari, not the Toyota,”</strong> he said.</p>
<p>In the first few years, startup founders spend at least 80% of their time on low-level, hands-on drudgery: sales calls, product development, social media management, writing email campaigns, hiring key people, setting up payroll/books/insurance/etc…It’s not glamorous work, but it needs to get done.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WTxowB5.png" alt="Startup founders and grunt work"></p>
<p>So, it’s tough for a startup to justify bringing on a consultant who <em>only</em> offers high-level strategy at an hourly rate many times higher than their early employees.</p>
<p>Most startup founders who have cleared the first couple of bars by doing some fundraising and making some sales are pretty smart people. They don’t need a consultant who’s never been in their shoes to tell them how to run their business; they need humble people who can get their hands dirty and make shit happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Consultants had a very topical view of our business, did not sit with us every day, and did not have the same passion and zeal for our company that we as founders naturally had. After three months, we stopped using them and learned a very important lesson.” - <a href="https://www.startups.com/library/expert-advice/should-you-hire-startup-consultants">Gray Skinner, CEO at Droplr</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if you restrict your work to startups within a single industry or market, as a consultant, you’re never going to be as “bought-in” as the founders. So, when you come in and make a recommendation that flies counter to what the founder believes, they can simply write it off. “She must not see what we see.”</p>
<p>Whether the founder is right or wrong doesn’t matter. What matters is their perception that outside consultants are never going to be as dedicated or see the vision that they do.</p>
<p>You might be able to filter startups out if they’re especially hostile to consultants, but it’s usually hard to tell what their attitude will be until you start to make recommendations to them.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-expert-problem">5. The “Expert” Problem</h3>
<p>Most consultants consider themselves experts in some specific field. That’s great, but as I’ve pointed out in the past, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/experts">experts fall prey to the same biases that the rest of us do</a>.</p>
<p>For one thing, many consultants tend to overgeneralize their experience. If you’ve been in marketing at a few startups, you might think you know everything there is to know about startup marketing. Even if you don’t project this hubris publicly, it affects the way you make decisions and closes you off to new inputs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We love anecdotes so much because it’s often much easier for people to believe someone’s testimony as opposed to understanding complex data and variation across a continuum. Anecdotes exempt us from having to prove our point: it’s happened once; that’s solid proof as far as I’m concerned.” - <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">Manuel Frigerio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This overgeneralization problem seems especially toxic in startup consulting because what worked in <a href="">cutting-edge startups</a> five years ago won’t necessarily work today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The solution the firm comes up involves a high tech presentation and even higher tech case studies, but when it comes to the true substance of the steps they recommend, it may as well be 1982.” - <a href="https://www.inc.com/michael-schein/how-consultants-kill-business.html">Michael Schein, CEO at Microfame Media</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="6-founders-need-to-learn-for-themselves">6. Founders Need to Learn for Themselves</h3>
<p>I recently saw a consultant who would sit down with a founder in <em>any industry</em> for an hour and tell them which marketing channels they should use.</p>
<p>I am skeptical that this will work. A startup’s early successful marketing channels will be based on which avenues the founder is most familiar with and where their target market hangs out. You can tell a founder to “just use Instagram ads,” but if they’ve never run an Instagram …</p></div></article></section></div>

            </section>

            
            <h2>And switching from init.vim to init.lua</h2>
            <p>If you, like me, never really understood Vimscript and hate the language
with a passion, you’re in the right place! You can now get rid of
Vimscript wholesale and replace it with a simpler, faster and elegant-er
language — Lua! <em>However</em>, this is only possible from Neovim 0.5
onwards<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and as of now, requires you to install Neovim from HEAD. How
to do that is left as an exercise to the reader. Also bear in mind that
the Lua API is fairly beta right now, and many Vim things don’t have
direct interfaces.</p>

<p>So assuming you’re now running Neovim <code>master</code>, head over to
<code>~/.config/nvim</code> and create your <code>init.lua</code>. Why, yes, we’re porting
over your <code>init.vim</code> to <code>init.lua</code> right now! Clear your calendar for
the next few hours — bikeshedding your text editor is top priority!</p>

<p>I also recommend going through
<a href="https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide" rel="nofollow">nanotee/nvim-lua-guide</a>
and <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/" rel="nofollow">Learn Lua in Y minutes</a>
before starting off.</p>

<h2>the directory structure</h2>

<p>Lua files are typically under <code>~/.config/nvim/lua</code>, and can be loaded as
Lua modules. This is incredibly powerful — you can structure your
configs however you like.</p>
<pre>$ tree .config/nvim
.
|-- ftplugin
|   `-- ...
|-- init.lua
|-- lua
|   |-- maps.lua
|   |-- settings.lua
|   |-- statusline.lua
|   `-- utils.lua
`-- plugin
    `-- ...
</pre>
<p>The common approach is to have different
bits of your config in Lua files under <code>lua/</code> and <code>require</code>’d in your
<code>init.lua</code>, so something like:</p>
<pre><span>-- init.lua</span>

require(<span>'</span><span>settings</span><span>'</span>)    <span>-- lua/settings.lua</span>
require(<span>'</span><span>maps</span><span>'</span>)        <span>-- lua/maps.lua</span>
require(<span>'</span><span>statusline</span><span>'</span>)  <span>-- lua/statusline.lua</span>
</pre>
<h2>the basics: setting options</h2>

<p>Vim has 3 kinds of options — global, buffer-local and window-local. In
Vimscript, you’d just <code>set</code> these. In Lua, however, you will have to
use one of</p>

<ul>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_set_option()</code> — global options</li>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option()</code> — buffer-local options</li>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_win_set_option()</code> — window-local options</li>
</ul>

<p>These are fairly verbose and very clunky, but fortunately for us, we
have “meta-accesors” for these: <code>vim.{o,wo,bo}</code>. Here’s an excerpt from
my <code>settings.lua</code> as an example:</p>
<pre><span>local</span> o = vim.o
<span>local</span> wo = vim.wo
<span>local</span> bo = vim.bo

<span>-- global options</span>
o.swapfile = <span>true</span>
o.dir = <span>'</span><span>/tmp</span><span>'</span>
o.smartcase = <span>true</span>
o.laststatus = 2
o.hlsearch = <span>true</span>
o.incsearch = <span>true</span>
o.ignorecase = <span>true</span>
o.scrolloff = 12
<span>-- ... snip ... </span>

<span>-- window-local options</span>
wo.number = <span>false</span>
wo.wrap = <span>false</span>

<span>-- buffer-local options</span>
bo.expandtab = <span>true</span>
</pre>
<p>If you’re not sure if an option is global, buffer or window-local,
consult the Vim help! For example, <code>:h 'number'</code>:</p>
<pre>'number' 'nu'           boolean (default off)
                        local to window
</pre>
<p>Also note that you don’t set the negation of an option to true, like
<code>wo.nonumber = true</code>, you instead set <code>wo.number = false</code>.</p>

<h2>defining autocommands</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, autocommands in Vim don’t have a Lua interface — it is
being worked on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Until then, you will have to use
<code>vim.api.nvim_command()</code>, or the shorter <code>vim.cmd()</code>. I’ve defined a
simple function that takes a Lua table of <code>autocmd</code>s as an argument, and
creates an <code>augroup</code> for you.</p>
<pre><span>-- utils.lua</span>

<span>local</span> M = {}
<span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd

<span>function</span> <span>M</span>.create_augroup(autocmds, name)
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>augroup </span><span>'</span> .. name)
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>autocmd!</span><span>'</span>)
    <span>for</span> _, autocmd <span>in</span> ipairs(autocmds) <span>do</span>
        cmd(<span>'</span><span>autocmd </span><span>'</span> .. table.concat(autocmd, <span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span>))
    <span>end</span>
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>augroup END</span><span>'</span>)
<span>end</span>

<span>return</span> M

<span>-- settings.lua</span>
<span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd
<span>local</span> u = require(<span>'</span><span>utils</span><span>'</span>)

</pre>
<h2>defining keymaps</h2>

<p>Keymaps can be set via <code>vim.api.nvim_set_keymap()</code>. It takes 4
arguments: the mode for which the mapping will take effect, the key
sequence, the command to execute and a table of options (<code>:h
:map-arguments</code>).</p>
<pre><span>-- maps.lua</span>

<span>local</span> map = vim.api.nvim_set_keymap

<span>-- map the leader key</span>
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;Space&gt;</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>'</span>, {})
vim.g.mapleader = <span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span>  <span>-- 'vim.g' sets global variables</span>


options = { noremap = <span>true</span> }
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;&lt;esc&gt;</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:nohlsearch&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:bnext&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;p</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:bprev&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
</pre>
<p>For user defined commands, you’re going to have to go the <code>vim.cmd</code>
route:</p>
<pre><span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd

cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! WQ wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! WQ wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Wq wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Wqa wqa</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! W w</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Q q</span><span>'</span>)
</pre>
<h2>managing packages</h2>

<p>Naturally, you can’t use your favourite Vimscript package manager
anymore, or at least, not without <code>vim.api.nvim_exec</code>ing a bunch of
Vimscript (ew!). Thankfully, there are a few pure-Lua plugin managers
available to use<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> — I personally use, and recommend
<a href="https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim/" rel="nofollow">paq</a>. It’s light and makes use of
the <a href="https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/" rel="nofollow"><code>vim.loop</code></a> API for async I/O.
paq’s docs are plentiful, so I’ll skip talking about how to set it up.</p>

<h2>bonus: writing your own statusline</h2>

<p>Imagine using a bloated, third-party statusline, when you can just write
your own.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> It’s actually quite simple! Start by defining a table for
every mode:</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

 <span>local</span> mode_map = {
	[<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>normal </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>no</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>n·operator pending </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>v</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>visual </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>V</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·line </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span></span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·block </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>s</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>select </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>S</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>s·line </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span></span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>s·block </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>i</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>insert </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>R</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>replace </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>Rv</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·replace </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>c</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>command </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>cv</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>vim ex </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>ce</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>ex </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>r</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>prompt </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>rm</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>more </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>r?</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>confirm </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>!</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>shell </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>t</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>terminal </span><span>'</span>
}
</pre>
<p>The idea is to get the current mode from <code>vim.api.nvim_get_mode()</code> and
map it to our desired text. Let’s wrap that around in a small <code>mode()</code>
function:</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

<span>local</span> <span>function</span> mode()
	<span>local</span> m = vim.api.nvim_get_mode().mode
	<span>if</span> mode_map[m] == <span>nil</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> m <span>end</span>
	<span>return</span> mode_map[m]
<span>end</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, set up your highlights. Again, there isn’t any interface for
highlights yet, so whip out that <code>vim.api.nvim_exec()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

vim.api.nvim_exec(
<span>[[
</span><span>  hi PrimaryBlock   ctermfg=06 ctermbg=00
</span><span>  hi SecondaryBlock ctermfg=08 ctermbg=00
</span><span>  hi Blanks   ctermfg=07 ctermbg=00
</span><span>]]</span>, <span>false</span>)
</pre>
<p>Create a new table to represent the entire statusline itself. You can
add any other functions you want (like one that returns the current git
branch, for instance). Read <code>:h 'statusline'</code> if you don’t understand
what’s going on here.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

<span>local</span> stl = {
  <span>'</span><span>%#PrimaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  mode(),
  <span>'</span><span>%#SecondaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#Blanks#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%f</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%m</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%=</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#SecondaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%l,%c </span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#PrimaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%{&amp;filetype}</span><span>'</span>,
}
</pre>
<p>Finally, with the power of <code>table.concat()</code>, set your statusline. This
is akin to doing a series of string concatenations, but way faster.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

vim.o.statusline = table.concat(stl)
</pre>
<p><img src="https://x.icyphox.sh/statusline.png" alt="statusline"></p>

<h2>this is what being tpope feels like</h2>

<p>You can now write that plugin you always wished for! I sat down to write
a plugin for <a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy" rel="nofollow">fzy</a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, which you can
find <a href="https://git.icyphox.sh/dotfiles/tree/config/nvim/lua/fzy" rel="nofollow">here</a>
along with my entire Neovim config<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. I plan to port a the last of my
<code>plugin/</code> directory over to Lua, soon™.</p>

<p>And it’s only going to get better when the Lua API is completed. We can
all be Vim plugin artists now.</p>

<p>I used to think that one of the things college would teach me is how to get a job in the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It didn’t.</p>



<p>Until I interviewed at a tech giant for the first time, I didn’t even know that there was a specific interview process, much less how I could prepare for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that I live in Silicon Valley and work for a tech giant, I realize that there are two main things that people talk about here: that the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23848039" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23848039">engineering</a> <a href="https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards">interview process</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E608682016205344768%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fmxcl2Fstatus2F608682016205344768widget%3DTweet" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E608682016205344768%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fmxcl2Fstatus2F608682016205344768widget%3DTweet">is broken</a>, and everyone should just start their own companies instead for working for someone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In time, the companies working on <a href="https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">fixing the interview process</a> might well succeed, or in the end it won’t matter anyway because by then we’ll all be <a href="https://twitter.com/IndieHackers" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/IndieHackers">indie hackers</a>. But for those of us who need jobs today, the reality is that the current process is what we have to work with. <strong>And if we want to</strong> <strong>work for the best companies out there, we need to know what the interview process is going to look like and how to prepare for it.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>So with that in mind, here is the most comprehensive guide to the software engineering interview process you’ll find on the internet today; one that I wish someone had written for me when I was in college. In addition to doing everything we talk about here, you’re also going to need luck. But since neither you nor I have any control over that, let’s focus on making sure that when the opportunity presents itself, you’ll be ready for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>




<h2><span id="Part_0_What_is_your_goal"></span>Part 0: What is your goal?<span></span></h2>



<h3><span id="What_kind_of_job_do_you_want"></span>What kind of job do you want?<span></span></h3>



<p>The first thing you need to think about is what kind of job you want. There are many flavors of software engineer – full-stack engineer, distributed systems engineer, machine learning engineer, backend engineer, frontend engineer, mobile engineer, security engineer, dev ops engineer and more.</p>



<p>If you’re completely new to searching for a role:</p>



<ul><li>Read about the differences between the types of software engineers.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Talk to engineers in the industry who are working in the areas you’d like to learn more about. You can get in touch with them through LinkedIn or a mentorship program (like <a href="https://www.builtbygirls.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.builtbygirls.com/">Built By Girls</a>).</li></ul>



<ul><li>Read job descriptions of similar roles on multiple companies’ websites. The goal here is to get a sense of the basic qualifications required for a particular role.</li></ul>



<p><strong>It is harder to get into some areas of engineering as an entry level programmer.</strong> For example, cybersecurity, machine learning, dev ops etc. These roles typically require higher qualifications, more specialization, prior experience or certifications. However, most companies will let you switch roles internally so it’s ok to get your start with your current skillset and slowly transition into the role you want over time.</p>



<h3><span id="What_type_of_company_do_you_want_to_work_for"></span>What type of company do you want to work for?<span></span></h3>



<p>The next thing to think about is what kind of company you want to work for. A good way to categorize your preferences is by <strong>company size</strong> (large, mid-size, or small) and <strong>industry</strong> (consumer tech, B2B, biotech, energy, finance, government, etc.).</p>



<p>Here are some factors to consider:</p>



<ul><li>Engineers are treated differently in different industries based on the value their work generates for the core products in that industry. If a company’s main product is the software they sell, then the quality of the engineering team has a direct impact on revenue, which means that engineers are a more valuable part of the employee base.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Joining a startup or a small company usually means that you’ll get to do a little bit of everything, especially at the early stages of the company. This type of company is a great way to get your hands dirty fast and get a lot of responsibility early on. However that comes with less established best practices, more on-call hours and less-than-market-rate cash compensation.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Things move comparatively slower at larger companies and there’s more internal politics and hierarchy, but the hours and pay are better. You also get to work on systems at scale, and get a lot of time to nurture your engineering skills.</li></ul>



<p>The type of company you choose depends on what you’re looking for in your career right now, and which company’s culture you like when you interview with them. <strong>Remember that this choice is important but not permanent</strong> and you can decide to go work somewhere else in the future if that’s what makes sense at the time. The cost of switching between companies is very low, and between industries is slightly higher but still very doable.</p>



<h3><span id="What_is_your_timeline"></span>What is your timeline?<span></span></h3>



<p>Here are a few examples of how you can structure your schedule depending on how long you have for the job search process.</p>



<h5><strong>A few months:</strong></h5>



<ol><li>Build an online presence: 2-3 weeks</li><li>Apply for jobs + Study for interviews: 3-4 weeks</li><li>Practice Interviews: 1-2 weeks</li><li>Real Interviews: 2-4 weeks</li><li>Salary Negotiation: 1 week</li></ol>



<h5><strong>A year:</strong></h5>



<ol><li>Work on side projects + Build an online presence: 6 months</li><li>Apply for jobs + Study for interviews: 3 months</li><li>Practice Interviews: 2-4 weeks</li><li>Real Interviews: 3-6 weeks</li><li>Salary Negotiation: 1-2 weeks</li></ol>



<h5><strong>A month:</strong></h5>



<p>Your goal of getting a good job is 100% achievable even if your timeline is a month or less. Just do everything simultaneously. Don’t wait for one phase to be over before you start the next. It’s going to be a lot harder and you’re going to have to put in a lot more hours everyday, but you can do it.</p>



<h2><span id="Part_1_Build_an_Online_Presence"></span>Part 1: Build an Online Presence<span></span></h2>



<p>Once you’ve thought about where you’d like to work, it’s time to create (or update) your portfolio, resume and profiles on LinkedIn, job boards and other professional networks.</p>



<p><strong>The goal here is to show your future employers that you can already do the job they’re looking to hire for.</strong> Internships, side projects, open source projects, hackathons or prior work experience are all good ways to showcase your skills. Classes or class projects are rarely a good enough signal by themselves.</p>



<p>Spend the time to make your online presence look good – this is a very important step. This is the way you market yourself and the image you’re presenting is one you should be proud of.</p>



<h3><span id="Resume"></span>Resume<span></span></h3>



<p>Your resume is a one page summary of your professional persona.</p>



<h5><strong>Content:</strong></h5>



<ul><li>At a minimum, your resume should include your education, prior work experience and side projects.</li></ul>



<ul><li>List your experience chronologically, starting with the most recent.</li></ul>



<ul><li>There are two important things to keep in mind when describing your past work: clearly communicate <em>what</em> you worked on, and the <em>measurable outcomes</em> that happened as a result of your work.</li></ul>



<h5><strong>Design:</strong></h5>



<ul><li>Your resume should be no longer than one page, with at least a one inch margin on all sides and a choice of text size and font that make it easy to read.</li></ul>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> is a high-quality typesetting tool that you can use to create your resume. It gives you a lot more control over each element on the page and the outcome looks much better than if you use a text editor.</li></ul>



<h3><span id="Portfolio"></span>Portfolio<span></span></h3>



<p>Your professional portfolio is a website that houses a collection of all your publicly available prior work. This could be links to other websites you’ve built or descriptions of projects you’ve worked on, highlighting the languages, tools and technologies you used to build the project.</p>



<p>It’s also helpful to include links to:</p>



<ul><li>Your LinkedIn profile</li><li>Your resume as an easily downloadable pdf</li><li>Your email address – should be the same as the one on your resume</li><li>Your Github profile</li><li>Any open source contributions</li></ul>



<p>Here are some free hosting options for online projects:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></li><li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li></ul>



<p>And free themes and images for portfolio website design:</p>



<ul><li>Themes – <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5UP</a></li><li>Images – <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></li></ul>



<h3><span id="Job_Boards_and_Professional_Networks"></span>Job Boards and Professional Networks<span></span></h3>



<p>Now that you’ve put in all this work into building an online presence, advertise it. This is how people are going to find you, and you need them to be able to find you before they can start the interview process with you.</p>



<p>Create profiles on:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://angel.co/">AngelList</a></li><li><a href="https://elpha.com/">Elpha</a></li><li><a href="https://www.workatastartup.com/">YC Work at a Startup</a></li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25266287">Hacker News Thread: Who wants to be hired?</a></li><li>And any others that you can think of</li></ul>



<p>In these profiles include links to your resume and portfolio. Also make sure your employment history (including job titles and dates) is accurate because hiring managers and recruiters will use job boards’ built in filters to check who’s actively interviewing, who has x years of experience, etc.</p>



<h2><span id="Part_2_Apply_for_Jobs"></span>Part 2: Apply for Jobs<span></span></h2>



<p>Now that you’ve built an online presence, it’s time to apply for jobs. <strong>Interviewing is a numbers game </strong>– the more places you apply to, the more chances you give yourself of landing an amazing job. Apply to companies you want to work for, but also apply to ones where you’re not as interested. You might find that you end up liking them after meeting with the team and interviewing with them, and if nothing else at least you’ll get some good interview practice out of it.</p>



<p>A huge part of being a good software engineer is being able to learn on the job. So if you have 50-60% of the skills listed on a job description then you are qualified to do that job. Some companies have basic requirements that they won’t budge on, so you should have all of those, but that list is usually short. Apply for job titles even if they seem like they’re a level above or a level below your experience, because once you get on the phone with the recruiter they can determine whether you’re a good fit. </p>



<p>Definitely apply to the jobs that don’t specify years of experience. Also, sometimes job descriptions can be outdated so apply if you’re interested because you might be qualified. And finally, apply for multiple roles at each company; you can narrow your search later if multiple teams from the same company are interested.</p>



<p><strong>Remember that if your application does not get accepted, then you will be no worse off than you are now.</strong> Let the company tell you if they’re not interested, don’t make that decision for them. So don’t be shy, apply!</p>



<h3><span id="Through_Your_Network"></span>Through Your Network<span></span></h3>



<p>Make a list of your family, friends, old colleagues and acquaintances who work in tech. You can also filter for 1st or 2nd …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

            <p>RISHIKESH, INDIA -- 
	Indian rescue crews struggled to reach trapped victims Sunday after part of a glacier in the Himalayas broke off and released a torrent of water and debris that slammed into two hydroelectric plants. At least nine people were killed and 140 were missing in a disaster experts said appeared to point to global warming.</p>
<p>
	Video from India's northern state of Uttarakhand showed the muddy, concrete-gray floodwaters tumbling through a valley and surging into a dam, breaking it into pieces with little resistance before roaring on downstream. The flood turned the countryside into what looked like an ash-colored moonscape.</p>
<p>
	More than 2,000 members of the military, paramilitary groups and police took part in the search-and-rescue operation, including soldiers expert in mountaineering, working into the night under bright halogen lights, authorities said.</p>
<p>
	The flood was caused when a portion of Nanda Devi glacier snapped off in the morning, releasing water trapped behind it, authorities said. It rushed down the mountain and into other bodies of water, forcing the evacuation of many villages along the banks of the Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers.</p>
<p>
	A hydroelectric plant on the Alaknanda was destroyed, and a plant under construction on the Dhauliganga was damaged, said Vivek Pandey, a spokesman for the paramilitary Indo Tibetan Border Police. Flowing out of the Himalayan mountains, the two rivers meet before merging with the Ganges River.</p>
<p>
	Pandey said at least 42 workers were trapped in two tunnels at the Dhauliganga project. Twelve were rescued from one of the tunnels, while at least 30 others remained stranded inside the other, he said.</p>
<p>
	"The rescuers used ropes and shovels to reach the mouth of the tunnel. They dug through the debris and entered the tunnel. They are yet to come in touch with the stranded people," said Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Uttarakhand's top elected official.</p>
<p>
	An additional 140 workers at the two plants were missing, Pandey said. Surjeet Singh, a police official, said at least nine bodies were recovered.</p>
<p>
	The Himalayan area has a chain of hydropower projects on several rivers and their tributaries. Rawat said authorities were able to save other power units downstream because of timely action taken to release water by opening gates.</p>
<p>
	The floodwaters also damaged houses, said Ravi Bejaria, a government spokesman, though he had no details on the number and whether any of the residents were injured, missing or dead.</p>
<p>
	"It all started sometime around 10 in the morning. We heard a bang, which shook our village," Dinesh Negi, a resident of Raini village, told The Associated Press by phone. He said they watched from high above one of the rivers as the water turned muddy and surged in a torrent.</p>
<p>
	"We knew something wrong had happened," Negi said. "We could see the fury of the river."</p>
<p>
	Video showed rescuers in camouflage uniforms and bright yellow or red helmets, using ropes to reach victims. A man who was pulled from a muddy hole threw his arms in the air, and rescuers laughed and exulted with him. Rescue workers comforted victims lying in a row of stretchers in the open.</p>
<p>
	Scientists have long known that global warming is contributing to the melting and the breakup of the world's glaciers.</p>
<p>
	Anjal Prakash, research director and adjunct professor at the Indian School of Business who has contributed to U.N.-sponsored research on global warming, said that while data on the cause of the disaster was not yet available, "this looks very much like a climate change event as the glaciers are melting due to global warming."</p>
<p>
	Uttarakhand Police Chief Ashok Kumar said officials immediately alerted residents in the area and evacuated them to safer places. Downstream, popular tourist spots on the banks of the Ganges were shut, and all boating activities were stopped.</p>
<p>
	Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that "the nation prays for everyone's safety" in Uttarakhand.</p>
<p>
	In 2013, thousands of people were killed in Uttarakhand after heavy rains triggered landslides and floods, washing away thousands of houses and roads and cutting communications in many places.</p>
                          
                                      <div>
                <h2>Correction:</h2>
                <p>
	This story has been corrected to show that authorities launched their search operation on Sunday, not Saturday. It has also been corrected to show that the Dhauliganga hydropower plant is on the Dhauliganga River, not the Alaknanda River.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>While Photoshop is a great tool to have in your development arsenal for basic image editing needs ( we use it at work often for touching up logos and generating sprites for our on-screen TV keyboard ) I've also found it super helpful in various side projects ( such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-colouring_of_photographs">hand-coloring</a> or <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/retouching-repairing-images.html">retouching blemishes</a> from old black &amp; white photos. )</p>
<p>Recently, I discovered it can also be used effectively to extract panoramas from videos, as this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ18lSMFGbA">YouTube video</a> demonstrates.</p>
<p>This inspired me to apply the same concept to a couple of historic videos taken from my hometown (Paris, Texas.) Granted, this older footage wasn't captured from a precisely-positioned drone. Nevertheless, I was still ultimately impressed with the results.</p>
<p>The first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXdI7IZnXVU&amp;t=376s">video</a> was recorded by Phil Johnson in 1964. Because he panned the camera around the downtown square, I was able to take advantage of those video frames by extracting them and culling the unnecessary / blurry stills. Then after processing those with Photoshop's <em>Auto-Align Layers</em> and <em>Auto-Blend Layers</em>, I ended with this set of nicely generated panoramas:</p>

<img src="https://www.joeycato.com/static/parispan64-square-nw-1f9237505b7fb312749f5b0f99cff13a.png">
<p>Happy with the results, I decided to repeat the same experiment with another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdLgwqaItGY">video</a> ( filmed from same location, but in 1927. )</p>
<p>This time I cranked it up a notch. In addition to generating multiple panoramas I also composited those together to create a super panorama. To accomplish this I relied on Photoshop's <em>Free Transform</em> and <em>Content Fill</em> options to smoothly align and blend the overlapping sections.</p>
<img src="https://www.joeycato.com/static/parispan27-square-comp-c533016e33a3190b7118a8cf717237d9.png">
<p>I was quite amazed with the results. Seeing the old downtown square in one single wide shot gave me a unique way to view and appreciate the past.</p></article></div>]]>

February 7, 2021 | http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/communicate_architecture.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/communicate_architecture.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Repeatedly software architects tell me that
their stakeholders pay no attention to their architecture.
One question I always have: Did you actually tell them?
An answer I got was that it was discussed
with some other team member a year ago.
Since <a href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/definitions_software_architecture.html">architecture is important</a>,
they expect such knowledge to spread on its own.
Unfortunately, natural spread does not happen.
Maybe because "important" is very often steamrolled by "urgent".
Maybe because the architecture has subtle complexities which get lost.
Thus the proper communication is a task many architects neglect.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: This is about architectures which affect many people.
For a single team, the natural spread can be sufficient.)</p>
<h2>How architects should spend their time</h2>
<p>This raises the question how much time an architect should spend on communication.
<a href="https://philippe.kruchten.com/">Philippe Kruchten</a>,
a well known researcher, gave an answer in
<em>What do software architects really do?</em> (<a href="https://pkruchten.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/kruchten_2008_journal-of-systems-and-software.pdf">pdf</a>).
The abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be successful, a software architect—or a software architecture team, collectively—must strike a delicate balance between an external focus—both outwards: Listening to customers, users, watching technology, developing a long-term vision, and inwards: driving the development teams—and an internal,reflective focus: spending time to make the right design choices, validating them, and documenting them.
Teams that stray too far away from this meta stable equilibrium fall into some traps that we describe as antipatterns of software architecture teams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Kruchten distinguishes between three working modes of an architect.
As a knowledge worker, it roughly maps to the input, processing, and output of information.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Internal working</strong>:
   This is the deep work an architect performs,
   essentially thinking and processing information.
   It may involve communication if there is a whole team of architects.</li>
<li><strong>Inwards communication</strong>:
   Architects must acquire a broad knowledge.
   This involves listening, reading, and asking questions.</li>
<li><strong>Outwards communication</strong>:
   Once new information is created, the architect spreads it.
   This involves presentations, writing documentation, and supporting.</li>
</ol>
<p>The ideal balance, according to Kruchten, is 50:25:25.
So only half the time the architect should spend on developing the architecture.
The other half is split in learning about the current state
and communicating the desired state.</p>
<p><img alt="50:25:25" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/arch_50-25-25.jpeg"></p>
<p>If the balance is lost,
various clichees are the result.</p>
<p>One example are perfectionists, who neglect the outward communication.
Kruchten calls it "goldplating" the architecture.
While the work product is great,
it is obsolete on arrival.</p>
<p><img alt="60:30:10" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/arch_60-30-10.jpeg"></p>
<p>An architect who neglects outward and inward communication
works "in an ivory tower".
While the work product might be internally consistent
and beautiful enough to make the creators arrogant,
it is impractical and thus ignored.
Especially academics tend to fall into this trap.</p>
<p><img alt="70:15:15" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/arch_70-15-15.jpeg"></p>
<p>If the architect neglects the internal working,
the absence of a consistent architecture will show in the overall product.
It might consist of well crafted parts
but they don't fit together well.</p>
<p><img alt="30:40:30" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/arch_30-40-30.jpeg"></p>
<p>An extreme focus on the outward communication turns the architect into a consultant.
While the developers appreciate the support,
there is no coherent mind behind the architecture.</p>
<p><img alt="25:25:50" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/arch_25-25-50.jpeg"></p>
<p>In practice there seems to be no extreme focus on inward communication.
It might be that such architects produce
neither architecture documentation nor do they support the team.
So they produce nothing of even superficial value and
do not survive for long for business reasons.</p>
<h2>Effectively communicating the architecture</h2>
<p>Let's come back to the initial question:
Why don't people know the architecture well enough?
Assuming there is solid architecture,
the architect is either goldplating or working in an ivory tower.
In both cases, the outward communication is lacking,
so more focus should be put there.
Here are a few ideas which worked for me.</p>
<h3>Asynchronous Communication</h3>
<p>I love asynchronous communication.
As does Elon Musk, so it must be truly great.</p>
<p><img alt="Elon Musk communicates asynchronously" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/elon_musk_async.jpeg"></p>
<p>The big advantage of asynchronous communication is
that it scales much better.
In the case of email, you can copy&amp;paste or forward information quickly.
Actually, writing in general scales well.
Unfortunately, writing skills are underrated in my profession.
Other media like podcasts or videos can also scale,
but I rarely see them used in the context of software architecture.</p>
<p>What is used heavily are diagrams.
Unfortunately, the focus is too extreme.
I have seen lots and lots of architectural diagrams
which are incomprehensible because textual explanation was missing.
Some diagrams are inherently bad (for example they use inconsistent symbols)
but even good diagrams require context.</p>
<p>The slides of great presentations are similar.
They were designed to work in a presentation.
For example, Steve Jobs' keynotes are legendary.
Here is one of the most important moments of them all.</p>
<p><img alt="Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/steve_jobs_keynote.jpeg"></p>
<p>The slide shows three icons of three relevant technologies.
During the next seconds later he announces the iPhone
which combines those three technologies into one device.
The slide works as part of the narrative context
but on its own is useless.
If you design slides to also work as a handout on their own,
the presentation will suffer for it.</p>
<p>Well, if you remember the presentation
the slide works as a reminder though.
Likewise, my hypothesis is that most architecture diagrams
are only useful as a memory aid.
To become an effective communication medium it requires more.</p>
<p>One case of asynchronous communication are architectural decision records
and <a href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/decision_records.html">I already wrote about them</a>.
In our context here the relevant aspect is that
decision records should be comprehensible on their own,
so you can give people a link to them
and they can learn about an aspect of the architecture on their own.
You don't have to explain it to them.
This doesn't mean you focus <em>more</em> time on outward communication
but you spend it more efficiently.</p>
<h3>Regular Newsletter</h3>
<p>For the last two years, I sent a weekly newsletter to everybody in my project,
which is roughly 250 people.
Additionally, a few dozen other people receive it as well
because they asked explicitly.
This shotgun approach means that
at least half of the recipients are not my target audience
because they are no developers.
However, even managers appreciated it as it gives them an impression
of the technical issues in the project.
My department head said "please, don't stop writing them!"</p>
<p>The newsletter is composed of whatever crosses my desk during the week.
It might a little tool how-to which I felt was not known enough yet.
It announces new architectural decision records
and upcoming/ongoing initiatives.
Sometimes developers learned something
they should have gotten from project management weeks ago.</p>
<p>Blogging experience helps a lot for writing such a newsletter.
The oldest blog post here is from 2009
and I blogged a few years before that already.
The most important part of such a newsletter is to do it consistently.</p>
<p>I use meme pictures.
They are out of the ordinary at my work
and they actually distract from the seriousness of some information.
However, multiple people told me that they only wanted to look at the funny pictures
and later realized they read the whole mail.
Also, developers appreciate the hacker vibes they know
from the internet sites they visit regularly.
Some told me, the newsletter was the highlight of their week.</p>
<p>Also helpful is writing scientific papers.
Assuming proper reviewing from supportive colleagues,
you train to write terse yet correct.
My newsletter only contains short summaries but plenty of links for more details.
Sometimes I even sneak in some self-promotion, like links to my blog here.
(I wonder if <em>you</em> found this via such a link?)</p>
<h3>The Universal Language is Concrete</h3>
<p>The book <a href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/made_to_stick.html">Made to Stick</a>
contains many ideas to make a message more memorable (sticky).
One of them is concreteness
and they tell a story about the conflict
between manufacturing people on the shop floor
and engineers drawing blueprints (page 115).
That resembles the architect-developer roles quite well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The manufacturing people were thinking, <em>Why don't you just come down to the factory floor and show me where the part should go?</em> And the engineering people were thinking, <em>What do I need to do to make the drawings better?</em></p>
<p>[...] Should both parties learn greater empathy for the other and, in essence, meet in the middle? Actually, no. The solution is for the engineers to change their behavior. Why? As Bechky notes, the physical machine was the most effective and relevant domain of communication. Everyone understands the machines fluently. Therefore problems should be solved at the level of the machine. [...]</p>
<p>The moral of the story is not to "dumb things down." The manufacturing people faced complex problems and they needed smart answers. Rather, the moral of the story is to find a "universal language," one that everyone speaks fluently. Inevitably, that universal language will be concrete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds remarkably similar to our initial question.
Developers might ignore the architecture because
it is not concrete enough for their problem at hand.
The book strongly suggests that the solution is not that developers
should be educated better.
It puts the burden on the architects to explain the architecture
in concrete situations.</p>
<p>My newsletter reinforces this.
Since I need to pump out something every week,
I have to pick something small to fill it.
Even if it is not relevant to everybody,
it nudges me to explain the wider architectural background.</p>
<p>Abstractions are the luxury of the expert.
They are shortcuts between well known concrete concepts.
If the concepts are not well understood yet,
the abstraction is not helpful.
So architects should rarely talk about the big overview.
At least, keep it short and rough.</p>
<p>All this concrete communication implies a lot of work for the architect
in comparison to mere abstract outlines.
Remember it should only take you 25% of your time, …</p></article></div>

      <div>
  
  <p><span>3 May 2020</span></p><p>If you are a regular contributor to an open source project on GitHub pushing code changes via pull requests, it is a good idea to delete the branches that have been merged and no longer needed.</p>

<p>I like to make sure that I keep my repositories up to date and employ good branch hygiene, making sure that I only have branches that I am working on in my GitHub forks and locally on my machine.</p>

<p>Currently we release a new version of the Office 365 CLI on a weekend, so I’ve got into a habit of using this day to sync my fork, ensuring that both the <code>master</code> and <code>dev</code> branches are up to date and cleanup up any branches that I don’t need anymore.</p>

<p>Now reading the title of this post, I’m sure you can now imagine what prompted me to write it… yes, you guessed it, I deleted a branch that I still needed, both from my fork in GitHub and locally. To make matters worse, deleting this branch automatically caused my open pull request causing it to be instantly closed.</p>

<p><img src="https://garrytrinder.github.io/public/img/git/deleted-source-branch.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As it turns out, this was fairly simple to fix. Every commit that you make in Git is uniquely recorded with a SHA-1 checksum and we can use this to create a new branch from, essentially recreating the branch from a point in time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;start_point&gt;</strong></p>

  <p>Create a new branch named &lt;branch&gt; and start it at &lt;start_point&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important part is obtaining the commit SHA-1 checksum of my commit. I was able to get this from my closed pull request by viewing the <code>Commits</code> tab on the pull request and copying the commit SHA-1 using the <code>copy</code> button.</p>

<p><img src="https://garrytrinder.github.io/public/img/git/copy-commit-sha1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Using the <code>git checkout</code> command, I was able to then re-create the branch locally and push the branch back up to my fork in GitHub, which restored the branch that my pull request was referencing.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git checkout -b auth-filestorage a1a12389bbefdf1aa197d04940b48d8641bbeae7
git push --set-upstream origin auth-filestorage
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://garrytrinder.github.io/public/img/git/restored-branch.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This then allowed my to reopen my pull request 🙌🏻</p>

<p><img src="https://garrytrinder.github.io/public/img/git/reopen-pull-request.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Crisis averted.</p>

<p>Tesla Semi Truck prototypes have again started appearing in different US states, this time, the color is white on these ones. At the first look, both of the white Tesla Semis seen in different US states seem to be the same truck, but looking closely, we can see the differences.</p>



<p>Tesla has also made slight changes to the exterior of the class-8 electric hauler that suggests the automaker is performing further R&amp;D. By testing these trucks on public roads, Tesla has been gathering real-world data for a few years now.</p>



<p>I have also compared two of the recently seen Tesla Semis from behind where both have different electrical boxes installed at the back which indicates that Tesla is also experimenting with variable electrical and battery management systems.</p>



<p>Let’s first look at the side profile of the new <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/semi-truck/">Tesla Semi Truck</a> prototype seen in the video of the Trucker/YouTuber Cory Draper. Tesla has made several small and big changes to the side profile that  I have tried to illustrate in the following single diagram (changes I have highlighted in this prototype can be compared to the official photo of the Tesla Semi added in the picture).</p>

Illustrated by Iqtidar Ali / image by Cory Draper (full video below). Click/Tap to zoom-in.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Following is the list of changes I have found in the exterior of this latest Tesla Semi prototype:</p>



<ul><li>Roof cab length is reduced by about 50% (visual estimate), this area previously expanded to the entire cabin’s length as seen in the official photo (above).</li><li>Roof cab height is also reduced significantly, but Tesla has been playing with it every now and then from the start. This is probably done to obtain an optimum point between utility and aerodynamic drag reduction.</li><li><strong>Window expansion / Sleeper Cabin:</strong> The most significant change I encountered in this prototype is the expansion of the ‘window’. Now it expands to around 70% of the rear cabin’s (area behind driver’s compartment), this is seen for the first time. I think this is now slowly converting to a sleeper cabin as Tesla said it was in the works. In one of my 2018 articles on the Tesla Semi spotting, <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/semi-sleeper-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I speculated</a> this area would convert to a sleeper and this space would be used as a sleeper cabin.</li><li>A black box above the 2nd cabin (sleeper) can be seen in the side profile photo above, this space was previously hollow (see old version photo below). Truckers need a sleeper and Tesla is surely going to give them one.</li><li>The rearmost panel has also extruded out a little and the curve on the bottom has been shortened to adjust for the modified side profile.</li></ul>



<h2>Electrical System Variations</h2>



<p>The following two photos of the rear area of the Tesla Semi Truck show two variations of an electrical systems box. In one prototype, the box looks like a rectangular chest placed in the middle. The other prototype’s electrical system casing is more rectangular and smaller in size, it’s also placed on the left side rather than the middle.</p>



<p>For understanding, I have named these electrical junction box variations, Design Type 1 and 2. This used to be a deep hollow space in prototypes seen before this one (pic below), now they have utilized the space more efficiently.</p>

<p>This variation in the electrical system box designs might also be due to the short and long range variants, 300 and 500 mile range respectively. </p>



<p>Tesla Semi prototype with the bigger electrical junction box was probably seen in Indiana, trucker/YouTuber Cory Draper shows us a detailed walkaround of this electric beast. This looks like a brand new un-used truck with the packaging material still intact in places, probably heading for a client demonstration.</p>



<p>The other prototype (pics below) was spotted in Chicago, IL, and was pretty dirty, most probably coming back from a rigorous testing session in muddy terrain.</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/02/01/listen-to-tesla-q4-2020-earnings-call-detailed-summary-of-musks-answers/">Q4 2020 Tesla Earnings Call</a>, CEO Elon Musk said that the Tesla Semi Truck needs at least 5X more batteries used in a car. So battery supply constraint is the main reason hindering the Tesla Semi production start. Although in a company email last year Musk told Tesla employees that <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/06/10/tesla-semi-bring-volume-production/">it’s time to bring the electric Semi to volume production</a> but the timeline seems to have been pushed to later this year.</p>



<p>Looks like production start delays are not getting in the way of more and more companies pre-ordering the electric hauler, Tesla just <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/11/05/pge-places-a-huge-tesla-semi-truck-order/">received its biggest Tesla Semi Truck order</a> towards the end of last year. A Tesla Semi <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/semi-truck-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">order tracking page</a> that I have now maintained for almost the last 3 years shows that the Silicon Valley-based automaker has 788 trucks on the reservation with 41 publicly known pre-orders by corporations, small freight management companies, and individuals.</p>

<p>As neuroscientists like to say, we need tractable definitions. However, the term "Tools For Thought", which we use to describe tools like RemNote or Roam Research, is not clearly defined.</p>

<p>In their work, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">How can we develop transformative Tools For Thought? </a> Michael Nielsen and Andy Matuschak describe the history of the term. The first usage of this term goes back to the early computer pioneers. In their essay, they state that they are using the word as a catch-all phrase. The main problem I see with it is that it does not differentiate between cognitive, e.g., cultural-evolutionary tools (like Hindu-Arabic numerals) and SaaS-like tools.</p>
<p>Thinking and Thoughts are also not clearly defined. For example, thought can be indulgence into an imaginative or pleasurable experience and, therefore, something that we don't try to improve through a tool's usage.</p>

<h2 id="history"><a href="#history" aria-label="history permalink"></a>History</h2>
<p>This research goes back to the 1960s with the pioneering work of Douglas C. Engelbart. He viewed the process of <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138">Augmenting Human Intellect</a> as increasing the capability to solve complex problems by information handling and symbol structuring and to gain comprehension. The vision developed by Engelbart, J. C. R. Licklider, Alan Kay, and others had a strong influence on later entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>The field was finally formed in early 2000 under "Augmented Cognition" and instituted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_cognition">Augmented Cognition Program</a>, which was renamed to <em>Improving Warfighter Information Intake Under Stress Program</em> in 2001. The program was separated into four phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure cognitive state</li>
<li>Manipulate cognitive state</li>
<li>Exploit human sensory channels</li>
<li>Optimize information allocation</li>
</ol>
<p>The main conference of the field is the <a href="http://2021.hci.international/ac">Augmented Cognition (AC) Conference</a>, an affiliated conference of the HCI International Conference, which will arrive at its 15th edition this July. Its last edition of 2018 brought forth two volumes of papers: <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-91470-1">Augmented Cognition: Intelligent Technologies</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-91467-1">Augmented Cognition: Users and Contexts</a>.</p>
<p>The research field today relies heavily on the terminology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">Cognitive Load Theory</a>. As we have seen, a big focus of the domain is to reduce Cognitive Overload. One way to do this is by developing schemas that act as memory templates coded into Long Term Memory by Working memory. If we help the users create new or surface relevant schemas like an effective Mnemonic, we will be able to reduce their Cognitive Load, increase their productivity, and reduce the rate of error.</p>
<p>A second useful and related framework is the one of <a href="https://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/DistributedCognition-TOCHI.pdf">Distributed Cognition</a>. It stated that cognitive processes are defined by the functional relationship among elements that participate in them and not by the spatial colocation of its elements. We will look at cloud-architectures that describe the combination of cognitive modules for augmentation interfaces later.</p>

<p>In 2016, Michael Nielsen, in his essay <a href="http://cognitivemedium.com/tat/">Thought as a Technology</a>, described the term cognitive technology as an external artifact designed by humans, which can be internalized and used as a substrate for cognition. These are representations invented by other people, such as words, graphs, maps, algebra, mathematical diagrams, etc. He further differentiated between Models of Augmentation as Cognitive Transformation (e.g., spreadsheet) or Cognitive Outsourcing (e.g., calculator).</p>
<p>A year later, in a paper titled, <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/aia/">Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence</a> he and his colleague Shan Carter expanded the concept into differentiating between Cognitive technology using Computers and Cognitive technology using Artificial Intelligence. The former is expanding human thought itself, meaning the computer performed action becomes a new generalizable concept. An example they give is the concept of applying a stamp in Photoshop to another layer. This concept is then generalized as "computer, [new type of action] this [new type of representation for a newly imagined class of object]".</p>
<p>Cognitive technology using Artificial Intelligence discovers and reveals deep principles in ways meaningful to the user. The example they give here is an Interactive Generative Adversarial Model (iGAN) that, for example, shows a fashion designer useful operation as new primitives that he can then internalize.</p>
<h2 id="personal-knowledge-management"><a href="#personal-knowledge-management" aria-label="personal knowledge management permalink"></a>Personal Knowledge Management</h2>
<p>A related concept, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">Personal knowledge management
</a> (PKM), is one way to Augmented Cognition. By helping us manage and externalize our knowledge, these systems enable us to work with a more significant knowledge base. In a broad sense, the accumulation of knowledge and know-how by networks of Personbytes can be seen as the basis for scientific and economic development described by César Hidalgo in his <a href="https://books.google.de/books/about/Why_Information_Grows.html?id=hgOyBQAAQBAJ">Why Information Grows</a>. PKM systems are often called "Second Brains.", but most of them act more as a storage medium and replica of its user's actual body of knowledge. At <a href="https://www.remnote.io/">RemNote</a>, we try to not just help you create a copy of your knowledge but an extension and augmentation of your brain.</p>

<p>In his seminal work from 1945 <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>, Vannevar Bush describes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a> (a very advanced association-based PKM). It should be able to retrieve and reproduce items many years old. He also describes its sharing-features as <em>"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the Memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. ..."</em></p>
<p>But there has not been actual scientific work to engineer a cognition augmenting device as he describes it. However, this changed recently. In June 2019, two researchers published their work <a href="https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/132846/1/cogment2019.pdf">Augmenting Cognition Through Edge Computing</a>, describing such a system's possible architecture: The RECALL Augmenting Memory architecture. It can, for example, help users restore context before their next conference or class. The student, walking to a lecture, could be primed with a summary of it through his smart glasses, surfacing relevant information. The description of the "Memory vault" in this architecture exhibits a high similarity to Vannevar Bush's Memex.</p>
<p>But have people start building such a device? Recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd34OMunStg">leaks about the startup Hu.ma.ne</a> hinted that they are building a contextual recall memory device that can help with memory recall.</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-state-measurement"><a href="#cognitive-state-measurement" aria-label="cognitive state measurement permalink"></a>Cognitive State measurement</h2>
<p>As we saw in the list of Goals of the Augmented Cognition Program, a great deal of research focuses on "Measure cognitive state." Many possible applications of adjusting information presentation to the user's cognitive abilities and background knowledge come to mind. For example, one could auto-control an audiobook's playback speed based on the listener's measured cognitive load.</p>
<h2 id="augmented-reality"><a href="#augmented-reality" aria-label="augmented reality permalink"></a>Augmented Reality</h2>
<p>AR Interfaces leverage the cognitive processing speed of visuospatial data, e.g., the strong visuospatial perception that human evolution created. This is why they can be predicted to be the next paradigm of Human-computer interfaces. Those interfaces will give rise to many new ways of interacting with computation and new types of media. The advances in UX design show that interactions with digital interfaces become ever more natural and intuitive. Following the doctrine of <em>Build Glasses, not Binoculars</em> (<a href="https://videos.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/video/5251-k03-making-humans-smarter-than-artificial-intelligence-digital-technologies-to-amplify-human-perception-and-cognition/">Albrecht Schmidt 2019</a>), we can envision AR Interfaces that allow us to browse a three-dimensional multimedia environment by navigating hand gestures rather than positioning a mouse on a desk.</p>
<h2 id="cognition-augmentation-software-for-learning"><a href="#cognition-augmentation-software-for-learning" aria-label="cognition augmentation software for learning permalink"></a>Cognition Augmentation Software for Learning</h2>
<p>When augmenting cognitive processes, the most useful application is to look for the most cognitively taxing tasks, with learning being one of them. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_3.0">Life 3.0</a>, Max Tegmark describes a fictional AI, Prometheus, that helps humans learn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Given any person's knowledge and abilities, Prometheus could determine the fastest way for them to learn any new subject in a manner that kept them highly engaged and motivated to continue and produce the corresponding optimized videos, reading materials, exercises, and other learning tools. [...] by leveraging Prometheus' movie-making talents, the video segments would truly engage, providing powerful metaphors that you would relate to, leaving you craving to learn more."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm optimistic that, given the technical feasibility, we will see the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system">intelligent tutoring systems</a> in the coming decades.</p>

<p>The future for CAS is bright and made inevitable through the acceleration of technology standards. One can describe three of those technology factors as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>superior sensing and capturing systems</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g., the possibility of continuous collection of memory cues through life-logging</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>advances in audio and image processing enabling widespread mining of stored cues for proactive presentation</li>
<li>pervasiveness of displays for displaying memory cues</li>
</ul>
<p>In their essay, Michael Nielsen and Andy Matuschak describe the difficulty for developers of Tools For Thought to prevent copy-cats. They give the examples of Adobe, which invested heavily in developing their products and is now copied or disrupted by cloud-based companies like Figma. Considering the economic drivers discussed, one can be optimistic that future CAS (or Cognitive technology using Artificial Intelligence) that leverage proprietary AI and AR technology will have less of those difficulties.</p>
<p>As mentioned, many innovations we take for granted today originated out of AC research. However, to date, most of the research is intended for and was funded by military and defense …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h3>

<p>The above is basically Jens Otten’s prover from the “Build Your Own First-Order Prover” at CADE 2019 <a href="http://jens-otten.de/tutorial_cade19/">http://jens-otten.de/tutorial_cade19/</a> in particular lecture 2.
I added a tracing parameter to it so that I can draw the sequent using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>.
Note that my javascript is looking for a query variable called <code>Proof</code> in order to draw the output.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-proof-anyway">What is a Proof Anyway?</h3>

<p>Proofs are actions or things that convince you of something.</p>

<p>How’s that for really nailing it down?</p>

<p>Some examples of stuff that might be considered “proof”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A solution to a set of linear equations is proof that they can be solved.</li>
  <li>A dual vector is proof of optimality of a linear program.</li>
  <li>A convincing English paragraph is proof.</li>
  <li>Use of a cryptographic key can prove your identity.</li>
  <li>A trace of a complete search program that failed to find a solution is proof of its nonexistence.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a sense that for something to be a proof requires it to be relatively easy to check the proof.</p>

<p>A narrower view of proof is that proof is a pile of formal manipulations of syntax.
One thing that you can prove is the truth of a proposition combined using logical connectives.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent">sequent</a> is a structure that represents a partial state of a proof. It contains a breakdown of formula.
$ A,B,C,… \vdash D,E,F,…$. Spiritually a sequent represents the knowledge or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_(mathematical_logic)">judgement</a> that the conjunction of the antecedents implies one of the consequents, but a sequent could be just considered pure syntax, merely a dead data structure to hold a pile of meaningless symbols.</p>

<p>The sequent proof viewed from the bottom up is a stepwise breakdown of formula until they are trivially true.
From the top down it is the combination of simpler facts into more complicated ones.</p>

<p>It’s all a very funny shell game. Somehow proofs take small steps that each feel so simple that they aren’t doing anything and build up a statement that is non obvious.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog">Prolog</a> is neat. Here I’m using <a href="http://tau-prolog.org/">Tau Prolog</a>, which a prolog that is written in Javascript.
Prolog is roughly what you get when you add search and unification as primitive constructs in a language.</p>

<p>Prolog has multiple readings, which makes it pretty special.
In one reading Prolog formula are themselves statements of axioms of a particular form (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn clauses</a>) that lends itself to a simple proof procedure.
It also has a fairly declarative reading as a nondeterminstic match statement that tries each match in turn.
Another interesting one is to consider <code>:-</code> to be the horizontal bar of an inference rule.</p>

<p>One model of the state of a prolog execution is as a sequent. The trace of prolog execution is is a sequent style proof. See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Higher-Order-Logic-Dale-Miller/dp/052187940X">Nadathur and Miller</a> or Frank Pfenning’s <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15317-f17/">notes</a> for more</p>

<p>Notable tricks from the <a href="http://jens-otten.de/tutorial_cade19/">Jens Otten</a> tutorial (which I highly recommend):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Invertible rules. Rules that are reversible (in what sense?) can be eagerly applied. Use cuts !</li>
  <li>Using prolog variables and <code>copy_term</code>. Prolog variables may not work for higher order logic, but they do work for first order, since we’re never substituting a bound variable inside another. Prolog variables are a different face . The trick to Keep some terms around is to include a Freevar list in copy term.</li>
  <li>Skolemization</li>
  <li>Iterative deepening. No surprise here. This is a pretty standard way of making prolog search complete.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more on these tricks, it is worthwhile to examine the leanTAP paper <a href="https://formal.iti.kit.edu/beckert/leantap/">https://formal.iti.kit.edu/beckert/leantap/</a>.</p>

<p>There is a little bit of glue code in javascript to call the Tau Prolog solver. I used HTML textarea as input elements and sort of willy nilly grabbed from them.</p>

<h3 id="the-pretty-printer">The Pretty Printer</h3>

<p>The pretty printer is straightforward and a little janky. I am using the bussproofs package that is included in mathjax to write out my proofs trees nice.
<a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/bussproofs.html?highlight=bussproofs">http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/bussproofs.html?highlight=bussproofs</a></p>

<p>Bussproofs flatten the tree as a post order traversal, meaning you write a node after all it’s children have been visited. It is most easily seen by examining this example. You can read more here <a href="https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/bussproofs/BussGuide2_Smith2012.pdf">https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/bussproofs/BussGuide2_Smith2012.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>Traversing through returned Tau Prolog objects is pretty straightforward. There are <code>id</code> fields that hold the name of the functor and <code>args</code> is an array holds the children. I figured it out via judicious use <code>console.log</code> as Tau Prolog doesn’t have the most documentation I’ve ever seen.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p><em>February 2, 2021</em></p><p>Since my previous post walked through the process of setting up <a href="https://uglyduck.ca/fathom-analytics-netlify">Fathom PRO on Netlify</a>, I figured it made sense to create a similar tutorial for the “Lite” variation, self-hosted on DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>Please note that while I think the PRO version of <a target="_blank" href="https://usefathom.com/ref/DKHJVX">Fathom Analytics</a> is truly great, for my small, niche blog it seemed overkill compared to self-hosting. Switching over from $14/mo to $5/mo while retaining most of the same functionality was a no-brainer. Choose the option that best suits your needs (or in the case - budget &amp; bandwidth).</p>

<p>With that cleared up - let’s get into it!</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<ol>
  <li>One or more website(s) where you would like to include analytics</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://m.do.co/c/74b3fd11c07a">DigitalOcean account</a> (<strong>this link will give you a $100 credit!</strong>)</li>
  <li>Positive attitude and passion for privacy-respecting analytics!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="create-a-droplet">Create a Droplet</h2>

<p>Once your DigitalOcean account is setup, navigate to the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/">Marketplace</a> and search for <code>Fathom Analytics</code>. Then click the <code>Create Fathom Analytics Droplet</code>.</p>

<p>From here you’ll be brought to a page that allows you to customize the specifications of your new droplet. If you’re a smaller traffic site (personal blog, etc) selecting the <strong>$5/month</strong> Basic Shared CPU option is your best bet.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/fathom-create-droplet-details.png" alt="Fathom Droplet Details">
    <figcaption>Creating the new droplet</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Select the data-center region based on where most of your traffic originates from. I would suggest enabling <code>IPv6</code> and setting up your authentication via SSH instead of a regular password system. Adding backups is entirely at your own discretion.</p>

<p>Once you’re ready, click <strong>Create Droplet</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-matrix-not-really">Enter the Matrix (not really)</h2>

<p>Once DigitalOcean finishes spinning up your new droplet, open a terminal and connect to it by entering:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh root@YOUR_DROPLET_IP</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you setup your login via SSH everything should work as-is. If you went the password route, you’ll given a prompt to enter it.</p>

<p>Now that you’re connected, Fathom will guide you through a simple configuration setup. It’s fairly straightforward and painless. Once complete, move to the next step.</p>

<h2 id="domains">Domains</h2>

<p>You’ll most likely want to host this instance on your own domain or subdomain - instead of connecting directly via the droplet’s <code>IP</code>. Head over to your <strong>Networking</strong> page in the sidebar of DigitalOcean and add your custom domain.</p>

<p>Then, click on that newly added domain - we need to add some new records. You’re going to add two new <code>A</code> records to this domain:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Hostname</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>@</td>
            <td>YOUR_DROPLET_IP</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>www</td>
            <td>YOUR_DROPLET_IP</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The last thing you need to do is set your nameservers to point to DigitalOcean:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">ns1.digitalocean.com
ns2.digitalocean.com
ns3.digitalocean.com</code></pre></figure>

<p>Give it some time to propagate and you’ll be in business!</p>

<h2 id="ssl-ftw">SSL FTW</h2>

<p>There is hardly a good reason not to practice security on the web, so setting up your new analytics to be served over <code>HTTPS</code> is just the smart thing to do. Did I mention that this is completely free as well? See - no excuses.</p>

<p>In order to get a free SSL certificate setup, you’ll need to install <code>certbot</code>. While connected to your droplet, enter the following:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>python-certbot-nginx</code></pre></figure>

<p>Once installed, enter the following to setup SSL (remember to swap out the domain with your own):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">certbot <span>--nginx</span> <span>-d</span> your-cool-domain.com</code></pre></figure>

<p>Follow the steps (it’s very quick and easy) and you’ll have <code>HTTPS</code> setup in a jiffy!</p>

<h2 id="the-final-lap">The Final Lap</h2>

<p>The last thing to do is login to your newly self-hosted Fathom instance, add your site you wish to track, grab the generated tracking code and then slap that badboy on whatever pages you need to track!</p>

<p>Congrats! You’re now officially running your own set of analytics tools. You should be happy about what you’ve accomplished and proud for respecting your users’ privacy!</p>

      <h4>Leon Wieseltier</h4>
      <h3>Steadying</h3>
      <p>For some time now it has felt like history is itself the pandemic. In our country and elsewhere, it has been in overdrive, teeming with evils, flush with collapses, abounding in fear and rage, a wounding contest between the sense of an ending and the sense of a beginning, between inertia and momentum, with all the terribilities of ages of transition. What is going has not yet gone and what is coming has not yet come. We have become connoisseurs of convulsion. At sea is our new sea.</p>
<p>For better and for worse, axioms and assumptions are dying everywhere around us. Such vertiginous hours always come with both clarities and confusions — there is no promise of illumination. The guidance we need in our circumstances will not be provided by the circumstances themselves: they are too many and too contradictory and too volatile; passion increasingly unconstrained and power increasingly unconstrained. As the sense of injustice grows, injustice seems to keep pace with it. There is a piercing sensation of flux, of uncontrollable effects and unmanageable consequences. The masks on our faces are emblems of an entire era of vulnerability. The most important thing, therefore, is that we keep our heads. A disequilibrium of history demands an equilibrium of the mind. Steadiness in the midst of turbulence is not complicity with the existing order. It is precisely in such binges of history that we must teach ourselves to sort through the true and the false, the good and the bad, the continuities and the discontinuities, the right statues and the wrong statues, the humane and the utopian.</p>
<p>Everything will be different: this is a ubiquitous sentiment. In all our upheavals — social and epidemiological — so much seems to be wrong and so much seems to be slipping away that one may be forgiven for enjoying a fantasy of total change. All these horrors, all these outrages, all these marches, and the world stays the same? So the first thing that needs to be said in the effort to keep our heads is that everything never changes. More, the idea that everything will change usually plays into the hands of those who want nothing to change. The cycle of revolution and reaction has never been the most effective engine of progress. Nothing suits the interests of the old regime like utopianism. The thirst for change will not be slaked by the cheap whiskey of apocalyptic thinking. The only certain outcome of the apocalyptic temper is catharsis, and one way of describing the decline of our politics in recent decades is that it has increasingly become a politics of catharsis, in which crisis is met mainly by emotion. (Populism is just mass emotionalism, and the emotions are often ugly ones.) Apocalypse is not an analysis, it is the death of analysis. It sets the stage only for salvation, but salvation must never become a political goal. This is especially true in a democratic society, where the only saviors are, alas, ourselves.</p>
<p>Thus it is that the struggle against injustice imposes upon us a paradoxical psychology: it demands both impatience and patience. Impatience about injustice, patience about justice. This is hard to do. It looks too much like, and in many cases it may well be, complacence. It is certainly difficult to preach incrementalism to the injured. So why not be impatient about justice, too? There are historical and practical reasons why not. History is stained by tales of instantaneous justice, by the consequences of the rush to perfection, by the victims of the victims. The ethical calculus of means and ends is never teleologically suspended, if just causes are to remain just. Nor is it a quantitative calculus: when I first studied the modern history of the Jews I drew a variety of conclusions from the Dreyfus affair, and one of them, which was an important moment in my moral education, was that Zola and his comrades appropriately threw an entire country into crisis for the sake of <i>one man</i>. Similarly, due process is not a legal formality, a procedural exercise that slows the way to a satisfying climax; it is the very honor of a liberal society.</p>
<p>More concretely, the establishment of justice involves not only revisions in opinions but also revisions in institutions. A dreary point! But anyone who denies the institutional dimension, in all its exasperating machinery, is not serious about the change. Paroxysms, unlike laws, vanish. This was the year in which the campaign for racial justice found support in virtually all the sectors of American society, with the exception of the White House — an unprecedented national epiphany that cannot be dismissed as “performative”, because culture matters; but the road from protest to policy is long and winding. It is not a betrayal of the ideal of social justice to tread carefully and tenaciously, with a mastery of the scruples and the methods that would make a reform defensible and durable. Tenacity is what patience looks like in the middle of a struggle.</p>
<p>I will give an example of the complicated nature of the mentality of change. One of the consequences of recent social movements in America — #MeToo (which came also to my door, with its lesson and its recklessness) and Black Lives Matter—has been to reveal how poorly we understand each other. Or more precisely, they have exposed the extent to which the failure to understand others may be owed to the failure to understand oneself — the limitations of one’s own standpoint, the comfortable assumption that one appears to others as one wishes to appear to them, or to oneself. This is nonsense, though sometimes you learn so the hard way. There are limits to our epistemological jurisdiction. The failure to observe these limits is solipsism, and we all begin as solipsists, awaiting correction by social experience.</p>
<p>Our epistemological jurisdiction stops at the encounter with another person. She is another epistemological kingdom, not more perfect but certainly different, with something important to add, and a perceptual contribution to make. I may like to think that I am what I present myself to be, but I am also what she sees me to be, because she sees me as I cannot, or will not, see myself. I am never in control of my self-representation and never complete in my self-awareness. We always show more of ourselves than we think we do, which is why we may learn from the responses of others. We spill beyond our intentions and our conceits, and what we gain from this overflow is criticism.</p>
<p>But criticism, too, must be assessed critically – there is no exemption. The enlightenment that one acquires from the judgments of others is owed only to their accuracy. It is certainly not warranted by the belief that a person’s identity or socio-economic position or experience of hardship confers an absolute authority, a special relationship to truth, a vatic privilege. What a simple world it would be if pain were a sufficient guarantee of credibility. But it is not – indeed, the opposite is the case, pain is myopic and sees chiefly itself, which is one of the reasons it hurts. Finally we are all left with the modesty of our grasp. No whole classes of people are right and no whole classes of people are wrong.</p>
<p>The ineradicability of ambiguity from human relations, the ignorance of ourselves that accompanies our ignorance of others, the whole fallible heap, creates an urgent need for tolerance and, more strenuously, for forgiveness. Historians will record that in the early decades of the twenty-first century we became an unforgiving society, a society of furies, a society in search of guilt and shame, a society of sanctimonies and “struggle sessions” American-style. They will admire our awakening to prejudice but lament the sometimes prejudicial ways in which we acted on our progressive realizations. In this respect America should become more Christian. (There, I said it.) For all our elaborate culture of self-knowledge, for all the hectoring articulateness of our identity vocabularies, we are still, each of us, our own blind spots. We should welcome every person we meet as a small blow against blindness.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://libertiesjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/insignia-break.png" width="300" height="127"></p>
<p>The partiality of perspective: this is the great teaching of the contemporary tumult. The problem is that we have not only begun to acknowledge our partiality, and the partiality of others, we have also begun to revere it, and this is a mistake. We are gagging on all our roots. If pain does not provide access to truth, neither does particularity. The worship of particularism is one of the great impediments to social justice, and in its exhilarating way it coarsens us all. In our moral and social thinking, our obsession with otherness has concealed that the foundation of moral and social action is sameness. The “other” is exotic, but there is nothing exotic about the homeless man on the street: he is the same as me, a human being, except that he is hungry and I am not. The difference in our circumstances is not a difference in our definition. When I hand him a few dollars I am not extending myself toward an alien being; I am practicing species solidarity. I am not discovering his humanity; I am responding to it. I am acting, in other words, universally, and none of the social problems that afflict us will be solved unless we recover the universalist standpoint that sees beyond the visible divisions, and is not trapped in, or enraptured by, the specificities of our tribes. Pluralism secures the right to turn inward, but it also broaches the duty to turn outward. By surrounding us with other partialities it legitimates our own partiality, but it also reveals that there …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Audio on Unix is a little zoo, there are so many acronyms for projects
and APIs that it’s easy to get lost. Let’s tackle that issue! Most
articles are confusing because they either use audio technical jargon,
or because they barely scratch the surface and leave people clueless. A
little knowledge can be dangerous.<br>
In this article I’ll try to bridge the gap by not requiring any
prerequisite knowledge while also giving a good overview of the whole Unix
audio landscape. There’s going to be enough details to remove mysticism
(Oh so pernicious in web bubbles) and see how the pieces fit.</p>

<p>By the end of this article you should understand the following terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ALSA</li>
  <li>OSS</li>
  <li>ESD</li>
  <li>aRts</li>
  <li>sndio</li>
  <li>PulseAudio</li>
  <li>PipeWire</li>
  <li>GStreamer</li>
  <li>LADSPA</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll try to make sense of their utility and their link. The article
will focus a bit more on the Linux stack as it is has more components than
others and is more advanced in that respect. We’ll also skip non-open
source Unix-like systems.<br>
As usual, if you want to go in depth there’s a list of references at
the bottom.</p>

<p>Overall, we got:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hardware layer: the physical devices, input and output</li>
  <li>Kernel layer: interfacing with the different hardware and managing
their specificities (ALSA, OSS)</li>
  <li>Libraries: used by software to interface with the hardware directly,
to manipulate audio/video, to interface with an intermediate layer
for creating streams (GStreamer, Libcanberra, libpulse, libalsa, etc..),
and to have a standard format (LADSPA).</li>
  <li>Sound servers: used to make the user facing (user-level) interaction
easier, more abstract, and high level. This often acts as glue, resolving
the issue that different software speak different protocols. (PulseAudio,
ESD, aRts, PipeWire, sndio)</li>

<p>Let me preface this by saying that I am not a developer in any of these
tech, neither am I a sound engineer. I am simply regrouping my general
understanding of the tech so that anyone can get an overview of what
the pieces involved are, and maybe a bit more.</p>



<p>It’s essential to have a look at the hardware at our disposal to
understand the audio stack because anything above it will be its direct
representation.<br>
There are many types of audio interfaces, be it input or output,
with different varieties of sound cards, internal organizations,
and capabilities.
Because of this diversity of chipsets, it’s simpler to group them into
families when interacting with them.</p>

<p>Let’s list the most common logical components that these cards can have.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An interface to communicate with the card connected to the bus, be it
interrupts, IO ports, DMA (direct memory access), etc..</li>
  <li>Output devices (DAC: Digital to analog converter)</li>
  <li>Input devices  (ADC: Analog to digital converter)</li>
  <li>An output amplifier, to raise the strength of output devices</li>
  <li>An input amplifier, same as above but for input devices (ex:
microphones).</li>
  <li>Controls mechanism to allow different settings</li>
  <li>Hardware mixer, which controls each devices volume and routing,
usually volume is measured in decibel.</li>
  <li>A MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) device/controller, a
standard unified protocol to control output devices (called
synthesizers) — think of them like keyboards for sounds.</li>
  <li>A sequencer, a builtin MIDI synthesizer (output of the above)</li>
  <li>A timer used to clock audio</li>
  <li>Any other special features such as a 3D spatializer</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to have a glance at these components because everything
in the software layers attempts to make them easier to approach.</p>



<p>A couple of concepts related to the interaction between the real
and digital world are also needed to kick-start our journey.</p>

<p>In the real world, the analog world, sound is made up of waves, which
are air pressures that can be arbitrarily large.</p>

<p>Speakers generating sound have a maximum volume/amplitude, usually
represented by 0dB (decibels). Volume lower than the maximum is
represented by negative decibels: -10dB, -20dB, etc.. And no sound is
thus -∞ dB.<br>
This might be surprising and actually not really true either. Decibel
doesn’t mean much until it’s tied to a specific absolute reference
point, it’s a relative scale. You pick a value for 0dB that makes sense
for what you are trying to measure.</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/audio_unix/VU_meter.jpg" alt="vu meter" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>The measurement above is the dBFS, the dB relative to digital full-scale,
aka digital 0. There are other measurements such as dB SPL and dBV.<br>
One thing to note about decibels is that they follow a strictly
exponential law , which matches it to human perception. What sounds like
a constantly increasing volume is indicated by a constantly rising dB
meter, corresponding to an exponentially rising output power. This is why
you can hear both vanishingly soft sounds and punishingly loud sounds.
The step from the loudest you can hear up to destroying your ears or
killing you is only a few more dB.</p>

<p>While decibels are about loudness, the tone is represented as sine
waves of certain frequency, the speed. For example, the note A is a
440Hz sine wave.</p>

<p>Alright, we got the idea of decibel and tone but how do we get from
waves to our computer or in reverse? This is what we call going from
analog to digital or digital to analog.<br>
To do this we have to convert waves into discrete points in time,
taking samples per second — what we call sample rate. The higher the
sample rate, the more accurate the representation of the analog sound (a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollipop_graph">lollipop graph</a>). Each
sample has a certain accuracy, how much information we store in it,
the number of bits for each sample — what we call the bit rate (the
higher the less noise). For example, CDs use 16 bits.<br>
Which value you choose as your sample rate and bit rate will depend on
a trade-off between quality and memory use.</p>

<p><em>NB</em>: That’s why it makes no sense to convert from digital low sample
rate to digital high sample rate, you’ll just be filling the void in
the middle of the discrete points with the same data.</p>

<p>Additionally, you may need to represent how multiple channels play sound
— multichannel. For example, mono, stereo, 3d, surround, etc..</p>

<p>It’s important to note that if we want to play sounds from multiple
sources at the same time, they will need to agree on the sample rate,
bit rate, and format representation, otherwise it’ll be impossible to
mix them. That’s something essential on a desktop.</p>

<p>The last part in this equation is how to implement the mechanism to
send audio to the sound card. That highly depends on what the card
itself supports, but the usual simple mechanism is to fill buffers with
streams of sound, then let the hardware read the samples, passing them
to the DAC (digital to analog converter), to then reach the speaker,
and vice versa. Once the hardware has read enough samples it’ll do an
interrupt to notify the software side that it needs more samples. This
cyclic mechanism goes on and on in a ring fashion.<br>
If the buffer samples aren’t filled fast enough we call this an underrun
or drop-out (aka xruns), which result in a glitch, basically audio
stopping for a short period before the buffer is filled again.</p>

<p>The audio can be played at a certain sample rate, with a certain
granularity, as we’ve said. So if we call <code>buffer-size</code> the number of
samples that can be contained in a cyclic-buffer meant to be read by
the hardware, <code>fragment-size</code> or <code>period-size</code> the number of samples
after which an interrupt is generated, <code>number-fragments</code> the number of
fragments that can fit in a hardware buffer (<code>buffer-size/fragment-size</code>),
and <code>sample-rate</code> the number of samples per seconds.<br>
Then the latency will be <code>buffer-size/sample-rate</code>, for example if we
can fit 100 samples in a buffer and the samples are played once every
1ms then that’s a 100ms latency; we’ll have to wait 100ms before the
hardware finishes processing the buffer.<br>
From the software side, we’ll be getting an interrupt every
<code>period-size/sample-rate</code>. Thus, if our <code>buffer-size</code> is 1024 samples, and
<code>fragment-size</code> is 512, and our <code>sample-rate</code> is <code>44100 samples/second</code>,
then we get an interrupt and need to refill the buffer every <code>512/44100
= 11.6 ms</code>, and our latency for this stage is up to <code>1024/44100 = 23
ms</code>. Audio processing pipelines consist of a series of buffers like this,
with samples read from one buffer, processed as needed, and written to
the next.</p>

<p>Choosing the values of the <code>buffer-size</code> and <code>period-size</code> are hard
questions. We need a buffer big enough to minimize underruns, but we also
need a buffer small enough to have low latency. The fragments should
be big enough to avoid frequent interrupts, but we also need them small
enough so that we’re able to fill the buffer and avoid underruns.<br>
What some software choose to do is to not follow the sound card
interrupts but to rely on the operating system scheduler instead,
to be able to rewrite the buffer at any time so that it stays
responsive to user input (aka buffer rewinding). This in turn allows
to make the buffer as big as possible. Though, <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/05/02/time-on-unix.html">timers often
deviate</a>,
but that can be fixed with good real-time scheduling.<br>
There are no optimal solutions to this problem, it will depend on
requirements, and these values can often be configured.</p>

<p>So we’ve seen how sound is represented in the real world with strength and
tone, to then be converted in the digital world via digital to analog DAC
or analog to digital ADC converters. This is done by taking samples at
a rate and of a certain accuracy called the bit rate. There can also be
other information needed such as the channel, byte ordering, etc.. Sound
that needs to be mixed needs to agree on these properties. Lastly, we’ve
seen how software has to manage a buffer of samples so that sound plays
continuously on the device, while also being responsive to users.</p>

<p>3 minute read</p>


    

<p>Human beings are social animals. For the most part, we seek social connection and discussion with others in our lives. This tendency is one of the traits that propels our species forward, but it can also be dangerous.</p>

<p>The measure to which we can satisfy this desire has increased with social media, with new tools that put an entire world of people at our fingertips, but also expose us to a new weakness.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental features of these social networks is the idea of <strong>liking and commenting</strong>: people read your post and then show their appreciation by liking it or initiate a conversation by writing a comment.</p>

<p>These are both forms of <strong>engagement</strong> and act as validation for the poster: their presence and personality is not only being seen by many, but it can also lead to new conversation and ideas.</p>

<p>This caters to our social inclination, a useful evolutionary trait for humanity as species, but one that initially existed for much smaller groups than the ones humans can now form online.</p>

<p>These social interactions trigger a dopamine rush in our brains. But the virtual social environments we’ve developed multiply the opportunity to enjoy these dopamine rewards. In a situation where every like or feedback or validation triggers a new boost in your brain, they become ubiquitous and sometimes over-absorbing.</p>

<p>This can lead to <strong>social overfitting</strong>: consciously or unconsciously being powered and influenced by your desire to be seen and appreciated to an extent that you create content that is not a true reflection of what you’re interested in or want to share. Instead, your intent is to produce content that will get you more reaction and validation. This overfitting is a form of excess, and in over-adapting to cause reactions, you might no longer have the appeal you once had. This happens if you produce to provoke interest rather than create something that is truly interesting, and that you’re interested in.</p>
      <h2 id="what-is-overfitting">
        
        
          What is overfitting? <a href="#what-is-overfitting">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The idea of <strong>overfitting</strong> I’m borrowing here actually comes from the field of statistics and machine learning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>overfitting is “the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The analogy I’m drawing is that we as social beings, can sometimes grow so drawn to the reactions and feedback we get online, that instead of continuing to do what we like and sharing what we really want to, we try to over-optimize social sharing into a strategy. This strategy aims to attract the most validation for the author and his content, be it in the form of views, likes or comments.</p>

<p>That’s not all, though; in the same way an overfit model is no longer able to reason well with the data we give it, often when content creation becomes powered by a “science of popularity” instead of authenticity, people will not be attracted to your content, and you’ll have the opposite of what you were looking for.</p>

<p>Genuinely trying to understand your audience is by no means something negative, but just be wary not to practise this “social overfitting”, and become too motivated by the temporary spotlight of online attention.</p>

<p>Even as I write this post, I’m at least a little bit motivated by the knowledge that I’ll share it online and hopefully someone else will counter or correct the opinions I have and discussion will arise, but that’s not the only goal I have when I write, and I believe that’s important. I’ve always been impressed by people who write 100% for themselves, and are unaffected by whether or not people react or see their writings, but I acknowledge that it’s not my case.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:02&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Hey Elon here. Can you hear me?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:07&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: Yes, I can. Yes I can. Hey  there. Hello.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:16&gt;&gt;<br>
Aarthi: Oh, we see you.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:22&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: <em>laughs</em> This is wild. It’s just my butt talking.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:27&gt;&gt;<br>
Marc: Elon, are you, are you wearing your short shorts?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:31&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Yeah, that's me.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:35&gt;&gt;<br>
Marc: Are you celebrating anything in particular with your short shorts?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:40&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: No. I'm just trying to look sexy and in these tight pants with the. You now fabulous red in the gold.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:47&gt;&gt;<br>
Marc: Are the short shorts still available to be purchased.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:55&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Sorry, I got a small barkly dog.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:59&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: Elon, I think you're, you've might have broken. I'm not sure about the internet, but definitely clubhouse. This room is easily the biggest room. The app has had and you're just putting on all sorts of pressure on it. This is amazing. This is a true historic moment.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:15&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: All right. Is it working? <em>laught</em></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:18&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: Absolutely, abso-effing-lutely.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:23&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: All right.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:25&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: All right. We're gonna just give it a minute because we promised we'd start at 10:00 PM and I think a few more people are going to try and trickle in, and then we'll get going we'll get going for what should be probably a historic first ever time for you on clubhouse.It's going to be amazing. Just do 30 seconds. And you're already doing it.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:41&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Okay. Oh by the way can you let in Vlad from Robinhood?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:50&gt;&gt;<br>
Marc: We can</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:52&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Okay.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:53&gt;&gt;<br>
Marc: I'm sorry, Shriram, sorry</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:56&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: I was gonna say you know I've been, I, My phone just blew up with when we started the room with people trying to get into it, we're going to try and get asking to be on top of it. Okay. Why don't we get started? Okay. Uh first of all, everyone thank you for joining us for what is really a historic episode.</p>
<p>I will come to our very special guest in a second, but just to quickly introduce the rest of this room. We have Garry Tan, of Initialized Capital. We have my significantly better other half Aarthi Ramamurthy, whom, Elon you've met when you took us on the tour of Space X. We have Steven Sinofsky, um, of ex-Microsoft and we have the one and only Marc Andreessen. But to introduce our special guests and this person truly needs  introduction.<br>
The founder of Tesla, Space X, the Boring Company, Neuralink, PayPal and a bunch more.. Elon Musk, welcome to Clubhouse.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:02:48&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Thank you.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:02:50&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: Thank you. Okay.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:02:51&gt;&gt;<br>
Aarthi: This is awesome. Yeah. Yeah. So, Elon again, welcome. This is really fun. Uh we've been waiting all day. This is the longest way to 10:00 PM because we just couldn't wait to get this going. I hope this is as much fun be the end of it for you as it is for us. First question from me - was is when are we going to get to Mars?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:03:11&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: I think we'll get to when will we get the first people to Mars? I think we have a decent shot of doing that in about I'd say like... I call it five years, something like that.</p>
<p>So Earth to Mars sync up every 26 months. That's when we're in this kind of the, it's roughly the same quadrant of the solar system and where we can do an interplanetary transfer. And  so we had one about six months ago, so about a year and a half there'll have be another one. So figure, I don't know five and a half years.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:03:44&gt;&gt;<br>
Aarthi: Five and a half years. So what does  take from here to that point what are the milestones you think for us to get to, five years out, we are landing on Mars?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:03:54&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: We've got to make a starship fly get it, gets go to orbit and back repeatedly. I mean, the essential elements are you need a fully reusable, but like, um... You need a fully and rapidly reusable rock.. orbital rocket. This is the Holy Grail of rocketry. So no one has ever succeeded in creating a fully reusable rocket and it can't just be fully reusable.</p>
<p>It needs to be rapidly reusable. So it doesn't take like several months of refirbish-ment between flights. It needs to be much like aircraft where the cost of an air flight is the biggest component of that is fuel. And you can't just be throwing rockets away every time.</p>
<p>And then you need to have orbital refilling, so where you can end the ship up to orbit then send another ship up dock with a transport propellant so that you can load up to being almost full propellant and then go to Mars.<br>
And if you've got a large, fully rapidly reusable rocket with orbital refilling that uses, high efficiency, low cost propellant then you can go to Mars and then..</p>
<p>And then one other one last thing is on Mars too you need local  propellant production. So you take CO2 out of the atmosphere combine it with the water ice - H2O to create CH4 methane and oxygen.</p>
<p>And f you have those elements - life can become multi-planetary and we can have a self-sustaining city on Mars, which I think is one of the most important things. We could possibly do for   ensuring the long-term existence of conscious consciousness.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:05:25&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: Elon, you've spoken about this often, which is, expanding the scope of consciousness and how it is tied to multiplanetary life. Could you explain what that means for you and why that matters to you?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:05:39&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Sure, so the... originally, I had  an existential crisis when I was a kid trying to figure out what's the meaning of life? Why are we here? What's the point of it all? Is it all meaningless?<br>
I got quite depressed actually and sad about it.  And then the thing that kind of broke me out of it was reading Douglas Adams is a Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy.</p>
<p>Where he essentially pointed out that the universe is the answer and really the hard part is figuring out what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe.</p>
<p>I'm trying to make fun of the fact that the answer is the , easy part, but the questions are the hard part. So in order for us to gain  a better understanding of what questions to ask or to understand.  What it's all about. We have to increase the scope and scale of consciousness so that we're better able to figure out which questions to ask them and answer them. So the longer, the broader in scope larger in scale, that consciousness is the more likely we are to be able to ask these questions and figure out what that's going on.</p>
<p>Why are we here to answer the fundamental questions? And  I think there's arguably a great filter that we face with you know, will we've become a multi-class species or not. We’ll be surprised if out there in our galaxy and others,  there are a whole bunch of... Dead one planet civilizations that prosper.. prospered for a while, they might've prospered for millions of years, but then gradually the civilization collapsed for reasons external or internal.</p>
<p>And that was that all civilization go through  go through an arc where they both, they grow up in technology complexity, but then  they don't keep going up. They, over time they... hey decline they fall and this has happened obviously with if you're a student of history with many civilizations in the past. You can look at ancient Egypt, 5,000 years ago, there was the great part of Giza, but then the people living there forgot how to build pyramids after a while and then they forgot how to read hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>There's obviously, Kevin's famous book about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire and how they had advanced technology in terms of roads, aqueducts plumbing and so forth and then they basically forgot about it .<br>
The ancients Sumerians, Babylonians - all these things have been all gone through a similar arc  which suggests that most likely we will go through such ourselves and we'll be arguably less resilient to recovery because of globalization.</p>
<p>So I think, for the first time in the four and a half billion year history of Earth that has been possible to extend life beyond Earth and make life multi-planetary. And this window of opportunity may be open for a long time. I hope it is, or it may be open for a short time. And I think it would be wise for us to assume that it's open for a short time.</p>
<p>I'm an optimist, not a pessimist, but I, you have to say there's some chance it's only open for a short time and we should take advantage of this brief window of opening, where we can transfer, transfer life, transport life to make life multi-planetary and humanity is essentially the agent of life in this process.</p>
<p>And I think we almost have an obligation to ensure that the creatures of Earth continue even if there was a calamity on Earth, which as I said, could be man-made or it could be some natural calamity as if you look at the fossil record there's, there are many mass extinctions.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:09:02&gt;&gt;<br>
Aarthi: Yeah, I think, all of that makes sense and I think we've heard, you've talked about this before. I think one other question I have is, when we get there, we have to set up the whole society. We have to set up civilization there. Um how will the whole thing work in your mind? Like, you know, everything from what does it mean to have internet connection on Mars? All the way to like governments and rules …</p></div></div></div></div>

The serial’s Golden Pheasant article is shorter than the articles for the first three birds that we covered, so this post may be shorter as well. But the Golden Pheasant is no less striking than the <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/bird-in-review-the-nonpareil-or-northern-bunting/">Nonpareil</a>, <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/bird-in-review-resplendent-trogon/">Resplendent Trogon</a>, and <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/bird-in-review-mandarin-duck/">Mandarin Duck</a>, so perhaps the content will pack just as much of a peck. I apologize for the pun. To avoid further humor-related injuries, let us proceed to the review of the Golden Pheasant, and assess whether this 1897 children’s literature holds up in 2021.</p><p>You can follow along with the original Golden Pheasant content at <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30221/30221-h/30221-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Gutenberg</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/birdscolormag00marbrich/page/12/mode/2up">The I</a><a aria-label="n (opens in a new tab)" href="https://archive.org/details/birdscolormag00marbrich/page/12/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n</a><a href="https://archive.org/details/birdscolormag00marbrich/page/12/mode/2up">ternet Archive</a>.</p> <h2>The Golden Pheasant, Illustrated</h2><p>Below, you will find the magazine’s illustration of the Golden Pheasant.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="451" src="https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pleasant-birds-monthly-serial.jpg" alt="Illustration of the Golden Pheasant, clipped from the January 1897 Birds: A Monthly Serial." srcset="https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pleasant-birds-monthly-serial.jpg 600w, https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pleasant-birds-monthly-serial-300x226.jpg 300w, https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pleasant-birds-monthly-serial-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>Illustration of The Golden Pheasant clipped from the magazine on Project Gutenberg</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Golden Pheasant continues our trend of colorful birds, with shades of red, green, yellow, and brown. Its “hair” on the top of its head may set it apart from the first three. What is that, exactly? Let us ask the Golden Pheasant himself.</p> <h2>Comments from Mr. Golden Pheasant</h2><p>The <em>Birds </em>magazine continued its concept of beginning specific bird content with a brief statement from the bird himself. In the case of the Golden Pheasant, there was an emphasis on “brief.” While the first three birds we covered each had a full-page statement or letter, the Golden Pheasant received just under half a page. Before one suggests that the Golden Pheasant was slighted, a few of the later birds that we will cover were not asked for comment at all. As we will see at the end, Mr. Golden Pheasant did get a poem in his honor to make up for the lower word count. I will cover the magazine’s poems in a separate post after finishing the rest of the bird content.</p><p>I now yield the floor to Mr. Golden Pheasant. How do we know it is “Mr.” Golden Pheasant? Well, he says so.</p><h3>Mr. Golden Pheasant’s Regal Regalia</h3><p>Where does Mr. Golden Pheasant’s name come from? “They call me the Golden Pheasant, because I have a golden crest.” What does that golden crest remind Mr. Golden Pheasant of? “It is like a king’s crown.” What a regal bird, indeed. Mr. Golden Pheasant agreed: “Don’t you think my dress is beautiful enough for a king?”</p><h3>Mr. Golden Pheasant’s Size</h3><p>Mr. Golden Pheasant made sure to tell children that he was a “very large bird,” standing “fourteen inches tall and twenty-eight inches long.” He gave an example of what this size would allow him to do: “I can step right over your little robins and meadow larks and blue jays and not touch them.” Do you hear that, nineteenth century American children? This mighty bird would scoff as he stepped <em>over</em> the puny little birds in your backyard. Take that. He is much smaller than <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/welcome-to-the-emu-cafe/">our own Mr. Emu here at <em>The New Leaf Journal</em></a><em>,</em> however. Couldn’t be this cocky if the <em>Bird </em>magazine was published in Australia. He noted blue jays too – I covered those in a separate matter.</p><p>With Mr. Golden Pheasant’s height, one might wonder whether he could readily reach things on the ground. Have no fear. “See the large ruff around my neck. I can raise and lower it as I please.”</p><h3>Egg Thieves!</h3><p>Mr. Golden Pheasant explained that sometimes, his Golden Pheasant eggs were stolen. “Sometimes people get some of our eggs and put them under an old hen.” Lest one worry about the hatchlings, “the hen is very good to them.” However, Mr. Golden Pheasant stated that although the hen is good to the little Golden Pheasants, “they do not wish to stay with her; they like their wild life.”</p><p>Why were eggs so often taken by people that Mr. Golden Pheasant had to make a note of it? A clue comes in the next section. There, Mr. Golden Pheasant explained that he and his wife “like to have our nests by a fallen tree.” <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/the-fallen-tree-in-brooklyn-heights/">Fallen tree</a>? Well, I suppose that would make it easier for people to take the eggs. Other birds, like the <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/bird-in-review-resplendent-trogon/">Resplendent Trogon</a>, stick to nests not only high in the trees, but also high in the mountains.</p><h3>Mr. Golden Pheasant’s Wife</h3><p>Mr. Golden Pheasant was married. Regarding his wife, “[h]er feathers are beginning to grow like mine.” What did this mean? “In a few years she will look as I do.” In light of this revelation, I suppose that it was necessary for Mr. Golden Pheasant to state his sex outright.</p> <h2>Golden Pheasant Facts</h2><p>Mr. Golden Pheasant returned to his fallen-tree nest and the editors of <em>Birds: A Monthly Serial </em>took the stage to tell us more about the gold-crested bird. Will the content be child-friendly for once? Well, perhaps a bit more than previous entries…</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="843" height="624" src="https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pheasant-spread-birds-monthly-serial.jpg" alt="Article about and photo of The Golden Pheasant in the January 1897 issue Birds: A Monthly Serial." srcset="https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pheasant-spread-birds-monthly-serial.jpg 843w, https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pheasant-spread-birds-monthly-serial-300x222.jpg 300w, https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pheasant-spread-birds-monthly-serial-768x568.jpg 768w, https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pheasant-spread-birds-monthly-serial-750x555.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px"><figcaption>The full Golden Pheasant spread, clipped from the magazine on Internet Archive.</figcaption></figure><h3>Where Does Mr. Golden Pheasant Live?</h3><p>The Golden Pheasant is also known as the “Chinese Pheasant.” If that was not enough of a hint, the magazine continues to tell readers that it “has its home in Eastern Asia.” So too does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_pheasant">Silve</a><a aria-label="r (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_pheasant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_pheasant"> Pheasant</a>, which the magazine observes is the Golden Pheasant’s “more sober-colored cousin.”</p><p>While China was the principle place to find Golden Pheasants, “Japan comes next to China as a pheasant country and there are some in India.” Golden Pheasants <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://animalcorner.org/animals/golden-pheasant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were introduced to the United Kingdom</a> around the time the magazine was published. The magazine did make reference to this event – “It has been introduced into Europe, but is fitted only for the aviary.” Today, Golden Pheasants <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_pheasant#Description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are found</a> in North America, South America, and parts of Western and Northern Europe.</p><h3>An Entry on Entrees</h3><p>In the last bird review, we learned that the Chinese valued the <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/bird-in-review-mandarin-duck/">Mandarin Ducks</a> for their aesthetic qualities and for their fidelity to one another. Here, we learn that the Chinese valued the Golden Pheasant “not only for its splendid plumage and elegant form, but for the excellence of his flesh, which is said to surpass even that of the common pheasant.” So begins the discussion of Golden Pheasants for dinner.</p><p>The magazine noted optimistically that, despite the Golden Pheasant’s being considered a delicacy, “[f]or purposes of the table it is not likely to come into general use…” Why so? “[T]here are great difficulties in the way of breeding it in sufficient numbers…” That fact likely explains why Mr. Golden Pheasant complained about humans stealing eggs from feral Golden Pheasant nests. If they could not be readily bred domestically, the eggs would have to be pilfered from the wild.</p><p>The magazine further suggested that the general adoption of Golden Pheasants for the dinner table was hindered by the fact that “one feels a natural repugnance to the killing of so beautiful a bird for the sake of eating it.”</p><p>The conservation status of the Golden Pheasant <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_pheasant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is currently</a> “Least Concern,” and none of the contemporary sources make special note of people eating them. This all comes together to suggest that the optimism of the editors of <em>Birds: A Monthly Serial, </em>was well-founded. They are common in aviaries, however, suggesting that they can, in fact, be bred in captivity without too much difficulty.</p><h3>The Colors of the Golden Pheasant</h3><p>Like most of the other birds we covered, the male Golden Pheasants are generally more colorful than the females. “The magnificent colors belong only to the male, the female being reddish brown, spotted and marked with a darker hue.” Furthermore, “[t]he tail of the female is short.” What did Mr. Golden Pheasant mean when he suggested that his wife would soon look the same as him then? “The statement is made, however, that some hens kept for six years by Lady Essex gradually assumed an attire like that of the males.”</p><p>A quick search of contemporary sources revealed no reference to female Golden Pheasants adopting the bright colors of their male counterparts. <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_pheasant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia notes</a>, however, that “[t]here are … different mutations of the golden pheasant known from birds in captivity, including the dark-throated, yellow, cinnamon, salmon, peach, splash, mahogany and silver.” This passage does not sound similar to the story of Lady Essex’s lady Golden Pheasants.</p><p>According to Animals Network, the reason why female Golden Pheasants are not colorful is because they “can’t afford showy features and gaudy colors, not when they have a brood to raise.” It continues, “[t]heir brown color helps them blend in with their surroundings, better allowing them to incubate eggs and raise chicks.” Perhaps Lady Essex’s Golden Pheasant hens became more colorful because they did not have to fear predators? It seems a bit unlikely, but who knows?</p><h3>Fly-Fishers and Golden Pheasant Feathers</h3><p>The editors of <em>Birds </em>stated that Golden Pheasants were much admired by the fishing community. “Fly-fishers highly esteem the crest and feathers on the back of the male, as many of the artificial baits owe their chief beauty to the Golden Pheasant.”</p><h3>The Chinese Name</h3><p>The editors wrote that that the Chinese called the Golden Pheasant “Keuki” or “Keukee.” That meant “gold flower fowl.” The editors cited to Latham’s “General History of Birds,” published in 1896, for this fact. I found no alternative source that cites to it. Latham’s <a href="https://archive.org/stream/BirdsAsiaJohnGoVIIGoul/BirdsAsiaJohnGoVIIGoul_djvu.txt">stated</a> that the name also means “wrought fowl,” noting its hardiness. If any Mandarin speakers read this, feel free to explain in the Guestbook whether Latham’s was correct.</p> <h2>The Golden Coronation</h2><p>The Golden Pheasant article was lighter on content than the first three bird posts, but still enlightening. Nothing in the post was completely out-dated. Furthermore, it offered a few interesting anecdotes that would not be easy to find today. The story of Lady Essex’s hens is interesting, although perhaps dubious. Latham’s discussion of the Golden Pheasant’s name in Chinese is worth looking into. The fly-fisherman anecdote was noteworthy.</p><p>The article discussed the subject of Golden Pheasant hunting without descending into gratuitous bird violence, as it did with the Resplendent Trogon. …</p></div></div>

February 7, 2021 | http://www.swansontec.com/sregisters.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.swansontec.com/sregisters.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p><i>I wrote this article for an online magazine called <a href="http://www.scenerep.org/scenezine/issue12.php">Scene Zine</a>. Scene Zine caters to the Demo Scene, which is an digital art community dedicated to pushing the limits of computers through a mix of music, art, and computer programming. A particular category of demoscene productions, 4K intros, focus on the final production's raw file size. The goal is to put as much high-quality music, graphics, and animation as possible into only 4096 bytes. Doing this requires highly-specialized size optimization techniques, since 4096 bytes is less space than two pages of typed text or a true-color Windows XP icon. This article discusses some of these techniques.</i></p>

<p>Some people have commented that they want to see more expert programming articles in Scene Zine. To remedy the situation, this article is for all assembly language programmers out there. It discusses the fine art of picking which registers to use in your code. This information should simplify your coding and help you write smaller routines.</p>

<p>When the engineers at Intel designed the original 8086 processor, they had a
special purpose in mind for each register. As they designed the instruction
set, they created many optimizations and special instructions based on the
function they expected each register to perform. Using registers according to
Intel's original plan allows the code to take full advantage of these
optimizations. Unfortunately, this seems to be a lost art. Few coders are aware
of Intel's overall design, and most compilers are too the simplistic or focused
on execution speed to use the registers properly. Understanding how the
registers and instruction set fit together, however, is an important step on
the road to effortless size-coding.</p>

<p>Using the registers consistently has other advantages besides size
optimization. Like using good variable names, using consistent registers makes
code more readable. When they are used properly, the registers have meanings
almost as clear as the loop counter, <var>i</var>, in higher-level languages. In fact, I
occasionally name my variables in C after x86 registers because the register
names are so descriptive. With proper register use, x86 assembler can be almost
as self-documenting as a high-level language.</p>

<p>Another benefit that consistent register use brings is better compression. In
productions which use a compressor to pack the final build, such as 4K intros,
creating more redundant code leads to smaller packed sizes. When code uses
registers consistently, the same instruction sequences begin to appear over and
over. This, in turn, improves the compression ratio.</p>

<p>As a review, all x86-family CPU's have 8 general-purpose registers. The
registers are 32 bits wide, although 16-bit versions are also accessible with a
special one-byte instruction prefix. In 16-bit mode, the situation is reversed.
The lower 16 bits are accessible by default, and the full registers are
accessible only with a prefix byte.</p>

<p>Each register name is really an acronym. This is true even for the
"alphabetical" registers EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX. The following list shows the
register names and their meanings:</p>

<ul>
<li>EAX - Accumulator Register</li>
<li>EBX - Base Register</li>
<li>ECX - Counter Register</li>
<li>EDX - Data Register</li>
<li>ESI - Source Index</li>
<li>EDI - Destination Index</li>
<li>EBP - Base Pointer</li>
<li>ESP - Stack Pointer</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the full-sized general registers, the x86 processor also has
eight byte-sized registers. Since these registers map directly into EAX, EBX,
ECX, and EDX, most people view them as parts of the larger registers. From the
instruction set point of view, however, the 8-bit registers are separate
entities. For example, the CL and CH registers share none of the ECX register's
useful properties. Except for AL and AH, none of the 8-bit registers have any
special significance in the instruction set, so this article does not mention
them.</p>

<h3>EAX: The Accumulator</h3>

<p>There are three major processor architectures: register, stack, and
accumulator. In a register architecture, operations such as addition or
subtraction can occur between any two arbitrary registers. In a stack
architecture, operations occur between the top of the stack and other items on
the stack. In an accumulator architecture, the processor has single calculation
register called the accumulator. All calculations occur in the accumulator, and
the other registers act as simple data storage locations.</p>

<p>Obviously, the x86 processor does not have an accumulator architecture. It
does, however, have an accumulator-like register: EAX / AL. Although most
calculations can occur between any two registers, the instruction set gives the
accumulator special preference as a calculation register. For example, all nine
basic operations (ADD, ADC, AND, CMP, OR, SBB, SUB, TEST, and XOR) have special
one-byte opcodes for operations between the accumulator and a constant.
Specialized operations, such as multiplication, division, sign extension, and
BCD correction can only occur in the accumulator.</p>

<p>Since most calculations occur in the accumulator, the x86 architecture contains
many optimized instructions for moving data in and out of this register. To
start, the processor has sixteen byte-sized XCHG opcodes for swapping data
between the accumulator and any other register. These aren't terribly useful,
but they show how strongly the Intel engineers preferred the accumulator over
the other registers. For them, it was better to swap data into the accumulator
to than to work with it where it was. Other instructions that move data in and
out of the accumulator are LODS, STOS, IN, OUT, INS, OUTS, SCAS, and XLAT.
Finally, the MOV instruction has a special one-byte opcode for moving data into
the accumulator from a constant memory location.</p>

<p>In your code, try to perform as much work in the accumulator as possible. As
you will see, the remaining seven general-purpose registers exist primarily to
support the calculation occurring in the accumulator.</p>

<h3>EDX: The Data Register</h3>

<p>Of the seven remaining general-purpose registers, the data register, EDX, is
most closely tied to the accumulator. Instructions that deal with over sized
data items, such as multiplication, division, CWD, and CDQ, store the most
significant bits in the data register and the least significant bits in the
accumulator. In a sense, the data register is the 64-bit extension of the
accumulator. The data register also plays a part in IO instructions. In this
case, the accumulator holds the data to read or write from the port, and the
data register holds the port address.</p>

<p>In your code, the data register is most useful for storing data related to the
accumulator's calculation. In my experience, most calculations need only these
two registers for storage if they are written properly.</p>

<h3>ECX: The Count Register</h3>

<p>The count register, ECX, is the x86 equivalent of the ubiquitous variable i.
Every counting-related instruction in the x86 uses ECX. The most obvious
counting instructions are LOOP, LOOPZ, and LOOPNZ. Another counter-based
instruction is JCXZ, which, as the name implies, jumps when the counter is 0.
The count register also appears in some bit-shift operations, where it holds
the number of shifts to perform. Finally, the count register controls the
string instructions through the REP, REPE, and REPNE prefixes. In this case,
the count register determines the maximum number of times the operation will
repeat.</p>

<p>Particularly in demos, most calculations occur in a loop. In these situations,
ECX is the logical choice for the loop counter, since no other register has so
many branching operations built around it. The only problem is that this
register counts downward instead of up as in high level languages. Designing a
downward-counting is not hard, however, so this is only a minor difficulty.</p>

<h3>EDI: The Destination Index</h3>

<p>Every loop that generates data must store the result in memory, and doing so
requires a moving pointer. The destination index, EDI, is that pointer. The
destination index holds the implied write address of all string operations. The
most useful string instruction, remarkably enough, is the seldom-used STOS.
STOS copies data from the accumulator into memory and increments the
destination index. This one-byte instruction is perfect, since the final result
of any calculation should be in the accumulator anyhow, and storing results in
a moving memory address is a common task.</p>

<p>Many coders treat the destination index as no more than extra storage space.
This is a mistake. All routines must store data, and some register must serve
as the storage pointer. Since the destination index is designed for this job,
using it for extra storage is a waste. Use the stack or some other register for
storage, and use EDI as your global write pointer.</p>

<h3>ESI: The Source Index</h3>

<p>The source index, ESI, has the same properties as the destination index. The
only difference is that the source index is for reading instead of writing.
Although all data-processing routines write, not all read, so the source index
is not as universally useful. When the time comes to use it, however, the
source index is just as powerful as the destination index, and has the same
type of instructions.</p>

<p>In situations where your code does not read any sort of data, of course, using
the source index for convenient storage space is acceptable.</p>

<h3>ESP and EBP: The Stack Pointer and the Base Pointer</h3>

<p>Of the eight general purpose registers, only the stack pointer, ESP, and the
base pointer, EBP, are widely used for their original purpose. These two
registers are the heart of the x86 function-call mechanism. When a block of
code calls a function, it pushes the parameters and the return address on the
stack. Once inside, function sets the base pointer equal to the stack pointer
and then places its own internal variables on the stack. From that point on,
the function refers to its parameters and variables relative to the base
pointer rather than the stack pointer. Why not the stack pointer? For some
reason, the stack pointer lousy addressing …</p></div></div>

<p>Since crypto’s near-death experience of March 2020, three things have risen in tandem: the price of Bitcoin, the market cap of Tether, and the number of people under lockdown at home, turning to day-trading as a way to kill time. These three trends are closely intertwined.</p>



<p>An image is worth a thousand words, so just have a look at this chart of Robinhood users’ activity:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/49736731-15924900361928709.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/49736731-15924900361928709.png 636w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/49736731-15924900361928709-300x221.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px"><figcaption>source: seekingalpha.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>A combination of high markets’ volatility, stimulus checks, and having nothing better to do, has led millions of people to start trading – or gambling, depending on your opinion on the financial markets.</p>



<p>Robinhood is one way to have fun, betting on stocks. But there’s another, much more adrenaline-fuelled alternative: crypto. The keyword is leverage. Stock trading apps will allow you to lever your trades 3, 4 or 5 times, depending on their assessment of market volatility and the risk of not being able to close your position in time. Unregulated crypto exchanges like Binance will offer you up to 125x leverage. Now that’s gambling on steroïds.</p>



<p>This leverage is the lifeblood of the crypto economy. To understand how it works, allow me to entertain you with a short story.</p>



<h3>Online Forex trading and leverage</h3>



<p>A long time ago, BNP Paribas bought a retail forex exchange, because they thought they’d get an insight into forex trading flows and positions. What they quickly discovered, is that the website was a muppet slaughterhouse.</p>



<p>People would get stopped out ALL THE TIME because they used too much leverage. Over 90% of them lost money in a consistent way. Those are worse than even casino odds. That’s why around 2005, you had so many forex trading websites popping up. They would offer up to 500x leverage. Anyone using that leverage would get wiped out in minutes by random moves. The trading websites wouldn’t even hedge their overall positions – the certainty of loss was that great. Because of this, the business was extremely lucrative.</p>



<p>The higher the leverage, the better (for the website). This became such a huge trend that regulators stepped in, and introduced maximum leverage rules. Something like x30 for forex, if I remember correctly. All of a sudden, all the ads and Premier League sponsorships vanished.</p>



<p>Forex gambling is still around, but not nearly as profitable, because it takes time for people to lose their money with a pitiful x30 leverage. Currencies usually don’t move by 3% in a day. It can take weeks for an amateur trader to lose it all. Plus the adrenaline rush is gone.</p>



<h3>Crypto trading and illegal leverage</h3>



<p>Enter crypto. It’s hard to overstate how one-sided leveraged crypto trading is. Traders don’t stand a chance. With currencies, you could expect to extract SOME money from real world flows. In crypto, there are no real world flows. It’s just traders against traders against insiders.</p>



<p>Of course leveraged trading is very fun and addictive. So the flows are substantial. Regulated exchanges don’t offer leverage, because it’s a pain in the ass legally – <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-ends-margin-trading">just look at Coinbase dropping it recently</a>. Because cryptos aren’t currencies, you have to deal with all this crap about ownership and being able to deliver the goods that’s very hard to process. Plus the CFTC thinks cryptos are commodities, while the SEC thinks they’re securities, and you have to deal with regulations for both.</p>



<p>That’s why offshore, unregulated exchanges sprung up so fast to offer leveraged crypto trading while bypassing those pesky regulators. Being unregulated offshore operations, it’s very hard for them to establish and maintain banking relationships, so they rely on cryptocurrencies, mainly Bitcoin, as a means for their clients to top up their accounts. If you’re a US resident, you can’t deposit money on Binance using your credit card. Instead, you go on Coinbase, buy Bitcoin, and send it to Binance.</p>



<p>Those exchanges are an absolute bonanza, precisely because they create this huge demand for crypto for on-ramp purposes. This crypto is then lost by gamblers, thanks to insane leverage, back to the crypto industry. This creates a one-way flow of real cash into the system.</p>



<p>Of course, these unregulated exchanges are also a huge threat to the crypto industry, because they’re serving US residents, which is illegal, and regulated exchanges knowingly serve as on-ramp platforms and enable US citizens to fund their gambling accounts there. It all hangs on a very thin thread.</p>



<h3>Illegal gambling: the real source of revenue for crypto</h3>



<p>Offering people to buy Bitcoins to hold isn’t nearly as interesting a business as offering people to buy Bitcoins to fund their gambling addiciton, and lose them by getting stopped out on Binance. A HODLer is a risk because he can sell his Bitcoins. A rekt gambler will simply buy more.</p>



<p>Unregulated offshore exchanges are feeding the rest of the crypto industry. They’re also feeding regulated exchanges, who serve as on-ramp platforms. It has become such a huge business that, just like with forex, regulators are looking into it. The <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/02/the-rise-and-fall-of-bitcoin-billionaire-arthur-hayes">story of Arthur Hayes</a>, the billionaire cofounder of BitMex currently hiding from prosecutors in New York, is one example of authorities breathing down the neck of these underground casinos posturing as exchanges.</p>



<p>These exchanges couldn’t exist without crypto – not least because there wouldn’t be anything to trade, but also because they couldn’t accept customer deposits or meet redemption requests. Were they to rely on traditional banking relationships, a regulator would simply need to call their bank, and order them to shut down their account (just like <a href="https://cryptonewsreview.com/bitfinex-suspends-fiat-deposits-amid-rumours-of-hsbc-withdrawal/">what happened to Bitfinex with HSBC</a>).</p>



<p>But thanks to this multi-layered system where regulated entities (like Coinbase) allow people to buy Bitcoin, and then help them to send this Bitcoin to less-regulated and/or unregulated entities like BitMex or Binance, everyone benefits. This way of doing things goes back to 2013, when the <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance/application-fincens-regulations-persons-administering">FinCEN ruled that crypto exchanges are money transmitters</a>, which was an incredibly generous classification, as it absolved the exchanges from performing AML and KYC on crypto transactions.</p>



<p>This very classification is currently under attack from regulators now, with the STABLE Act, and calls for regulating self-hosted wallets. It’s probably the reason why PayPal chose not to allow people to withdraw their crypto.</p>



<h3>March 2020: the day when Tether got its wings</h3>



<p>While gambling addicts might not care about having to go through Bitcoin to fund their accounts, exchanges themselves would be in a tough spot if they had to rely exclusively on this volatile and cumbersome cryptocurrency to manage your day-to-day operations. Imagine having your liabilities fixed in USD, when your income and assets fluctuate in value by 10% every few hours.</p>



<p>It’s much more convenient to have something that’s stable in price, and can be transferred in seconds. This is where Tether steps in, by offering their stablecoin, USDT. <em>(more precisely, they stepped in gradually, because them relying on the OMNI layer, which itself relies on Bitcoin, made transactions slow and unreliable in moments when the Bitcoin network became clogged – an issue that was solved by launching an ERC-20 USDT token in September 2017).</em></p>



<p>USDT does have one major flaw, however – it’s controlled by a central party, Tether. By holding USDT, you are accepting Tether’s credit risk, which is a scary thought, knowing that they aren’t audited or regulated, and are currently under investigation by the NYAG. USDT tokens can be frozen, and there’s no guarantee that you’ll be able to cash out. It’s probably for these reasons that USDT usage remained subdued for quite a while.</p>



<p>But then, something happened. Unbeknownst to most, March 2020 was a crucial turning point for the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">8. The recent rapid increase in USDT issuance since March and then since Oct are entirely explained by (1) post 03/20 there was a sustained mass move away from BitMEX (which margins their deriv contracts in BTC) towards Binance (which margins mostly in USDT)…</p>— David Fauchier (@dfauchier) <a href="https://twitter.com/dfauchier/status/1350741887095873537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2021</a></blockquote> 



<p>For some reason, major unregulated exchanges suddenly warmed up to the idea of holding a lot of USDT on their books. The switch from Bitcoin as collateral, to USDT for margin trading, meant that Binance was cool with having a multi-billion dollar exposure to Tether, a <a href="https://thecaspiancey.medium.com/finding-finex-3eefac0d45a2">small unaudited company with no office, whose CEO and CFO are MIA</a>.</p>



<p>Only insiders know the true reasons behind this shift, but my take is quite straightforward:</p>



<ul><li>with Bitcoin in freefall, major institutions in the crypto industry had to come together to support the markets – much like <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/long-term-capital-crisis-3306240#:~:text=for%20three%20months.-,Federal%20Reserve%20Intervention,lowering%20the%20fed%20funds%20rate.">commercial banks bailed out LTCM in 1998 </a>to prevent a financial panic</li><li>having Bitcoin as collateral for margin trading is a nightmare for risk management (because the value of the collateral is correlated with the P&amp;L of the trade), and exchanges needed something stable to prevent a meltdown of cascading liquidations  </li></ul>



<h3>Follow the Tethers</h3>

<p>When we use proprietary software, we are under the power of the owner of the software. The owner's revenue depends on us, either directly through purchases and solutions, or indirectly by advertising. There is a relationship of power, with the owner having power over us.</p>
<p>When we fell that the owner is doing something unethical, we might choose to refuse to use their software. We do this to put financial pressure on them to change their practices. We may also do it to disassociate ourselves from them, showing we disapprove of their actions. We may boycott this way in many other situations, it makes sense to extend it to software.</p>
<p>In contrast, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has no owner. Most free software is primarily maintained by one individual or group, but licenses give users power over the software, allowing us to control it to the same extent as anyone else. The power balance is shifted.</p>
<p>When the primary developer of a free program does something we find unethical, many are inclined to approach the matter similarly. However, with free software we are not bound by the program or the developer in the same way. We do not remove ourselves from someone's power when we boycott free software. We just restrict our own access to a potentially useful program.</p>
<p>If the software has features we don't like, we can remove them. If the software is hosted by one organization, we can deploy it ourselves. If these are impractical, or if the software is not actually useful, we can abandon it. But we do not need to give up on certain free programs based on reasons other than the software itself.</p>
<p>Of course, one may be boycotting programs made by a particular developer in an effort to hurt their feelings. This is a foolish reason to oppose software. Emotional manipulation is not going to solve any problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've seen all of this happen in FOSS communities. People refuse to use helpful software because of disagreements with the author. Worse yet, those who do use the software are sometimes shamed. This is terribly effective at weaving disunity within our own communities.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to sow bitterness within ourselves and others for even a seemingly noble goal. The only result is smug superiority: "We aren't one of <em>them</em> who associate with one of <em>those</em> developers." Frivolously dividing our communities based on software usage is not worthwhile.</p>
<p>We cannot enrich society with free and open source software when we are busy attacking some of those making it.</p>

				<p><em>Onora O’Neill, professor emeritus of philosophy at Cambridge University and a member of the British House of Lords, has been selected for the 2017 $1 million </em><a href="http://berggruen.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><em>Berggruen Prize</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>London — Near the conclusion of the Brexit referendum campaign last year, Michael Gove, then the British justice secretary, infamously said that “people in this country have had enough of experts…” If you watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGgiGtJk7MA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">video</a> of the interview, Gove had begun to say something more specific but was interrupted by a particularly hectoring interviewer. He has since clarified that he had <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39102840" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">intended</a> to say that the public has had enough of <em>economists</em>.</p>
<p>We can all giggle about that now, but it is the literal and uncharitable reading of Gove’s remark that still makes headlines and comes up in discussions of the idea that we live in a post-fact or post-truth era. Suspicion of experts and professionals is not new. Claims that experts were engaged in some sort of conspiracy against the public or the public interest were widely voiced during the 1980s, and accusations of “professional coziness” were cited as reasons for shifting from professional to regulatory discipline of experts. But the current suspicion of experts is more troubling and cannot be addressed by regulatory remedies — they would be promptly tarred with the same brush.</p>
<p>Is this heightened suspicion of experts an inevitable effect of digital communications technologies? I suspect that the problem may lie not with the technologies themselves but with the disruption to practices and standards for communication that have followed their chaotic introduction. These technologies enable voluminous, remote and anonymous dissemination of content whose trustworthiness — or lack of trustworthiness — is hard to judge. While the ethics of communication is about the standards that speech acts should meet, new technologies make it hard to identify which acts are being undertaken, let alone to judge whether they are trustworthy.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that new technologies have disrupted established communicative practices and standards. Plato tells us that Socrates was so worried by the written word’s disruption of communication that he relied entirely on the spoken word. Luckily Plato did write, or we would know nothing about Socrates’ misgivings. Socrates worried his words would go fatherless into the world, reaching sundry readers with nobody present to explain what was meant or to clear up misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The problem with writing, however, was not that texts can be separated from their authors and cannot explain themselves, but that the practices of attribution, validation, authorization and commentary, on which writing and publishing now depend, had not been developed in ancient Greece. Now that those practices and standards are in place, we often think of the written word as a particularly robust and reliable way of communicating content accurately and responsibly.</p>
<p>A second wave of difficulties arose with the development of printing. Once again, the difficulties were not due to the technology but to the disruption caused by innovation. Laws had to be enacted and practices developed in order to define the respective roles and responsibilities of authors, printers and publishers. New laws had to provide remedies for the wrongs that can be inflicted by distributing printed material, ranging from defamation to breach of copyright, from fraud to breach of privacy, and from misleading advertising to breaches of commercial and professional confidentiality. It took a long time and a lot of struggle to reshape legal requirements and social and cultural practices to ensure that they both protected free speech and prevented and limited wrongs that can be done by widely distributed printed communication.</p>
<p>The situation is similar with online communication. Legal and cultural measures needed to secure ethical standards in communication have been massively disrupted, leaving us less able to judge whether others’ claims are honest, competent and reliable. Seemingly direct, unmediated, even intimate online communication sometimes turns out to emanate from or to have been shared with unknown others. Seemingly professional and expert claims sometimes misrepresent or falsify. Seemingly original material sometimes turns out to have been plagiarized. Yet the ethical standards and the epistemic norms that matter for trustworthy communication, and that underpin the possibility of checking and challenging what others communicate, matter every bit as much for online as for offline communication.</p>
<p>As one might expect, the new technologies have charm and advantages, and there is great reluctance to recognize how much needs to be done to reconstruct ethically adequate standards for communication. We are still in a period of gestures and platitudes. Cyber romantics still suggest that any restriction of online communication would be wrong; they forget that free speech&nbsp;is only one of the many standards that matter for the ethics of communication.</p>
<p>Well-meaning discussions suggest that improving digital literacy might be useful, so that those on the receiving end of communication are less likely to be deceived. But while improving digital literacy is surely a good idea, we can hardly expect it to remedy the serious wrongs that can be done by some online communication. At present, we have not even developed a clear distinction between online platforms and online publishers, so we have no account of their respective responsibilities. There is a long way to go.</p>

                <p><em>Perhaps best known for their esoteric livecoding language ORCΛ, <a href="https://100r.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 Rabbits</a> (Rekka and Devine) have a creative practice that seamlessly crosses from the esoteric to the practical. Living on a boat and relying primarily on solar energy, they create their own tools to avoid the impracticalities and wastefulness of commercial software. Their work has a rare coherence of thought and design that bridges art, code, and life.<br></em></p>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/b1679d0f-5d99-422c-b670-530a2839e0c4/100rabbits_header.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p><strong>» There is an idealism to many of your projects that reminds me of the early Web or perhaps the Amiga era, with a sense that anything is fair game to be re-thought; from the recipe site&nbsp;<a href="https://grimgrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grimgrains</a> with its unusual sign to even representations of time and dates with <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Neralie</em> and <em>Arvelie</em></a>. *</strong></p>
<p><strong>This extends to the tools you adopt by others, like Plan 9 and Gemini, that are not as widely used or supported but are built on better logical or aesthetic principles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'd like to begin by asking you to describe a bit of your creative philosophy and process as a team.</strong></p>
<p>Our development philosophy comes down to a strong belief that solving problems is more efficient than looking for solutions.</p>
<p>I say this to mean that, based on personal experiences, searching for a password is more expensive and less fulfilling than cracking the safe itself. It does mean reinventing the wheel many times over, but the process has led us to many unforeseen places, often in areas we had previously taken for granted, or considered solved.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5FkYhfpmqA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca x Ronin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://100r.co/site/philosophy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philosophy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We will always choose a lesser home-brewed tool tailored specifically to our own needs, over a better generic tool that we have not built and do not understand. This scenario is often called the "Not Invented Here"(NIH) syndrome. It's a choice we made that works for our unique financial situation, but it's not something that we advocate for, or that we think would scale well in for-profit environments.</p>
<p><strong>» Orca is an esoteric language. It is also a live-coding environment, which means what it is esoteric to is a different set of behaviors, mainly languages designed for performance, with programs that can be altered as they run. This crossover is unusual, and I'm curious first could you describe how the idea of Orca evolved?</strong></p>
<p><strong>For instance, was the idea of each letter corresponding to a command part of the original concept, or did it grow from experiments?</strong></p>
<p>Orca was first a terminal utility designed to simulate moves on a game-board to help with the development of a project called Markl, in which the state of each character is represented by a single character.</p>
<p>The simulator was later re-purposed into a demake of Pico, a color-based game created a few years prior. This early iteration of Orca included some of the operators that are still part of it today. As the Pico playground became more popular, people started to point at the name and its overlapping with that of Pico-8 so the name was changed.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1h7vQFH9xFM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><em>First video of Orca</em></p>
<p>After asking around if anyone had a good name for a black and white monster, someone recommended Orca. We thought it fitting, and adopted the name.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN7dUqMtIWU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pico3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pico8</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We weren't very familiar with the concept of live-coding at that time, Orca was still described as Dwarf Fortress for music. I was growing increasingly interested in the Algorave scene, for which, the tagline is: <strong>Show Us Your Screens</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0b64ec04-c283-11e9-ae6e-a26d1d0455f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorave</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFjvYnJWMUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca controlling lights</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgNDwUx2Tb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca self-replication</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Orca seemed like the ideal candidate for a livecoding performance as it was designed from the ground-up as a golfing language, making it very fast compared to verbose languages like Haskell and Lisp. Operators like the cardinals(N, S, E &amp; W) made it easier for the audience to track where all the notes were coming from.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNuuG7SiNqE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca @ Algograve</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lxFYv5vIm4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca controlling Playground</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>» Did (non-livecoding) esolangs influence its design or internal logic at all? I know you've written about FRACTRAN; also the Funges come to mind with Orca's N, S, E, and W operators.</strong></p>
<p>I became aware of esolangs during the development of Orca, I knew of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brainfuck</a> and <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Nock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nock</a>, but I can't say that I fully understood the point of those until later when I started to be more interested in programming.</p>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/1cc9f0d6-b23d-4ada-a95a-6f0b67446a7f/100rabbits_orca_terminal.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p><strong>» Tell me about the larger Orca community. Has anyone created something with Orca that truly surprised you? Given the size of the community and language ecosystem (with Orca functioning as four different versions), is supporting the language a large ongoing task?</strong></p>
<p>Some people have used Orca to control microcontrollers, visuals, and video games. There was a robotics student in France who used Orca to move an articulated arm which was pretty neat.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7moEYBqckc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca controlling NES</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcFjBiHx14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca to play Mario Bros</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The specs have not changed dramatically for some time, the operators have grown organically based on feedback from the community. Each implementation has different maintainers who try to follow the specs as best as they can, but each platform has their own specific needs, and therefore, their own specific operators.</p>
<p>For example, the Norns implementation in Lua has a LOT of custom operators to control the various sound engines of the device.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://llllllll.co/t/orca/22492" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca Norns</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>» Also, I have to ask about Lietal. It's provided names for many of your projects (Arvelie etc) but do you also use it at all for every-day communication? What is it like to think in terms of Lietal?</strong></p>
<p>Despite Lietal having its own syntax and grammar, it was originally meant as a synthetic language to create loanwords that can be used as part of other languages. For example, members of the <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/merveilles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merveilles</a> community adopted the use the old Lietal word "xoka", to say hello, which doesn't quite translate to <em>hello</em> but as "it's nice of you to come toward me".</p>
<p>Lietal was also created to indicate the names of spaces or things in the Neauismetica conworld which lives as music, games and illustrations.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/neauismetica.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neauismetica</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The main concept of Lietal is that <em>to talk about something, you must first understand what you're trying to describe</em>. It's built from first principles, the philosophical idea being that every permutation of every elementary particle of the language would mean all things true and false.</p>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/6c3e6d40-2b80-4e20-a319-29e0897885c4/100rabbits_pino.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p><strong>» How has your philosophy about open-source / free software / right to repair affected your distribution channels (the Apple Store, etc) and what technologies you adopt? You seem to work with a mix of newer and older platforms (like 6502); has this been a challenge in keeping the work accessible and usable?</strong></p>
<p>Our philosophy of software development is advised principally by our lifestyle and the internet and power scarcity that it entails. Since we build everything from a sailboat, our power comes principally from the solar energy we collect throughout the day. We normally only work on the computer while the sun is up.</p>
<p>This restriction forced us to consider ways to extend the life of our computer's batteries by discarding heavy toolchains, such as XCode. Bloated software such as Slack, or DRM-protected software such as Photoshop, were not viable options to us, so we turned to open-source to find software that we could repair ourselves, and that did not require constant internet access.</p>
<p>We found that even within open-source, a lot of software was poorly-built and did not address our specific needs, so we began building the missing pieces ourselves. We tried using web technologies at first, but the resulting applications were slow and inefficient, we have since rebuilt our tools in plain C.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://100r.co/site/working_offgrid_efficiently.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Offgrid</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>» You created your own LISP dialect, Lain, which now drives your image-drawing software, Ronin. First, why did you decide to do this as a LISP in particular, and what was it like constructing the language and building its first interpreter? Have you found that it's approachable for users of the platform? Also, it strikes me how inter-connected these projects are: there are many images on your site that seem to have used the de-saturation feature of Ronin.</strong></p>
<p>I wanted a simple LISP to do some basic repetitive graphical tasks(resizing, cropping, etc), so I built a little playground to experiment with. The playground turned into a fully-featured engine to do photo manipulation and was a great help at that time, it allowed us to work from a Chromebook after one of our main laptop died, which was very handy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Ronin/blob/master/scripts/library.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ronin Library</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We've used Ronin to resize, sharpen and colorize almost all the photos from our sites between 2017 and 2019. Lisp is a simple language to start exploring some more esoteric concepts and move away from more traditional languages. Lisp is a slippery slope that leads inevitably to Forth.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/forth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forth</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>» Do "Lain" and "Ronin" come from Lietal words with specific meanings?</strong></p>
<p>The name Lain for the lisp dialect comes from the anime series with the same name, in which the main character uses Lisp on her laptop.</p>
<p><strong>» Lietal sounds like a Lojban-like language (a logical language for human expression) or perhaps Toki Pona, which promotes honesty (as a more realistic way of getting at "truth"). Is the thinking of Lietal built around trying to get the speaker to understand the core of what they're saying?</strong></p>
<p>It's kind of a side-effect, in the sense that there are only 27 Lietal "words", everything else are compounds of these basic words. Saying complex things take a long time, and two people with a different understanding of a <em>thing</em> might not understand each other. You cannot say in Lietal(except for loanwords) "What is X", since for saying X, you must first describe it.</p>

<p><strong>» What role does the Neauismetica plays in your work? Is it something to daydream about, a set of stories that have been written, or is it more a general idea that fuels other projects? Is it a set of stories, an imaginary setting for other projects, something to discuss on long ocean voyages?</strong></p>
<p>The Neauismetica is a conworld that exists through the music, games, aesthetics, and language of a lot of the related projects. When I began writing about the world of Dinaisth, I had no plans to be …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Everyone loves GitLab CI and Kubernetes.</p>
<p>GitLab CI (Continuous Integration) is a popular tool for building and testing software developers write for applications. GitLab CI helps developers build code faster, more confidently, and detect errors quickly.</p>
<p>Kubernetes, popularly shortened to K8s, is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerization workloads and services. K8s is used by companies of all sizes everyday to automate deployment, scaling, and managing applications in containers.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to show how you can bolt on the Continuous Delivery (CD) piece of the puzzle to build a CI/CD pipeline so you can deploy your applications to Kubernetes. But before we get too far, we're going to need to talk about Helm, which is an important part of the puzzle.</p>
<h2>What the Helm?</h2>
<p><a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm calls itself "the package manager for Kubernetes".</a> That's a pretty accurate description. Helm is a versatile, sturdy tool DevOps engineers can use to define configuration files in, and perform variable substitution to create consistent deployments to our clusters, and have different variables for different environments.</p>
<p>It's certainly the right solution to the problem we're covering here.</p>
<h2>How do we do it?</h2>
<p>First off, a few prerequisites. You’re going to have to have this all hammered out before you started with the project. There’s links to helpful documentation below if you need help.</p>
<p>Or, you could always <a href="https://nextlinklabs.com/contact">get in touch with us</a> and we could talk about your project together.</p>
<ol>
<li>You already have an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">Amazon EKS cluster</a>.</li>
<li>You already know how to use <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">GitLab CI</a>.</li>
<li>You have a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes.html">GitLab CI runner</a> configured in your Kubernetes cluster.</li>
<li>You have the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller">AWS Load Balancer Controller</a> running in your cluster.</li>
</ol>
<p>With those boxes checked, we can get started. You'll want to create a new repository in GitLab first for us to use in this example. Once you've done that we can get started with creating our files.</p>
<h2>File tree</h2>
<p>Basically, at the end our folder/file structure is going to look like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;dir&gt;
├── chart/
|   ├── Chart.yaml
|   ├── values.yaml
|   └── templates/
|      ├── deployment.yaml
|      ├── service.yaml
|      ├── ingress.yaml
|      └── configmap.yaml
└── gitlab-ci.yml</code></pre></div>
<h3>values.yaml</h3>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>applicationName: my-first-app
certArn: your-certificate-arn
domain: your domain name
subnets: your subnets
securityGroups: your security groups</code></pre></div>
<h3>deployment.yaml</h3>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

    matchLabels:
      app: {{ .Values.applicationName }}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ .Values.applicationName  }}
    spec:
      containers:

          imagePullPolicy: Always
          image: nginx:1.19.4
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
              name: nginx-conf
              subPath: index.html
      volumes:
        - name: nginx-conf
          configMap:
            name: {{ .Values.applicationName  }}-configmap</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the configuration file that defines our deployment. You can see there are a few lines with <code>{{ some text }}</code>. This is how we use a variable we define in our values file within our chart.</p>
<h3>configmap.yaml</h3>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.applicationName }}-configmap

data:
  index.html: |
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;My first Helm deployment!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thanks for checking out my first Helm deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>This config map just defines a simple index page that we'll display for our app.</p>
<h3>service.yaml</h3>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>apiVersion: v1

<h2>Okay we have all the files. Now what?</h2>
<p>Well, after you have all the files defined and your infrastructure follows our prerequisites, there's not much left to do.</p>
<p>If you commit these files, GitLab will interpet your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file and initiate a pipeline. Our pipeline only has one stage and one job (deploy). It'll spin up a container in the cluster for the deployment using the <code>helm:3.2.1</code> image and run our <code>script</code> command. This does all of the heavy lifting for us with creating all of the files required in our namespace and starting our application.</p>
<p>If you configure in Route53 a DNS record like <code>my-first-app.my-domain.com</code> with an A record to the load balancer that the ingress controller created, you'll see the index page we defined in the configmap!</p></div></div>]]>

February 7, 2021 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching-quickening/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching-quickening/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In my <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/">last post</a> I discussed inline caching as a
technique for runtime optimization. I ended the post with some extensions to
the basic technique, like <em>quickening</em>. If you have not read the previous post,
I recommend it. This post will make many references to it.</p>

<p>Quickening involves bytecode rewriting — self modifying code — to remove
some branches and indirection in the common path. Stefan Brunthaler writes
about it in his papers <a href="https://publications.sba-research.org/publications/dls10.pdf">Efficient Interpretation using Quickening</a>
and <a href="https://publications.sba-research.org/publications/ecoop10.pdf">Inline Caching Meets Quickening</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at a fragment of the caching interpreter from the last post
so we can talk about the problem more concretely. You can also get the sources
<a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/icdemo">from the repo</a> and open <code>interpreter.c</code>
in your preferred editor.</p>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As I also mentioned last post, the <code>ADD</code> opcode handler has three cases to
handle:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cache is empty</li>
  <li>Cache has the wrong key</li>
  <li>Cache has the right key</li>
</ol>

<p>Since Deutsch &amp; Schiffman found that types don’t vary that much, the third
case is the fast path case. This means that we should do as little as possible
in that case. And right now, we’re doing too much work.</p>

<p>Why should we have to check if the cache slot is empty if in the fast path it
shouldn’t be? And why should we then have to make an indirect call? On some
CPUs, indirect calls are <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching-quickening/calls">much slower</a> than direct calls. And this
assumes the compiler generates a call instruction — it’s very possible that a
compiler would decide to inline the direct call.</p>

<p>Quickening is a technique that reduces the number of checks by explitly marking
state transitions in the bytecode.</p>

<h2 id="removing-the-empty-check">Removing the empty check</h2>

<p>In order to remove one of the checks — the <code>method == NULL</code> check — we can
add a new opcode, <code>ADD_CACHED</code>. The <code>ADD_CACHED</code> opcode can skip the check
because our interpreter will maintain the following invariant:</p>

<p><strong>Invariant:</strong> The opcode <code>ADD_CACHED</code> will appear in the bytecode stream <em>if
and only if</em> there is an entry in the cache at that opcode.</p>

<p>After <code>ADD</code> adds something to the cache, it can rewrite itself to <code>ADD_CACHED</code>.
This way, the next time around, we have satisfied the invariant.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not too different. We’ve shuffled the code around a little bit but overall it
looks fairly similar. We still get to share some code in <code>add_update_cache</code>, so
there isn’t too much duplication, either.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve moved the empty check, it’s time to remove the indirect call.</p>

<h2 id="removing-the-indirect-call">Removing the indirect call</h2>

<p>Let’s assume for a minute that you, the writer of a language runtime, know that
most of the time, when people write <code>a + b</code>, the operation refers to integer
addition.</p>

<p>Not many other primitive types implement addition. Frequently floating point
numbers use the same operator (though languages like OCaml do not). Maybe
strings. And maybe your language allows for overloading the plus operator. But
most people don’t do that. They add numbers.</p>

<p>In that case, you want to remove as much of the overhead as possible for adding
two numbers. So let’s introduce a new opcode, <code>ADD_INT</code> that is specialized for
integer addition.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, we would just be able to pop two objects, add them, and move
on. But in our current reality, we still have to deal with the possibility of
programmers passing in a non-integer every once in a while.</p>

<p>So first, we check if the types match. If they don’t, we populate the cache and
transition to <code>ADD_CACHED</code>. I’ll get to why we do that in a moment.</p>

<p>And if we did actually get an int, great, we call this new function
<code>do_add_int</code>.</p>

<p>This is a nice opcode handler for <code>ADD_INT</code>, but right now it’s orphaned. Some
opcode has to take the leap and rewrite itself to <code>ADD_INT</code>, otherwise it’ll
never get run.</p>

<p>I suggest we make <code>ADD</code> do the transition. This keeps <code>ADD_CACHED</code> fast for
other types. If <code>ADD</code> observes that the left hand side of the operation is an
integer, it’ll call <code>do_add_int</code> and rewrite itself.</p>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Back to “why transition from <code>ADD_INT</code> to <code>ADD_CACHED</code>”. Two thoughts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We could transition back to <code>ADD</code>. In that case, this code would perform
poorly in an environment where the programmer passes multiple different
types at this opcode. There would be a lot of bytecode rewriting overhead
going on as it goes back and forth between <code>ADD</code> and <code>ADD_INT</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could also assume it’s a hiccup and <em>not</em> rewrite. This would perform
poorly if the first time the argument is an integer, but something else
every subsequent operation. There would be a lot of <code>lookup_method</code> calls.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A great extension here would be to add a polymorphic cache. Those are designed
to efficiently handle a small (less than five, normally) amount of repeated
types at a given point.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-faster">Why is this faster?</h2>

<p>Even if we leave the interpreter in this state, a small C bytecode interpreter,
we save a couple of instructions and some call overhead in the fast path of
integer addition. This is a decent win for math-heavy applications.</p>

<p>In the best case, though, we save a great deal of instructions. It’s entirely
possible that the compiler will optimize the entire body of <code>ADD_INT</code> to
something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pop rax
pop rcx
cmp rax, $IntTag
jne slow_path
add rcx
push rcx
jmp next_opcode
slow_path:
; ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It won’t look exactly like that, due to our object representation and because
our <code>push</code>/<code>pop</code> functions do not operate on the C call stack, but it will be a
little closer than before. But what if we could fix these issues and trim down
the code even further?</p>

<p>Then we might have something like the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/b1c09ecd8f30adc02f7623f6137e07a51a648dc3/runtime/vm/compiler/backend/il_x64.cc#L3549">Dart intermediate
implementation</a> of addition for small integers on x86-64. The
following C++ code emits assembly for a specialized small integer handler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>CheckedSmiOpInstr</span><span>::</span><span>EmitNativeCode</span><span>(</span><span>FlowGraphCompiler</span><span>*</span> <span>compiler</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>// Check both left and right are small integers</span>

  <span>__</span> <span>orq</span><span>(</span><span>TMP</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>);</span>
  <span>__</span> <span>testq</span><span>(</span><span>TMP</span><span>,</span> <span>compiler</span><span>::</span><span>Immediate</span><span>(</span><span>kSmiTagMask</span><span>));</span>

  <span>Register</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>locs</span><span>()</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>out</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>).</span><span>reg</span><span>();</span>
  <span>__</span> <span>movq</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>,</span> <span>left</span><span>);</span>
  <span>__</span> <span>addq</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example is a little bit different since it is using an optimizing compiler
and assumes the input and output are both in registers, but still expresses the
main ideas.</p>

<p>See also the JVM <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/a6d950587bc68f81495660f59169b7f1970076e7/src/hotspot/cpu/x86/templateTable_x86.cpp#L1338">template interpreter implementation</a> for binary
operations on small integers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>TemplateTable</span><span>::</span><span>iop2</span><span>(</span><span>Operation</span> <span>op</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>__</span> <span>pop_i</span><span>(</span><span>rdx</span><span>);</span>
  <span>__</span> <span>addl</span> <span>(</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>rdx</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which pops the top of the stack and adds <code>rax</code> to it. I think this is because
the JVM caches the top of the stack in the register <code>rax</code> at all times, but I
have not been able to confirm this. It would explain why it adds <code>rax</code> and why
there is no <code>push</code>, though.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-further">Exploring further</h2>

<p>There are a number of improvements that could be made to this very simple demo.
Bytecode rewriting can unlock a lot of performance gains with additional work.
I will list some of them below:</p></div></div>

        <p>I tested how the 1000 most popular Chrome extensions affect browser performance.</p>
<p>The main metrics I'll consider are CPU consumption, memory consumption, and whether the extension makes pages render more slowly.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/chrome-extension-performance-lookup">list of all tested extensions and their results</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update 8 July 2020: I originally reported the simulated FCP metric provided by Lighthouse rather than the First Contentful Paint observed in the browser. I've now updated the charts and the list of extensions.</em></p>

<h2 id="performance-impact-of-the-top-100-extensions">Performance impact of the Top 100 extensions</h2>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the 100 most used Chrome extensions. Each of these has been installed more than 2 million times.</p>
<p>We’ll look at four different metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page CPU time</strong> How long is the page main thread busy for, and what is it doing?</li>
<li><strong>Page rendering delays</strong> How long does it take until the page displays some content?</li>
<li><strong>Background CPU time</strong> How much processing does the extension do in the background?</li>
<li><strong>Browser memory consumption</strong> How much memory do different components of the browser use?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="page-cpu-usage">Page CPU Usage</h3>
<p>JavaScript execution or running layout logic blocks the browser main thread. This means the browser can’t respond to user interactions.</p>
<p>If no extension is installed loading example.com takes around 40ms of CPU time. If you’ve installed Evernote or Grammarly this jumps to over 500ms.</p>
<p>This chart shows the 20 slowest extensions out of the 100 most used Chrome extensions. The other 80 all add less than 100ms of additional CPU time to the page.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/chrome-extension-page-cpu-time.png" alt="On-page CPU time by Chrome extension, Top 100"></p>
<p>Rather than targeting specific sites, these extensions add code to every page opened by the user. Let’s take a look at what some of they are doing.</p>
<h4 id="evernote-web-clipper">Evernote Web Clipper</h4>
<p>The Evernote extension has over 4 million users. It adds a 2.9MB content script to every page. 140ms are spent just parsing and compiling that code.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/evernote-page-trace.png" alt="Evernote trace showing code being parsed, compiled, and executed"></p>
<p>Once the bundle has been loaded it needs to be evaluated, which takes another 300ms.</p>
<p>Does this code actually do anything? As far as I can tell, no, not unless the user clicks the Evernote extension icon.</p>
<p>The code does set up an event listener that’s fired when the user clicks the icon, but this can be done without loading the full JavaScript bundle.</p>
<h4 id="grammarly-clever-avira-password-manager-skype">Grammarly, Clever, Avira Password Manager, Skype</h4>
<p>This pattern of loading large amounts of unnecessary code repeats with other Chrome extensions.</p>

<p>Extensions often need to inject code into every page, rather than only targeting certain domains. Password managers need to check if there's a login form. Spell checkers need to look for text fields.</p>
<p>However, for performance it would be much better if the code that checks the relevant conditions was separated from the primary functionality of the extension. Then most of the code would only be loaded when necessary. Honey made this change last year and it <a href="#grammarly-and-honey">greatly reduced their performance impact</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Skype only adds 150ms of CPU time, even though it has a large JavaScript bundle. My guess is that this is due to the code mostly consisting of static configuration objects and long strings that are easy to parse and evaluate.</p>
<h4 id="ghostery">Ghostery</h4>
<p>I was surprised to see Ghostery relatively high up in the list. Unlike the other extensions it actually does something on the page, namely displaying how many trackers were blocked.</p>
<p>Ghostery loads 160KB of JavaScript and adds 120ms of CPU time –&nbsp;not a huge amount. However some of this code is render-blocking, as we’ll see in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="page-rendering-delays">Page rendering delays</h3>
<p>While extra CPU time means the page isn’t interactive for some time, this doesn’t normally completely block the page from rendering. To see if an extension blocks rendering we can look at the <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> metric –&nbsp;when the browser starts to display text or images.</p>
<p>Most extensions introduce no or only minor rendering delays. This chart shows the extensions with the largest negative impact on initial content rendering.</p>
<p>Note that the FCP impact of Avira isn't caused by request blocking logic running in the background. We'll see what's going there in the next section.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/extension-fcp.png" alt="Impact of Chrome extension on First Contentful Paint"></p>
<p>Chrome extensions can define scripts and stylesheets that should be injected into the page. By default these are added to the page once the page has finished loading and is idle.</p>
<p>However, extensions developers can decide to load these resources as soon as the page starts loading. For example, the Dark Reader extension changes website content to a dark theme. It would be jarring to first render pages in a bright theme and then suddenly transition. Here it makes sense to run the code before the page starts to render.</p>
<p>The amount of this code should be reduced to a minimum. The good news is that only 12 of the extensions in the chart cause a rendering delay of more than 100ms.</p>
<h4 id="clever-grammarly-rakuten-get-cash-back-for-shopping-last-pass">Clever, Grammarly, Rakuten Get Cash Back for Shopping, LastPass</h4>
<p>These extensions all run significant amounts of code before the page starts rendering. In the case of Clever, page content only starts showing 300ms later than without the extension installed.</p>
<h4 id="avg-avast-safe-price">AVG/Avast SafePrice</h4>
<p>While SafePrice doesn’t wait until the page is idle before injecting scripts, it does wait until the document has loaded. I'm not sure why, but somehow the JavaScript code still appears to run before the initial render.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/safeprice-trace.png" alt="SafePrice Trace showing FCP after content scripts have run"></p>
<h3 id="background-cpu-usage">Background CPU Usage</h3>
<p>Not all processing that a browser extension does happens on a page that's visible to the user. Most Chrome extensions also have something called a background page which lets the extension do things like listen to network requests or update the extension icon.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/background-page-cpu.png" alt="Background page CPU usage, with Avira spending alsmost 3s while Ghostery is a far-off second with 180ms"></p>
<p>Avira Browser Safety spends almost 3s running code in the background page, while all other extensions spend less than 200ms.</p>
<p>Background pages often run code in response to network requests made by the page that was opened by the user. The page from the previous test only makes one network requests, far less than normal. So I ran this test again, this time loading the Apple homepage, which makes around 50 requests.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/background-page-cpu-apple.png" alt="Background page CPU usage when loading Apple homepage, Ghostery spend a bit over 1s"></p>
<p>Interestingly Avira is now significantly faster, 600ms instead of 2.7s! What’s going on?</p>
<p>The Avira Browser Safety extension contains a website allowlist with 30k+ regular expressions. When the user navigates to a new page Avira checks if the page URL is in that allowlist:</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>key</span>: <span>"_isWhitelisted"</span>,
  <span>value</span>: <span><span>function</span> <span>_isWhitelisted</span>(<span>url</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> !!<span>this</span>._whitelist &amp;&amp; <span>this</span>._whitelist.some(<span><span>function</span> (<span>pattern</span>) </span>{
      <span>return</span> pattern.test(url);
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Apple.com is in the allowlist, and because the list is sorted alphabetically the function quickly finishes. Example.com is not in the list, so the extension ends up checking the URL against all 30 thousand regex patterns.</p>
<h3 id="browser-memory-consumption">Browser memory consumption</h3>
<p>Chrome extensions can increase memory consumption, both in pages opened by the user and in the extension background page.</p>
<p>Again, Avira Browser Safety is at the top of the list, increasing memory consumption by 218MB. This is due to the 30k+ regular expressions –&nbsp;I think they are compiled to bytecode or machine code, which needs to be stored in memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/top-100-extension-browser-memory-consumption.png" alt="Browser memory consumption –&nbsp;140MB with no extensions, many extensions raise that by 100-200MB"></p>
<p>Some background pages also contain iframes, for example the Amazon Assistant extension:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/amazon-assistant-subframes.png" alt="DevTools Elements tab for Amazon Assistent background page showing multiple iframes"></p>
<p>An extension with a background page increases memory consumption by at least 10MB. If there’s no background page and only a small on-page script then an extension's the memory impact can be minimal.</p>
<h2 id="performance-impact-of-the-top-1000-extensions">Performance impact of the Top 1000 extensions</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some slightly less popular extensions with 100k+ users.</p>
<h3 id="page-cpu-usage-1">Page CPU Usage</h3>
<p>Previously Evernote had the greatest negative performance impact, increasing CPU times by 560ms. There are 9 extensions among the top 1000 with a greater negative impact than that.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/page-cpu-top-1000.png" alt="Vigia de Preco and Snap &amp; Read both spend over 1s of one-page CPU time"></p>
<h4 id="vigia-de-preco">Vigia de Preço</h4>
<p>Vigia de Preço is a Brazilian coupon and price watching extension with 200k users. It blocks the main thread for 1.6s.</p>
<p>A big part of this is using <a href="https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2">fingerprintjs2</a> to generate a token. For example, this involves rendering an image and generating a data URL for it, in order to detect if certain Canvas features are supported by the browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/vigia-de-preco-trace.png" alt="Vigia de Preco Chrome trace showing fingerprinting"></p>
<h4 id="snap-amp-read">Snap &amp; Read</h4>
<p>Snap &amp; Read has over half a million users and helps them read and understand texts. On every page it loads a 3.8MB lexicon.js file, which is where most of the parse and compile time is spent. Parsing this would likely be much more efficient as a JSON file.</p>
<p>It then processes the lexicon and loads a bunch of libraries like <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise">compromise</a>, jQuery, pdfmake and citeproc. In total Snap &amp; Read loads 7.5MB of JavaScript code on every page.</p>
<h4 id="yi-ban-xiao-cha-jian">壹伴 · 小插件</h4>
<p>This is a Chinese Chrome extension with 300 thousand users. It seems mostly extend the WeChat web editor, but it loads 4MB of code on every page anyway.</p>
<h4 id="moz-bar">MozBar</h4>
<p>MozBar is an SEO tool with 700 thousand users. It doesn’t seem to do much unless you actually click the extension icon, but still runs 3MB of code.</p>
<h3 id="page-rendering-delays-1">Page rendering delays</h3>
<p>Do the additional processing block the page from rendering? Most of the time, no.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/rendering-delays-top-1000.png" alt="FCP increase by Top 1000 Chrome extension"></p>
<p>壹伴 · 小插件 loads 14 content scripts that take over 700ms to process before the page rendering starts. Axe loads two content scripts worth 1.8MB before the page is rendered.</p>
<h3 id="background-cpu-usage-1">Background CPU Usage</h3>
<p>Looking at background pages, no other extension exceeds the additional processing introduced by Avira Browser Safety and Avira Safe Shopping.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/top-1000-background-page-cpu.png" alt="Top 1000 Chrome extension background CPU consumption"></p>
<h4 id="traffic-light">TrafficLight</h4>
<p>Bitdefender TrafficLight is a security extension with 600k users. It checks request URLs against a list of several thousand criteria that might indicate a security issue. To do that it needs to iterate over that list and check if the current URL matches.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/traffic-light-bg-cpu.png" alt="TrafficLight trace showing getRule, runRule, and runMetaRule"></p>
<h3 id="browser-memory-consumption-1">Browser memory consumption</h3>
<p>Interestingly, on a page without ads, ad blockers significantly increase browser memory consumption. This is mostly due to …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

          <p>
          <strong>My current default boilerplate for building web apps: Spring, React, Postgres and Docker Compose on a raw VM</strong>
          </p>
        </header>
      

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>Inspired by Sam Texas’ blog post “<a href="https://www.simplecto.com/docker-django-traefik-intercoolerjs-is-my-stack-for-2021/">Docker, Django, Traefik, and IntercoolerJS is My Go-To Stack for Building a SaaS in 2021</a>” and the accompanied <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25973242">Hacker News thread</a> I decided to write my own version. Not because I think my approach is better (frankly, it’s very similar) but because it’s fun and it will be interesting looking back at it in 5 years.</p>

<p>What I’ll describe below is a stack that <em>I</em> am personally comfortable with and which <em>to me</em> strikes a pretty good balance between budget, ease-of-use and productivity. But as HN user <em>ssijak</em> points out nicely in the linked HN thread:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Goto stack for building SaaS is the one you know the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that being said, let’s get started. This is my stack for 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Spring Boot</strong> backend</li>
  <li><strong>React</strong> in case of SPA</li>
  <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> as database</li>
  <li><strong>Docker Compose</strong> as deployment platform</li>
  <li><strong>Nginx</strong> as reverse proxy</li>
  <li><strong>Hetzner Cloud</strong> for hosting</li>
  <li><strong>Ansible</strong> for infrastructure automation</li>
  <li><strong>Github actions</strong> for CI/CD</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="application-level">Application Level</h2>

<h3 id="spring-boot">Spring Boot</h3>
<p>Spring Boot is my go-to backend technology for the simple reason that it allows me to get stuff done. With Spring Boot, it feels like the only code you write is business logic. There’s barely any glue code or plumbing, you just fill in the gaps, everything else is taken care of. Working with Spring makes you realize how much time you wasted reinventing the wheel and writing code that brings absolutely zero value.</p>

<p>What Spring is for me is Django or Ruby on Rails for others. Ultimately, which one you pick doesn’t really matter. At this point it’s more of a cultural thing: If you started your career in California you’d probably be more inclined to pick Rails but I grew up in Europe, where Spring is more commonplace. In terms of features, they’re equivalent as far as I’m concerned.</p>

<p>Now, a few things need to be said about Java. Java still has its shortcomings but it has been making great strides in the right direction:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Verbosity</strong>: When people think of Java they think of unnecessary boilerplate. I’m happy to announce that those days are gone: <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/all">Project Lombok</a> removes a large part of Java’s inherent verbosity. Also, with every language iteration more and more quality of life improvements are added: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/language/local-variable-type-inference.html">type inference via <code>var</code> keyword</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/language/records.html">record classes</a> are just two examples.</li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous programming and concurrency</strong>: What has irked me for a long time is Java’s subpar support for asynchronous programming - but that has been taken care of as well thanks to projects such as <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">Reactive Extensions</a> and <a href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</a>. Hell, we’ll even get true fibers with <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main">Project Loom</a> in the near future.</li>
  <li><strong>Heavy weight</strong>: Sure, the JVM is still heavy. An idle Spring app takes 200 - 300 MB of RAM. And I acknowledge that this might be a deal breaker for some but IMO the productivity gains are more than worth it. Let’s also not forget that the JVM is an <em>incredibly</em> powerful piece of technology, so when you need the power you have it at your fingertips.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like it or not, Java is as relevant as ever and it will stay that way for many more years.</p>

<h3 id="react-frontend">React Frontend</h3>
<p>I firmly believe that SPAs are vastly overused and that in many cases you can get away with simple server-side rendering. But I’m not one of those who reject SPAs <em>out of principle</em>. For applications that are heavy on the interaction side I currently go with React. This choice has nothing to do with me being a flaming React fanboy (far from it) but again, with how comfortable I am working with it. I just so happened to be doing some work with React in previous projects and was able to gain a decent grasp of it in the process. React has long surpassed the point where I would call it “mature” and the documentation and community support is superb. For someone who’s primarily a backend developer and who does some frontend work because it <em>needs</em> to be done that’s all I could ever ask for.</p>

<p>I store my frontend code alongside the backend code in a mono repo and serve the static files from Spring’s embedded Tomcat Webserver. I really like being able to deploy frontend and backend in one go.</p>

<h3 id="postgresql">PostgreSQL</h3>
<p>I think nothing really needs to be said about Postgres. It’s just a no-brainer. When I look back at previous projects Postgres has been the technology that throughout caused the least amount of trouble - by far. You spin it up and it simply does what it’s supposed to do. A certain degree of SQL knowledge is required of course and it doesn’t hurt to know the SQL tuning basics: indexing, denormalization, materialized views, <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>, etc… But in most cases you won’t even get into the situation where you need to optimize it.</p>

<p>In addition, Postgres makes for a great task queue for asynchronous workloads. No need to introduce Redis, just use your existing Postgres with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE"><code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code></a>.</p>

<h3 id="logging--monitoring">Logging / Monitoring</h3>
<p>Logging and monitoring is the only real pain point in my set up. Self-hosting an ELK stack is not really viable and lighter-weight alternatives are few and far between. So far, I had to resort to grepping raw logs from the containers which works alright (grep stronk!!1 💪) but if you have a better idea, please let me know! I’m currently contemplating sending all logs over to AWS Cloudwatch via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/">Docker log driver</a> although I’m really not a fan of the product itself, but hey, it’s super cheap.</p>

<h2 id="infrastructure-level">Infrastructure Level</h2>

<h3 id="docker-compose-as-deployment-platform">Docker Compose as deployment platform</h3>
<p>For simple projects and early stage startups Docker Compose really is enough. If you only need to run a handful of containers and you don’t have crazy scaling requirements (most applications don’t) there’s no need to bother with Kubernetes. Did you know that you can <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#replicas">scale containers in and out</a> with Docker Compose? With some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49090395/how-to-achieve-a-rolling-update-with-docker-compose">tricks</a> you can even achieve rolling updates! Anyway, my boilerplate Docker Compose stack consists of the following containers:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy">Nginx proxy</a></strong>: Unsurprisingly, this container runs an nginx reverse proxy. The cool thing about it is that it listens on the Docker socket for newly created containers. If a new container has the <code>VIRTUAL_HOST</code> environment variable set the proxy will automatically create a route to that container using the specified virtual host. When I want to host another application, I just spin up the container with <code>VIRTUAL_HOST</code> value set to e.g. “myapp.mydomain.com” and seconds later I can reach the application on myapp.mydomain.com.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion">Let’s Encrypt proxy companion</a></strong>: A container running alongside the nginx proxy that automatically issues and renews Let’s Encrypt certificates for the specified virtual hosts.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower/">Watchtower</a></strong>: Watchtower regularly checks whether an updated image is available for any of your running containers, and if so performs a (rolling) update. Automatic updates can be turned off for individual containers that you don’t want to randomly restart, like the database.</li>
</ol>

    <figcaption>
      My setup: Running Docker Compose as deployment platform.

    </figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="hetzner-cloud-for-hosting">Hetzner Cloud for hosting</h3>
<p>My Docker Compose stacks typically run on an ordinary Linux VM on <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud">Hetzner Cloud</a> but any hosting provider suffices really. The reason I’m choosing Hetzner over Digital Ocean or Linode is its <em>truly thrifty™</em> pricing. 2.96€/mo for 1 vCPU / 2 GB RAM / 20 GB disk, it doesn’t get cheaper than that.</p>

<h3 id="ansible-for-infrastructure-automation">Ansible for infrastructure automation</h3>
<p>For some reason, Ansible has always scared me. Maybe because when you’re dealing with Ansible you’re leaving the nice and cozy, cotton candy developer world and enter the murky, obscure realm of die-hard Linux system administration. Ansible is one of the tools that I never understood what its good for and what exactly the difference is to Chef and Puppet. But as it turns out, it’s really not that scary. It’s simply a tool that helps you set up and manage your raw Linux box. It covers the stuff that comes <em>before</em> running Docker, like for example <em>installing</em> Docker. I’m sure there millions of advanced use cases for Ansible, like managing entire <em>fleets</em> of servers but what <em>I</em> am using it for is only the initial setup of my VM. Steps that I would typically do manually once I first login to the VM: setting up users and installing packages in particular. The benefit of doing it via script (as opposed to manual) is that it’s repeatable, versioned and documented in code. So when I decide to move a project to another hosting provider I can simply reconfigure a new server address and launch a new environment within seconds. I typically use a version of <a href="https://gist.github.com/dhet/59cc8c8c3f0ef7f5604bdf2af7f0b960">this playbook</a> which sets up a Linux environment with Docker ready to use and basic security precautions applied (firewall, automatic updates, disabled password login, etc.).</p>

<p>Additionally, I’m making use of <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html">Ansible Vault</a> which allows you to encrypt files (like .env files containing secrets) so that they can be checked into git. The files can then be decrypted by the deployment pipeline using the <a href="https://github.com/anthonykgross/ansible-vault-cli-github-action">Ansible Vault Github action</a>.</p>

<h3 id="github-actions-for-cicd">Github actions for CI/CD</h3>
<p>CI/CD has never been easier than with Github actions. It’s so dead simple I’ll just post a deployment workflow config and it will explain itself.</p>

<p>Not only are black people more likely than white people to be stopped by police, but new research in <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2372732220943639" target="_blank">Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences</a> </em>documents that the darker you are, the more likely you are to be shot.</p>



<p>Conversely white people with very white skin are less likely to have force used against them.&nbsp; “Whiteness serve(s) as a protective factor,” <strong>Kimberly Barsamian Kahn</strong> and <strong>Karin D. Martin</strong> explain in “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2372732220943639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Social Psychology of Racially Biased Policing: Evidence-Based Policy Responses</a>.”</p>



<p>Communities nationwide are trying various strategies to combat the inherent bias and stereotyping that not only target black people but also can cause perpetrators to deny feelings of pain experienced by minorities, such as Freddie Gray, who had his spinal cord broken while in police transport, and George Floyd, who died as a white officer kneeled on his throat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these strategies–community policing, body cameras, officer training on biases, etc.–have the potential to lead to better police outcomes, a key ingredient still is needed: a national database of policing outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without comprehensive data, any efforts at reforming police behaviors are compromised.</p>



<p>According to the researchers, the latest effort to create such a database could come through passage of the “<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020</a>,” a bill introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives.&nbsp; The bill not only recommends cameras and other strategies that have shown promise, but it also adds the creation of a national, coordinated effort to collect and analyze police use of force.</p>



<p>Such a database “would significantly aid in assessing, and addressing, racial biases in police outcomes,” the researchers state.</p>



<p>Federal efforts to create a comprehensive database, thus far unsuccessful, include the 2014 reauthorization of the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000.&nbsp; The act requires states to provide quarterly reports of anyone incarcerated or in police custody, but the extent of compliance “remains unclear,” according to the research.</p>



<p>The Bureau of Justice Statistics, through what the researchers describe as a “laborious process,” also attempted to generate data on deaths in custody.&nbsp; Among other findings, they learned that during a three-month period, the media reported 377 deaths while law enforcement agencies reported 48.</p>



<p>The latest attempt, the George Floyd Act, would institute the much-needed, comprehensive, nationwide database; it also would create a National Police Misconduct Registry to reduce the rehiring of problematic officers, and it would ban “no knock” warrants, which occurred in the death of Breonna Taylor, and tactics such as the choke hold that killed Floyd.</p>



<p>The bill also would require the use of body cameras, police training on implicit bias and other strategies that, collectively, “all…have the potential to reduce bias if they are enacted and enforced.”</p>

<p><img src="https://ans.unibs.it/assets/images/csimurder.png">
CSI-MURDER takes the move from one of the most flourishing research topics in wireless networks: the ability to exploit communication signals to sense the surrounding environment and hence to localize people and possibly objects.
Instead of proposing yet another localization system, this project explores the possibility of preventing unauthorized localization without hampering the communication performance.
Sensing techniques use the Channel State Information (CSI) embedded in each Wi-Fi frame for understanding how wireless signals propagate in the environment: for instance, by measuring how CSI amplitude changes over time it is possible to detect human presence or motion, recognize different types of activity, even detect specific gestures or measure human breathing, albeit these fine-grained detection has proven hard to replicate.
This project tackles the problem of neutralizing un-authorized surveillance while preserving the communication performance. To this end, we implemented a number of functions for modifying Wi-Fi frames before they are transmitted over the channel in such a way that their content can still be decoded, while the CSI appears as being randomly generated so that eavesdroppers cannot use CSI for sensing the environment.</p>

<p><img src="https://ans.unibs.it/assets/images/privacy-attack.png"></p>

<p>Imagine someone wants to illegally track the position (and implicitely the time spent) by someone into a laboratory, for instance to track how much time is spent into different activities to be performace ad different desks/instruments, as depicted in the upper picture. How much effective can this attack be?</p>

<p>Actual experiments, reported in the lower picture on the left, tells us the CSI-base localization can be extremely accurate, as all the stimated poings(the marks) basically falls within the circle representing the position where the person in the lab was sitting working. With CSI-MURDER instead the localization becomes impossible, giving random results, thus preserving the person privacy without destroying Wi-Fi communications.</p>

		<article>
				               
			<p>We are at a critical moment, when digital technologies of automation, often referred to with buzzy vocabulary like “algorithms” and “AI,” are poised to transform work in a “Fourth Industrial Revolution.” Headlines scream about the imminent replacement of workers, often in language reminiscent of anti-immigrant rhetoric: robots are threatening to “take” or “steal” jobs. You can even go to the website willrobotstakemyjob.com and input specific occupations to get statistics on the likelihood of such theft. Writers have only a 3.8 percent chance—“totally safe”—while machinists face an alarming 65 percent. “Robots are watching,” the site cautions. These numbers are drawn from a widely cited 2013 report by economist Carl Benedikt Frey and computer scientist Michael A. Osborne that concluded 47 percent of total US employment would be automated by 2034.</p>
<p>Many writers on the radical left have accepted this framing of automation, while detourning its implications, making “full automation” central to the transcendence of capitalist exploitation. In <em>Inventing the Future</em>, Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek argue, “Without full automation, postcapitalist futures must necessarily choose between abundance at the expense of freedom (echoing the work-centricity of Soviet Russia) or freedom at the expense of abundance, represented by primitivist dystopias.” Aaron Bastani’s <em>Fully Automated Luxury Communism</em> pushes this idea to its limits, promising a future of boundless leisure for all, supplemented by a profusion of goods and services delivered sans human exploitation: “We will see more of the world than ever before, eat varieties of food we never have heard of, and lead lives equivalent—if we so wish—to those of today’s billionaires.”</p>
<p>Such a framing is both simple and attractive, especially to those of us trapped in dead-end jobs and eking out precarious existences; if robots, rather than we and our fellow workers, performed these tasks, and the productivity of technology were widely and equally dispersed, maybe we could spend our days doing more fulfilling activities than punching a clock. Like those cheesy banner ads that were all over the web in the late 2000s, you could have an egalitarian society with “one weird trick.” The bourgeoisie would hate this!</p>
<p>But Full Automators, whether dystopian or utopian, have a misguided approach to the question. According to historian Aaron Benanav, the specter of a postwork future has been conjured by anemic growth rates, not new technologies. Without radical change, our fate is further stagnation and crisis, not the world of the Jetsons. But new technologies certainly exist, and they are certainly doing, well, <em>something</em> to the work. But what?</p>
<p>Let’s start with a more basic question. What is automation? Machines have replicated and augmented human work processes for centuries, and that is often the colloquial use of “automation” in our current moment. But “automation” was not used to describe this process until 1947, when Delmar Harder, vice president of manufacturing at Ford Motor Company, created its Automation Department. The department’s engineers redesigned automobile production so that materials were automatically conveyed from one process to another, obviating the need for laborers to load and unload machines. Further, the process was itself increasingly machine-controlled, through a system of timers, switches, and relays—what technology historian David Hounsell calls the “electromechanical brain.”</p>
<p>Most of the technologies involved in automation had been developed and implemented in other industries years before their incorporation into Ford’s production process. What made automation new was its centrality to Ford’s manufacturing strategy, coming at a time of historic unrest among autoworkers, and in particular, on the heels of a costly twenty-four-day strike at Ford’s massive River Rouge plant in May of 1949. Not only would the new technologies dramatically reduce an unruly labor force, but they allowed Ford to decentralize its production away from the roiling unrest of Detroit as the company opened new automated factories, with new less militant employees, in Cleveland and Buffalo. Workers immediately perceived the threat, and automation was, from its inception, a deeply politicized issue. The history of automation reveals it as a political tool to subvert worker power, not simply an economic one to increase productivity.</p>
<p>Digging into the technical side of automation unearths more problems with the Full Automation Fallacy. David Autor, an economist, offers a useful corrective in his 2015 article “Why Are There Still So Many Jobs?,” its plaintive title a response to John Maynard Keynes’s Depression-era predictions of an automated future with a 15-hour work week. As Autor explains, rather than simply replace human jobs with machinic processes, automation affects labor in complex ways:</p>
<p>Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been “polarization” of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle.</p>
<p>Automation thus recomposes the workforce, isolating and rearranging tasks, altering job descriptions, and hollowing out middle-tier occupations.</p>
<p>Why does automation polarize instead of outright replace jobs? For one, many jobs require labor that is challenging to automate. Computers have to follow instructions laid out by programmers, so in order to substitute a computer for a worker, the worker’s tasks must be understood and articulated. However, much of the labor process is encompassed in tacit knowledge that workers are unable to articulate: “There are tasks for which neither computer programmers nor anyone else can enunciate the explicit ‘rules’ or procedures.” Even when tasks are known, automating them is easier said than done. On one end, computers cannot replicate the high levels of abstract thought required for managerial positions. On the other, jobs that require both manual work and flexibility, such as service sector jobs in food preparation and maintenance, are both difficult and cost-prohibitive to automate.</p>
<p>Take an example. In March 2018, Flippy, a burger-flipping robot, was rolled out at the Pasadena location of fast-food chain CaliBurger, to great fanfare and numerous headlines. The implication was clear: Would this humble machine spell the end of the fast-food job, the metonym for low-skilled entry-level occupations?</p>
<p>Not exactly. In an event that provoked far less press coverage, Flippy was retired after one day of work. CaliBurger’s owners took the honorable path of blaming Flippy’s failure on their human employees: workers, they explained, were simply too slow with tasks such as dressing the burgers, causing Flippy’s meaty achievements to pile up. However, a few discerning journalists had previously noted Flippy’s numerous errors in the relatively simple task that gave the robot its name. Flippy just wasn’t very good at its job. And so, yet another fully automated dream came crashing into messy reality.</p>
<p>According to Autor, the introduction of new kinds of information and control technology, such as what is currently hyped as “artificial intelligence,” supplements managerial work, and so increases the power and wages of bosses. On the other end, manual laborers (such as Flippy’s coworkers) see tasks eaten away and their movements reorganized and tightly controlled to make room for more rigid machines. Wages and working conditions deteriorate. But even then, automation stops short of “full”: such systems, as we will see, rely upon a stratum of human labor that is all but ineradicable. This is as true of Flippy as it is of the most powerful AI.</p>
<p>What do tend to be substitutable are not the lowest rungs, but those jobs requiring repetitive physical labor, as well as middle management jobs in operations. For example, Amazon’s warehouses use a software-directed system that coordinates human laborers, who select individual goods, with robots, who move large shelves. Algorithms replace middle-income jobs in managing the floor, leading to a polarized workforce of increasingly wealthy and powerful executives and programmers and increasingly degraded laborers who are substitutable not by machines, but by other humans; in other words, they are eminently replaceable.</p>
<p>But some have their targets set on precisely those positions in “knowledge work” that once promised a future safe from the robots. Technologists such as Kai-Fu Lee, former president of Google China, vow that white-collar jobs will go first. According to Lee, “The white collar jobs are easier to take because they’re purely a quantitative analytical process. Reporters, traders, telemarketing, telesales, customer service, analysts, they can all be replaced by software.”</p>
<p>But, of course, automation never completely erases human labor. Lee’s prediction of total replacement of knowledge work is a profound exaggeration, as a report by the think tank Data &amp; Society makes plain: “AI technologies reconfigure work practices rather than replace workers,” while at the same time, “automated and AI technologies tend to mask the human labor that allows them to be fully integrated into a social context while profoundly changing the conditions and quality of labor that is at stake.” Investigating grocery store self-checkout, researchers found that Luddite customers hated and avoided the technology. In response, management cut staff to make lines so unbearable that customers gave up and used the machines instead. Even then, cashiers were still required to assist and monitor transactions; rather than reduce workload, the technologies were “intensifying the work of customer service and creating new challenges.”</p>
<p>Self-checkout is an example of what technology journalist Brian Merchant calls “shitty automation”:</p>

    <h2>How Google's insidious* behavior led me to find superior alternatives.</h2>
    
    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/google-sign-out.png" alt="Google warning: 'Couldn't sign you in'"></p><p>I saw the above warning using <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi</a>: a successful and powerful Chromium based browser. There's nothing insecure about it. I tried to fix the problem by disabling all extensions, clearing all browser data, and enabling “less secure app access” in the Google account settings. Alas. The only solution I found was reinstalling the browser. But after having done so—five times—each time when clearing the cookies, or enabling a VPN, it wouldn't let me sign in again. Then the following email found my inbox.</p>

    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/google-warning.png" alt="Google warning: someone knows the password to your linked Google account"></p><p>“Someone knows the password to your linked Google Account”… Me. It was <em>me</em>! Obviously <em>I</em> know the password to my linked Google account. Forced to change my password I was duly annoyed. I realized how dependent I was. If Google unpredictably revokes access to your account, you can't log into anything else of their services: YouTube, Gmail, Play Store, Docs, Drive, Calendar, etc. Fortunately I already did a partial Google and social media exodus. Nevertheless, even when only using YouTube and Google Play, losing access startled me. Therefore, because I don't want to be put in this position again, I completed the exodus: discarding the need for a Google account.</p>

    <p>A quick aside, I have nothing against monopolies as a general rule. Usually they grow so big because of a significantly superior service <sup>(1)</sup>. But as convenient as they may be—even though their products aren't superior anymore—if their power goes to their head and they start pulling insidious shenanigans, like using false claims to deter people from browsers other than Chrome, then I'm out.</p>

    <p>So that's exactly what I did and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. Believe it or not but my phone is more responsive and the battery lasts longer. Although the former might be due to the factory reset, I assume the latter has to do with the decrease in background processes due to 1. removing my Google account 2. subsequently disabling Google Play Store 3. disabling everything in the settings tab called Google services &amp; preferences. Digital minimalism, it's so incredibly satisfying. You should try it. Your life was perfectly fine before you had all that extra stuff to worry about (or pay for); I learnt that from my teacher, Diogenes of Sinope, 404 – 323 BC.</p>

    <h2>Alternatives to Google.</h2>
    <p>Diogenes would suggest living on the streets, but I'm unsure if that's feasible, and you'd still be overwhelmed by ads. So what to do? One could completely avoid Google as there is plenty competition to choose from. A quick search for “Google alternatives” or a peek at <a href="https://nomoregoogle.com/">No More Google</a> or <a href="https://degoogle.jmoore.dev/">degoogle</a> can suffice. Although, realistically, one will want to keep using some of their services, preferably without an account. As was the case for me.</p>

    <h3>YouTube.</h3>
    <p>YouTube has a lot of content nowhere else to be found. Fortunately one doesn't need an account (yet) to simply watch these videos. However, sometimes logging in is required. To <strong>circumvent logging in</strong>, use the YouTube front-end <a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>, and select an instance such as ytprivate.com. It uses YouTube in the background, but discards the bullshit, making the website much faster. Just enter a search term, or copy-paste the YouTube URL or video ID, and you're good to go. If you require <strong>playlists</strong> or <strong>subscriptions</strong>, Invidious supports that too if you register. Importing or exporting data from other Invidious instances is possible as well.</p>

    <p>If you want to manually create a playlist on YouTube without an account, append the following URL with the YouTube video IDs separated by commas, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch_videos?video_ids=xUozVQVt1xI,ed0fRdTma9I.</p>
    
    <p>When on <strong>mobile</strong>, <a href="https://newpipe.net/">NewPipe</a> is the way. There are other YouTube front-ends, but I strongly recommend NewPipe because: it is highly configurable, it supports background play on a locked phone, it features easy downloading, it has <em>no</em> ads, it works hand in hand with PeerTube and Invidious, it's super fast, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>Google Play Store.</h3>
    <p>The Google Play store is something I was most worried about. I assumed using “their” apps necessitated a Google account. Not necessarily. <strong>The free apps don't require an account, the paid apps do</strong>. For example, I purchased Wolfram Alpha but can't install it without Google Play Store. And even if I could, I'd need my Google account as a receipt to reactivate it. In total I have 14 apps and one digital book I paid for. But as time passed I found better and free alternatives to all of them, or I merely donated to support their decision to refuse ads, not their premium functions. However, I can understand if this is a dealbreaker to those who are dependent on non-free apps.</p>
      
    <p>Anyway, to install an app you just need an .apk file. But to avoid a time-consuming process, there are alternative app catalogues such as <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/"><strong>F-Droid</strong></a> and <a href="https://auroraoss.com/app_info.php?app_id=1"><strong>Aurora Store</strong></a>, these will serve most of your needs. I suggest perusing F-Droid first because its apps are FOSS (Free and Open Source Software); more than half of mine are on it. Here's a list of everyting I use: <a href="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/software.html">quitfacebook.org/file/software.html</a>.</p>

    <p>Not going to lie, it feels good to release the shackles; Google Play Store is disabled and everything works just fine. However, Google Play <em>services</em> needs to remain enabled for functionalities such as auto updates, push notifications, or geolocation <sup>(2)</sup>. I can live with that, for now, but the decreased battery life is noticeable. If that's too much to ask, just disable it, or consider the alternative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroG">MicroG</a>. I can't vouch for it yet, but it looks promising.</p>

    <h3>Gmail.</h3>
    <p>I'm only keeping this account just in case I need the key to the dungeon. Otherwise I use <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a>, which was developed by scientists at CERN <sup>(3)</sup>; 'nuff said? Sure there are plenty of other providers, but man, developed at CERN, that's like a Vulcan salute to Trekkies.</p>

    <p>🖖</p>

    <h3>Google Chrome.</h3>
    <p>On a PC <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi Browser</a>'s quality <em>does</em> match up to its name—and we all know <em>Four Seasons</em>. I could throw around superlatives all day, but I won't spoil the pleasant surprise. What got <em>me</em> to click “set as default browser” was Vivaldi's unmatched simultaneous customizability <em>and</em> speed. Not surprisingly, it has a thriving community forum.</p>

    <p>On mobile look no further than <a href="https://kiwibrowser.com/">Kiwi Browser</a>. To summarize their own website: fast, quiet, without annoyances. They aren't lying. Best of all, they support <em>all</em> extensions such as uBlock Origin and uMatrix; thumbs up if you know what they are already.</p>

    <h3>Google Drive.</h3>
    <p>The only thing I used Google Drive for was backing up contacts. This can easily be replaced by exporting a .vcf file. Similarly, before a factory reset, I just manually use the export function of the few apps I want backups from.</p>

    <p>But what in the case of a hard drive crash? For the most important files I use a directory that's immediately synced to <a href="https://mega.nz/">MEGA</a> by default. For instance, I'm writing this page on a file that's sent to the cloud each time it's saved. This is probably commonplace and trivial information for IT enthusiasts, but I'm certain that's not most people.</p>

    <h3>Google search.</h3>
    <p>I admit I haven't found any search engine with better results than Google, despite its bias. If you want to avoid Google completely, use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>—but let's call it <a href="https://duck.com/">duck.com</a> from now on so we can say “duck it” instead of “google it”.</p>

    <p>Ideally, just be efficient and use shortcuts for multiple search engines.</p>

    <h3>Google Authenticator.</h3>
    <p>If Google Authenticator is a Trump Hotel, then <a href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis Authenticator</a> is a Ritz-Carlton. Why? Aegis is open source, supports backups, and offers more security. Therefore, unless you want to be “grabbed by the pussy” <sup>(4)</sup>, you know where to stay.</p>

    <h3>Google Translate.</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepl.com/">DeepL</a>. The translations it produces are astounding; single words as well as full text translations. Try it, I'm confident you'll confirm that it beats Google.</p>

    <h3>Google Ads.</h3>
    <p>Fuck ads, and I'm being polite. To find out how I block all of them I suggest you read my post “<a href="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/adblocking.html">Ad blocking, or how to use the Web properly.</a>”</p>

    <h2>Why do I care?</h2>
    <p>I don't have a coherent answer yet; the problem is multifold and my expertise is lacking. Regardless, things don't feel right. For one, it greatly bothers me that there is a vast collection of fantastic software that doesn't get the attention it deserves. Especially the ones made by praiseworthy developers who refuse ads and trackers. Frequently they're hidden behind products of those who can spend the most on marketing, or they suffer traffic loss by biased search results. Consequently, these virtuous mindsets don't get incentivized as they earn significantly less money. Developers with a backbone deserve to be rewarded more. Additionally, the dumbing down of devices and software decreases all-around tech savviness and makes us more reliant while hypocritically increasing the attitude of taking things for granted.</p>

    <p>To add fuel to the fire, we've become addicted to convenience because monopolies handed us everything on silver plate in return for our data, all so the consumption of whatever can be increased. It sounds like a conspiracy, but it isn't; data is seen as the new oil for just that reason: manipulation. Call me old-fashioned all you want, but I consider wilful manipulation evil. The fact that Facebook is still around after all their <em>known</em> scandals proves how hollow we've become.</p>

<p>Last week I spoke at the <a href="http://newpublic.org/">New_Public festival</a> in an “online park” where designers, urbanists, and artists explored how to create better “digital public spaces”. While preparing for the session I hosted, I started questioning how we came to understand our social media platforms as the “new public square” in the first place. The road to widespread internet adoption was paved with spatial metaphors, which helped non-technical people wrap their heads around this brand new technology. We drove down the information super<em>highway</em>, we visited cyber <em>space</em>, we navigated to web <em>sites</em>. Software designers were known as digital <em>architects</em> who built virtual places for work and play. We talked about the internet as if it was <em>outside</em> of us —&nbsp;an environment to wander around in, an ocean to surf.</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/digital-sensorium/internet.gif"></p>

<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/fIowerstructure">É. Urcades</a>, one of my favorite technologists on the interwebs, has challenged me to think differently about digital spaces. “websites”, he says, “are absolutely not places or architecture, they are temporary bodies … when you design interfaces you are -literally- designing the sensory organs people use to perceive information — interface design is organ design.” When our organs of perception get augmented by new technologies, we experience subtle shifts in our relationships with each other and with our selves. Throughout the 2010s, some <a href="https://qz.com/677218/this-woman-a-self-described-cyborg-can-sense-every-earthquake-in-real-time/">wannabe</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Harbisson">cyborgs</a> have already undergone extremely invasive procedures to augment their default “hardware”. But if É. Urcades is right, you don’t even need risky surgery to acquire new senses. You just have to turn on your (pocket) computer.</p>

<p>Thirty years into the digital age, it’s safe to say the internet isn’t just an <em>external</em> environment that we travel through or a “public space” that we stroll around in. It’s fully entangled with our nervous systems now, and it has re-shaped our minds in ways that aren’t always easy or comfortable to articulate. This process became even more apparent during 2020 —&nbsp;a year in which screens swallowed the last remaining bits of our “offline” culture and daily lives. I don’t think we’ll be able to create the sort of digital publics that the New_Public festival is aiming towards until we’ve adequately taken stock of what happens <em>within us</em> when we <a href="https://twitter.com/HipCityReg/status/1340760227021533186?s=20">live</a> with the technologies we’ve built.</p>

<p>To that end, I wrote up 8 first-person stories about the new psychologies that have emerged under the influence of digital media. These accounts are based on a number of conversations with internet friends and strangers over the last few years. This is no doubt a small sampling of the subjective experiences that have been created by our software “sense organs.” What other unique sensory configurations are floating around out there, waiting to be discovered? Starting today, I’m opening up a digital <a href="https://j200lig809x.typeform.com/to/aKlUewsm">hotline</a> in order to find out. You can think of the stories below as the very first submissions to the hotline. Perhaps you’ll even recognize some of the experiences they describe as your own.</p>

<strong>subject: Exoskeletal unease</strong><br></p>

<p>You know that feeling when you outgrow your wardrobe? When you no longer feel like yourself in your old clothes? That happens to me with my virtual avatars and profile photos. Or maybe my accounts are more like <a href="https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1171603433301790720?s=20">exoskeletons</a> that I have to shed as I grow, and they absolutely need to be maintained because they’re as much “me” as anything else. My physical body no longer feels like the “center of gravity” of my identity… my sense of presence is forever <a href="https://hipcityreg.substack.com/p/the-concurrency-pool">fractured</a> and distributed all over the place. I close my eyes and imagine all the screens that are displaying my content at this very moment, I wonder about the total number of pixels I currently occupy, I feel like I am nowhere and also everywhere. After a while, the exoskeleton I wear online doesn’t really feel like a true expression of my inner self. It’s so much <a href="https://twitter.com/matildepark_/status/1258240760698286080?s=20">work</a> to keep it up to date, but I basically don’t have a choice because that’s where I do most of my socializing nowadays. To be honest, my internet friends are the only people who really understand what I’m about —&nbsp;everyone else is stuck with a shallow, incomplete version of me. As you can probably tell, I pour a lot of my self into these apps. When they die, like Vine did a few years ago, it feels almost like a psychological amputation. I’m permanently cut off from a part of my exoskeleton, and I have to grow a whole new shell.</p>

<strong>subject: Hyperlink holism</strong></p>

<p>So I started putting together a wiki of all my personal knowledge about 4 years ago, before Roam and Notion and Are.na were even a thing. I really wanted to be able to surf across my own mind the way other people surf across the web. My database is an always-growing <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1091506683036164096?s=20">network</a> of quotes, speculations, Bible verses, synchronistic hyperlinks, and interesting juxtapositions of information that I’ve collected from all over the place. Now that I’ve been building this wiki for a few years, my perception seems way more hyperlinked than it used to. Any random object or situation gives me like 400 flashbacks to books X, Y, Z and obscure historical references 1, 2, 3. I can’t look at a thing anymore and just see the thing. I filter all new info through the lens of my digitally extended mind and it feels like a superpower, or like that NZT-48 drug from the movie <em>Limitless</em>. Guess you could say I run my own little intelligence agency. Sometimes I even prefer video chat to IRL convos because I can easily reference my external brain without the other person noticing. If I ever lost access to my database, I’m not really sure <em>what</em> I’d do. I think the networked note-takers are really on the front lines of creating the Global Social Computer in the Cloud. Part of me suspects that someday, after I’m gone, someone will be able to use all my data to bring me back to life in deepfake form, like they <a href="https://adage.com/article/advertising/parkland-victim-joaquin-oliver-comes-back-life-heartbreaking-plea-voters/2285166">did to that kid</a> who died in the Parkland shootings. It gives me peace of mind to think that maybe, just maybe, my digital soul will survive into the far future —&nbsp;long after my meatspace body has decomposed.</p>

<strong>subject: Digital bicameralism</strong></p>

<p>Twitter has definitely changed my relationship with my internal monologue. Just like my vocal cords and larynx turn my silent neural activity into vibrating air molecules, my <em>external</em> voice box on twitter dot com turns my inner rumination into text on someone else’s screen. Before I started posting, my thoughts were more abstract and non-verbal —&nbsp;like blobs of play-doh floating around a zero gravity chamber. I used to spend a lot of time re-molding these amorphous thought forms into Twitter-friendly nuggets. But nowadays my internal monologue speaks tweet by default. Thoughts bubble up from the depths of my psyche readymade for the timeline, already twisted into the pre-programmed shape of a Post. I wonder if the algorithm is starting to interfere with the way my subconscious works. What if it’s filtering out thoughts that it doesn’t think will perform well online? Every day, thousands of strangers upload little slices of their consciousness directly into my mind. My <a href="https://reallifemag.com/podcast-passivity/">concern</a> is that I’m prone to mistake their thoughts for my own — that some part of me believes I’m only hearing myself think. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I’ll scroll through my old posts just to remind myself of myself. It feels like looking in the mirror. I’m swallowing my (digital) self so that I’m <em>me</em> instead of someone else.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<strong>subject: Vidya gaem consciousness</strong></p>

<p>I basically spent all my childhood building worlds in SimCity and Rollercoaster Tycoon and zooming into random cities on <a href="https://reallifemag.com/springtime-everywhere/">Google Earth</a>. These apps definitely inspired my decision to work in urban planning. This might sound weird, but when I walk through a building I can usually <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1260366804184117248?s=20" title="">tell you</a> what version of AutoCad they used to design it. After spending years and years in rendering software, you sort of get a sixth sense for the tools &amp; features that the architect had access to, and the IRL built environment starts to feel kinda fake — like the different “towns” inside Disney World. On top of that, the POV of the virtual camera follows me out into the “real world.” I’m pretty good at hallucinating what my surroundings would look like from the drone’s eye view. (The other day, one of my friends was telling me that he can convince himself he’s playing The Sims or a first-person shooter game with his own body, monitoring the little green bars, making sure his stats are all good). When I look at the gradient of a beautiful sunset, or the hairline cracks in a concrete sidewalk, or the murky texture of a cumulonimbus cloud, I can’t help but think about how hard it’d be to make something like that in Unity. It’s almost like the world is a big game engine and God is the supernatural renderer. Maybe one of these days I’ll turn around too quickly and spot a glitch. Sometimes I mix up my IRL memories with memories from my VR experiences, but that’s a whole other story…</p>

<p>I’ve been on TikTok a lot lately, and it’s kind of changed the way I see and hear things. When I’m scrolling the For You page, I’m not really taking in each video as a whole —&nbsp;I’m always deconstructing it in my mind. I process the audio separately from the visuals and try to figure out how I might re-use the sound for my own content ideas. The weird thing is that this “Song Exploder” mode of hearing has seeped into my everyday life. When I’m out and about, I’m constantly sensing my auditory environment through the TikTok filter in my head. When I’m hanging out with friends who spend a lot of time on the app, we can basically speak a whole different language together.

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<p>New Year’s Eve morning, I decided to start the new year with Roam. </p>



<p>A few days ago, I noticed, I passed the threshold of 5,000 notes in Evernote. The last two years, my daily-not-so-daily Logs are missing a piece of organization, that I might find in Roam. That’s how Travis Daily started his post on <a href="https://travisdailey.com/migrate-to-roam-research/">how to migrate from Evernote to Roam</a> “I have 5000 plus notes in my Evernote account”. </p>







<h2 id="0-roam-sources">Roam Sources</h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://travisdailey.com/migrate-to-roam-research/">Migrate From Evernote To Roam Research With Notion</a> by Travis Daily</li><li><a href="https://www.roamtips.com/">Roam Tips by </a>Mark Traphagen (<a href="https://twitter.com/marktraphagen">@marktraphagen</a>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">Roam: Why I Love It and How I Use It</a> by <strong>Nat Eliason</strong> – one of my long reads of this week. </li></ul>



<p>The first time,  I heard about Roam was on the<a href="https://reactpodcast.simplecast.com/episodes/104"> 104th episode of the React podcast by Chantastic</a>. <a href="https://jevakallio.dev/">Jani Eväkallio</a> talked  about Roam and about his app called <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a>, that allows you to transform your VSCode instance to a Roam app. The ideas on Roam are all based on <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/">Tiago Forte’s work</a> and <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Build a Second Brain</a> approach. There is actually a <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-second-brain-manifesto/">“Second Brain Manifesto”</a></p>



<p><strong>Roam Research </strong>doesn’t have an API yet for further integration with other tools but there is a <a href="https://github.com/artpi/roam-research-private-api">‘Private API’</a> by <a href="https://piszek.com/">Artur Piszek</a> from Warsaw,  working at Automattic. Artur also created the <a href="https://deliber.at/wp-roam-block/">Roam Block plugin</a>, I have yet to test. </p>



<h2 id="1-strong-import-all-evernote-items-to-notion-strong">Import all Evernote items to Notion</h2>



<p>I already have a Notion account I started and then never used from 2019.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="268" height="238" src="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-31-at-11.34.36-AM.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Turns out my notes numbers (over 5,000) are inflated. In 2012, in a misguided attempt to preserve Twitter Favorites, I sync them with Evernote via IFTTT, to never looked at them again. I let it run between  Dec 14, 2012 to April 29, 2015, and I accumulated 2112 single notes. Those won’t come over to RoamResearch. Since then, I archive Tweets, favorites aka likes and follows on Google Sheet.  </p>



<p>I felt great relief when Notion’s import script showed me the breakdown of notes in notebooks,  so I can select the ones I would want to import.  The breakdown also reveals some abandoned attempts to organize my notes. </p>



<p>It takes more than a couple of minutes, I guess. 30 minutes into the import time, I could only see notes back to 2018. It seems, the connection only imported about 550 of the 2872 notes and then stopped. I tried to start it again, and it counted through the imported once rather quickly so there seems to be a duplicate check. I am happy about that. I read through the documentation on Evernote import, and it didn’t mention any rate limits. </p>



<p>I started a chat through the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Help-Support-e040febf70a94950b8620e6f00005004">Help and Support pages at Notion</a>. I connected with two people. <em>“This is definitely not intended behavior and has been filed with our engineering team. Unfortunately, we may not have a fix right away, but know it’s on our to-do list.</em>” Meanwhile, I’ll follow this advice: <em>“Sometimes it’s caused by a single (usually large) page. If you are importing multiple notebooks, would you mind trying to import your notes in smaller batches? If there are lots of photos, videos, etc. I’d try importing those a few at a time, but if they’re just text you can import them in larger batches :)”</em></p>



<p>Moving in Evernote only works with 50 Notes at a time. God, my grandmother was right. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Computers are a colossal waste of time! </p><cite>Oma Pauli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I copy/pasted today’s#1023 note over to Roam to get acquainted with the future interface. I might as well go on our lunch run. </p>



<p>15 days in I am still in love with Roam and now really need to continue the work to migration Evernote content to Roam Research. </p>



<h2 id="2-from-notion-to-roam-research">From Notion to RoamResearch</h2>



<p>So now that many notes have been imported to Notion, I exported them as instructed. The import into RoamResearch works, but it’s only 10 files at a time. 🤦‍♀️</p>



<p>I also expected that <em>RoamResearch</em> would be able to read the created date and import it accordingly. Now all have today’s date. I had to change every note’s name to turn it into a Daily Note. For that purpose, a 10 file limit is probably good. </p>



<h2 id="3-private-api">Private-api</h2>



<p>I had hoped that Artur Priszek’s private-api would get me started, but it doesn’t have much documentation beyond the read me and the roam-quick command, I could get working. I need to dive into code, to figure out how it would work beyond. I can see myself creating a little CLI app that hides away the access credentials and lets me write via the command line something like <code>rem 'Call your mother tomorrow' </code>and have it show up in the Quick Capture of the app, when I switch over to the app again.  </p>



<h2 id="4-what-i-like-about-using-roam-research">What I Like about using Roam Research</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Command + K works</strong> for adding link to highlighted text. It also uses pure Markdown [link text](linkurl) and converts it to links once you leave the editing mode. </li><li><strong>Adding a tag is as easy </strong>as adding a # before the work. </li><li><strong>Can import JSON + Markdown.</strong> </li><li><strong>Slash command</strong> and first item on the list is the TODO item once I hit enter my checkbox are back.</li><li>The <strong>Sidebar</strong> shows me all Todos in one screen as well as the “Done” items. </li><li>The <strong>auto-creation of daily pages</strong> is neat and a time saver. I started adding future dates to do items or preparation for meetings etc. very helpful. In the morning, I open the RoamResearch app and see what my past self has in store for me. </li><li>Easy page merge: So with any other notes app, that has a tagging feature, I would never get the spelling right for hashtags and other tags and end up with too many tags that are misspellings, and they are a pain to consolidate, so I never did. With RoamResearch, when I discover I two similar tags, I decide on a single one and just change the page title of the other one, and it merge the two page. Brilliant. </li><li>The biggest tools especially after I import the Evernote notes will be the <strong>‘Unlinked references’</strong> it finds for a certain topic. It unloads the cognitive loads, you have to put into document management, for when you forget the coding of certain things. </li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="466" src="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-24-at-3.55.52-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-24-at-3.55.52-PM.png 680w, https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-24-at-3.55.52-PM-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"><figcaption>A page with Unlinked References to the page title. It offers a “Link All” feature now. </figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="5-what-i-find-missing-or-wanting">What I find missing or wanting</h2>



<ul><li>Definitely an <strong>API to integrate with other services</strong>. </li><li><strong>Faster load on mobile.</strong> It’s spins for multiple seconds until I can start adding text, and sometimes I can’t get it to sync from other devices. </li><li>Seems at publishing date, the right sidebar is broken. It’s just shows an empty column. </li></ul>

<p>After a month of using it, I am definitely comfortable, sometimes still lost. February will be the month going from Novice to competent user on the Dreyfus’ “Five-Stage Model of Mental Activities Involved in Directed  Skill Acquisition”. I just read it. Speaking of Reddit, there is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/">RoamResearch community</a> and in a pinned post, are some thoughts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/eho7de/building_a_second_brain_in_roamand_why_you_might/">how to work on projects</a>. That’s my next adventure. </p>

It could become an energy efficient building material in the future.</p>  <p>Wood is made of two basic ingredients: cellulose, which are tiny fibres, and lignin, which bonds those fibres together to give it strength.</p>  <p>Tear a paper towel in half and look closely along the edge. You will see the little cellulose fibres sticking up. Lignin is a glue-like material that bonds the fibres together, a little like the plastic resin in fibreglass or carbon fibre. The lignin also contains molecules called chromophores, which give the wood its brown colour and prevent light from passing through.</p>  <p>Early attempts to make transparent wood involved removing the lignin, but this involved hazardous chemicals, high temperatures and a lot of time, making the product expensive and somewhat brittle. The new technique is so cheap and easy it could literally be done in a backyard.</p>  <p>Starting with planks of wood a metre long and one millimetre thick, the scientists simply brushed on a solution of hydrogen peroxide using an ordinary paint brush. When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers demonstrated after brushing a coat of hydrogen peroxide on the opaque wood material, and exposing it to one hour of sunlight, it turns transparent.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened.&nbsp;This made the white wood transparent.</p>  <p>You can see a similar effect by taking that same piece of paper towel, dip half of it in water and place it on a patterned surface.&nbsp;The white paper towel will become translucent with light passing through the water and cellulose fibres without being scattered by refraction.</p>  <p>The epoxy in the wood does an even better job, allowing 90 per cent of visible light to pass through.

The clear wood&nbsp;is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.</p>  <p>Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.</p>      <p>Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.</p>  <p>While this technology has yet to&nbsp; be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A researcher holds up a 10-centimetre long slab of the see-through wood.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Images copyright Xia et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>,&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

A wrong must be righted.</p><p>I spent the next hour or two staring at the code and wondering what the hell is going on. Twenty lines of code and it doesn't compile. Gives me something like:</p><blockquote>error FS0010: Unexpected character '“' in interaction</blockquote><p>Did I cast something the wrong way? I tried recasting things. Did I hose up my environment? I reloaded. Is my code structure off in subtle ways? Nothing I did seemed to work. Finally, out of desperation, I started a new project and re-typed everything in by hand.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>The problem? When I copied and pasted the input code, it was using typographic quotes, not programming quotes. It was a copy-and-paste problem, of the freaking input data, that had defeated me all of that time.</p><p>Once that was out of the way, I kicked out the solution rather quickly, first coding it up as a strongly-typed function and then removing the type restrictions to make it one day a generic library function. As another commenter pointed out, this is classic Run Length Encoding, so that's what I named the function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>
let runLengthEncode&lt;'a when 'a:equality&gt; inputSeq =
  let rec rleInnerLoop inputSeq acc =
    if inputSeq|&gt;Seq.isEmpty then acc else
    let itemWereWatching=inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head
    let chunk=inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile itemWereWatching.Equals
    let chunkLength=chunk|&gt;Seq.length
    let newInputSeq = inputSeq |&gt; Seq.skip chunkLength
    let newItem=seq{itemWereWatching, chunkLength}
    rleInnerLoop newInputSeq newItem |&gt; Seq.append acc
  rleInnerLoop inputSeq Seq.empty
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The only type constraint I had was that whatever stream of stuff I'm processing, it has to support equality, or a=b, otherwise how could I remove duplicates? I'm also quite taken back by the size of the code. Now my code was the big honking solution. Yikes!</p><p>Could I shorten it? Well sure, since it's pure FP and written in an idiomatic style, the whole thing could collapse to one line of code. But why do that? All of those labels in there are for my benefit, in case I need to debug. Until I've tested the hell out of it, I need the labels. (Plus the labels and size shouldn't matter to the compiler anyway, if I can collapse it, the compiler should be able to collapse it)</p><p>But something about this feels odd to me, as if it were one of those situations where non-idiomatic code might be better for performance reasons. That's what happens under-the-hood with some F# library functions. For now, though, I'll let the library guys worry about optimization and I'm stay happy with a solved problem. yay me</p><p>Of course I have to write the inverse function, Run Length Decode:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>let runLengthDecode (inputSeq:seq&lt;'a*int&gt;) =
  seq {yield! inputSeq|&gt;Seq.collect(fun x-&gt;Seq.replicate (snd x) (fst x))}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's a lot shorter and makes me happy. When I see functions like the first one I worry that I've gone far afield of the best solution, perhaps by reinventing the wheel. When I see functions like the second one, I am reassured that this is a common problem. Many others have been here before me. (This goes back to my statement that "I need the labels until I've tested the hell out of it" Other people have done the testing work. Woot!)</p><p>What lessons were learned? Well, I really suck at coding in my head. I knew already but continue to be amazed when it happens with only the simplest problems. One of the major points of <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">Info-Ops II</a> is that our belief in our understanding of the code, no matter what it is, is much more unfounded than founded. Even with "perfect" code, battle-tested and hardened, the most you can say is that it works, it has no bugs, and you can trust it. You can't say you understand all that's going on. Modern programming if far, far too complex for that ever to be true. </p><p>We're all like that, even non-coders. As much as some of us think we can code in our head, it doesn't work that way, even many times with the most trivial of problems. That doesn't stop us, though. There are people who think they can talk at length about deep issues like foreign policy, all the while maintaining a logical and coherent set of symbols. They're being logical. They're running the code they've created in their head. Other folks, though, are not. (Other folks see this the same way, only with the players reversed) </p><p>This is true in policy discussion for the exact same reasons it's true with coding. There's simply too much depth and nuance in language for it to work like code, and even if it did work like code, we'd think we understood far, far more than we actually do. We lose either way.</p><p>Secondly, test cases don't always save you. Yes, my initial mistake was not having test cases, just doing it in my head, but once I had test cases and started coding it out, the major part of my hang-up was dealing with some kind of IDE/OS/Unicode/UTF-8 crap, not the code itself. Doesn't matter, I still would have taken more than the allotted 25 minutes. I do not get the job.</p><p>But I had fun. That made it worth the effort.</p><p>P.S. For those interested in how this all would collapse into one line, here's a hint:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>let runLengthEncode2&lt;'a when 'a:equality&gt; inputSeq =
  let rec rleInnerLoop inputSeq acc = match inputSeq|&gt;Seq.isEmpty with |true-&gt;acc|false-&gt;rleInnerLoop (inputSeq |&gt; Seq.skip ((inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile (inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head).Equals)|&gt;Seq.length)) (seq{(inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head), ((inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile (inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head).Equals)|&gt;Seq.length)}) |&gt; Seq.append acc
  rleInnerLoop inputSeq Seq.empty
</code></pre>

It could become an energy efficient building material in the future.</p>  <p>Wood is made of two basic ingredients: cellulose, which are tiny fibres, and lignin, which bonds those fibres together to give it strength.</p>  <p>Tear a paper towel in half and look closely along the edge. You will see the little cellulose fibres sticking up. Lignin is a glue-like material that bonds the fibres together, a little like the plastic resin in fibreglass or carbon fibre. The lignin also contains molecules called chromophores, which give the wood its brown colour and prevent light from passing through.</p>  <p>Early attempts to make transparent wood involved removing the lignin, but this involved hazardous chemicals, high temperatures and a lot of time, making the product expensive and somewhat brittle. The new technique is so cheap and easy it could literally be done in a backyard.</p>  <p>Starting with planks of wood a metre long and one millimetre thick, the scientists simply brushed on a solution of hydrogen peroxide using an ordinary paint brush. When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers demonstrated after brushing a coat of hydrogen peroxide on the opaque wood material, and exposing it to one hour of sunlight, it turns transparent.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened.&nbsp;This made the white wood transparent.</p>  <p>You can see a similar effect by taking that same piece of paper towel, dip half of it in water and place it on a patterned surface.&nbsp;The white paper towel will become translucent with light passing through the water and cellulose fibres without being scattered by refraction.</p>  <p>The epoxy in the wood does an even better job, allowing 90 per cent of visible light to pass through.

The clear wood&nbsp;is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.</p>  <p>Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.</p>      <p>Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.</p>  <p>While this technology has yet to&nbsp; be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A researcher holds up a 10-centimetre long slab of the see-through wood.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Images copyright Xia et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>,&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Competition among businesses is obviously vital to a functioning market. A business that doesn’t have to compete doesn’t have to offer <em>competitive</em> products, pay, etc. Competition on one hand and regulation on the other form an opposing pair of constraints that channels a business’s pursuit of growth, dominance, profit, and development into benefit for society. I posit that the typical root cause of so-called greedy business practices (such as poverty wages, price gouging, lay-offs, cutting costs via human and animal cruelty, environmental pollution, and so on) is not a moral failing of the chief decision-makers, but rather inadequate regulation.</p><p>Yesterday my wife said to me “Kroger is offering to pay $100 to each employee who gets the COVID vaccine. Funny how they’ll do that, but they won’t give hazard pay for working during the pandemic!”.</p><p>“Well, hazard pay would be a lot more expensive, wouldn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes — $4 per hour in Seattle.” So after one week, this would exceed the one-time $100 bonus for full-time employees. “I know it would be costly, but the work is dangerous right now. The employees deserve it.”</p><p>“I agree,” I said, “but to control costs a company can’t pay a whole lot more than the market rate for whatever type of labour it needs. Outspending the competition for the same thing is bad for business.”.</p><p>“I don’t really care what’s bad for business. Paying workers fairly is the right thing to do. The greed required to put profit before ethics is disgusting.”</p><h2 id="whats-bad-for-business">what’s bad for business</h2><p>So, why don’t businesses generally “do the right thing” even if it’s costly? So what if the competition outcompetes them? Winning isn’t everything, right? Sure, but losing <em>is</em> everything. In a stable market, there’s a kind of competitive equilibrium. An uncompetitive company risks being driven out of the market by competitive companies.</p><p>Couldn’t a company just take some money out of profits to pay better, to make more environmentally friendly choices, or whatever? Well, profit makes a company an attractive investment. A company competes not only for customers, but for investors, too. If one company becomes a less attractive investment than its competitors, investors reallocate their investments for better performance. Sacrificing for the greater good <em>is a sacrifice</em>, and the cost is market share.</p><p>Okay, so why don’t businesses make the sacrifice — give up market share or possibly go out of business — in the service of ethics? Because less market share means less power to do the right thing. Companies that have made such sacrifices don’t dominate the market. “Unethical” companies do. One might be able to do the right thing for a little while, but one’s contribution to society will be short-lived.</p><h2 id="whats-bad-for-consumers-and-workers">what’s bad for consumers and workers</h2><p>Some say consumers should vote with their wallets. It feels good to support small local businesses, to boycott sweatshops, to put your money where your morals are. Unfortunately it’s more costly. What Walmart lacks in charm and scruples it makes up for in discounts.</p><p>Other than wealthy consumers who can afford the luxury of consistent ethical choices in the market, the rest of the consumers are in a bind. It’s a matter of preservation of quality of life (or in the extreme, self-preservation) to seek the best deal we can get. The principal form of competition among consumers is not so much “keeping up with the Joneses” as it is making our dollar go as far as everyone else’s. For each ethical spending decision we make, we have less money overall to work with than someone with a similar income who makes the most economically rational choice. So are we going to pay extra for cruelty-free eggs or for cruelty-free clothes? We can’t do this for everything all at once. If <em>all</em> of our purchases are the ethical option, we can’t afford some things that others can afford. Something has to give, and because we are competing with other wage-earners, the result is downward class mobility, a slow spiral into poverty.</p><h2 id="if-not-individual-choices-then-what">If not individual choices, then what?</h2><p>So businesses and consumers both are in a bind where competition dictates that they make economically rational choices or lose. Efficiency is maximised at great environmental and social cost. Individual choices mean squat because “the invisible hand” of the market punishes certain ethical choices and eventually diminishes the influence of ethical agents such that their agency has little effect.</p><p>But what if everyone did the right thing? A market full of agents voluntarily choosing the right thing is wide open for someone to take advantage.</p><p>Okay, but what if everyone <em>had to do the right thing</em>? Consider the minimum wage. Apart from a few egregious loopholes, businesses in most industries have to abide by it. Does Kroger suffer a competitive loss by paying its employees the minimum wage? No, because all of the other grocers have to do likewise. Something still has to give, but it’s not a consumer’s standard of living or a business’s market share. The money really can come out of profits in this case. If it’s coming out of all grocers' profits, investors can’t very well get out of paying for it by divesting from one grocer (or one industry) to invest in another. Almost the whole economy is equally affected, so investors don’t have much of an alternative to taking the loss and moving on. When everyone is forced to make an ethical choice, competitive standing is no longer at stake in making it.</p><h2 id="the-economy-as-a-game">the economy as a game</h2><p>Imagine a sport very much like football (not American hand-egg) wherein there is no such thing as a foul. It would be a perfectly valid (if unethical) strategy to injure the other team relentlessly until they were unable to mount a competent opposition, and then to score goals unchallenged for the remaining time. (Trust me - as a kid, I tested this strategy in Fifa 98 with fouls turned off.)</p><p>Well, perhaps not unethical if you consider that the risk would be obvious and participation voluntary. Participation in the market is hardly voluntary (apologies to any hunter-gatherers I may offend), though the risks are obvious.</p><p>So how do we achieve the utilitarian outcome of minimising the risk of injury in our sport, given that everyone is entered into this tournament at birth? We could just try to play ethically on an individual basis, or try to shift the general attitudes of many players against violence. But the people who kick shins will end up playing the most matches in this tournament, because their strategy still works. We choose to lose by abstaining from exploitation individually, so we choose to allow the shin-kickers to dominate. We’re in a bind. The “ethical” choice does not fix the systemic problem that causes the bad outcome. With this set of rules, either choice leads to the same bad outcome. Well, obviously we need to reinstate the foul rule! If it’s impossible to win by kicking shins, there ceases to be any competitive advantage in doing so, and we can all benefit from a game with less shin-kicking.</p><p>Choosing ethically in commerce may assuage our guilt, but it does not make the world a better place. Regulations would actually make a difference.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The Mediocre Programmer? What's that?</p>
<p>The Mediocre Programmer is a book about the journey of becoming a better programmer. But before we can become better programmers we have to pass through being mediocre programmers. Mediocre doesn't mean a bad programmer --- far from it. It means lacking skill. As beginners we start our journey full of fresh ideas of how we'll be great programmers, but as we learn more we realize that the gap between being a beginner and an expert programmer requires us to be mediocre for a time. And that period of mediocrity can be frustrating. As beginning programmers we're given all the encouragement to explore and make mistakes. As we move to the intermediate and mediocre stages of programming that encouragement fades. Instead of encouragement we are faced with expectations, both from ourselves and from others. We start to question our abilities. Why do we have to keep looking things up? Shouldn't we already know this? Why does programming feel like a struggle? Am I ever going to be good at this? </p>
<p>This book is about helping you along on the journey of being a mediocre programmer. Together we'll uncover some of common misconceptions we have about programming, failure, and growth and come to understand that the act of programming and development is something we undertake each day and improve in small ways. It's these small changes that over time transform us from being mediocre programmers into better programmers.</p>
<p>There are plenty of books on how to become a better programmer out there. Books like this tend to have checklists and other advice that the author deems important enough for you to do in order to become a better programmer. They tend to focus on specific improvements like choosing a better editor, writing better test cases, or drinking lots of water. Those books have lots of useful advice, but they read like a laundry list of things that you must do all at once in order to succeed. This book will try not to saddle you with more work (you likely have enough as it is). Rather, we'll discuss what it feels like to be a programmer. We'll talk about the emotions in being a programmer; the feelings of frustration, guilt, anger, and inadequacy. We'll cover the struggles in learning new things and keeping your skills current. We'll talk about those times when you feel like giving up and walking away from computing and whether those feelings come from a place of love or a worry that you're not keeping up.</p>
<p>This book is a personal journey for both of us. It's a memoir of my time as a programmer and my feelings along the way. I've thought many times about giving up and finding a different career path but doing anything other than being a computer programmer scares me even more. Does that mean I'm stuck in a perverse ouroboros of self-pity and self-doubt? Hardly. It means that I need to dig deeper to understand why I chose the path of being a programmer and realize that it took a lot to get here and it's going to take a lot more to get where I want to be. It's a commitment to seeing things as they are now and moving forward from wherever I'm standing.</p>
<p>I hope you'll join me on this journey.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Day One - Exiting the Pyramid</strong></p><p>On December 17, I stopped eating for seven days. I consumed nothing but water, coffee, and an occasional pinch of salt. I did it to achieve cellular regeneration, spiritual contemplation, and a temporary break in my furious, constant consumption of every calorie within ten feet.</p><p>I was following in the footsteps of a man who tried to starve himself to death. In 1887, Dr. Henry S. Tanner stopped eating, having apparently decided that he deserved an agonizing demise after failures in marriage and business. As the first few famished days passed, he wondered when the sweet release of death would cease its tardiness. But, by the tenth day, he didn’t feel hungry anymore—in fact, felt vigorous and healthy. He saw no reason to stop fasting, and, in the end, fasted for a month, before repeating the feat repeatedly in the presence of puzzled doctors.</p><p>However, though Dr. Tanner did much to popularize fasting in the modern era, he wasn’t my immediate inspiration. I’d been influenced to try water fasting by friends in the tech sector, where fasting has become something of a trend. Not everyone is happy about this. The Harper’s Bazaar article “<a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/diet-fitness/a28577713/silicon-valley-fasting/">Inside Silicon Valley’s Dangerous New Obsession with Fasting</a>,” for example, claims that fasting is merely disordered eating rebranded and that its tech sector purveyors are being unjustly lauded for habits that are condemned in teen girls. There’s also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/21/extreme-fasting-how-silicon-valley-is-rebranding-eating-disorders">this one</a>, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/01/silicon-valley-extreme-diets-fasting/581566/">this one</a>, and many other works of literature penned by the nutrition and psychology experts of progressive Twitter.</p><p>They’re all mostly wrong. They’re also probably somewhat culturally motivated; it’s hard to imagine any of these publications putting out something called The Dark Side of Ramadan: Inside the Muslim World’s Dangerous Obsession with Fasting.</p><p>But I don’t blame them for being wrong. Their opinions are to be expected. They’ve been educated by a culture that teaches you the gospel of three meals a day, every day—that constant eating is a necessity for happiness. From birth, they’ve been pumped full of propaganda prepared by agribusiness and government, including conceptual ideas like the Food Pyramid, that compellingly geometric menu that has dug many an early grave. If I told them, or, really, most anyone off the street that I wasn’t going to eat for seven days, they’d probably wonder if I were committing suicide.</p><p>But fasting for surprisingly long periods of time <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6314618/">doesn't actually seem dangerous</a>, for most. In a sense, this finding is obvious; if human beings weren’t able to use our fat stores to survive, we wouldn’t have made it out of the ancestral environment, where occasional scarcity was simply a given.</p><p>However, fasting <em>is</em> hazardous, in a way. It punches this weird food-shaped hole in consensus reality. Doing it can change the way you think about, at the very least, food, disease, and the progress of science—which is to say, a big chunk of human life.</p><p>Oh, and, at times, it does totally suck. The first day is tricky. Your body is trained by your normal habits, developing hunger pangs in response to the release of a hormone called ghrelin. When you just skip all of that day’s meals, the ghrelin assault is uncomfortable. But then you sit through it, and your hunger pangs just… go away, leaving you, mysteriously, alive.</p><p><strong>Day Two - Big Nothing</strong></p><p>Sometimes, I wish there were a Big Nothing lobby—some sort of agency devoted to studying what would happen if we did less. For example, let’s say the government became fixated on some problem with social welfare. Is there anyone to study what would happen if we did nothing? Would it just get better on its own? Similarly, what would happen if, in response to population-level health issues, instead of taking supplements or treatments, we just ate nothing for an interval?</p><p>Unfortunately, profit motives rule out this potential world. There is no Nothing Lobby. Which is a shame, because if Pfizer or Merck stumbled upon a drug that could do half of what fasting appears to, their entire R&amp;D apartments would be frothing at the mouth and gripping their calipers tightly.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it’s touted as a weight loss intervention, fasting’s health effects go way beyond that. When you read the fasting literature, you have all these moments of, like, <em>what, really? </em>For example, if you come down with cancer, you might want to fast, because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048045/">fasting appears to protect the body during chemotherapy, allowing higher doses of radiation to be administered with fewer side effects.</a> On the other hand, maybe you should’ve fasted earlier: studies in mice suggest that fasting <a href="https://osher.ucsf.edu/patient-care/integrative-medicine-resources/cancer-and-nutrition/faq/cancer-and-fasting-calorie-restriction">might be effective in slowing or preventing tumor growth</a>. If you’re just not interested in getting sick at all, you should know that <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/abstract/S1934-5909(14)00151-9">fasting appears to promote the generation of new white blood cells, thus potentially reinvigorating the immune system</a>. It could also keep you sharp, and by that I mean keep you sharp when you’re 80 years old. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3106288/">Fasting appears to promote neuronal health, potentially making it a defense against neurodegenerative diseases</a>.</p><p>But, if weight loss is what you’re looking for, supervised fasting appears to be strikingly effective. For example, in 1965, a 456lb man named Angus Barbieri went without eating for a year with no apparent negative consequences, went down to around 180, and kept the weight off for his whole life. And, while this result is uncommon in degree, a brief peak at <a href="http://reddit.com/r/fasting">reddit.com/r/fasting</a> reveals that it’s not unusual in kind.</p><p>We maybe understand why this happens. It seems to be down to autophagy—literally, self-ingestion. Your body constantly recycles old material, but, when you’re fasting, that process is dramatically accelerated. Old cells are broken down. Excess fat is turned into ketone bodies so the brain can continue operating. (Many who lose weight during fasting are surprised to find that they don’t have loose skin because their bodies literally ate it.) After all of the old stuff is recycled, the hypothesis goes, your body functions better.</p><p>But, overall, we’re still ignorant of the mechanisms of water fasting, despite the fact that it’s been advocated for thousands of years—Pythagoras required it of his students, finding that it promoted lucidity and focus. We don’t know what the ideal fasting protocol is. We don’t exactly understand its effects on longevity. It’s possible that repeat fasts in a short period of time could be damaging, specifically to the kidneys—where exactly are the healthy limits? We don’t know.</p><p>Several luminaries of the fasting scene, which is a thing that exists, have figured out how to make money off Nothing. One prominent advocate of no food, Dr. Jason Fung, sells highly readable books on fasting and helps run <a href="http://thefastingmethod.com/">a clinic</a> that coaches people through the fasting lifestyle. Another, Dr. Valter Longo, also sells books, as well as <a href="https://prolonfast.com/">ready-made meals</a> which are low-calorie enough to help fasters maintain a fasting state, but nutritive enough to make the process more tolerable.</p><p>This is all great, but, for the time being, the Nothing Lobby will be eclipsed by the mountains of cash involved in soybean oil, corn syrup, dietary supplements, and bariatric surgeries. And so, for the foreseeable future, fasting may remain poorly-explained and under-promoted, a personal rebellion against the entrenched interests undermining our health.</p><p>Perhaps this should make us furious. I know a fair number of fat people who want to lose weight. They’re given diets that don’t work, supplements that don’t work, and then shamed, which also doesn’t work. But, as it turns out, they might not need any of that. With medical supervision, they could probably solve the problem by not eating for a month or two. It could be a really shitty month or two—but better than struggling for decades, if losing weight is what you want to do. But if they read Harper’s Bazaar, or other maintainers of the dietary Overton Window, they might be dissuaded from even investigating this possibility.</p><p>On day two, fasting is doing weird things to me. Usually, I’m hot all over, but, without calories, my extremities go through thermal alternation—my nose is cold, then hot again. My breath smells great, then awful. At random moments, I’m seized by waves of incredible energy, thoughts of conquest, and the lust for food. At other moments, I lust for nothing and dwell in profound neutrality. I’m more diurnal; whereas I normally tend towards nocturnal activity, I wake with the sun, and my energy plunges the moment it’s dark.</p><p><strong>Day Three - First Principles</strong></p><p>Perhaps one reason that fasting has become popular in Silicon Valley is that it’s an applied crash course in First Principles Thinking. This term has only become a tired cliche in tech circles because it’s a principle that’s served so effectively in the past. The best (and worst) technological innovations have come from asking questions so basic only a curious child or a frenzied entrepreneur would think to ask them, and the process continues today. We don’t live on Mars. Why? We have to drive our cars. Why? We should eat a shit-ton of food every day, without interruption. Why?</p><p>The reason is not immediately apparent. On the third day of my fast, I wake up feeling fine, if still not totally normal. There is this basic knowledge that my bowels are empty. My interior feels strikingly vacant. But, generally, my physical condition is less notable than it was the day before.</p><p>What’s more notable is how surreal it all is. Our days are broken up by meals and punctuated by snacks. Once you take that away, what’s left?&nbsp;</p><p>Great expanses of time. The day just goes on and on and on. In that ocean of minutes, I’m unusually productive. Uninterrupted by the 100,000 snack breaks I usually take in a day, I double my usual daily writing output. Moreover, I’m weirdly focused. The energy that would usually go into digesting fistfuls of random stuff from the fridge is being directed into my laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a change in mood, too. Most emotion drops away, positive and negative. I’m not interested in listening to fun …</p></div></div>

I had my founder blinders on (which can be both good and bad depending on the circumstances) and felt weighed down by the sunk costs I'd already put into bootstrapping Saasify.</p><p>I needed a change of pace.

It represents a completely open territory to explore and paint my ideas upon with no rules or regulations. This has led to some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://coss.media/">unbelievably successful commercial open source products</a> being built that would've otherwise been very difficult to bring to market in a more traditional, closed source world. It's also led to an amazing amount of long-tail value creation and experimentation in the form of smaller OSS projects that have found insane amounts of adoption around the world.</p><p>I think it's safe to say that open source software has had profound effects on the world, but as with many passion projects, the key difficulty lies in making your passion sustainable. When you start off working on a project, it's almost always out of intrinsic motivation; that is to say, it's because you're excited about something and want to scratch your own itch. As your project(s) grow in popularity and usage over time, you inevitably get more and more support requests and people complaining about bugs or missing features. What started as a purely intrinsic passion project has now become a burden, and the only real way to reconcile this problem is to introduce extrinsic motivation (usually in the form of money or followers) that will help you sustain your interest in growing a community around your work.</p><p>There are tens of thousands of these talented indie devs out there who are passionate about open source. And more generally, there are millions of talented creators out there who are passionate about their own creative outlets, whether they be music, videos, teaching, writing, art, comedy, and so much more.</p><h3 data-id="72ec651bcfb54da9829c85fc7f70474f"><a href="#72ec651bcfb54da9829c85fc7f70474f" title="Human passion is universal"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Human passion is universal</span></h3><p>This brings me back to the passion economy and its cool cousin, the creator economy.</p><p>I fundamentally believe in the boundless potential of humanity. I know that sounds a little idealistic and bullshit-y, but you're literally reading a blog called Transitive Bullshit...</p><p>One thing that I find so much beauty in is all of the different ways that human creativity and passion manifest themselves.</p><p>No matter where you are in the world..</p><p>No matter what your background is..</p><p>No matter what your motivations are..</p><p>No matter what your creative outlets are..</p><p>No matter who you are..</p><p>The internet and platforms built on the internet unlock so much hidden opportunity for you.</p><p>Human passion is truly universal, and the internet is the ultimate tool to unlock the power of human creativity on a scale that is hard to comprehend. In this respect, I believe that we're still in the very early stages of discovering all of the second &amp; third order effects that the internet will have on humanity. I also love thinking about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">humanity as a species that is experiencing an unprecedented rate of exponential evolution</a> and how fundamental forces like the internet, AI, and human passion are driving this evolution forward. It's an exciting time to be alive.</p><p>And these days, there are just so many inspirational stories out there of people striving to better themselves and help their audiences in unique, authentic, and creative ways.</p><p>Human passion and creativity are truly universal, and we're seeing a long-term change in the way people view their passions and creative outlets versus traditional work.</p><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAAAQAgCdASoQAA8ABUB8JbACsAERHzma9luAAP7v0t51jxw+/73aT08qIIRPHhVPfeRNAwJmGw5TOmQU0dwRAnPsxOGEaUzsAAA=" alt="Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life" width="1124" height="1063" decoding="async"><img src="https://ssfy.io/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Fsecure.notion-static.com%252Ff89a085d-937e-49bd-9aac-a8a4fcb10f40%252FUntitled.png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D95d34e25-7272-433e-8960-b302309e5a07%26cache%3Dv2" alt="Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life" width="1124" height="1063" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></p></div><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7">Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life</a></figcaption></figure><h3 data-id="68733797765f454d9ddcc2abaf2a6658"><a href="#68733797765f454d9ddcc2abaf2a6658" title="Passion First, Economy Second"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Passion First, Economy Second</span></h3><p>I was recently listening to a Clubhouse room where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/ljin18">Li Jin</a> (no surprise! haha) was interviewing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/allenlau">Allen Lau</a>, the co-founder of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wattpad.com/">Wattpad</a>, a platform that makes it easy for writers to share stories, which just sold for $600M. One of the things which stood out for me was something Allen said about passion always coming first, and monetization coming second.</p><blockquote>"99% of people who write are motivated by their fanbase and engagement. Only a small portion really go into things focused on monetization." (Allen Lau)</blockquote><p>This is an incredibly important point to keep in mind, especially for founders building solutions in this space that naturally tend to focus on reducing barriers to monetization — because it's easier to get funding for products with clear monetization models.</p><p>This naturally leads to the question: is the "passion economy" even a good thing? Should our passions remain our passions and our work remain our work?</p><p>I think there's no one answer to this, but I can share two key insights that have really clicked with me recently.</p><p>The first insight is Li's answer to this question. She is a strong proponent of consumer choice and enabling the option to monetize as opposed to it being full of friction, and I couldn't agree with this more. The easier you make the option of monetizing your passion via different methods and platforms, the more creators will experiment with these solutions and naturally find a healthy balance that works for them.</p><p>The second insight comes from this article: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/">my product is my garden</a>. The author does a great job exploring different forms of monetization and sustainability around his love for building software side projects. In the end, he views his work as a garden and finds peace in the process of tending to his garden.</p><h3 data-id="0d7a2eaa371b4ef3bd2b9c5688b300c3"><a href="#0d7a2eaa371b4ef3bd2b9c5688b300c3" title="Inspiration comes in many forms"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Inspiration comes in many forms</span></h3><p>As I continue to explore the passion economy and the future of work, I'm actively looking to connect with other co-founders, developers, creators, and builders who are excited about this space.</p><p>I try to always keep in mind how small my view of the world is, so I'm looking to meet other passionate folks who will bring their own unique insights to the table in order to challenge my assumptions.</p><p>I'm particularly interested in building solutions that will help enable a more independent and fulfilling future of work. I believe that helping ambitious creators and domain experts to follow their passions via more sustainable, frictionless business models is one of the most important, impactful, and universal problems that we are uniquely poised to solve today.</p><p>This is a pretty grandiose mission when you think about it. It has a lot of overlap with:</p><ul><li>Traditional VC models of enabling entrepreneurship</li></ul><ul><li>Influencers and the future of media and entertainment</li></ul><ul><li>Evolving the concept of work from full-time employment to more flexible, lightweight models</li></ul><ul><li>Making knowledge more accessible at scale</li></ul><p>And finally, as an anime otaku myself, I wanted to leave you with one last bit of inspiration coming from an entirely different field. Hayao Miyazaki is the genius behind Studio Ghibli and a master creator at heart. ❤️</p><figure><div></div></figure><h3 data-id="51de05c5306a42bca0cb94219a9c2211"><a href="#51de05c5306a42bca0cb94219a9c2211" title="Further Reading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Further Reading</span></h3><div><p><span role="img" aria-label="👉">👉</span></p><p>If you found this article helpful, consider following my journey on twitter <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/transitive_bs">@transitive_bs</a></span></p></div></article></div>]]>
