<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>The COVID pandemic made me think about how arcaic the current education system is. I should say, the current <em>delivery</em> of education. The core idea for a fairer education relies in a sort of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, but at the state level. Traditional teachers won’t be replaced by a classroom computer, but would see their role reshaped: from teachers to facilitators. For example, a 1-hour class might include a 40min video of the subject delivered by a top specialist followed by 20min of classroom activities and Q&amp;As.</p><p>The current delivery of educational subjects is in the hands of an army of teachers. The quality of teaching is highly variable, and the schools with the best ratings are usually the ones in rich neighborhoods. Good ratings on a school can alone make or break the real estate market, driving house prices and rents in the nearby radius. Public schools should provide a level playing field for everyone, but this is not the case, and never has been. Rich parents can afford higher rents while poorer families are driven in the outskirsts of a city, where lower rated schools usually are. Public housing in high-income areas have historically provided a solution for this, but the chance of being accepted in a specific public housing project are still highly randomized.</p><p>During the second wave of the COVID pandemic in the UK in January 2021, the schools were again shut down. Interestingly, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach">BBC started broadcasting curriculum-mapped lessons</a> on primary and secondary school subjects, for free. If we were to push this concept to its very limit, imagine what a country like the UK could be able to offer to its pupils. The best of the best delivered to anyone. A physics lesson delivered by Prof. Brian Cox, a science lesson on evolutionary byology delivered by Richard Dawkins or Sir David Attenborough, an english class delivered by Stephen Fry. This is already happening in higher education and in the workplace anyways - learning and training has been remote for ages now. But this shouldn’t be the end of the classroom as the social aspect of school is as important as the educational one. Teachers could see their role reshaped towards being educators or classroom facilitators, answering pupils questions and coordinating classroom activities.</p><p>I’ve grown up in Europe, where education is generally considered quite good. My school experience up to College has been scarred by mediocrity, with some notable horrific experiences and a couple of teachers who became like mentors to me. I’m sure a lot of people can relate to my experience. Later in life and like many like me, I self-taught myself software engineering using YouTube, Coursera and online material. I’ve had the chance to follow the best courses from the best teachers at Stanford, MIT and so on. Being a drop-out from College I was even able to complete my degree by re-enlisting 10 years later and rather than going back to the classroom, I was studying the subject on Khan Academy and textbooks. The potential of a unified, highest-quality possible education delivery for everyone is immense. The solution is not necessarily remote learning, but the tools given by remote learning.</p><p>I wonder whether in the aftermath of the pandemic and the combination of widespread use of conferencing tools, unified delivery of learning might become a serious subject of discussion to build a fairer future for our children.</p></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/procrastination_work_no.png" alt="Q2 Time: how to work without a looming deadline"></p><p>You have work to do, but the deadline is in a couple of weeks or months. Or you have no deadline at all.</p><p>How do you do great work every day instead of the usual last-minute push before a deadline?<br>A vitally important question in the era of knowledge work.</p><h3>The mythical land of Q2, the important but not urgent</h3><p>This post is all about the Q2 of the Eisenhower matrix - the part that many procrastinators never get around to.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/eisenhower_Q2.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix"></p><p>It's a shame because Q2 is where all the future-focused, strategic work lies: learning new skills, investing into new endeavors, working on new branches of a business,...</p><p><strong>Q2 is the quadrant of potential.</strong></p><p>Without spending time in Q2 frequently, we tread water in life, doing only the things that we've always done, or that we're forced into at the last minute. Just enough to get by, but not to go to bed with a sense of pride.</p><p>Let's change this.</p><p>We'll start with the first obstacle to working on non-urgent important tasks—the reactive habit of&nbsp;<em>checking</em>.</p><h2>Why checking things became a default habit</h2><p>If you have Internet access, you probably developed this simple habit:</p><p><em>When I get bored, I check ___________.</em></p><p>This is a problem.</p><p>Work often isn't engaging at the beginning of a session. It can seem onerous, never-ending, and boring (before you get into the problem-solving mode).</p><p>If you always have an easy way to get distracted, you'll take it. Often.</p><p>When you&nbsp;<em>check</em>&nbsp;a site or app, you get a bit of dopamine - a feel-good neurochemical.</p><p>This dopamine hit makes it addictive to check stuff. Just the possibility of something new, random, or unexpected is exciting, even if that new thing ends up being a work email.</p><p>Checking things is the cornerstone of&nbsp;<strong>a reactive work style:</strong></p><ul><li>You never do something unless it's in reply to someone else.</li><li>You wait for others to remind you multiple times to do something.</li><li>You refresh inboxes constantly and keep them open at all times.</li><li>When you find yourself bored, you immediately check something.</li></ul><p><strong>This way of working is devoid of initiative. It's an addiction to new information disguised as being "responsive."</strong></p><p>Nothing non-urgent ever gets done.</p><p>How can we get ourselves to do it?</p><h2>2 ways to do non-urgent work</h2><p>The first way is to make Q2 feel like Q1 - to make it urgent. There's a variety of ways to do it.</p><p>The second way is to choose to work on Q2 because you can.</p><h2>1. Make Q2 feel like Q1</h2><p>When we're on a deadline, we spring into action.</p><p>The consequences of not acting become clear: we'll get fired, fail a class, or ruin a relationship...</p><p>The fear of these scenarios is visceral. It drives us to finally get things done.</p><p>While reliance on this fear is not ideal, we can use it.</p><h3>Create consequences for your actions (or lack thereof)</h3><p>If you know that without a deadline, you don't work, create deadlines.</p><p>There are many ways of doing this:</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</strong><br>If you tell a coworker that you'll have done something by Tuesday, they will expect you to deliver. If you don't, you'll cause them to be disappointed or angry. That's a clear consequence.</li><li><strong>Promise publicly you'll do something.</strong><br>If you promise on social media or any other public forum that you'll do something by a certain time, you're putting your reputation at risk.</li><li><strong>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</strong><br>If it's 3PM and you schedule a fancy dinner with your partner at 6PM, it becomes clear that you have only the next 3 hours to get things done (unless you want to miss the dinner). Having more events in your schedule highlights the space available for work. If there's little time for delays, you'll probably adapt and not delay.</li><li><strong>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></strong><br>Both of these services allow you to make a financial bet against yourself. They also help you put your goals into a concrete format. Losing your own money if you don’t do something can be a powerful motivating force.</li></ul><p>Besides these ways of creating a deadline for yourself, you can also heighten your awareness of not working when you're meant to.</p><h3>Create a crystal clear sense of "Now I focus"</h3><p>When a deadline is looming over us, we feel this visceral feeling of "now I really need to work."</p><p>Suddenly, every available hour is an hour we can use to work. Having so much to do and so little time to do it makes us use every minute.</p><p>In other words, it becomes crystal clear to us that&nbsp;<strong>now is the time to focus.</strong></p><p>We can use other tools to get to that feeling.</p><h4>Work alongside others</h4><p>Our environment shapes our behavior in a profound way. Imagine you're working next to a coworker who's focusing intensely. They can also see your screen when they occasionally glance away from their work.</p><p>Would that inspire you to focus a bit more?</p><p>The research says yes.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/497818?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">One study</a>&nbsp;found that the presence of another person improves performance by 16-32%. Interestingly, the study notes: "low productivity workers are the most sensitive to the behavior of peers."</p><p>Now, if you can't use this in your physical environment and work with your coworker, or partner, you can use a service like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></p><p>It allows you to work with 50 minute sessions with others who want to focus on their work.</p><p>You can try the service for free and see if it helps you.</p><h4>Make a grand gesture</h4><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/tips/hotel.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="5 Star hotel"></p><p>A slightly more esoteric way of boosting your awareness of "now I work" is to make a grand gesture.</p><p>Cal Newport describes this strategy in Deep Work and uses the example of J K Rowling.</p><p>When Rowling was stuck writing The Goblet of Fire, she decided to check into a 5 star hotel.</p><p>A stay in a hotel like that is expensive. You can spend hundreds of dollars every day.</p><p>For Rowling, the whole purpose of staying in that hotel was to write. If she was paying thousands of pounds every week, it heightened her awareness time passing. She was paying for every minute, so she'd better produce something worth it.</p><p>Now, this grand gesture is not available to all of us, but another is:&nbsp;<strong>a trip.</strong></p><p>To help himself decide whether to start his online training program AltMBA, Seth Godin went into the desert for a few days with his friends.</p><p>He had one objective for himself: decide.</p><p>He thought about the project, wrote about it, and ultimately decided to commit and do it.</p><p>Could you take a trip somewhere as an opportunity to make a decision you’ve been putting off?</p><p>If you don't want to make yourself work using the above, the other choice is creating a routine in your life to take on non-urgent work without pressure.</p><h2>2. Choosing to work now</h2><h3>Make time for Q2 or it won't happen</h3><p>The anti-dote to reactive site and app checking is&nbsp;<strong>consciously blocking out big uninterrupted chunks of time.</strong></p><p>Our mind works best when we focus on 1 task for an extended period of time, without interruptions.</p><p>If you have email or social media open at all times, you'll get interrupted.</p><h3>Decide to set specific times aside</h3><p>When was the last time you had 2+ hours to work on non-urgent tasks? A time when you didn’t check any distractions and had no one interrupt you?</p><p>If you have to starch your memory extensively to find an answer, then it may be time for a change.</p><p>Uninterrupted time is crucial for productivity, particularly when it comes to dealing with complex or ambiguous tasks.</p><p>It’s also crucial to specify what you’re going to work on. Without a clear intention, the urgent work and unproductive habits will take over.</p><p>The simplest way to do this is to put a big block on the calendar and put what you need to do as the title. You can also add any links or notes to the description.</p><p>When in your week can you do this? When can you make time for futures oriented, important work?</p><h3>Choose to work because you can</h3><p>The last point may well be the most important one. Much of our time, we don’t choose to work. We’re forced to do so by our circumstances. That puts us in a defensive position.</p><p>But we can actively&nbsp;<em>choose</em>&nbsp;to do work. Choose to write that email. Choose to reach out to someone. Choose to start working on the next project. Go on offense.</p><p>Fear is the default motivator for many of us. If I don't do this, I will [insert unpleasant consequences here].</p><p>There are other ways, other internal narratives that we can use.</p><p>"I'm doing this because I have the time and I'm alert and able.""I'll do this because the sooner I do it, the better.""I'll get this done now because it would be awesome if it existed."</p><p>Instead of focusing on what happens if you&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;do something, focus on what happens if you&nbsp;<em>do</em>.</p><p>Switch from the fear of consequences to desire for a specific awesome version of the future.</p><p><strong>When you do block out a 2 hour block of time and find yourself with nothing urgent to do, choose to work.</strong>&nbsp;Because you can. Because you want to create something awesome. Because it will make you happy at the end of the day, week, month, and year.</p><p>Don't wait until circumstances force you, go on offense now!</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>There are 2 main ways to get non-urgent work done:</p><ol start=""><li>Make it feel urgent.</li><li>Choose to do it.</li></ol><p>To make work feel more urgent, you can:</p><ul><li><p>Create consequences for your inaction.</p><ul><li>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</li><li>Promise publicly you'll do something.</li><li>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</li><li>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Make yourself hyper-aware of not taking action.</p><ul><li>Work alongside others with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></li><li>Make not taking action feel wasteful to yourself (scrolling social media in a 5 star hotel).</li></ul></li></ul><p>To choose to do non-urgent work:</p><ul><li>Block out big uninterrupted chunks of time for non-urgent work.</li><li>Assign specific times to specific tasks.</li><li>When you have the opportunity, choose to work because you can.</li></ul><p>Pick 1 strategy out of this article and apply it today!</p></article></div>]]>

<p>Facebook has given an ultimatum for WhatsApp users to either share their data with Facebook or leave the service. And that date is February 8th.</p>
<p>One of the most appealing things about WhatsApp is it’s end to end encryption. Even though their are other chat apps, no one provides end to end encryption to chats by default other than WhatsApp and Signal. </p>
<p>Not even Telegram provide encryption by default, and you need to start a secret chat to enable end to end encryption.</p>
<p>One of the most important things in iOS 14 is the ability for users see what kind of data apps are collecting from their users. </p>

<p>So in light of all this I went through the top 10 social networking/chat apps to see how much data they are collecting in comparison to Signal, and explain why I won’t use Signal and what we can do instead.</p>
<h2>The top 10 social media/chat apps</h2>

<h2>Telegram</h2>
<p>Telegram is one of the better apps when we compare with the others in this group. They collect relatively small amount of data.</p>
<p>It is currently the number 1 in my region, Telegram is extremely popular in my region because it provides a great way to share pirated content. </p>
<p>There is no limit to the file size that you can upload on Telegram, and there is no limit for the number of users that a Telegram group can have.</p>
<p>This makes it an ideal place for people to share pirated copies of movies, games, songs in groups with hundreds of users.</p>

<p>I’m bit reluctant to use Telegram due to its poor user interface, and its connections to Russia.</p>
<p>To clarify what I meant by poor user interface, on the android device that I tried Telegram, I was unable to select multiple chats, and deleting a chat is a multi step process. It doesn’t have to be that complicated.</p>
<h2><strong>WhatsApp</strong> </h2>
<p>WhatsApp is currently the number 2 in my region, and when compared with Telegram, WhatsApp is collecting a decent amount of data to track you.</p>

<h2>Facebook and <strong>Messenger</strong> </h2>
<p>Facebook is a vacuumed of user data, they collect everything that they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>The Messenger app is also no different to the Facebook app. I’m not installing either of them, no matter how much Facebook mobile website tries to funnel me to installing their Messenger app.</p>

<h2>IMO</h2>
<p>IMO is also a chat app with a niche audience. Even though it’s not popular in the USA, IMO is quite popular in Southeast Asia as a platform to share adult content, like a live cam website.</p>
<p>But it too has chat capabilities just like any other chat app, and it too collects a decent amount of user data, even more than WhatsApp.</p>

<h2>Viber</h2>
<p>When it comes to my friends and relatives Viber is the second most popular chat app behind WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>Especially girls love using Viber because of the large variety of stickers, that they can select in the app.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t like using viber, and find it too bloated. Yes, the stickers are nice, but what I need is a chat app, not a sticker app.</p>
<p>And it appears Viber is also collecting lot of data as well.</p>

<p><strong>I’m skipping Parent control app, because even though listed as a chat app it does not appear to look like a chat app.</strong></p>
<h2>Signal</h2>
<p>When it comes to chat apps, it’s unbelievable to see that Signal is basically not collecting any user data.</p>
<p>They also provide end to end encrypted chats by default.</p>
<p>The lack of collecting user data is a sign that they don’t need to sell user data as a way to make money. </p>
<p>Signal is currently depending on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://signal.org/donate" target="_blank">donations</a>, and even if they find other ways to monetize the service, as long as they are not collecting data, we can be sure that our data is not being used to monetize the service.</p>

<h2>BOTIM</h2>
<p>I have not used the BOTIM and I have no idea why it’s there in the charts ahead of other chat apps like WeChat and Line.</p>
<p>Maybe BOTIM has a niche audience that I don’t know about.</p>

<h2>Why <strong>I’</strong>n not/<strong>can’t</strong> use Signal</h2>
<p>I love to use Signal, I wish everyone can use Signal, and I wish I can use Signal, but I just can’t.</p>
<p>I have installed any tried using Signal couple of times, but whenever I install it it’s basically a ghost town. No one is using it and I can’t convince anyone else to join, because none of their friends on Signal either.</p>
<p>The network effect on WhatsApp is strong, and almost all of my non techie regular WhatsApp users will just accept the new TOS and will share their data with Facebook. They just want a chat app and that is what WhatsApp is providing.</p>
<p>Even if I install Signal, I will be the only one in my network using it. And no one will be willing to use Signal just to chat with me.</p>
<p>I will try to keep my personal messages away from WhatsApp as much as possible, but. I won’t be able to leave my WhatsApp groups. I will use iMessages whenever I’m chatting with someone with an Apple device.</p>
<h2>What we <strong>actually</strong> need</h2>
<p>What we actually need is not Signal, WhatsApp or Telegram. What we need is a protocol, just like email but for chat and apps that build on top of this protocol.</p>
<p>There are such protocols, but no major company is willing to use them for their chat apps.</p>
<p>If we have such protocol, then we will be able to switch apps with ease, without having to worry about the network effect or losing out chats just like we can do with our emails.</p>
<p>So please everyone try to invest on a protocol, not on an individual app.</p>

<p>Welcome to the new world of engineering management! You’ve entered a brave new world that will be significantly different than your life as an individual contributor. Here are some tips I’ve learned over time.</p>



<p>You have one goal: <strong>maximize your team’s productive work</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s it. Do that and you will succeed. Do anything else and you fail. Life is simple.</p>



<p>Let’s break that down into a few key ideas.</p>



<h2>Maximize Your Team Member’s Potential</h2>



<p>First, let’s assess the type of engineers you may have on your team.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Solid</strong> = Can solve well defined problems.</li><li><strong>Bad</strong> = Can’t solve well defined problems.</li><li><strong>Junior</strong> = Bad engineers but have the excuse of being very early in their career or being put into a new situation.</li><li><strong>Leaders</strong> = Can determine the problems that need to be solved and help others get the necessary work done.</li></ul>



<p>How should you manage the different types of engineers?</p>



<p><strong>Engineering Leaders</strong>. If you are a new manager, you are likely the only Leader in your team. If you are lucky enough to have team members that are Leaders, your life will be easy. Just keep giving them tough problems and stay out of their way.</p>



<p><strong>Solid Engineers</strong>. These engineers will hopefully make up most of your team. They can tackle well defined problems, so to maximize their current utility, work on giving them the minimum definition they need and then get out of their way. To maximize their long term success, you want to try and turn Solid Engineers into Leaders. One way to do this is to keep giving them tougher problems with less definition and let them grow into Leaders.</p>



<p><strong>Bad Engineers. </strong>Hopefully you don’t inherit any Bad Engineers. If you do, you need to quickly assess whether it is worth the management effort to get them to Solid Engineers, or get them off your team (either by firing or a transfer to another team).</p>



<p><strong>Junior Engineers. </strong>As a new manager, you are likely to have several Junior Engineers. I’ve found that everyone is happiest if both the Junior Engineer and yourself acknowledge that Junior Engineers do not produce useful work today. Instead, both the Junior Engineer and yourself should focus your efforts on turning them into a Solid Engineer as soon as possible. As a manager, you can accelerate their growth by (1) giving them training tasks, i.e. tasks that may not be the most relevant to your team’s productivity today, but help them grow as an individual and (2) giving them extra 1 on 1 attention. While this extra effort will consume significant time now, you can have a Solid Engineer within a few months. Plus, this extra effort is nothing compared to the effort you would later need to spend to move someone from a Bad Engineer to Solid Engineer.</p>



<h2>Maximize Your Team Output</h2>



<p>Now that we have covered the basics of maximizing individual team member’s performance, let’s move on to some tips for maximizing your whole team’s output.</p>



<h3>Your Output</h3>



<p>First, you need to plan that your personal coding output will basically be zero. You may occasionally do some coding, but you need to remember that you are judged on your team’s output now, not just your own. So any coding project you do needs to be weighed against the opportunity cost of you spending that same amount of time improving your team members. I’ve found that this likely means you will only end up coding (1) early prototypes, (2) refactorings, or (3) nice to have projects. Instead, you need to switch to thinking about your team’s output.</p>



<h3>Meetings</h3>



<p>As a new manager, your life can easily be consumed by meetings. You will now be in charge of 1:1s and team meetings, and also get invited to lots of cross team meetings. My biggest regret as an early manager is saying yes to every meeting. I personally am fine with delegating work, but my weakness was that I still wanted to know everything that was going on. Before you know it, you will spend all day running from meeting to meeting. This is bad for three reasons: (1) you don’t have time to think, (2) you can’t adapt to emergencies and (3) your team members will become too shy to schedule 1:1s with you since they assume you are doing something important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So fight the good fight and minimize the number of meetings. I advocate the following meeting philosophy:</p>



<ul><li>All meetings should have a predefined agenda, even 1:1s.</li><li>Have the minimum number of people in the meeting (ie prefer 1:1s or small groups)</li><li>Minimize the number of meetings that are just status updates. Most of these can likely be replaced by email, Slack, or a document.</li><li>Group meetings into blocks. I’ve had success with the following type of meeting schedule:<ul><li>Monday AM: Sprint starts / big team meetings.</li><li>Monday PM: 1:1s.</li><li>Tuesday: No recurring meetings.</li><li>Wednesday: Cross team meetings.</li><li>Thursday: No recurring meetings.</li><li>Friday AM: Sprint check ins / sprint end meetings.</li><li>Friday PM: 1:1s.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Documents</h3>



<p>A well written document is one of your two new best friends. The power of a well written document is that it (1) forces you to clarify your thoughts, (2) provides a clear documentation trail and (3) prevents you from repeating yourself. There is nothing worse than having a meeting with a lot of people that leads to some very important decisions, but then no one can seem to remember what those decisions are. Write, write, and write some more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Do Productive Work</h2>



<p>At this point your team should be doing lots of work. But how do you guarantee that this work is productive? Let me introduce you to your second new best friend: <a href="https://www.whatmatters.com/get-started/">Objectives and Key Results</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main principles of OKRs are:</p>



<ul><li>Objectives should be clearly defined aspirational goals</li><li>Key results are specific quantitative measures</li><li>Each objective should be supported by 3-5 key results</li><li>Ideally key results can be measured on a 0-100% scale</li><li>To make key results push the boundaries of your team, it is recommended that<ul><li>A key result is considered achieved if &gt;=70% is achieved</li><li>Key results are not tied to pay</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Many companies use a mix of yearly and quarterly OKRs. I personally find the quarter OKRs most useful as a management tool. The yearly OKRs are more useful for upper management to set clear company wide goals, but I’ve found that setting yearly team goals are not very useful unless they directly tie into a company OKR. Instead, I would focus on writing solid quarterly team OKRs.</p>



<p>For OKRs to truly work, you need to get buy in from the whole team. In order to get buy in, you should:</p>



<ol><li>Do the necessary prep work to deeply understand the company priorities and OKRs.</li><li>Involve your team members in developing the team OKRs.</li><li>Set up a central dashboard to track your progress on OKRs.</li><li>Make that dashboard a central part of your meetings. Kick off team meetings by looking at the dashboard and calling out progress.</li><li>Have a retrospective at the end of the recording period to understand why your team succeeded or failed to achieve OKRs.</li><li>Rinse and repeat. Your first several quarters of OKRs likely won’t go well. But please don’t give up until you have tried for at least 4 quarters in a row.</li></ol>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Good luck, hope these tips help!</p>

Given its safety, </span><span>w</span><span>e call for immediate widespread increased vitamin D intakes</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Vitamin D modulates thousands of genes and many aspects of immune function, both innate and adaptive. The scientific evidence</span><span>1</span><span>&nbsp;shows that:</span></p><p><span>Vitamin D is well known to be essential, but most people do not get enough. Two common definitions of inadequacy are deficiency &lt; 20ng/ml (50nmol/L), the target of most governmental organizations, and insufficiency &lt; 30ng/ml (75nmol/L), the target of several medical societies &amp; experts.</span><span>2</span><span>&nbsp;Too many people have levels below these targets. </span><span>Rates of vitamin D deficiency &lt;20ng/ml exceed 33% of the population in most of the world, and most estimates of insufficiency &lt;30ng/ml are well over 50% (but much higher in many countries).</span><span>3</span><span>&nbsp;Rates are even higher in winter, and several groups have notably worse deficiency: the overweight, those with dark skin (especially far from the equator), and care home residents. These same groups face increased COVID-19 risk.</span></p><p><span>It has been shown that 3875 IU (97mcg) daily is required for 97.5% of people to reach 20ng/ml, and 6200 IU (155mcg) for 30ng/ml,</span><span>4</span><span>&nbsp;intakes far above all national guidelines. Unfortunately, the report that set the US RDA included an admitted statistical error in which required intake was calculated to be ~10x too low.</span><span>4</span><span>&nbsp;Numerous calls in the academic literature to raise official recommended intakes had not yet resulted in increases by the time SARS-CoV-2 arrived. Now, many papers indicate that vitamin D affects COVID-19 more strongly than most other health conditions, with increased risk at levels &lt; 30ng/ml (75nmol/L) and severely greater risk &lt; 20ng/ml (50nmol/L).</span><span>1</span></p><p><span>Evidence to date </span><span>suggests </span><span>the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic sustains itself in large part &nbsp;through infection of those with low vitamin D, and that deaths are concentrated largely in those with deficiency. The mere possibility that this is so should compel urgent gathering of more vitamin D data. </span><span>Even without more data</span><span>, </span><span>the </span><span>preponderance </span><span>of evidence indicates that </span><span>increased vitamin D would help reduce infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, &amp; deaths</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Decades of safety data show that vitamin D has very low risk: </span><span>Toxicity would be extremely rare with the recommendations here. The risk of insufficient levels far outweighs any risk from levels that seem to provide most of the protection against COVID-19, and this is notably different from drugs. Vitamin D is much safer than steroids, such as dexamethasone, the most widely accepted treatment to have also demonstrated a large COVID-19 benefit. Vitamin D’s safety is more like that of face masks. </span><span>There is no need to wait for further clinical trials to increase use of something so safe, </span><span>especially when remedying high rates of deficiency/insufficiency should already be a priority</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, we call on all governments, doctors, and healthcare workers worldwide to immediately recommend and implement efforts appropriate to their adult populations to increase vitamin D, at least until the end of the pandemic. Specifically to:</span></p><p><span>Many factors are known to predispose individuals to higher risk from exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such as age, being male, comorbidities, etc., but </span><span>inadequate</span><span>&nbsp;v</span><span>itamin D is by far the most easily and quickly </span><span>modifiable</span><span>&nbsp;risk factor with abundant evidence to support a large effect</span><span>. Vitamin D is inexpensive and has negligible risk compared to the considerable risk of COVID-19.</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>&nbsp;The following include 4000 IU within their tolerable intakes in official guidelines: NAM (US, Canada), SACN (UK), EFSA (Europe), Endocrine Society (international), Nordic countries, The Netherlands, Australia &amp; New Zealand, UAE, and the American Geriatrics Soc. (USA, elderly). No major agency specifies a lower tolerable intake limit. The US NAM said 4000 IU “is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals.” See also [</span><span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32180081/">Giustina et al ‘20</a></span><span>].</span></p><p><span>The signatories below endorse this letter.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div role="main"><div><article><p>Modern processors are quite complex, with many parts having the potential to become a bottleneck. It is relatively easy to reason about the performance of short pieces of code, especially if memory effects are kept to a minimum. Both static analysis tools like LLVM MCA and microbenchmarks can provide a lot of information in such cases. However, the behaviour of the whole program is not just the sum of those small parts. As the code becomes larger and more complex other effects start appearing. One of such potential problems are excessive instruction cache misses.</p><p>Every program has different properties, and those large-scale effects will affect it differently. However, if its job is to execute complex logic on a small amount of data, the instruction cache is likely to become a problem at some point. The actual impact may vary significantly from codebase to codebase, which is why I won’t show any numbers in this article. Let’s consider this just a collection of ideas, but it is not easy to tell how much any of them will help for a given application.</p><p>First, let’s have a quick look at the processor front end. Below is a simplified diagram of how it is arranged in Skylake, the numbers between units are the maxima per cycle.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="630" height="860" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-front-end.min.2e73578fff.svg" alt="CPU front end"></p><p>Each cycle the processor fetches up to 16 bytes from the instruction cache using information from the Branch Prediction Unit to predict the control flow. The pre-decode unit determines instruction lengths and puts up to five of them in the Instruction Queue. From the Instruction Queue, up to 5 instructions (with macro-fusion) are brought each cycle to the decoders. There is one complex decoder that can handle instructions that translate to up to 4 µops and 3 simple decoders that can handle only single-µop instructions. In total, all decoders are limited to producing no more than 5 µops each cycle. Instructions that require more than 4 µops go through Microcode Sequence ROM, which emits 4 µops per cycle, and while it is active, the decoders are disabled. There is also Decoded ICache (<abbr title="Decoded Stream Buffer">DSB</abbr>) which caches decoded µops. It can emit up to 6 µops each cycle. All µops, regardless of their source, end up in the Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ). The Loop Stream Detector (LSD) detects small loops and keeps them in the queue, so that no fetched, decodes or reads from the DSB are needed during the duration of the loop. IDQ is the last part of the front end, and the queued µops continue to the back end.</p><p>From the instruction cache point of view, the front end has two weaknesses. Firstly, instructions are processed in-order which can severely limit the processor ability to hide latencies of cache misses. HyperThreading can make sure that this part of the processor still does some useful work, but it is also the source of the second problem – all resources, including the L1 instruction cache and µop cache are shared between the hardware threads.</p><p>Modern processors provide various metrics that help monitor their behaviour. However, the task of extracting the relevant data requires a proper approach if it is to be done efficiently. Top-down analysis is invaluable with helping to understand microarchitectural phenomena in large codebases. The idea is to monitor program behaviour with the <abbr title="Performance Monitoring Unit">PMU</abbr> counters and identify the bottleneck starting with the major functional parts of the CPU and then digging deeper narrowing down on the exact source of the problem. It can be done in an automated way by tools like VTune or toplev.</p><pre><code>FE    Frontend_Bound:                                      39.48 +-  0.00 % Slots

</code></pre><p>Above is an example of a toplev result. We can see that the instruction cache misses were the dominating bottleneck. Unsurprisingly instruction TLB misses also show up. On the front end bandwidth side of things, toplev points to the legacy decode pipeline. That makes perfect sense if the instructions are supplied from DSB or LSD, then there are no instruction fetches, and no cache misses.</p><p>Sometimes, the final summary may not provide sufficient information if there are changes in the code behaviour during the test. When that’s the case, a graph is likely to be a much more helpful way of presenting the results.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="950" height="950" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-toplev.min.2b465fdb6f.svg" alt="toplev"></p><p>Tools like toplev are great for initial identification of the problem, but once that’s done what we need is a right way for comparing different solutions. Ultimately, the most important metric is the actual performance of the program in a real-life workload. toplev still can be helpful as it shows the balance between different performance-limiting factors. What also can be useful is <code>perf stat</code> which can show the performance counter statistics. The event most relevant for us is <code>L1-icache-load-misses</code>, though there are more model-specific registers that may be of interest.</p><p>Now, that we know how to diagnose excessive instruction cache misses, let’s see what can be done to deal with this problem.</p><h2 id="avoiding-work">Avoiding work</h2><p>If the number of executed instructions is the problem, the most obvious solution is to try to reduce that number. Obviously, that’s much easier said than done, but there are some common patterns for dealing with this issue. One example would be prepared statements in databases. The general idea is that if a client knows it will send requests that have some commonality, it can tell the database engine early that the requests are going to match specific templates. This information allows the server to do as much work as possible during the preparation stage, thus reducing the amount of logic that needs to be executed for each individual request.</p><p>Extracting common patterns doesn’t have to be explicit. A server or any other kind of an application which actions depend on the user input could attempt to look for repeating patterns and cache some common parts. This is a very vague idea and most likely won’t be easily implementable in a lot of applications, but in some cases may be quite a natural solution. It also shows the main problem with the “just do less” approach – it is very application specific. On the plus, side, if this can be done, it is likely to help with the overall performance, not just the instruction cache misses.</p><p>Another potential problem is making sure that the preparation phase can really do something to help during the execution phase. If that means pre-computing some values, then it’s simple. However, if the only thing that preparation gives us is the knowledge which code paths are going to be exercised and which branches taken during the execution, it is going to be harder to take benefit from it. One option is to have some specialised code for the most common paths, C++ templates may come in handy here. If it is not easy to determine what may be the most common paths, then a just-in-time compiler may be used to generate code in the preparation stage.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><h2 id="batching-work">Batching work</h2><p>So far, we have been trying to reduce the number of executed instructions, by taking advantage of some earlier knowledge to avoiding repeating the same work. In other words, we have introduced two stages:</p><ul><li>preparation, which is performed rarely and, consequently, less performance critical</li><li>execution, which is done many times and is expected to dominate overall performance</li></ul><p>The way this can help with the instruction cache misses is that the execution stage, being smaller, is more likely to fit in the instruction cache. Whether this brings any measurable benefits depends highly on the type of the application and how much logic can be moved from execution to preparation stages.</p><p>We have already split our processing pipeline into preparation and execution stage. If the execution stage can fit in the instruction cache, we are done. However, often, that’s not the case. What we can do to improve the situation more is to split the execution into more stages. This time the goal is not to reuse work as it was with the preparation, but to group entities that need to have the same code executed for them. In other words, if the processing pipeline consists of steps A, B and C the idea is to separate them, add a queue in front of each of those stages, and then cycle through those stages each time handling multiple elements from the queue. Connections between the stages don’t have to be one-to-one, any directed graph is fine.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="756" height="331" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-seda.min.7259b25adc.svg" alt="SEDA diagram"></p><p>In the diagram above, there is one stage that feeds tasks to one of two stages. This could be, for example, a front-end of a database server. The first stage does some initial request processing and then, depending on whether it is a read or write, puts it in the appropriate queue. Each stage processes requests in batches, the first one warms up the instruction …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

It's like the distance a speeding car travels after the brakes are applied.</p>  <p>But Monday's <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00955-x">study in the journal Nature Climate Change</a> calculates that a bit differently and now figures the carbon pollution already put in the air will push global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times.</p>  <p>Previous estimates, including those accepted by international science panels, were about a degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) less than that amount of committed warming.</p>  <p>International climate agreements set goals of limiting warming to 2 C&nbsp;(3.6 F) since pre-industrial times, with the more ambitious goal of limiting it to 1.5 C&nbsp;(2.7 F) added in Paris in 2015. The world has already warmed about 1.1 C&nbsp;(2 F).</p>  <p>"You've got some ... global warming inertia that's going to cause the climate system to keep warming, and that's essentially what we're calculating," said study co-author Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. "Think about the climate system like the Titanic. It's hard to turn the ship when you see the icebergs."</p>  <p>Dessler and colleagues at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Nanjing University in China calculated committed warming to take into account that the world has warmed at different rates in different places and that places that haven't warmed as fast are destined to catch up.</p>    <p>Places such as the Southern Ocean, surrounding Antarctica are a bit cooler, and that difference creates low-lying clouds that reflect more sun away from earth, keeping these places cooler. But this situation can't keep going indefinitely because physics dictates that cooler locations will warm up more and when they do, the clouds will dwindle and more heating will occur, Dessler said.</p>  <p>Previous studies were based on the cooler spots staying that way, but Dessler and colleagues say that's not likely.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/greenland-record-melt.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/greenland-record-melt.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/greenland-record-melt.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greenland-record-melt.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/greenland-record-melt.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greenland-record-melt.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>In this Aug. 16, 2019 file photo, icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland.

Breakthrough Institute climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the new work fits better with climate models than observational data.</p>  <p>Just because the world is bound to get more warming than international goals, that doesn't mean all is lost in the fight against global warming, said Dessler, who cautioned against what he called "climate doomers."</p>  <p>If the world gets to net zero carbon emissions soon, 2 degrees of global warming could be delayed enough so that it won't happen for centuries, giving society time to adapt or even come up with technological fixes, he said.</p>  <p>"If we don't, we're going to blow through (climate goals) in a few decades," Dessler said. "It's really the rate of warming that makes climate change so terrible. If we got a few degrees over 100,000 years, that would not be that big a deal. We can deal with that. But a few degrees over 100 years is really bad."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>How do you send a password over the internet? You acquire a SSL certificate and let TLS do the job of securely transporting the password from client to server. Of course it’s not as cut-and-dry as I’m making it out to be, but the gist of it holds true and stood the test of time. This hasn’t always been this way though, and one incredibly popular storefront on the world wide web prefers to add a little extra to this day. I’ll be discussing Steam’s unique method of logging in their users, and go down a deep rabbit hole of fascinating implementation details.</p><h3 id="pointing-out-the-obvious">Pointing out the obvious</h3><p>I found a StackOverflow question from 2013 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1582894/how-to-send-password-securely-over-http">asking how to securely send a password over HTTP</a>. The answers are pretty unanimous: get a SSL certificate. Here’s an experiment: set up your favorite traffic-capturing proxy, browse to a service you frequently use, log in with your account (or preferably a throwaway), and inspect the requests. You will most certainly find that your username and password are sent as-is in a HTTP request body. The only reason this works is because your connection to the server is encrypted using TLS.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/so-real-host.png" alt="StackOverflow user asking what to do if a webhost doesn't support SSL certificates, told to move to a real webhost"><figcaption><p>Weird to think that this used to be an issue</p></figcaption></figure><p>The internet was a different place though in the early 2010s, let alone the many years prior. We now have services like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> which issue SSL certificates free of charge for a period of three months, with automatic renewals if desired. There really wasn’t much of a way around acquiring a SSL certificate for money, but usually with extended validity and support. You could certainly argue that there is a price to be paid for the security and privacy of your users, but that didn’t stop questions like the one I linked from appearing.</p><p>Now that we all agree that TLS is important, let’s switch it up. Let’s pretend we cannot send a password over HTTPS and have to somehow make it work with plain HTTP, while also providing users with some level of security. There’s the <code>Authorization</code> header which is standardized and widely accepted. However, in conjunction with the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme, it provides no security if used in plain HTTP.</p><p>There are tried and tested challenge-response algorithms, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP</a> which is designed to do password-based authentication without ever actually sending the password, but you probably have to implement them yourself and a slight oversight could cause serious harm. You could also defer authentication to an external service. “Sign in with service XYZ” is commonly used, but comes with its own ramifications. All things considered, it’s not trivial to send secrets over an inheretly insecure connection.</p><p>So when me and a friend took Steam apart in search for traces of personally identifiable information, I was surprised to see that Steam’s login page doesn’t only rely on TLS to ensure that your password stays protected.</p><h3 id="crypto-cherry-on-top">Crypto cherry on top</h3><p>Again, grab your favorite traffic-capturing proxy and navigate to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login">Steam’s login page</a>. Enter your username and password and you will (hopefully) be asked to enter a one-time token generated by your preferred two-factor authentication method. You can stop right there, because the magic I want to point out has already happened. You’ll find that pressing the login button launches a request against an odd endpoint: <code>/login/getrsakey</code>, followed by <code>/login/dologin</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/getrsa-call.png" alt="Requests to fetch script assets, acquire RSA key and perform login"><figcaption><p>All relevant assets and requests in succession</p></figcaption></figure><p>Inspect the request for <code>/login/getrsakey</code> and you’ll find a JSON-formatted response, containing fields with names that should look very familiar to anyone who’s briefly dealt with public key cryptography. You’re given a RSA public key, though the exact values might look a bit odd. It’s clear that <code>publickey_mod</code> and <code>publickey_exp</code> define the modulus and the exponent used in encryption, but the former is given in hexadecimal while the latter appears to be given in binary (I’ll get back on that later). There’s also a timestamp which has no immediately recognizable starting point. As to what the purpose of <code>token_gid</code> is, I have no clue yet.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The login page pulls some scripts on load. There is the main login handler contained in <code>login.js</code> which is completely unobfuscated, so anyone can just analyze it and find out what it does. The site also loads some additional dependencies, namely <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code>.</p><p>A quick search for the name mentioned in the first line of <code>jsbn.js</code> reveals that these two scripts are the work of <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/">Tom Wu</a> — a MIT and Stanford graduate who likes software engineering and computer cryptography. They released <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code> as pure JavaScript implementations of arbitrary precision integers and RSA encryption/decryption respectively. You’ll also find that these libraries have had their most recent updates in 2005 and 2013 which is a bit of information I’ll come back to later. For now, just keep it in mind.</p><h3 id="going-down-the-rsabbit-hole">Going down the r(s)abbit hole</h3><p>So now that we have all relevant assets, let’s dig around in <code>login.js</code>. The code is a bit of a mess with lots of callbacks and proxied function calls, but it turns out the parts of interest can be easily condensed. In essence, the script can be boiled down to a couple of steps, each step assuming that everything went fine in the previous step.</p><ol><li>The user enters their username and password and presses the login button.</li><li><code>DoLogin</code> is called, which checks if the login mask was filled out correctly and launches a request against <code>/login/getrsakey</code>.</li><li><code>OnRSAKeyResponse</code> is called. This checks if the response is well-formed.</li><li><code>GetAuthCode</code> is called. It runs some platform-specific code in case there are any 2FA measures active on the user’s account.</li><li><code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> is called. This is where the password is encrypted using RSA and the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> is prepared and executed.</li><li><code>OnLoginResponse</code> is called. The user is logged in and redirected to the Steam storefront.</li></ol><p>The code in <code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> shows why the requested public key is formatted the way that it is. Starting at line 387 in the source file, the modulus and exponent of the <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response are passed as-is to the RSA library. The user’s password is then encrypted with the given public key and added to the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> in the subsequent login step.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>pubKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_mod</span><span>,</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_exp</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div><p>I copied the source files onto my local machine to explore the RSA library a little bit. Both the modulus and the exponent are passed to the function <code>RSAPublicKey</code> which behaves like a constructor in the “pre-class” JavaScript era. <code>RSAPublicKey</code> simply wraps both values into instances of <code>BigInteger</code> provided by the <code>jsbn.js</code> script. It was to my surprise that the exponent is actually not represented in binary but, just like the modulus, in hexadecimal. (Also, turns out <code>0x010001</code> is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6098381/what-are-common-rsa-sign-exponent">very common encryption exponent</a> in RSA implementations.) So now it’s clear that the password encryption is based on 2048-bit RSA with an encryption exponent of 65537.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>"c85ba44d5a360856..."</span> <span>/* insert your own long modulus here */</span><span>,</span> <span>"010001"</span><span>);</span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>Moving on to the <code>timestamp</code> field. The <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response contains an <code>Expires</code> header. It references a date in the past, meaning that the response is absolutely not meant to be cached or persisted in any way. If you check back on <code>/login/getrsakey</code> over a longer period of time, you’ll notice that the public key changes ever so often and, as such, its timestamp value too. This means there’s only a limited time frame in which a certain Steam-issued RSA public key can be used to authenticate.</p><p>This becomes even more evident when examining the subsequent request against <code>/login/dologin</code>. Among many other things, it contains the username, encrypted password as well as the timestamp of the issued RSA public key. Trying to perform a login attempt while altering the timestamp fails as expected. But more importantly, it’s also not possible to reuse an older public key, even if the password is correctly encrypted.</p><p>I went one step further and <a href="https://gist.github.com/JoogsWasTaken/8a8e60859e1721255c57e9185eb6cb10">wrote a simple Python script to collect public keys</a> over the span of three days using a throwaway account. I let it run every five minutes using a cronjob. The goal was to check just how often Steam’s public keys change and to hopefully find out how the <code>timestamp</code> field behaves.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-pubkeys.png" alt="SQLite database containing public keys sourced from Steam"><figcaption><p>Lots and lots and lots of public keys</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that the public key changes every 12 entries, meaning that it’s safe to assume that they rotate every hour. The encryption exponent stays the same — no surprises here. More intriguing however is the aforementioned <code>timestamp</code> field. For every 12 public keys, the value of the <code>timestamp</code> increases by a certain amount, namely 3600000000 and then some. And what’s more is that this number wraps around after some period of time as can be seen in the following image. Be warned, because all of what I’m about to say is highly speculative.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-wraparound.png" alt="Public key entries where the timestamp value wraps around in-between"><figcaption><p>Timestamp field wrapping around</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that 3600000000 microseconds is equal to one hour, making me assume that the value of the <code>timestamp</code> field is, in fact, given in microseconds. However, I already hinted at the fact that the timestamp value doesn’t increase by one hour exactly with every new public key. In my own data, I observed that the difference between two successive timestamps is one hour plus 1 to 2.6 seconds, with most being in the order of about 1.05 to 1.25 seconds. But this raises another interesting possibility.</p><p>Let’s assume that a new public key is generated every hour plus one second. If I query the public key …</p></article></section></div>

                    <p>Today is a difficult day in America, a difficult day to be an American.</p><p>Watching the videos of my fellow countrymen breaking windows to get into the U.S. Capitol, seeing the photos of our elected lawmakers huddling under chairs in the House chamber: these are images of our very democracy under attack -- all in an attempt to disrupt what is usually a ceremonial certification of an election.</p><p>As sad and disappointing as the situation is, what is worse is what got us here. &nbsp;Disinformation is real. The vilification of the news media is real. &nbsp;At some point in the last few years, we’ve bifurcated reality, politicizing verifiable facts and even the act of journalism itself.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After I called them rioters just now on air, the crowd converged on the area press had gathered so we took off.

</figure><p>America is a democracy -- a government by the people, for the people. &nbsp;And in order for the people to govern themselves, we need a well equipped press corps to keep us informed. &nbsp;There cannot be two sets of facts, two universes of truth. &nbsp;We need the reliable journalists to win, to keep us informed, so we can debate ideas, not facts.</p><p>Reporting is not a political act, but it’s also not simply stenography for the powerful. &nbsp;Digging, investigating, holding those in power accountable -- these are the ideals that journalism holds in the highest regard. </p><p>Most who work for reputable news organizations are obsessive in their caution to limit any appearance of impropriety. &nbsp;They adhere to strict editorial standards that the audience is largely unaware of. They are bound by policies and standards that guide how and what they report all designed to ensure credibility in the information they share.</p><p>And yet, disinformation runs wild. &nbsp;The downside of a platform where anyone can post anything, is that anyone can post anything. &nbsp;</p><p>I know many people do not like to pay for news. &nbsp;Frankly, it makes fiscal sense not to when you view it as a commodity and so much is available for free. &nbsp;But when news is commoditized, and taken from an aggregator or a social network, the provenance &nbsp;-- and credibility - can be a gamble.</p><p>It also means that there is ever less money funding the responsible reporting that we need so much. &nbsp;There are technical means to disable ads; there are methods to sneak around paywalls. &nbsp;But each of these actions means that journalism is ever so slightly less economically viable, with dire consequences.</p><p>Newspapers go bankrupt. &nbsp;</p><p>News websites turn to clickbait to attract the remaining ad-viewing traffic they so desperately need.</p><p>And others who abide by no ethics step up to fill the void, which can lead to plagiarizing total fabrication or conspiracy minded fantasists, breathlessly reporting the intricate details of insane theories about the dark side of our leaders. </p><p>All of this makes trust in all media decline (even those that are obsessively reliable), makes the profession less viable, and makes our democracy less informed.</p><p>All of this makes today’s scenes on Capitol Hill possible.</p><p>Journalism is not the enemy. &nbsp;It is the shield that protects us from those that wish to turn us against each other.</p>

<p>In short, the concern is that an array of magnets in the phone may turn off the life-saving function of these cardiac devices.</p>
<p>This “MagSafe” technology was already used elsewhere, but this is the first time it has been incorporated into an iPhone.</p>
<p>Nearly all ICDs will stop shocking a patient when placed near a sufficiently strong magnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pacemakers exposed to a magnet are set to a pre-programmed mode that varies by manufacturer, usually with a rate of 65-80bpm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask any Emergency Medicine physician and they will be able to point you to a blue circular magnet used for this exact purpose.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>1. This is unlikely to result in medical malpractice litigation against any individual physician. However, it does place the manufacturer at risk for product liability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. ED physicians should keep this in mind for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. These patients should be completely exposed during the code, removing all clothing and foreign objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. For patients with pacemakers, consider that any unusual or unexplained symptoms could have been explained by a transient switch in pacemaker mode while their phone was nearby. Interrogating the pacemaker will help shed light on this.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>React is the de-facto tool for frontend web development. It has a rich ecosystem and a well-known company to back it up. Despite all of this, I think they still get a ton of stuff wrong. This post is about my personal views and things I think React is already a too slow-moving giant to fix.</p><h2 id="the-syntax">The syntax</h2><p>React has such an awful API that they needed to create a whole new programming language syntax to overcome it: The <code>React.createElement</code> API. Most of the time it's hidden behind JSX that's transpiled onto <code>React.createElement</code> calls.</p><p>You either only ever write JSX when working with React, or you get frustrated with the amount of clutter that gets to your codebase from all that repetition that provides no value to the reader.</p><pre><code>Reat.createElement(<span>'html'</span>, <span>null</span>,
  React.createElement(<span>'body'</span>, <span>null</span>,
    React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, <span>null</span>,
      React.createElement(...)
    )
  )
)
</code></pre><p>I think a much better way is to follow what SwiftUI and Flutter are doing: Move the element's name from argument to be the function's name:</p><pre><code>html(
  body(
    div(...)
  )
)
</code></pre><p>This does not only remove unnecessary clutter, but removes the need for any compilation step.</p><h2 id="create-react-app">create-react-app</h2><p>Next up us a monstrosity that's nowadays accepted by many to be a "best practice" for getting started with a React project. The problem being, that React ecosystem is such a complex beast that they created a bootstrap project so you can get anything done in a meaningful time. Just pray that you don't need to eject it any time soon.</p><p>Just to give you an idea of the absurdness of this situation: create-react-app creates a "hello world" project for you that downloads <strong>2.5 million lines of Javascript code</strong> to your machine. For a hello world app.</p><p>I have strong feelings about fighting complexity by adding more complexity, and this sure smells like something you should not be doing in 2021.</p><p>Instead we should be thinking about where our browsers and server ecosystems are nowadays and if we could make the bootstrapping <em>simpler</em>. Browsers <a href="https://caniuse.com/es6-module">know how to handle imports nowadays</a>, and the module format is <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html">also part of Node.js</a> without any preprocessing, so you don't necessarily need a build step to get those working.</p><p>Modern browsers are really good with on-the-fly compression like gzip <a href="https://caniuse.com/brotli">and even brotli</a>, so minification is not so much of an issue. Your CDN should anyways be optimizing compression of your static assets.</p><p>Another point being that React is over 100kb when minified (including React DOM because you can't do that much without it). Imagine how much unminified code you could fit in 100kb if you used something that doesn't need to be built at all.</p><h2 id="react-is-not-just-a-view-rendering-library-anymore">React is not just a view rendering library anymore</h2><p>React used to be only a good frontend rendering library with JSX. Nowadays you're signing up for a framework with its own plugin ecosystem, hooks, fibers, suspense, and other obscure future features like <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html">server components</a>.</p><p>We've changed from doing <em>model-view-controller</em> to using all-consuming views that perform both business logic and create side effects. Views have become the top-level entity that controls everything else.</p><p>Remember the old saying "UI is a function of state"? React used to be a good implementation of this, but nowadays it's more of "UI that handles your state".</p><p>I think a good view rendering library should do just one thing well: Render the UI based on the app's state. It should not care where the state is, and most importantly it should not handle the state itself. Otherwise we'll end up with things like bloated class components or <em>"suddenly global state and black magic is fine"</em> type of hooks inside otherwise pure functions.</p><p>Instead you should be handling your business logic, side effects and data gathering some place else, and use proper separation of concerns to model your application's logic.</p><h2 id="imagine-a-better-world">Imagine a better world</h2><p>So how would a better React alternative look in 2021? I made a small prototype library called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/longwood">Longwood</a> based on above principles, and a hello world looks like this:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"app"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>script</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"module"</span>&gt;</span><span>
      <span>import</span> { div, text } <span>from</span> <span>'https://cdn.skypack.dev/longwood'</span>

      <span>const</span> render = div(text(<span>'Hello world!'</span>))
      render(<span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'app'</span>))
    </span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>body</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/unruffled-star-xs16e?file=/index.html">▶️ Try it out at CodeSandbox.io</a></p><p>That's all the code you need. No precompilation, no build steps, no downloading of 2.5 million lines of code to get started. You can open a text editor, save the code as an <code>index.html</code> file, open it in a browser and it works.</p><p>You have the same power of Javascript to compose your views as with React, and there's a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/longwood-usestate">separate state management library</a> to get started if you're coming from React. But moreover <em>it's okay to handle your state however you want</em>. It's just a rendering library. It can be used for just a small portion of your site if you want. It even supports server-side rendering out of the box (with jsdom).</p><p>Since you're going to ask, here are a couple of examples:</p><ul><li><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/competent-swartz-beoub?file=/src/TodoComponent.ts">React style Todo app</a></li><li><a href="https://links.thejunkland.com/">Rendering 1000+ rows of data with Longwood</a><ul><li><a href="https://links.thejunkland.com/react/">Same example done with create-react-app</a></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="to-wrap-up">To wrap up</h2><p>We’ve come a long way since the web 2.0 times. jQuery made the world a better place by making DOM manipulation easier. AngularJS made the world a better place by introducing data binding to the masses. But all great increments seem to fade at some point to welcome better alternatives.</p><p>Will the future be bright for Longwood? I have no idea, it’s a single-person project and at the moment has one production site running on it. But I hope it demonstrates a point that we can do things even better in the future if we keep innovating and cherry-picking the good stuff from others.</p><p>Happy hacking.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22What%20React%20gets%20wrong%22%20by%20@luotojesse%20https://thejunkland.com/blog/what-react-gets-wrong.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweet</a></p></article></div></div>]]>

                    <h2 id="and-their-influence-on-dark">And their influence on Dark</h2><p><br>After two decades of coding professionally in a dozen languages, I’ve come to a conclusion about static and dynamic types:</p><ul><li>Static types help you ensure that your changes work, especially for changes that span large parts of the program. This leads to long-term productivity gains from reduction in errors, as well as code that works better.</li><li>The lack of static types in dynamic languages allows you to prototype quicker and iterate faster. It also makes your code more readable.</li></ul><p>The result is a productivity quagmire. Static languages bring the cost of type-safety to every line of code that is written, slowing development of new features and concepts. Dynamic languages’ lack of type safety produces significant costs down the line, eating the productivity benefit of the early quick prototyping.</p><p>In Dark, we want the advantages of both. We want to take a type-safe core with long-term productivity gains and risk-reduction, and use tooling to enable the quick prototyping and readable code that you get from dynamic languages.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/darklang/the-design-of-dark-59f5d38e52d2" rel="noopener">Dark</a> has a number of features that are different from regular programming languages. A quick intro:</p><ul><li>Dark’s goal is to remove accidental complexity from coding. We want you to write backend services quickly and safely, with little to no overhead.</li><li>Dark is for building backends — you typically write HTTP handlers and we handle the deployment and infrastructure.</li><li>Dark combines an editor, language and infrastructure, and we use the tight integration to overcome common limitations in programming languages.</li><li>Dark doesn’t have a compilation step or separate compiler/interpreter. Instead, the editor updates with errors and warnings as you type (it also prevents syntax errors and some type errors).</li><li>Dark is designed for continuous delivery — the practice of frequently making small, low-risk changes. Code that you write is deployed to “production” (typically behind a feature flag) immediately after being written.</li></ul><p>Statically-typed functional languages (hereafter FPs, with apologies to Lispers) are amazing. They have a property that exists almost nowhere else: once it compiles, it usually works first try. We obviously want this property in Dark, so we made Dark a statically-typed functional language.</p><p><em><em>(If you’re already very familiar with statically-typed functional languages, you can </em></em><a href="https://medium.com/darklang/real-problems-with-functional-languages-efe668c5264a" rel="noopener"><em><em>skip this section</em></em></a><em><em> without missing much.)</em></em></p><h2 id="type-safety">Type safety</h2><p>In FPs, the compiler checks if all the types line up, and if you’ve handled every possible edge case about your type. When you make a change, the compiler tells you every single place you need to change, which you need to figure out for yourself in dynamic languages. Importantly, that safety comes for free — you don’t have to write millions of unit tests to get it. The result is that small changes across large scale systems are pretty risk free. You can still get the logic wrong, but the plumbing is guaranteed to behave as expected.</p><h2 id="nulls">Nulls</h2><p>In almost every non-FP language, including Java, C, C++, Go, Python, Ruby, PHP, Erlang, Javascript, Clojure, Scala, SQL, C#, and Objective-C, any value can be null, and it can be extremely challenging to reason about whether a particular variable is or isn’t null in practice. Nulls cause program crashes when functions and methods are called on them, when they are indexed, and when their fields are accessed.</p><pre><code>function leadPlayer(players) {
  if (players.length &lt;= 0)
    return null;
  return players[0];
}
function chooseCaptain(players) {
  // throw a NullPointerException if the `players` list is empty.
  leadPlayer(players).setCaptain(true);
}</code></pre><p>In the Java/Javascript-ish code above, the type system doesn’t protect against the NullPointerException when we expected an object but get a null.</p><p>FPs replace nulls with an Option type (called <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/error_handling/maybe.html" rel="noopener nofollow">Maybe in Elm</a> and <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Maybe" rel="noopener nofollow">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://learning-rust.github.io/docs/e3.option_and_result.html" rel="noopener nofollow">Option in Rust</a>, <a href="https://danielwestheide.com/blog/2012/12/19/the-neophytes-guide-to-scala-part-5-the-option-type.html" rel="noopener nofollow">Scala</a>, and <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/guided-tour.html#scrollNav-3-3" rel="noopener nofollow">OCaml</a>/<a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/the-option-type/" rel="noopener nofollow">F#</a>, and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/swift-optionals-explained-simply-e109a4297298" rel="noopener nofollow">Optional in Swift</a>). The Option type encodes in the type system that a value can be null. If the value is not an Option, then it cannot be null.</p><p>Every time you have an Option, the compiler requires you to handle both potential cases: if it is a real value, or if it’s not. Since the compiler won’t let you access a field or index or call a method on a null value, that entire class of errors is removed.</p><pre><code>function leadPlayer(players) {
  match players with
  | [] -&gt;
    return Nothing
  | head :: rest -&gt; // an array with 1 or more elements
    return (Just head)
}
function chooseCaptain(players) {
  match leadPlayer(players) with
  | Just player -&gt;
      player.setCaptain(true); // we know this can't be null
  | Nothing -&gt;
      // don't throw an exception
}</code></pre><p>As we can see, the FP version of the same code requires the <code>null</code> (called <code>Nothing</code> in our examples) to be handled.</p><h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2><p>Similarly, in most languages, any operation can cause an exception. Even Java with its checked exceptions has a category of exceptions (RuntimeExceptions) that can happen anywhere, including the beloved <code>NullPointerException</code>. Exceptions are so pervasive that it’s basically impossible to have a single line of code that is known to be exception-free — and even if it is, you won’t have a compiler to tell you that.</p><p>Here’s an example of some simple Python code that will throw an exception if <code>a</code>or <code>b</code>are strings which are not valid ints:</p><pre><code>sum = int(a) + int(b);</code></pre><p>FPs commonly use a Result type instead of exceptions (or C/Go error codes). A Result is a value which is either a valid value or an error. Like the Option type, the compiler sees every Result and requires you to handle the potential error, knowing that you cannot do your regular type operations on an error.</p><p>Here’s the same in an Elm-like language with result types. As you can see, this requires you to handle both the errors of <code>a</code>and <code>b</code>.</p><pre><code>match String.toInt a, String.toInt b with
| Ok a, Ok b -&gt;
    sum = a + b
| _ -&gt;
    Debug.log(“Error parsing integers);
    sum = 0</code></pre><p>By removing both nulls and exceptions, FPs remove a huge set of possible errors, and allow developers the safety of knowing that their programs work. Most importantly, that knowledge comes from automatic tooling, not manually writing test cases.</p><h2 id="implementation-in-dark">Implementation in Dark</h2><p>Dark takes influence from FPs, and Dark programs are fully type-checked. Dark’s type system allows us to find everywhere that a change needs to propagate, and tells you whether your types line up or not.</p><p>We also use Results and Options instead of exceptions and nulls, to avoid all the problems that come from those language features.</p><p>Unfortunately, these benefits come with significant frustrations and downsides, which current functional languages have — in our opinion — poor solutions for.</p><h2 id="type-checking-in-dark">Type checking in Dark</h2><p>In most FP compilers, your whole program either compiles or it doesn’t, making it difficult to make small scale changes. If I’m programming in Python, and I want to test out a quick hacky change in some component, I can do that immediately to discover whether the hack will even solve my problem.</p><p>Not so in FP. If I change a type in a FP, it might take me an hour to change every use of that type so that my program can even compile. And that’s assuming I’m stubbing out any logic that I don’t want to handle just yet. There’s little I find more frustrating than discovering in step 2 that the type changes I diligently propagated in step 1 were wrong and that I wasted the last hour.</p><p>Dark is designed for continuous delivery. As such, we don’t like requiring you to make large scale changes across your program, like changing a type everywhere. Instead, we want you to quickly discover that bad ideas won’t work, without first requiring you to propagate the type changes throughout your program.</p><p>Dark has a deliberately small compilation unit (the amount of code which is compiled together, and therefore which must be type checked together). You can make changes in a single HTTP route without having to make it type check with the rest of your program. This lowers the amount of type changes that you need to make to test out a single change.</p><p>The way this works is that you don’t actually change types in Dark. Instead, you make a copy of the type, and make your changes on that new copy. This allows you to prototype with the new type and test your change easily, making cheap iterations (and new types) as you try out new ideas. Once you are confident in your new type, you replace the uses of the old type (with semi-automated tooling to handle all the changes, including changes that are way down the call-stack).</p><p>As a result, you get the benefits of type checking, along with the benefits of cheap prototyping and quick iteration.</p><h2 id="option-result-types-in-dark">Option/Result types in Dark</h2><p>If I want to use a value wrapped in an Option or Result, I must first unwrap it, and then handle the failure case. This ensures that my code handles all errors and edge cases, but also adds costs to prototyping and iteration. If I want to make a quick hack in Python or Javascript, I can ignore nulls and errors on the first pass as I prototype and develop my algorithm. Not so with static types — in fact, often I’m forced to do low-level restructuring of my code to handle Options and Results.</p><p>Consider the code I have to add to my prototype in our Elm-like example:</p><pre><code>match String.toInt a, String.toInt b with
| Ok a, Ok b -&gt;
  sum = a + b
| _ -&gt;
  Debug.log(“Error parsing integers);
  sum = 0</code></pre><p>The Python code was significantly faster to write (though it has bugs that we want to ignore during our prototype).</p><p>Dark uses a concept from <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">Scott Wlaschin</a> called “<a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/" rel="noopener nofollow">Railway Oriented Programming</a>” to reduce this complexity. ROP is a metaphor where the error values of Results and Options form an alternate execution path through the program, called an Error Rail. When an error happens, the execution in the main body stops and instead passes over to the Error Rail.</p><p>Dark takes the ROP metaphor and makes a literal version of it in our editor. If you call a function in Dark that returns a <code>Nothing</code>(the name of the null-ish value of our Option type), …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Choose the simple and good process over the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/06/productivity-porn/">complicated and perfect</a> process. The value of universal understanding outweighs the value of accounting for every possible edge case and gotcha.</p>



<p>I like to talk about processes in terms of <em><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/22/power-in-naming-things/">recite-ability</a></em>. If everyone involved in the process can’t recite it off the top of their head, try to simplify it. </p>



<p>Look at the humble Kanban board with <em>Todo</em>, <em>Doing</em>, and <em>Done</em> columns. Everyone knows which column their ticket should be in. There are only 3 of them! Simple!</p>



<p>That’s why we should think long and hard before adding that <em>In Review</em> column or the <em>Awaiting Deploy</em> column. Those should only be created when <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/17/stop-solving-problems-nobody-complained-about/">not having them becomes <em>torture</em></a>. Each one makes the process that much less recite-able. If a team’s board has so many columns that the average team member can’t recite them all from memory, that’s trouble.</p>



<p>The 80/20 rule applies, as always. If I can get 80% of the value of a process with 20% of the complexity, then that’s a tradeoff I’ll take almost every time. Of course there are exceptions, but I find that they aren’t as common as we’d expect. </p>



<p>I know it feels safer to account for everything so that there’s nothing left open to interpretation. But then we’ve just replaced one problem (“if X is true the we’ll have to do Y manually and that allows for human error!”) with <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/10/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-in-software-development/">a worse problem</a> (“nobody <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">deeply understands this</a> so they’re making mistakes or ignoring it altogether”).</p>



<p>One of my favorite rules for <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">spotting broken processes</a> is: <em>when times get tough, if people run away from the process instead of towards it, it’s broken</em>. And when people are freaking out, they run away from complexity and towards simplicity.</p>



<p>So strive for simple. A simple process is a happy process.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><span> The <a href="https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Google Titan Security Key</i></a> is a FIDO U2F hardware device proposed by Google (available since July 2018) as a two-factor authentication token to sign in to applications (e.g. your Google account). Our work describes a side-channel attack that targets the <i>Google Titan Security Key</i>’s secure element (the NXP A700X chip) by the observation of its local electromagnetic radiations during ECDSA signatures (the core cryptographic operation of the FIDO U2F protocol). In other words, an attacker can create a clone of a legitimate <i>Google Titan Security Key</i>.</span></p>

<p><span> To understand the NXP ECDSA implementation, find a vulnerability and design a key-recovery attack, we had to make a quick stop on <i>Rhea</i> (NXP J3D081 JavaCard smartcard). Freely available on the web, this product looks very much like the NXP A700X chip and uses the same cryptographic library. <i>Rhea</i>, as an open JavaCard platform, gives us more control to study the ECDSA engine.</span></p>

<p><span> We could then show that the electromagnetic side-channel signal bears partial information about the ECDSA ephemeral key. The sensitive information is recovered with a non-supervised machine learning method and plugged into a customized lattice-based attack scheme.</span></p>

<p><span> Finally, 4000 ECDSA observations were enough to recover the (known) secret key on <i>Rhea</i> and validate our attack process. It was then applied on the <i>Google Titan Security Key</i> with success (this time by using 6000 observations) as we were able to extract the long term ECDSA private key linked to a FIDO U2F account created for the experiment.</span></p>

<h3>Cautionary Note</h3>
<p><span> Two-factor authentication tokens (like FIDO U2F hardware devices) primary goal is to fight phishing attacks. Our attack requires physical access to the <i>Google Titan Security Key</i>, expensive equipment, custom software, and technical skills.</span></p>

<p><span> <b>Thus, as far as our study goes, it is still safer to use your <i>Google Titan Security Key</i> or other impacted products as FIDO U2F two-factor authentication token to sign in to applications rather than not using one.</b></span></p>

<p><span> Nevertheless, this work shows that the <i>Google Titan Security Key</i> (and other impacted products) would not avoid unnoticed security breach by attackers willing to put enough effort into it. Users that face such a threat should probably switch to other FIDO U2F hardware security keys, where no vulnerability has yet been discovered.</span></p>

<h3>Discovered By</h3>
<p><span> Victor lomné (NinjaLab) and Thomas Roche (NinjaLab).<br>
with the help of Camille Mutschler (NinjaLab) and Dr. Laurent Imbert (LIRMM, CNRS).</span></p>

<h3>List of Impacted Products</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google Titan Security Key (all versions) </li>
<li> Yubico Yubikey Neo </li>
<li> Feitian FIDO NFC USB-A / K9 </li>
<li> Feitian MultiPass FIDO / K13 </li>
<li> Feitian ePass FIDO USB-C / K21 </li>
<li> Feitian FIDO NFC USB-C / K40 </li>
<li> NXP J3D081_M59_DF and variants </li>

<li> NXP J3E145_M64 and variants </li>
<li> NXP J3E081_M64_DF and variants </li>
</ul>


<h3>Further Notes</h3>
<p><span>
1. The impacted Yubico Yubikey Neo is an old product no more available for sale. All FIDO U2F Yubico Yubikeys currently available on their webstore are based on a newer secure element from Infineon, and are not impacted by our work to our knowledge.
</span></p>
<p><span>
2. The NXP P5 / SmartMX secure microcontroller family and its associated cryptographic library (up to v2.9) impacted by our work is quite old. Since, NXP has released two new generations of secure microcontroller families, the “NXP P60 / SmartMX2” family and now the “NXP P70 / SmartMX3” family. Both are Common Criteria certified (with recent certification process), and are not impacted by our work to our knowledge.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Billions of dollars in Bitcoin are stolen every year.&nbsp; If you’re a victim of Bitcoin theft or a scam, read this article first.</p>
<p>I will tell you why most “recovery” services are scams, and what you should actually do.</p>
<h3><strong>Can a Bitcoin recovery service help get my stolen Bitcoin/Ethereum/etc back?</strong></h3>
<p>The first and most important thing you should know is <strong>that there is absolutely no way to reverse confirmed Bitcoin/cryptocurrency transactions</strong>.&nbsp; Once a transaction is confirmed on the Blockchain, there is no way to reverse it.</p>
<p><strong>Beware of “Bitcoin recovery” scams</strong></p>
<p>There are many “Bitcoin recovery” services that claim to be able to return stolen Bitcoin.&nbsp; They will have all kinds of explanations of how they do this.</p>
<p>Here is a debunking of the most common recovery methods:</p>
<h3><strong>Lawyers:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they promise: </strong>we will prosecute thieves and force them to return stolen Bitcoin</p>
<p><strong>Why it won’t work:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In almost all cases, you won’t know the identity of the people who stole your Bitcoin. It’s nearly impossible to find out the real-world identity of the owner of a given Bitcoin address.</p>
<p>Even if you have a name, email address, “registered trading account,” website, etc, it will be very difficult to obtain the cooperation of the police in getting their real-world identity.</p>
<p>The police don’t care about “small scale” theft. In most cases, the thieves will be in a different country than you.&nbsp; Furthermore, unlike cash, there is no paper trail to follow.&nbsp; Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is generally considered “property” rather than money, and hacking isn’t given the same weight as theft of physical goods.&nbsp; All of this makes authorities unlikely to pursue cases.</p>
<p>Even when the identity of the thieves is definitely known, the Bitcoin is rarely returned. The only cases where Bitcoin has been recovered in theft has been in a class-action lawsuit (such as with Mt Gox). Even then, it usually takes thousands of victims, at least tens of millions of dollars stolen, expensive attorneys, and many years.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s impossible. Just don’t expect to send a random lawyer $5000-$10,000 (typical “recovery” fees) and anything useful to happen. It’s a scam.</p>
<h3><strong>“Ethical hackers”</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they promise:</strong> we will hack the thieves and get them to return your Bitcoin.</p>
<p><strong>Why it won’t work:</strong></p>
<p>First, anyone who was able to steal your money is already a sophisticated hacker. Most “hackers” prey on the technologically ignorant.&nbsp; Anyone capable of stealing your Bitcoin probably knows the tricks of so-called “ethical hackers”.</p>
<p>Second, it’s nearly impossible to find out the real-world identity from a Bitcoin address or an email address.&nbsp; If the U.S. government struggles to find find out who operates darknet markets, what hope has some hacker you paid $1000?</p>
<p>Third, even an “ethical hacker” has to break into someone else’s systems — and probably break some laws in the process. If they could someone break into people’s computers to get their Bitcoin, why should they return it to you?&nbsp; Why do they need you at all?&nbsp; If they can hack people’s computers to steal Bitcoin, they are just as likely to steal yours.</p>
<p>There are no credible, independent reports of anyone successfully doing this. “Ethical hackers” that return Bitcoin for cash upfront simply do not exist.&nbsp; It’s a scam.</p>
<h3><strong>Blockchain hackers</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they promise:</strong> we will hack Bitcoin or brute force your private key to reverse the transaction and return your Bitcoin.</p>
<p><strong>Why it won’t work:</strong></p>
<p>The market cap of Bitcoin is nearly $700 billion dollars.&nbsp; Every single Bitcoin transaction and address is public.&nbsp; If someone could steal or reverse a Bitcoin transaction, they wouldn’t be helping you.&nbsp; <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/rich-list/">They would be going after the richest Bitcoin wallets worth tens of billions of dollars.</a> Of course, once it got out that Bitcoin could be hacked, the exploit would either be patched, or Bitcoin would become worthless.</p>
<p>No matter how brilliant they claim to be, it’s a scam.</p>
<h3><strong>Chainalysis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they claim:</strong> we will trace Bitcoin transaction to the service holding them, and force them to return your money.</p>
<p><strong>Why it won’t work:</strong></p>
<p>Chainalysis is a real thing.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/">There are companies</a> that keep databases of addresses used by criminals and gambling sites, and help exchanges ban those customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, they can’t help you for a few reasons:</p>
<p>First, they have expensive products for businesses and governments than the random recovery service you found online probably doesn’t have access to.</p>
<p>Second, the most they can do is trace which major exchange or business got your Bitcoin.&nbsp; At this point, you would need the cooperation of the exchange to tell you which customer made that deposit.&nbsp; That cooperation is impossible to obtain without a court order, which as previously explained is nearly impossible to obtain.&nbsp; Furthermore, thieves don’t use cooperative exchanges in the first place, since they require <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Know_your_customer">KYC. </a>If they want to cash out, they are going to use some less-reputable service in a country that probably does not cooperate with your government.</p>
<p>Third, once your crypto hits an exchange, it’s impossible to trace what a given customer does with it next.&nbsp; If someone simply deposits Bitcoin with an exchange, you will never know when they take it out or move it.&nbsp; This is because exchanges combine all their funds, so your stolen Bitcoin will be given to whoever requests a withdrawal first.&nbsp; It will not be withdrawn by the person who deposited it.</p>
<p>Fourth, criminals don’t keep Bitcoin at exchanges.&nbsp; In my experience, they will either sit on it for years or cash it out immediately. They are not stupid enough to keep it where it can be confiscated, however unlikely that is.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>It is nearly impossible to return your stolen cryptocurrency.&nbsp; Don’t lose more of your money in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Am I wrong?&nbsp; Are there other “recovery” methods I forgot to mention? Please let me know below.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>So what should I do?</strong></h3>
<p>First, there is a small qualification that <strong>unconfirmed transactions can be reversed or canceled</strong>.&nbsp; In a few cases, I’ve been able to reverse transactions that haven’t confirmed yet.&nbsp; It’s rare and requires immediate action.&nbsp; Usually, this happens with wallets that receive mining payments, as they require much higher fees to confirm.</p>
<p>Second, if your Bitcoin keys, logins, seed, etc have been leaked or exposed, but the thieves have not yet sent it away, you must act <strong>immediately&nbsp;</strong>to transfer it to a new private wallet.</p>
<p>Third, realize that if someone has stolen your Bitcoin, you may still be vulnerable to theft. You probably did something wrong or were exploited by someone who can do it again.</p>
<p>Don’t go out and buy more Bitcoin.&nbsp; You need to <a href="https://walletrecovery.info/ten-essential-security-practices-to-keep-your-bitcoin-safe/">perform a security audit</a> to understand how it was stolen. You may have a keylogger tracking all your keystrokes, or a root exploit that allows someone to access all your files.&nbsp; Educate yourself. Learn about <a href="https://walletrecovery.info/watch-out-for-these-five-common-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-scams/">the most common cryptocurrency scams</a>. At a minimum,&nbsp; <a href="https://walletrecovery.info/how-to-safely-store-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies/">read my article on how to safely store Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>Fourth, make sure your crypto was really stolen.&nbsp; You should see a transaction to an address that does not belong to you on a date/time you did not make any transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://walletrecovery.info/contact-us/">If you’re not sure, ask for help</a></strong>.&nbsp; If you don’t see an outgoing transaction, it was probably not stolen – you’re doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Fifth, if your Bitcoin was stolen, and you held it before August 2017, check to see if the BCH/BSV forks have been claimed.&nbsp; Do this immediately, before the crooks do.</p>

<p>“[B]y coordinating more with Facebook, we’ll be able to do things like track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp.
And by connecting your phone number with Facebook’s systems, Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><small> Brian Acton and Jan Koum, August 2016<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></small></p>
<hr>

<p>WhatsApp started out full of dreams: “we want WhatsApp to be the product that keeps you awake…and that you reach for in the morning. No one jumps up from a nap and runs to see an advertisement”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. When they thought of WhatsApp, Brian Acton and Jan Koum were very keen on <em>not</em> selling our user data for targeted advertisement purposes. So they charged a nominal rate for the use of their service, rightfully pointing out the hidden cost of using free services.</p>
<p>In the year of 2014 however, WhatsApp was bought by Facebook, thus joining the social network’s happy and expanding family of venture capital investments, a family including Instagram, purchased in April 2012, and Oculus VR, purchased the month before. At the time, many, and with good reason, worried about the changes this acquisition could entail for WhatsApp. Eventually, in August 2016, WhatsApp users everywhere learned about what was in fact unavoidable. The company that built its reputation upon an ad-free ethic, would now be sharing private user information with Facebook, its parent company. So we, the users, are the product after all, and as expected, this is presented in the form of an <em>improvement</em> of the user experience. Thanks to the tighter coordination between WhatsApp and Facebook, we can now more easily find our friends or see more valuable messages from the companies that truly matter to us. Of course, small footnote, these ‘benefits’ comes at the price of sharing our phone number and other private data with Facebook—though, trusting their word, not the content of the messages themselves.</p>
<p>Facebook does this for the simple reason that it needs to increase its market share on mobile devices<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>; the family of Whatsapp, Facebook and Instagram are all <em>different</em> channels leading to this same purpose. One of the consequences of this is that while Facebook’s chat function can still be used on their mobile website, plans are that we will soon be forced to install Facebook Messenger should we wish to continue using it on our mobile phones<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. Once again, in a stroke of pure genius and creativity, this move is being marketed as a way to provide us with the best experience ever.  And we can use it with just a phone number, we don’t even need a Facebook account. That way, their user base expands along with their profits.</p>
<p>Every time there is a breach of user trust —read: a change in the Terms of Service— or news regarding network surveillance, people are on the lookout for an alternative, and rightfully so. In these moments there are many also willing to promote such <em>alternatives</em>, usually in the form of yet another disruptive app.  After the purchase of Whatsapp, for example, Telegram was advertised as the alternative. After it became clear that Telegram had dreadful security, people promoted Viber. Then Snapchat, then Threema, then Allo and now Signal. There is a reason why we’re falling into this pattern of needing alternatives to the alternatives. And that is because…</p>

<p>There’s a tendency to oversimplify the issues related to the use of these apps as merely a privacy matter, and not even that is sufficiently addressed. While each of the aforementioned apps are alternative companies and brands, what these alternatives all have in common is that they share the same model. A model that revolves around centralized services, vendor lock-in and marketing related surveillance, and all of that within a neoliberal context of the free market. These alternatives therefore promote themselves as more than just an alternative, but also as competing products, usually highlighting a particular feature lacking in rivals’ products. Remember that ill-fated, super cool, nice looking alternative to Facebook, Ello? It gained a lot of traction out of legitimate concerns with Facebook’s modus operandi, promoting itself as an alternative for its nice features and its promise not to use advertising. But as Aral Balkan was quick to point out, allowing investments by venture capital firms meant the project was dead before it really began<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>. Taking these investments, which allowed them to scale as a platform, also meant that they would, at some point, <em>have</em> to make a lot of money for their investors. How? By selling ad space or information about their users. The reason the pattern keeps repeating itself is not because the makers of these apps always secretly intended to sell your data while saying they wouldn’t. The reason is that they have no choice within the economic system they choose to operate in.</p>

<p>The latest competitive feature—one might even say, marketing trick—to make concerned users switch from one alternative to another is cryptography, the act of coding messages during communication. This strategy works well because the vast majority of people are not really informed when it comes down to the technicalities of cryptography, so this discourse mostly serves to throw bedazzling sparkles in our eyes. To be sure, cryptography is fundamental for privacy. However, the main privacy threat in the context of using these apps isn’t the potential of a government eavesdropping on our communications. The privacy threat is the wholesale and increasing dependence on centralized services which revolve around the surveillance and monetization of user information. In 2016, both WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger enabled end-to-end encryption<a href="http://homebrewserver.club/beginners-guide-to-xmpp-speak.html#e2e"><sup>?</sup></a> to address increasing privacy concerns. Adding <em>crypto</em> to a communication app in this case merely obfuscates a concern about the hegemony of these platforms. In essence, the issue of privacy is much larger than just the lack of cryptography; the conditions that threaten privacy are structural and economic and not resolved by a <em>patch</em> or a new feature.</p>
<p>This issue is further stressed when looking at the question of metadata, that is to say, data about data, which in the case of communication applications is everything but the communication data itself. When WhatsApp started sharing, among other things, its users’ phone numbers with its parent company, Facebook, it went to great lengths to guarantee us that the content of our messages was still perfectly secure, impossible to be read by both WhatsApp and Facebook. The argument stating that “It’s only metadata, don’t worry” has been however debunked numerous times. Even though these platforms would love us to believe otherwise, metadata is neither a trivial disposable by-product, nor it is anonymous. And assuming that the crypto is sound and that the app running this crypto is not flawed, cross-referencing several databases containing metadata will always produce an array of very personal information, that in itself is much more valuable than encrypted naked selfies. Thus it should be no surprise that former NSA director Michael Hayden infamously said in 2012 “we kill based on metadata”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> and later argued in 2015 that metadata should be the main area of focus of surveillance activities, and not the creation of backdoors within crypto, or the banning of the latter<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In short, both Whatsapp and FacebookMessenger can afford to deploy end-to-end encryption for your messages because it won’t hurt their bottom line, which is making money based on the surveillance of your behavior and your social graph. Adding crypto thus merely patches your privacy worries, but not the threat to it.</p>

<p>The end-to-end encryption enabled in WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger has been developed by Open Whisper Systems, a non-profit run by crypto-celebrity Moxie Marlinspike. OWS also developed the algorithm for their own instant messaging application, Signal, and then open-sourced it. Signal itself is now the latest app being promoted as an alternative to WhatsApp and is hailed as the panacea of both security and usability. It even has the backing of members of the dissident elite such as Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>While OWS provides thorough expertise in the field of cryptography, Marlinspike is currently advocating centralisation as the only answer towards user-friendly, fast and secure messaging apps. Decentralisation, according to him, has no place in the modern world and apparently hampers innovation. However, some of his arguments have not remained unchallenged. In particular, where Marlinspike accuses federation of stalling evolution<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>, Daniel Gultsch<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> provides a counter argument by using the Web as an example of successfully federated system<a href="http://homebrewserver.club/beginners-guide-to-xmpp-speak.html#federated"><sup>?</sup></a>. Furthermore, Gultsch states that the problem is not that federation doesn’t adapt, but rather that there are problems with its implementation for a very significant reason: software developers working on federated systems mostly work for free in their spare time or with little means, given the difficulty to monetise a system which design can only succeed if it is open and can be appropriated easily beyond its original scope, and thus making its capitalisation particularly challenging. In that sense, the most interesting aspect of this debate is that while Marlinspike seems to defend his product from a technological perspective, Gultsch’s counter argument moves back the discussion to the context of political economy.</p>

<header><p>7 Jan 2021</p></header><p>Apple’s latest line of Macs includes their in-house “M1” system-on-chip, featuring a custom GPU. This poses a problem for those of us in the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux</a> project who wish to run Linux on our devices, as this custom Apple GPU has neither public documentation nor open source drivers. Some speculate it might descend from PowerVR GPUs, as used in older iPhones, while others believe the GPU to be completely custom. But rumours and speculations are no fun when we can peek under the hood ourselves!</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I purchased a Mac Mini with an M1 GPU as a development target to study the instruction set and command stream, to understand the GPU’s architecture at a level not previously publicly understood, and ultimately to accelerate the development of a Mesa driver for the hardware. Today I’ve reached my first milestone: I now understand enough of the instruction set to disassemble simple shaders with a free and open-source tool chain, <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/gpu">released on GitHub here</a>.</p>
<p>The process for decoding the instruction set and command stream of the GPU parallels the same process I used for reverse-engineering Mali GPUs in the Panfrost project, originally pioneered by the Lima, Freedreno, and Nouveau free software driver projects. Typically, for Linux or Android driver reverse-engineering, a small wrap library will be written to inject into a test application via <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> that hooks key system calls like <code>ioctl</code> and <code>mmap</code> in order to analyze user-kernel interactions. Once the “submit command buffer” call is issued, the library can dump all (mapped) shared memory for offline analysis.</p>
<p>The same overall process will work for the M1, but there are some macOSisms that need to be translated. First, there is no <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on macOS; the equivalent is <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code>, which has some extra security features which are easy enough to turn off for our purposes. Second, while the standard Linux/BSD system calls do exist on macOS, they are not used for graphics drivers. Instead, Apple’s own <code>IOKit</code> framework is used for both kernel and userspace drivers, with the critical entry point of <code>IOConnectCallMethod</code>, an analogue of <code>ioctl</code>. These differences are easy enough to paper over, but they do add a layer of distance from the standard Linux tooling.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is orienting ourselves in the IOKit world. Since Linux is under a copyleft license, (legal) kernel drivers are open source, so the <code>ioctl</code> interface is public, albeit vendor-specific. macOS’s kernel (XNU) being under a permissive license brings no such obligations; the kernel interface is proprietary and undocumented. Even after wrapping <code>IOConnectCallMethod</code>, it took some elbow grease to identify the three critical calls: memory allocation, command buffer creation, and command buffer submission. Wrapping the allocation and creation calls is essential for tracking GPU visible memory (what we are interested in studying), and wrapping the submission call is essential for timing the memory dump.</p>
<p>With those obstacles cleared, we can finally get to the shader binaries, black boxes in themselves. However, the process from here on out is standard: start with the simplest fragment or compute shader possible, make a small change in the input source code, and compare the output binaries. Iterating on this process is tedious but will quickly reveal key structures, including opcode numbers.</p>
<p>The findings of the process documented in the free software disassembler confirm a number of traits of the GPU:</p>
<p>One, this is a scalar architecture. Unlike some GPUs that are scalar for 32-bits but vectorized for 16-bits, the M1’s GPU is scalar at all bit sizes. Yet Metal optimization resources imply 16-bit arithmetic should be significantly faster, in addition to a reduction of register usage leading to higher thread count (occupancy). This suggests the hardware is superscalar, with more 16-bit ALUs than 32-bit ALUs, allowing the part to benefit from low-precision graphics shaders much more than competing chips can, while removing a great deal of complexity from the compiler.</p>
<p>Two, this seems to handle scheduling in hardware, common among desktop GPUs but less so in the embedded space. This again makes the compiler simpler at the expense of more hardware. Instructions seem to have minimal encoding overhead, unlike other architectures which need to pad out instructions with <em>nop</em>’s to accommodate highly constrained instruction sets.</p>
<p>Three, various modifiers are supported. Floating point ALUs can do clamps (saturate), negates, and absolute value modifiers “for free”, a common shader architecture trait. Further, most (all?) instructions can type-convert between 16-bit and 32-bit “for free” on both the destination and the sources, which allows the compiler to be much more aggressive about using 16-bit operations without risking conversion overheads. On the integer side, various bitwise complements and shifts are allowed on certain instructions for free. None of this is unique to Apple’s design, but it’s worth noting all the same.</p>
<p>Finally, not all ALU instructions have the same timing. Instructions like <code>imad</code>, used to multiply two integers and add a third, are avoided in favour of repeated <code>iadd</code> integer addition instructions where possible. This also suggests a superscalar architecture; software-scheduled designs like those I work on for my day job cannot exploit differences in pipeline length, inadvertently slowing down simple instructions to match the speed of complex ones.</p>
<p>From my prior experience working with GPUs, I continue to expect to find some eldritch horror waiting in the instruction set, to balloon compiler complexity. Though the above work currently covers only a small surface area of the instruction set, so far everything seems sound. There are no convoluted optimization tricks, but doing away with the trickery is creating a streamlined, efficient design that does one thing and does it well. Maybe Apple’s hardware engineers discovered it’s hard to beat simplicity.</p>
<p>Alas, a shader tool chain isn’t much use without an open-source userspace driver. Next up: dissecting the command stream!</p>

  <article>
	<header>

	</header>

		<p>
		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-sources.png" alt="Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, showing a lot of inlined unreadable scripts">
			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product / Company / Business landing page and marketing sites</li>
			<li>Personal portfolio / bio</li>
			<li>Blog</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from a REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can I minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

    One Day on Slack...</h2><blockquote>
<p>1.3gb for a web app?! The size of your Docker image is getting out of control!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh-oh... The infrastructure team is <em>calling you out</em> for your Docker image size! Larger images means...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/">Garbage collection of stale images &amp; containers</a> takes longer*</li>
<li>Node storage runs out faster*</li>
<li>It takes longer to build the image</li>
<li>It takes longer to send the image over the wire</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are small problems but <strong>they add up!</strong> So your image is too big–don't panic! Following a few simple steps, you can cut your Docker image down to size in next to no time.</p>
<p>*<em>this post assumes you are running Docker images in Kubernetes.</em></p>

    </a>
    Analyzing Your Image</h2><p>How big is your image? Assuming you've run <code>docker build</code> to build your image locally, this is easy to check with <code>docker images</code>:</p>
<pre><code>➜ docker images
REPOSITORY                           TAG      IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE
gcr.io/ns-1/toodle-app               d82c28d  e4f0fd00de6d  4 months ago  1.32GB
gcr.io/ns-2/go-af                    v0.12.1  d665db43eb95  4 months ago  911MB
</code></pre>
<p>Our <code>toodle-app</code> image is <code>1.32 GB</code>. But why is it so big? To figure that out, we'll use a handy tool called <a href="https://github.com/wagoodman/dive">dive</a> to analyze the image layer by layer.</p>
<pre><code>➜ dive gcr.io/ns-1/toodle-app:d82c28d
Image Source: docker://gcr.io/ns-1/toodle-app:d82c28d
Fetching image... (this can take a while for large images)
</code></pre>
<p>When it completes it will show a view like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://sequoia.makes.software/img/docker-dive-1.png" alt="dive command output"></p>
<p>There's a lot going on here!</p>
<ul>
<li>The top-left panel shows you <strong>layers</strong>, each of which corresponds to a Dockerfile command. (If the command if it's truncated, find the <em>full</em> command below in the "Layer Details" section.)</li>
<li>The right column shows the filesystem tree for the <strong>currently selected layer</strong>–more on this later</li>
<li>The bottom left is <strong>Image Details</strong> and does not change as you navigate through the layers</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the arrow keys to navigate up and down in the currently selected pane. Use <code>tab</code> to switch from the Layers pane to Current Layer Contents and back. Here I've pressed the down arrow several times to get to the 309 MB <code>RUN make build/bin/server</code> layer, then used <code>tab</code> to switch focus to the Current Layer Contents panel:</p>
<p><img src="https://sequoia.makes.software/img/docker-dive-2.png" alt="dive command output: &quot;RUN make build/bin/server&quot; layer"></p>
<p>By default, the Current Layer Contents shows you a full tree of the filesystem up to and including the selected layer. What's typically more useful when analyzing your image size by layer is to see what files were added by <em>that</em> layer. Use <code>ctrl+u</code> (see "^U Unmodified" in the bottom right of the screenshot) to toggle that option <em>off</em>, which <strong>hides files unmodified by the current layer</strong>. This leaves visible only files that were Added, Removed, or Modified by <em>this</em> layer:</p>
<p><img src="https://sequoia.makes.software/img/docker-dive-3.png" alt="dive command output: &quot;RUN make build/bin/server&quot; layer with unmodified files hidden"></p>
<p>Hello, what's this–this layer (which runs <code>go build</code> to build the actual toodle-app binary) add 309MB, but 237MB of that is <a href="https://golang.org/ref/mod#module-cache">go mod cache</a>, which <strong>we do not need after the binary has been built!</strong></p>
<p>Now we know why this layer is larger than it should be and we can see about cleaning it up (we'll do this <a href="#remove-build-tools-and-assets-after-the-build-completes">below</a>). Repeat the process for other large layers, or just poke around and see what each layer is adding or modifying.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to figure out <em>why</em> it's big, let's look at some strategies to cut down an image's size...</p>
<h2 id="chopping-your-image-in-twain">
    <a href="#chopping-your-image-in-twain">
      
    </a>
    Chopping Your Image in Twain</h2><p>When we build a project inside a docker image, each of the things we pull or copy into that image falls into one of two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stuff we need to <strong>build</strong> the application</li>
<li>Stuff we need to <strong>run</strong> the application</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the things we add to our toodle-app image, above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>make</code>: needed to <strong>build</strong> the application</li>
<li><code>gcc</code>: needed to <strong>build</strong> the application</li>
<li>go modules: needed to <strong>build</strong> the application</li>
<li><code>nginx</code>: needed to <strong>run</strong> the application</li>
<li><code>./build/client/strings</code>: needed to <strong>run</strong> the application</li>
<li>the <code>build/bin/server</code> binary we create: needed to <strong>run</strong> the application</li>
</ul>
<p>The stuff we need only at build time (<code>make</code>, <code>gcc</code>, etc.) <strong>does not need to be shipped as part of the image</strong> because <strong>it is not needed at runtime</strong>. We could uninstall <code>make</code> <code>gcc</code> etc. after running the build, but there is an even cleaner way: <strong>create one image just for building the application and one image just for running the application</strong>.</p>
<p>This has become a common pattern, and there are two ways to do this:</p>
<h3 id="two-separate-docker-files-em-old-approach-should-not-be-needed-anymore-em-">
    <a href="#two-separate-docker-files-em-old-approach-should-not-be-needed-anymore-em-">
      
    </a>
    Two Separate Docker Files ❌ <em>(old approach, should not be needed anymore)</em></h3><p>With this approach you have one "builder" image and a separate "runtime" image. From a high level:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>Dockerfile.builder</code> Dockerfile defines your "builder" image. This builds an image based on....</li>
<li>A <em>separate</em> runtime <code>Dockerfile</code> contains <em>only</em> runtime dependencies</li>
</ol>
<p>Your CI step (e.g. on Google Cloud Build) loads the "Builder" image and <em>runs docker inside that image</em> to produce your runtime image.</p>
<h3 id="multi-stage-builds-em-current-approach-use-this-one-em-em-em-">
    <a href="#multi-stage-builds-em-current-approach-use-this-one-em-em-em-">
      
    </a>
    Multi-Stage Builds ✅ <em>(current approach: use this one</em> 😄<em>)</em></h3><p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/">Multi-Stage Builds</a> vastly simplify this process! A multi-stage docker file has multiple <code>FROM</code> commands, the first one for the "builder" and the second one for the "runtime." Basically you install all the build dependencies in your builder, run your build, then in the runtime build you <code>COPY</code> the build artifact into your runtime image which you can then deploy.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>FROM</span> golang:<span>1.7</span>.<span>3</span> AS sequoiasbuilder
<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /tmp/foo
</span><span>COPY</span><span> src/main.go . 
</span>

go build -o my-application ./main.go



<span>FROM</span> alpine:latest 
<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /root/
</span>

<span>COPY</span><span> --from=sequoiasbuilder /tmp/foo/my-application .
</span><span>CMD</span><span> [<span>"./my-application"</span>]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now only those things necessary for runtime will be shipped to kubernetes, and the go binary (and all the go modules that <code>go build</code> pulled in) etc. are discarded! Read <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/">this short article</a> for more.</p>
<h3 id="which-one-to-use-a-note-on-layer-caching">
    <a href="#which-one-to-use-a-note-on-layer-caching">
      
    </a>
    Which one to use? A note on layer caching</h3><p>The main reason to use the "multiple dockerfiles" approach is because the underlying "builder" image can be built once and reused across many builds. But Docker image layers by default, so why would you need this? You would need this if <strong>your (<abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr>) build environment is discarding Docker image layers after each build</strong>, as Google Cloud Platform does by default. Discard docker images after each build = build from scratch each time.</p>
<p>There is a simple fix for this, however: the Kaniko builder allows layers to be <strong>stored, cached, and reused.</strong></p>
<p>❗️ On <abbr title="Google Cloud Build">GCB</abbr>, using Kaniko is recommended for <strong>both</strong> builder <strong>and</strong> multi-stage patterns. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/kaniko-cache">Read more.</a></p>
<h2 id="cleaning-up-image-contents">
    <a href="#cleaning-up-image-contents">
      
    </a>
    Cleaning Up Image Contents</h2><p>Assuming you don't go the Multi-Stage route (above), or even if you did, you may be able to reduce your image size by <strong>removing stuff you don't actually need</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="ensure-you-em-actually-need-em-everything-you-39-ve-added">
    <a href="#ensure-you-em-actually-need-em-everything-you-39-ve-added">
      
    </a>
    Ensure you <em>actually need</em> everything you've added</h3><p>Did you start building your dockerfile by copying an existing one? If so, perhaps you have a command like this near the top</p>
<pre><code><span>RUN</span><span> apk add --no-cache make git curl bash nginx pkgconfig zeromq-dev \
     gcc musl-dev autoconf automake build-base libtool python</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Check that you <em>actually need</em> all these things! Some may be cruft from another project, or the dependency may have been replaced. <strong>This is especially important if you're building off a shared "base" image file.</strong> When using a shared base image, it's very likely that there's stuff in there you don't need. Easy money!</p>
<h3 id="remove-build-tools-and-assets-after-the-build-completes">
    <a href="#remove-build-tools-and-assets-after-the-build-completes">
      
    </a>
    Remove build tools and assets after the build completes</h3><p>As we saw above using <code>dive</code>, the toodle-app <code>go build</code> was downloading <strong>and caching</strong> 237 MB of go modules, which were needed during the build but not after:</p>

    Remove static assets when possible</h3><p>You may have static assets in your image that rarely change and are not actually needed <em>within</em> the application. For example, the toodle-app image contains various reports and media assets:</p>

<p>It's not huge, but this is 62MB that gets pulled by the Kubernetes controller for <em>every</em> deployment and copied into <em>every</em> container (the image upon which this post is based was running on 268 containers at the time of writing), all of which need garbage collection... it adds up!!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><label>Jan 7, 2021 • 10 min read</label><h2>No Meetings, No Deadlines, No Full-Time Employees</h2><p>I started Gumroad in 2011. In 2015, we reached a peak of 23 full-time employees. In 2016, after <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">failing</a> to raise more money, I ended up back where I began: a one-person company.</p><p>Today, when I’m asked how many people work at Gumroad, I respond with “ten or so.” That’s how I convert the number of people we have into what others expect. But the truth is more complicated:</p><p>If we include everyone who works on Gumroad, it’s 25.</p><p>If we include full-time employees, it’s none. Not even me.</p><p>We have no meetings, and no deadlines either.</p><p>And it’s working: our creators earn over $175 million a year, and we generate $11 million in annualized revenue, growing 85% year-over-year.</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/2020-earnings.png"></p><p>That said, I don’t expect anyone to copy our way of working wholesale. We got here on accident, not some grand plan.</p><p>However, I do think there are pieces of our story and the way we work that could benefit other companies, their people, and–most importantly–their customers.</p><h2>Freedom at all costs</h2><p>After the layoffs in 2015, even though the team shrunk, Gumroad itself continued to grow.</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/2018-earnings.png"></p><p>But hiring people full-time and leasing a new office in San Francisco to work out of was untenable. Instead, I found an Indian firm called <a href="https://bigbinary.com/">BigBinary</a> and hired a few engineers as contractors.</p><p>These contractors saved the company. They fixed bugs and maintained the site while I answered support tickets, designed features, and wrote about new initatives.</p><p>Eventually, I hired back the same customer support person we had from before the layoffs, this time via an hourly contracting agreement too.</p><p>Meanwhile, I <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/bubble">moved to Utah</a> and attempted to become a full-time creator.</p><p>While Gumroad was no longer on track to become a billion-dollar company, I acquired a new asset: time. I used that time to take classes on writing and painting.</p><p>Because I was burned out and didn’t want to think about working any more than I needed to, I instituted a no-meeting, no-deadline culture.</p><p>For me, it was no longer about growth at all costs, but “freedom at all costs.”</p><p>This way, Gumroad stayed profitable, I could take a much-needed break to explore my hobbies, and the product continued to improve over time.</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/operating.png"></p><h2>How we work</h2><p>Today, working at Gumroad resembles working on an open source project like Rails. Except it’s neither open source, nor unpaid.</p><p>Instead of having meetings, people “talk” to each other via GitHub, Notion, and (occasionally) Slack, expecting responses within 24 hours. Because there are no standups or “syncs” and some projects can involve expensive feedback loops to collaborate, working this way requires clear and thoughtful communication.</p><p>Everyone writes well, and writes <em>a lot</em>.</p><p>There are no deadlines either. We ship incrementally, and launch things whenever the stuff in development is better than what’s currently in production. The occasional exception does exist, such as a tax deadline, but as a rule, I try not to tell anyone what to do or how fast to do it. When someone new joins the company, they do what everyone else does: go into our Notion queue, pick a task, and get to work, asking for clarification when needed.</p><p>Instead of setting quarterly goals or using OKRs, we move towards a single north star: maximizing how much money creators earn. It’s simple and measurable, allowing anyone in the company to do the math on how much a feature or bug-fix might be worth.</p><p>But we don’t prioritize ruthlessly.</p><p>People can work on what’s fun or rely on their intuition, because as long as we remain profitable and keep shipping, we tend to get to the important stuff eventually. Our <a href="https://www.notion.so/gumroad/Roadmap-ce2ad07c483046e7941227ad7810730d">public roadmap</a> helps Gumroad's creators hold us accountable.</p><p>We ship big things this way too.</p><p>In November 2020, we shipped <a href="https://gumroad.com/gumroad/p/introducing-gumroad-memberships">Gumroad Memberships</a>, a year in the works and now used by hundreds of creators to earn over $1,500,000 per month.</p><p>This is a screenshot from our roadmap to show what it looks like in practice:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/memberships-roadmap.png"></p><p>For more, I recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PcIC1DKBU0">an hour-long video</a> about how we ship something as large as Gumroad Memberships.</p><p>Gumroad engineer Helen Hood, who shipped Memberships, says, “it’s one of the biggest product launches of my career, and we shipped it without a single meeting or video call. I've worked at your typical startup, with an open floor plan, lots of whiteboards, standups and sprint planning, beers after work. I’ve also worked on a remote team with little communication and engineers largely siloed on their own projects. The way we work at Gumroad is ideal for me. It lets me maximize my productive hours, and clock out when I've hit my limit.”</p><p>Those are the broad strokes, but we’ve published more specific documentation about the way we work:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.notion.so/gumroad/How-do-we-decide-what-to-work-on-f2064b8ab16c4cbcac1077e16c8cf33b">How do we decide what to work on?</a><p>“At the end of the day there's a lot of emotion that goes into Gumroad, that's not dissimilar from an art project. We sometimes pick what's fun and feels good to work on! We love listening to creators! We don't do tons of data analysis to decide what's worth working on.”</p></li><li><a href="https://www.notion.so/gumroad/How-do-we-communicate-06f2032bfdae4552a38149c99c68e3df">How do we communicate?</a><p>“Turn off all notifications from your phone!”</p></li><li><a href="https://www.notion.so/gumroad/What-does-working-at-Gumroad-feel-like-7d9fd1c9548245a58afe5569d76a7960">What does working at Gumroad feel like?</a><p>“We ship incrementally, iteratively, and have one massive tentpole launch a year. Every month we see how much creators got paid, then we move on. The journey is the fun part, we're not waiting to arrive at some destination.”</p></li><li><a href="https://www.notion.so/gumroad/What-s-not-so-good-at-Gumroad-847e3c285b1f45ab955ebacf52867900">What’s not so good at Gumroad?</a><p>“There's not a lot of room for growth. We're staying profitable, and not planning to double the team every year. While there will likely be a few leadership roles, there aren't plenty of them and they aren't built into the career path of working at Gumroad.”</p></li></ul><p>Gumroad’s Chris Maximin says, “this way to work is responsible for the highest level of productivity I've ever experienced. The ability to focus on actual work creates a virtuous circle benefiting both the company and the workers: 1) the company does not have to pay expensive engineers to sit around in endless, useless meetings, and 2) the engineers get to do more and learn more, which benefits them in the long term.”</p><p>This isn’t just for engineers.</p><p>Justin Mikolay, a writer at Gumroad, ships each of our <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/BCMDz">Creator Spotlights</a> this way, even though each one requires at least three people–plus the creator.</p><p><em>Everything</em> is handled this way: support, risk, content, growth, product prioritization, board decks, design feedback, and more.</p><h2>Minimum viable culture</h2><p>This way of working isn’t for everyone.</p><p>There are no retreats planned, and no social channels in Slack. There are limited opportunities for growth. And we can’t compete with the comp packages that big tech companies can provide.</p><p>But we can compete–and win–on flexibility.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sidyadav">Sid Yadav</a>, former VP of Product at Teachable, joined Gumroad in 2018.</p><p>In his words, “most entrepreneurs have two options: work a full-time job and hustle nights/weekends, or leave your job and risk everything to start the company. Gumroad provided a third way: I could contract 20-35 hours a week, and for a couple days a week, incubate ideas and work on my next thing.”</p><p>In 2020, Sid left Gumroad to start his own creator economy company, <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle</a>, together with former Gumroad coworker <a href="https://community.circle.so/u/45ef416b">Rudy Santino</a>:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m starting a new company: <a href="https://t.co/BW40WmGBlF">https://t.co/BW40WmGBlF</a>! I’ll be sharing more about it in the coming weeks, but today I wanted to show gratitude to the life situation that made this possible: contracting for a flexible remote startup — <a href="https://twitter.com/gumroad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gumroad</a>. It wouldn’t have happened without it.</p>— Sid Yadav (@sidyadav) <a href="https://twitter.com/sidyadav/status/1216761573479473152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <p>Working on Gumroad isn't a majority of anyone's identity.</p><p>People work at Gumroad as little as they need to sustain the other parts of their lives they prefer to spend their time and energy on: a creative side-hustle, their family, or anything else.</p><p>Gumroad engineer Nathan Chan says, “I produce more value for my time than at any other company in my career, and I’m able to fully participate in parenting and watching my kiddo grow up.”</p><p>That includes me.</p><p>From 2011 to 2016, building Gumroad was my singular focus in life. But today, it is just a part of my life, like a hobby might be. For example, I paint for fun, and every once in a while, I sell a painting.</p><h2>A company of creators</h2><p>One day, out of the blue, I received an email from <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a>. I knew Daniel; he was a creator who had made over $250,000 on Gumroad in less than a year.</p><p>He was already using the product–so he understood what problems Gumroad ought to solve next–and he had some ideas for how he could help out:</p><blockquote>I love Gumroad (and I’m living off it!), I enjoy product scoping and strategy, and I think I can take over your PM tasks. I would only be able to dedicate around 2hrs/day on average, but I’d be available daily. Don’t know if this is the type of commitment you had in mind, but I figured if there’s a place where this arrangement can work, it’s Gumroad :)</blockquote><p>It was a perfect fit. Daniel became our new Head of Product.</p><p>It can be a great deal for Gumroad too. Before Daniel quit his job at Amazon, he was making over $400,000 a year. We pay him $120,000 a year.</p><p>How? He works ten hours a week for us. In his words:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Almost nobody is seeing this trend as an opportunity to work less, rather than to earn more. <a href="https://t.co/U9YBqp1ebn">https://t.co/U9YBqp1ebn</a></p>— Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1334288446697865216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <h2>Getting paid</h2><p>In practice, we pay everyone hourly based on their role. The range varies from $50 (customer support) to $250 (Head of Product) an hour.</p><p>Recently I standardized our rates world-wide:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🌍🌎🌏 Excited to announce we've deprecated all location-based pay! Gumroad will now pay you the same salary, no matter if you live in San Francisco, Bangalore, Lagos, or anywhere else.</p>— Sahil (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1334201934702493697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <p>This rate is agreed upon during our interview process:</p><ol><li>Apply via a form.</li><li>An unpaid, few-hour challenge, that resembles the high-level work we do at Gumroad. This may include breaking down a large shipment (like Gumroad Memberships) into its atomic parts, planning the schema associated with a new feature, or writing up a Help Center article.</li><li>A paid, few-week trial period, that resembles the day-to-day work we do at Gumroad.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>By November 5, 2020, as election results continued to be tallied, it was becoming certain that Joe Biden would go on to become the winner of the 2020 US presidential election. But the outcome was far more nail-biting than expected. After all, surveys projected him to win by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/">8% points nationally</a>, high single digit margins in all swing states, including by 8.4% in Wisconsin 7.9%, in Michigan, and 2.5% in Florida.</p>
<p>Bidenâ€™s presumed strength was such that even when gold-rated pollster Anne Selzer came out with a <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2020/10/31/election-2020-iowa-poll-president-donald-trump-leads-joe-biden/6061937002/">+7 Trump rating in Iowa</a>, she was loudly panned â€” NYTimesâ€™ Nate Cohn <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1322684447817453569">commented</a> â€œSelzer can be wrong, and has been before,â€� with other commentators piling on as well.</p>
<p>What happened of course was different. Trump outperformed polling by 6% in Florida, 7.7% in Wisconsin, and 7.3% in Ohio. Seltzer of Iowa ended up right, when Trump beat the Iowa consensus polling by 6.9%.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s shocking in these results isnâ€™t that polls can be off â€” that happens. Whatâ€™s shocking is the breadth of the error, across presidential, senatorial, and house levels; across geographies; across pollsters. This miss was in the same direction, of the same intensity, as the miss in 2016, despite all the hand-wringing and adjustments and model updates that happened in the interim.</p>
<p>How did the most generously-funded, highest-quality, and highest-frequency election polling in history get it wrong? While the eulogy is still being written, many theories point to a fundamental problem â€” a response sample that turned out to be non-random.</p>
<p>For anyone who has taken a beginnerâ€™s statistics course, the foundation of all calculations rely on random sampling. Confidence intervals and margins of error are meaningless if your sample isnâ€™t random.</p>
<p>While weâ€™d like to believe polls are random samples â€” they are not. Non-responsive bias and self-selection are two of many ways samples can be improperly collected; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/upshot/polls-what-went-wrong.html">a leading theory</a> is that Trump voter social disaffection led to the polling misses.</p>
<p>We, the voting public, believed that polling firms who were well-funded and staffed to the brim with PhDs, would figure out techniques around this. As is now obvious, that assumption was dead wrong, as wrong in 2020 as it was in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="whatdoestheelectionresulthavetodowithuserresearch">What does the election result have to do with user research?</h2>
<p>If the best polling firms in the world can come to the wrong conclusions, what does this mean for user research?</p>
<p>User research often manifests itself as independent functions within larger corporations. Or, it refers to the products of companies like User Leap, User Testing, and others who promote the idea of â€œcontinuousâ€� research, promising Web app developers with the data they need to understand how users use their product.</p>
<div>

  <p><img src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/survey-box.png"><br>
  <span>Does this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=foresee+survey&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwja8Ournu_tAhVKsFMKHQGHDKgQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=foresee+s&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgQIIxAnMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHjIECAAQGDIECAAQGDoECAAQQzoFCAAQsQM6CAgAELEDEIMBOgcIABCxAxBDUNJhWKFsYORwaAFwAHgAgAFdiAGGBZIBAjEwmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=PA7pX9riH8rgzgKBjrLACg&amp;bih=699&amp;biw=1440&amp;hl=en#imgrc=pySAZ-pP94o7hM&amp;imgdii=CoQbW0vptoztuM">annoying window</a> ring a bell?</span>

</p></div>
<p>Regardless of the tool, these approaches have the same fault at their core â€” the lack of a random sample. Most users dismiss survey prompts on web sites. Most users will never fork over our time to conduct an in-person research survey. The people that do respond are self-selecting by definition â€” maybe theyâ€™re overly pissed off about something or maybe theyâ€™re bored, but theyâ€™re definitely not random.</p>
<p>If the data youâ€™re using isnâ€™t randomly sampled, your conclusions are going to be invalid. And that can be costly â€” for your time, your team, and your business.</p>
<h2 id="howdoyoudouserresearchtherightway">How do you do user research the right way?</h2>
<h3 id="lookatyouranalyticsmorecarefully">Look at your analytics more carefully.</h3>
<p>User research purports to answer â€œwhyâ€� people behave in the ways that you see them behave in your analytics. But as we know, the whys are based on non-random samples and therefore are unsound.</p>
<p>The good news is, analytics tools like Google Analytics (or <a href="https://usefathom.com/" rel="nofollow">Fathom</a> for the privacy-minded) track nearly all users, so thereâ€™s no need to randomly sample (and when they do, itâ€™s a real random sample). They also go a long way to answer the â€œwhys.â€� Sometimes metrics differ by desktop or mobile â€” which points to device type as influential. Sometimes metrics differ by browser, which could point to specific browser bugs. With the right cut of the data, an analytics tool can often answer the why through data alone. In our case, to develop our product roadmap, we used search trends and our internal analytics to get insights that solitaire players also played <a href="https://solitaired.com/mahjong">Mahjong</a>, <a href="https://solitaired.com/freecell">FreeCell</a>, and <a href="https://solitaired.com/spider">Spider Solitaire</a>.</p>
<p>Going further, tools like HotJar record randomly-sampled screens and create heatmaps, so you can actually see what a random sample of users does on your site, which arguably is multiples more valuable than getting a response from a self-selected user or someone in a user research lab. (Note, the privacy-minded out there may not like these sorts of recording software tools â€” which is a worthy debate to have).</p>
<h3 id="experimentmore">Experiment more.</h3>
<p>Ultimately, what someone may say in a survey or explain in a lab will differ from how theyâ€™ll react in real life. The only way to know if something is working is to try it. There are many low-cost ways to try new things, including a/b testing and painted door testing (link to other post), that will minimize the time it takes for you to learn about user behavior.</p>
<p>The benefits of experimentation go beyond simply user-testing. Building an organization that can execute tests quickly means that you can iterate faster. Waiting for user research feedback can often have the opposite effect â€” adding an additional bottleneck into an often already complex software development process. <a href="https://thestartup.substack.com/p/unicorn-traits" rel="nofollow">Innovating early and often is good</a>.</p>
<h3 id="builduserresearchintoyourui">Build user research into your UI.</h3>
<p>Some sites, like Stitchfix, donâ€™t guess what their users want â€” they just ask. Integrating a survey into the actual user experience, which more or less forces users to respond and reduces bias, is another way of learning a userâ€™s intent.</p>

<h2 id="whendoestraditionaluserresearchwork">When does traditional user research work?</h2>
<p>One of the few times when user research is beneficial is when you donâ€™t need a random sample â€” aka, you have big, enterprise customers that account for a majority of your revenue.</p>
<p>Another area where user research can be important is when you have zero product and are only exploring a market. Here, however, the most important part is building relationships with potential customers â€” user research here is less about actual product workflows and more about building the customer relationships you need to get started.</p>
<p>Most importantly, user research is not just a standard stage in the product development process, where you are interviewing individual customers and relying on non-random feedback. User research should be thought about more holistically, encompassing all the tools that you have, and relying on the ones that can give you a more complete picture of user behavior â€” that includes analytics, experimentation, and data-yielding product workflows. Perhaps Googleâ€™s embrace of <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/96893097926894278-quantitative-user-experience-researcher/">quantitative user research</a> will move product development further in this direction.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>At an early hour of the morning, Tesla &amp; SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted “Use Signal” — the precursor for this tweet was an earlier reply to WhatsApp’s recent policy that forcefully asks to comply to data sharing with Facebook.</p>

<p>WhatsApp is actually owned by Facebook Inc. (FB), now Facebook is apparently trying to widen its human data research to the next level. With the past scandals like Cambridge Analytica, the social media platform’s credibility has been shaken.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the Cambridge Analytica scandal surfaced within a few weeks after Elon Musk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17156402/elon-musk-deleted-tesla-and-spacex-facebook-pages-twitter-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered</a> to remove <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/spacex/">SpaceX</a>, <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/">Tesla</a>, and his official page from Facebook. Musk has been a staunch opposer of Facebook and regularly criticizes the social media platform for bad user experience and possible misuse of personal data.</p>

<p>In the new WhatsApp terms of use agreement (screenshot above), it’s clearly mentioned that if you do not agree with Facebook data sharing otherwise you will not be granted permission to use WhatsApp (a little rephrased I know but that’s what Facebook meant actually).</p>



<p>Now with WhatsApp’s mandatory data sharing with Facebook, <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> decided to give a boost to Signal Private Messenger. As of this writing, Signal Messenger 570k+ users on Google Playstore vs. 127 million+ WhatsApp users. With Musk’s more than 41 million followers on Twitter, the number of Signal users is likely to hike in the coming hours, days, and weeks.</p>



<p>Another interesting bit is that Elon Musk has now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/musk-close-to-surpassing-bezos-as-world-s-richest-person" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become</a> the world’s richest person with Tesla stock reaching an all-time high of $796.12 ($3,980.6 pre-split) at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>However, Signal offers real end-to-end encryption for enhanced security and privacy. <a href="https://signal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Signal Messenger</a> has no social media partners to share data for profit and that’s even better.</p>



<p>The dilemma is, how we are going to convince our friends and family to migrate to Signal when they are addicted to WhatsApp, I don’t see that happening very soon.</p>

<pre><em>Today we’ll take a turn and showcase a personal project developed by our Tech Lead, Bruno, who took the multiple hours of lockdown we experienced last year and turned them into an initiative that allowed him to communicate with his 6 year old daughter. Below you’ll be able to review his experience and gather all of the details of his project (in case you want to replicate his system).</em></pre>



<p>In terms of social interactions, 2020 was an odd year, with cyclic lockdowns and openings. <strong>Keeping in touch with our close ones was one of the main challenges for all of us</strong>. The lockdowns are a bizarre experience in itself, but one of the strangest parts for me was when I topped it all up with a fever. It ended up being just a regular flu in the end, but for precaution my doctor ordered me to lock me down in a room for two weeks. Being there just a few meters away from my family and not being able to hug them or have a direct conversation was <strong>hard for all of us, but especially for my six-year-old daughter who wasn’t able to wrap her head around the reasons we couldn’t just see each other.</strong></p>



<p>So this time I decided to build something for her to keep us in touch in case something similar happens. The basic concept is a <strong>simplified interface for a Telegram voice chat with only a few (big) buttons: it should allow to easily and intuitively send and receive voice messages</strong>. Of course having a raspberry-pi as the core of this device was a no-brainer, since It has everything that’s needed for the project: WiFi connectivity, low level interface to control leds and buttons, and of course a complete OS where to run a Python interpreter to control everything.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-300x217.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="389" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-300x217.jpg 300w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-1024x739.jpg 1024w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-768x555.jpg 768w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-640x462.jpg 640w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-100x72.jpg 100w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px"></figure></div>



<h3>TUI</h3>



<p>A good idea when dealing with electronic projects is to <strong>start small and have a proof of concept working before getting all the components</strong> and wire the whole thing together. In this case I started by creating the main program but replacing the physical button interface with a <em>TUI</em> (terminal user interface). The code can be found <a href="https://gitlab.com/daylanKifky/daddy-box-python-module" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this repository</a>, you should be able to test it by running it using the <code>--tui</code> flag like this:</p>



<pre>python -m daddy_box --tui</pre>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_tui.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_tui.jpg 575w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_tui-300x242.jpg 300w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_tui-100x81.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px"></figure></div>



<h3>Telegram bot setup</h3>



<p>The first time you run it you will need to give it a telegram bot key. Follow <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this steps</a> to create your instance of a Bot, and then run it with the <code>--setup-bot</code> flag and input the information the <em>BotFather</em> gave you.</p>



<p>You should now be able to search for the bot’s username in telegram and exchange some messages with it. You will first find that you get “not allowed” responses. The <strong>idea behind this bot is to exchange messages privately with just one user</strong>, so you have to tell the bot which is the allowed user id to interact with.</p>



<p>Take a look at the terminal where the bot is running, you will see some printed messages like this one:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_user_id.png" alt="" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_user_id.png 571w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_user_id-300x66.png 300w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_user_id-100x22.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px"></figure></div>



<p>Copy your user-id from there and give it to the bot using the <code>--setup-user</code> flag.  You should now be able to send and receive voice messages, so we are ready to start with the physical part of the project.</p>







<h3>Raspberry pi HAT</h3>



<p>When doing a one-shot project like this I normally use breadboards or perfboards to assemble all the components. I used that approach a bunch of times in the past to handle a few backlitghted buttons, and the process was always frustrating: I ended up spending lots of time with the soldering and wiring of the components. So this time I decided to actually do what I promised myself each one of those times: design a <strong>breakout HAT for the raspberry with screw terminals where to easily connect everything.</strong></p>



<p>Since I was at it I added a darlington array and a number of selectable power sources in order to potentially handle bigger loads. I designed it in Kicad and then ordered a few PCBs. You can find the project files <a href="https://gitlab.com/daylanKifky/daddy-box-raspberry-pi-hat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="583" height="388" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-300x199.jpg 300w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-768x511.jpg 768w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-640x425.jpg 640w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-100x66.jpg 100w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT.jpg 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px"></figure></div>



<h3>Audio</h3>



<p>One little detail I wasn’t taking into consideration when I started the project was the fact that a <strong>raspberry pi doesn’t have an audio input</strong>.<strong> So I had to buy an USB microphone.</strong> A cheap one from a local store did the trick. I removed all the plastic parts and shortened the cable to avoid unnecessary EM interference.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_mic.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="443" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_mic.jpg 581w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_mic-218x300.jpg 218w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_mic-349x480.jpg 349w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_mic-73x100.jpg 73w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px"></figure></div>



<p>Before using it I also tried a small USB audio card but I had a lot of conflicts being raised by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/" target="_blank">pyaudio,</a> the library I used to handle the recording and playing of audio files in python.</p>



<p>For the audio output I connected a small speaker directly to the RPi audio output jack. The volume is a little low, but it gets the work done.</p>



<h3>Final assembly</h3>



<p>Once the PCBs and all the components arrived it was time to replace the <em>TUI</em> with a Button UI. I used the handy <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gpiozero</a> library to handle button press and leds. For the external case I used a shoe box to which I made holes for the buttons and speaker.</p>

<p>Once everything was set and tested I disassembled and packed all the components inside the box, wrapped the whole thing as a gift to prepare it for the best part.</p>



<h3>XMAS</h3>



<p>I gave the box as a present to my daughter to be opened on Christmas eve without telling her what the purpose of all those parts were. <strong>The next morning we spent a couple of hours putting it all together, so she discovered the purpose of the device, its final shape and got a glimpse of the internal functionality during the process.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="286" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-300x169.jpg 300w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-768x432.jpg 768w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-640x360.jpg 640w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-100x56.jpg 100w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid.jpg 1422w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px"></figure></div>



<p>When it was done my kid liked it way more than I could ever expect. What I conceived as an utilitary tool to keep us connected when I wasn’t close soon became a part of a game of exchanging messages about every little action in the everyday routine, even when we are just a few meters away 😅.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I’m quite happy with the result. Not only did this object help strengthen our relationship, it ended up being a <strong>cool way to transmit the hacker-maker values and habits to a young mind.</strong></p>



<p>I hope some of you find this useful and if you try to build this at home I would love to know how it went for you, please share your experience in <a href="https://forum.chordata.cc/">our forum</a> using the <em>offtopic</em> tag.</p>



<p>And above all, have a great starting of the year!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The images of the storming of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., are painful to the soul of every friend of democracy. The democratic world is shocked and appalled. But that’s not enough. We need all democrats around the world to stand shoulder to shoulder. The struggle against narrow-minded delusion, against intolerance, against the division of our societies is our common struggle. Indeed, it would be self-righteous to point the finger solely at America right now. Here in Germany, too, in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/when-far-right-hatred-turns-into-terrorism-a-e58ac378-bc7c-442e-a024-c801296d2b9c" data-link-flag="english">Hanau</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/far-right-terrorism-in-germany-shooting-exposes-lapses-in-security-apparatus-a-1291075.html" data-link-flag="english">Halle </a>and on the steps of Reichstag (in coronavirus protests last summer), we have seen how agitation and inflammatory words can spark hateful deeds.</p><div>
<p>This should be extremely clear: Those who, like Trump, have spent years using words to constantly inflame and incite their own supporters, ultimately bear responsibility for this attack on the heart of American democracy. We see all around the world what happens when radical populists come to power and systematically stir up resentment against democratic institutions. Yes, democracy thrives on contradiction, even disagreement. But it dies when brute force silences the other, when sheer hatred breaks all bounds of decency and respect.</p><p>The radical mob does not represent the majority in the United States. The vast majority of American voters stand firmly behind democracy and voted decisively against a right-wing populist. And it’s not just Donald Trump who needs to finally accept that. Every Republican with a modicum of responsibility needs to finally repudiate Trump once and for all. The American courts have ruled clearly that this was a lawful election. Those who disrespect that election result are disrespecting their own people.</p>
</div><div>
<p>America’s strength is its diversity. It is admired around the world for the freedom of its democracy. U.S. president-elect Joe Biden knows this. His call yesterday for mutual respect and reconciliation were the soothing words of a president. And the confirmation of the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris by the U.S. Congress was the best democratic response to those who sowed chaos and discord in Washington yesterday.</p><p>As friends of America and as friends of democracy, we wish Joe Biden and Kamala Harris great strength in the difficult task of overcoming America’s division. We stand together with them in the fight for democracy. In keeping with the quintessential American motto: "E pluribus unum" – out of many, one.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As I have explored previously, various commentators in the early Trump era attempted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/features/2019/11/11/18273141/postmodernism-donald-trump-lyotard-baudrillard">link</a> the new president to the body of thought often known as “postmodern theory.” As a recap of this discussion, I will quote here from some of my <a href="https://arcdigital.media/the-irony-poisoner-88d3f15232b9">prior writing</a> on the subject:</p><p>“In early 2017 . . . Steve Bannon, a White House strategist at the time, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-wh-strategist-vows-a-daily-fight-for-deconstruction-of-the-administrative-state/2017/02/23/03f6b8da-f9ea-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html">proclaimed</a> that the Trump administration would undertake the ‘deconstruction of the administrative state.’ Bannon’s invocation of this old buzzword of critical theory led to plenty of <a href="https://twitter.com/HeerJeet/status/834922404216360961">humorous</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/garymmorris/status/835132954712104962">Twitter takes</a>, many linking [deconstructive literary theorist Paul] de Man to Trump’s postmodern White House.</p><p>“Conservatives usually repudiate postmodernism, but this was not the first time an improbable alliance between these nemeses had been suggested. At least since a George W. Bush aide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community">dismissed</a> ‘the reality-based community,’ the notion that there is a ‘<a href="https://arcdigital.media/the-rise-of-post-modern-conservatism-53cf8651b052">postmodern turn</a>’ on the right has gained a certain currency. Many have found further evidence of a synthesis of conservatism and postmodernism in certain glib pronouncements emerging out of the Trump orbit, from Kellyanne Conway’s ‘alternative facts’ to Rudy Giuliani’s ‘truth isn’t truth.’”</p><p>Now, as the Trump era draws to a close, I would like to discuss a more concrete and, in my view, more interesting aspect of the admittedly tenuous linkage between Trump and “theory.” This is the presence of several individuals in the orbit of his White House who, in contrast to “folk postmodernists” like Conway and Giuliani, have an intellectual background and a sustained interest in “theory.”</p><p>I will focus on three such figures, but first, I will consider one other with a powerful spectral presence in the Trump-aligned political realm: Andrew Breitbart. Breitbart died before Trump’s political rise, but the eponymous publication he founded became an unofficial house organ of Trump’s campaign as well as a feeder of staff to his administration. One <em>Breitbart</em> alumna who ended up in the White House will be my second subject: Julia Hahn, previously a student of philosophy and psychoanalysis. Next, I’ll consider Darren Beattie, a former Trump speechwriter who wrote a doctoral dissertation on Martin Heidegger. Finally, I’ll return briefly to the theoretical interests of the so-called “philosopher-CEO” Peter Thiel, who has made regular appearances in my writing in the past. Thiel was never part of Trump’s administration, but he was an influential supporter, delegate, convention speaker, and member of the transition team in 2016.</p><h4>Andrew Breitbart</h4><p>Breitbart deserves mention here because although he helped establish the negative tenor of much of the contemporary right’s attitude to “theory,” he also pointed towards a different relationship between right-wing insurgents and the body of thought referred to by that term. In his 2011 autobiography <em>Righteous Indignation</em>, Breitbart wrote about his induction into “cultural Marxism” in college, specifically the work of the Frankfurt School theorists Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse, and his later realization that “it was everywhere, from the mainstream media to Hollywood to the educational system to the government.” He describes critical theory as a “mission to destroy society and culture using the Marxist dialectic.”</p><p>It is worth quoting Breitbart at greater length on this subject:</p><p>“[Critical theory] was . . . a theory of criticizing everyone and everything everywhere. It was an attempt to tear down the social fabric by using all the social sciences (sociology, psychology, economics, political science, etc.); it was an infinite and unending criticism of the status quo, adolescent rebellion against all established social rules and norms.”</p><p>This passage should be read against the grain of its overt anti-theory stance. Elsewhere, Breitbart tells us that American society and politics is controlled by the “Democrat-Media Complex,” the “the power structure of Hollywood, Washington, and New York,” which is infused with cultural Marxism. How does one respond to this? Presumably by way of  a “ruthless criticism of all that exists” – in other words, by using the methods that Breitbart views as the main vice of critical theory; perhaps, also, by engaging in “adolescent rebellion against all established social rules and norms,” which is to say, against the politically correct dogmas of hegemonic liberalism. (Breitbart’s publication, recall, went on to employ Milo Yiannopolous.)</p><p>This is the real task Breitbart sets for himself and for the American right, and in this way, he seeks to learn from the “cultural Marxists” he repudiates. This means learning from his enemies, the cultural Marxists, in order to defeat them, since “[a]s it stands, the Frankfurt School–taught left is fighting the political battle on both the political and the cultural battlefields. Conservatives are fighting it only on the political battlefield.” Breitbart’s famous motto, “Politics is downstream from culture,” proceeds from its founder’s belief that the right should embrace the approach he attributes to critical theory to reclaim the culture from the “Democrat-Media Complex.” (As is often noted, the motto is Breitbart’s spin on the work of the Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci, a key figure in his “cultural Marxism” narrative.) To borrow the Hegelian terminology his Frankfurt School nemeses might find congenial, Breitbart set out to “negate the negation.”</p><p>What’s difficult to determine from <em>Righteous Indignation</em> is how fully Breitbart believes the just-so story he relates about a handful of relatively obscure philosophers single-handedly undermining American society by slowly meming their ideas into the mainstream through the universities. Perhaps this is a conscious act of mythmaking carried out in the service of Breitbart’s own meme warfare counterattack. Regardless, his ambivalent relationship to “theory” – both his primary antagonist and a crucial inspiration for his project – set the stage for later developments in the Trump era.</p><h4>Julia Hahn</h4><p>Julia Hahn is, as of the writing of this post, still Special Assistant to the President, having outlasted many other White House staffers. This includes the man who brought her into Trump’s orbit: Steve Bannon, Andrew Breitbart’s friend and successor at the media empire he launched. Hahn wrote for <em>Breitbart</em> throughout the 2016 primary and general elections, prior to entering the Trump administration. She was best known for her polemical coverage of establishment Republicans like Paul Ryan and for incendiary immigration reporting that repeatedly drew attention to crimes committed by immigrants.</p><p>What brings Hahn to our attention here, however, is her <a href="https://thepointmag.com/politics/uchicago-bannons-bannons-bannon/">prior career</a> as a student at the University of Chicago. Less than two years before taking a job at <em>Breitbart</em>, Hahn, as an undergraduate, appeared on a panel discussion at Chicago related to the work of Leo Bersani, a crucial figure in the development of queer theory. The video of this session is still available on <a href="https://youtu.be/39FMKMdoM18?t=2246">Youtube</a>. The moderator who introduces Hahn to the audience situates her research “at the intersection of psychoanalysis and post-Foucauldian philosophical inquiry” and explains that her senior thesis explores “how psychoanalysis reveals flaws in the neo-Kantian conception of autonomy.”</p><p>Hahn breaks the ice at the beginning of her presentation with a joke about anal sex (a theoretical interest of Bersani’s), then delivers a precisely argued reassessment of French social theorist Michel Foucault’s critique of Freudian psychoanalysis. For background, Foucault’s critique of psychoanalysis goes approximately as follows: Freud believed that by working through repressed desires in speech, suffering people might find relief from the harmful effects of repression; but according to Foucault, rather than offering liberation through the release of pent-up desires, psychoanalysis <em>produced</em> those desires as discursive phenomena available to be monitored by power for the purpose of social control; in this sense, it amounted to a new strategy of social discipline comparable to the Catholic confessional. Hahn’s goal is to nuance Foucault’s critique by showing that Freud anticipated some elements of it, and to propose a model of psychoanalysis that survives Foucauldian scrutiny. In the course of this discussion, Hahn argues that Foucault’s account of psychoanalysis as a technique of power does not truly discredit it. Power is unavoidable, she says; “the problem,” as she reads Foucault, “is when power becomes rigid, and leads to states of what he calls domination.”</p><p>Given Hahn’s later career, it’s hard not to hear a faint echo here of Andrew Breitbart’s attack on the “Democrat-Media Complex.” Perhaps someone deeply invested in Foucault’s criticism of the diffuse, invisible ways in which power is exercised in the modern world, as Hahn appeared to be, might find some appeal in Andrew Breitbart’s account of the full-spectrum liberal “domination” of education, entertainment, and other industries and institutions, just as Breitbart himself was unmistakably attracted to aspects of the “culture industry” critique of the Frankfurt School theorists he detested.</p><p>Hahn’s presentation gives the impression of a nuanced and even-handed style of thought that contrasts with her overtly propagandistic work for <em>Breitbart</em>. Yet her paper might be read as offering a preemptive retort to this criticism, which goes something like this: no doubt, <em>Breitbart</em> is a purveyor of political propaganda, just as Freudian psychoanalysis is a technique of power. But if, as Foucault argues (and Breitbart would concur), the operations of power are omnipresent, perhaps university lectures and subtle literary essays are no less propagandistic than incendiary anti-immigration screeds. Hence, just as, for Hahn, the investment of psychoanalysis in power relations does not discredit it, especially if it can offer a means for resisting “domination,” the same might be said of outrage clickbait. Indeed, the latter’s …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><article><div><div><p><img src="https://pachdm.com/images/blog-images/Pachyderm-1-12-announcment.jpg" alt="Pachyderm 1.12 GA Announcement"></p><p>2020 was a crazy year, to say the least. That’s why we thought it best not to tempt fate by trying to squeeze in a major release during the last few weeks of December. And so, with a renewed sense of optimism, and 2020 now officially in the history books (hooray!), we’re excited to announce the release of Pachyderm 1.12.</p><p>Here’s a look at what’s new:</p><h3 id="new-pipeline-input-type-groups">New Pipeline Input Type: Groups</h3><p>Groups give you a brand new way to combine data from multiple sources on Pachyderm. Similar to a database <em>group-by</em>, <strong><a href="https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/group/">Groups in Pachyderm</a></strong> are a special type of pipeline input that enables you to aggregate files from one or more Pachyderm repositories via a particular naming pattern. For example:</p><p><strong>Groups within a single repo</strong></p><pre><code>$ pachctl list file repo@master
/labs/patientID1-labID1.txt
/labs/patientID2-labID1.txt
/labs/patientID1-labID2.txt
/labs/patientID3-labID1.txt
</code></pre><p>By configuring our pipeline input type to <code>group</code> and defining our <code>capture group</code> to match on <code>patientID</code>, we can <strong>aggregate all of patientID1 lab results into a single datum</strong> and create separate datums for all of patient 2 and 3. Neat!</p><p>Where Pachyderm Groups really start to shine is when you want to combine data from multiple repos and return the result as a single datum to be processed independently. For example, imagine we have a retail department store chain with multiple stores and different repos storing purchase information, return information and store identity information:</p><p><strong>Groups using multiple repos</strong></p><pre><code>Repo 1: Purchases
/ORDERW078929_STOREID2.txt file 64B  
/ORDERW080231_STOREID5.txt file 65B  
...
</code></pre><pre><code>Repo 2: Returns
NAME                       TYPE SIZE 
/ORDERW080231_STOREID5.txt file 65B  
/ORDERW080520_STOREID1.txt file 65B  
...
</code></pre><pre><code>Repo 3: Stores
/STOREID1.txt file 85B  
/STOREID2.txt file 85B  
/STOREID3.txt file 84B
</code></pre><p>Let’s say we wanted to get a list of all transactions (purchases or returns) grouped by storeID. Thanks to the new Pachyderm Group input type, this is easy. We simply specify our matching criteria and let Pachyderm handle the rest.</p><p>For those familiar with Pachyderm <code>joins</code>, you might be wondering how groups are different? In a nutshell, <code>joins</code> will return a single datum per match. Groups, on the other hand, will return all matches as a single datum.</p><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/3omRJX0">Try groups out for yourself with this great example.</a></strong></p><h3 id="automated-deferred-processing-with-triggers">Automated Deferred Processing with Triggers</h3><p>Another exciting addition to Pachyderm 1.12 is Triggers, which gives users greater control over how and when to process data.</p><p>Take our retail example from earlier. Throughout the day we have lots of transactions happening; for each transaction the company has to pay anywhere from 1-3% of the total plus a flat fee to the bank (aka interchange-rates). A Pachyderm Trigger could help reduce those costs by automatically deferring each transaction’s processing using a predefined set of criteria – For example, every night at 10pm, or in batches of 20.</p><p>Now, instead of paying a processing fee for each transaction, we only pay it once. Cha ching!</p><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/3pPjWG6">Give Pachyderm Triggers a try.</a></strong></p><h3 id="pachyderm-112-enterprise-additions">Pachyderm 1.12 Enterprise Additions:</h3><p>Pachyderm Enterprise includes everything mentioned so far as well as a few other goodies:</p><ul><li><a href="https://pachdm.com/3be5i7c">Group support for OIDC</a></li><li>Auth-enabled Extract/Restore</li></ul><h3 id="other-noteworthy-items">Other Noteworthy Items:</h3><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/35gQUYm">Improved Spouts</a></strong>
We re-architected spouts to improve stability and security while also making it easier to integrate with external data sources.</p><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/2MxA0hm">New “outer joins”</a></strong>
Where inner joins in Pachyderm will only return matched results, outer joins will return a result regardless of whether there’s a match or not.</p><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/35gkDAA"><code>pachctl list datum</code></a></strong>
Now includes a dry run option for testing glob patterns.</p><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/2Xjun8S"><code>pachctl update pipeline</code></a></strong>
Now supports transactions.</p><p>Interested in learning more about Pachyderm? <strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/3ogNTP3">Schedule some time with one of our experts</a></strong></p></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<p>
Recently, I had the pleasure of talking with KC Sivaramakrishnan - one
of the lead developers of the OCaml multicore project - when he came
to NUS to give us a talk on his work on multicore and a potential new
language feature for OCaml: <b>Algebraic effects</b>.  At a high level, the
run-down on algebraic effects is that they can be considered as a sort
of alternative to monads,<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> however with the key benefit that they
<i>play a lot nicer</i> with existing direct-style code and thus might be a
<i>more fluid</i> and <i>ergonomic</i> tool.  One of my most surprising takeaways
from meeting KC was in realising the significant amount of progress
that had already been made on implementing algebraic effects in
OCaml - in fact, algebraic effects, far from just being a far-off
pipe-dream (cough, modular implicits, cough), are actually at a point
where it is possible (<i>fairly easy even</i>) to play with them right now
(albeit using an experimental fork of the OCaml compiler).
</p>

<p>
Indeed, this is exactly what I have been working on over the past few
weeks - so moved was I by the world of possibilities opened up by this
development, I immediately set about experimenting on inserting
algebraic effects into various OCaml projects that I happened have
handy at the time.  Over the course of these experiments, I ended up
considering the application of algebraic effects to functional game
development, and in the process stumbled upon a rather elegant pattern
for representing animations in a functional style.  In fact, this
pattern actually ended up solving a longstanding issue I was having
with managing the control flow for animations alongside game logic,
and so I think it forms a rather nice setting for exploring the
benefits of algebraic effects, hence this post.
</p>

 


<p>
In the rest of this blog post, I'm going to provide a <i>gentle
introduction</i> to algebraic effects, provided in the context of their
use in implementing <b>functional game animations</b> - we'll look at using
algebraic effects to implement 3 different case studies of <i>relatively
complex</i> animations (see above) for games in a fluid and elegant way.
Hopefully, through exploring these case-studies, you should be able to
gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of algebraic effects
and why they are certainly something to be excited about.

<h3 id="orgbc783f7">The vision: Functional Game Development</h3>
<div id="text-orgbc783f7">
<p>
While our final code uses a mix of functional and imperative code (as
is idiomatic OCaml style), our journey really begins in the world of
pure functional games.
</p>

<div> 
<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_update.png" alt="functional_update.png"></p><div><p> 
Fundamentally, functional games work by separating
the execution of a game into two distinct functions representing the main phases of the game loop:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>an update function</b> that takes user input and time and updates the state of the world</li>
<li><b>a draw function</b> that displays the current state of the world to the
screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The idea here is that while the state of the game may change over time, the individual update and draw functions are pure and referentially transparent, and thus come with all the usual benefits of functional code (modularity and compositionality, reusable code, easier to reason about etc.).
</p></div> 
</div> 


<p>
To see these ideas in practice, suppose we wanted to implement a simple menu for a game:
</p><p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/a_game_menu.png" alt="a_game_menu.png">
</p> 


<p>
Following the functional approach, we could define the state of our menu as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> selected<span>:</span> int<span>;</span> options<span>:</span> string list<span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using this fairly simple state, we can easily
write a pure draw function for the menu as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>draw_item</span><span> </span><span>~</span><span>pos </span><span>~</span><span>is_active txt</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> <span>(* </span><span>draw an individual menu item </span><span>*)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>draw</span> <span>{</span>selected<span>;</span>options<span>}</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>List.</span>iteri <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>ind option</span> <span>-&gt;</span>  
       draw_item <span>~pos</span><span>:</span>ind <span>~is_active</span><span>:(</span>ind <span>=</span> selected<span>)</span> option
    <span>)</span> options
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Similarly, if we wanted to make the menu respond to user inputs, we
can write a functional update operation for the menu as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>update</span><span> menu key</span> <span>=</span> 
   <span>let</span> <span>len</span> <span>=</span> length menu.options <span>in</span>
   <span>let</span> <span>next</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>+</span> 1<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
   <span>let</span> <span>prev</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>-</span> 1 <span>+</span> len<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
   <span>match</span> key <span>with</span>
   <span>|</span> <span>Up</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> next menu.selected<span>}</span>
   <span>|</span> <span>Down</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> prev menu.selected<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Hooking these all up together, the main loop for our program might then look as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>main</span><span> </span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>=</span> 
   <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>loop</span><span> menu</span> <span>=</span> 
      draw menu<span>;</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>input</span> <span>=</span> get_input <span>()</span> <span>in</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> update menu input <span>in</span>
      loop menu <span>in</span>
   loop <span>{</span>selected<span>=</span>0<span>;</span> options<span>=[</span><span>"A"</span><span>;</span> <span>"B"</span><span>;</span> <span>"C"</span><span>]}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And tada! We now have a fully functional menu that <i>dynamically</i>
responds and updates to user inputs, and we were able to do it all
without having to ever dirty our hands with any <b>evil impure code</b>.
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_menu.png" alt="functional_menu.png">
</p> 


<p>
Functional game development sounds great, right?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge7daf0a">
<h3 id="orge7daf0a">The challenge: Managing animations</h3>
<div id="text-orge7daf0a">
<p>
The stuff that I presented in the previous section is nothing new -
there are countless prior blog posts and videos on the web that all
describe this style of a game engine, and it paints a very pretty
picture.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I am afraid to say, not all is as it seems in the land
of functional game development, and when you start using this
methodology to develop any kind of <i>non-trivial</i> games, you can quickly
find yourself running into edge-cases, and one <i>particularly nefarious</i>
example of such issues is handling animations.
</p>

<p>
Returning back to our running example of a game menu, suppose we now
wanted to come back and add a <i>simple</i> quality of life feature to our
menu - nothing complex, just a <b>fade-in</b> between states of the menu.
</p>

<p>
In other words, when the user presses a button, there should be small
<b>time-delay</b> as the menu <i>gradually transitions</i> from the original state
to the new one:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_animation.png" alt="functional_animation.png"> 
</p> 


<p>
<i>Okay, sure - that's not a complex transformation - so this should be
simple to implement within our framework, right?</i>
</p>

<div> 
<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_update_q.png" alt="functional_update_q.png"></p><div> 


<p>
<b>Unfortunately, no.</b>
</p>

<p>
Our methodology so far was based entirely around the assumption that
the update function is <i>pure</i> and <i>stateless</i> and should be called on each
frame of the game.
</p>

<p>
As such, if we were to return a new menu with the next item selected
when the user presses down, the <b>transformation would be immediate</b>
rather than the <i>gradual change</i> we want.
</p>

<p>
<i>So what exactly should we return from our update function then?</i>
</p></div> 
</div> 


<p>
If one were to strictly adhere to the functional game development
paradigm, then one hacky way to achieve this would be to explicitly
track the state of animations in the menu.
</p>

<p>
For example, we can update our definition of menu to be as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>time</span> <span>=</span> int
<span>type</span> <span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>Static</span> <span>of</span> int <span>|</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>of</span> int <span>*</span> int <span>*</span> time
<span>type</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> selected<span>:</span> state<span>;</span> options<span>:</span> string list<span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The idea here is that the <code>state</code> type tracks the two possible states of the menu and its animations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>either the animation is complete and the menu is static</li>
<li>or the menu is in the middle of an animation between two states
with some amount of <code>time</code> (in ms) remaining.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With this change, we can then write our update function as follows
(now updated to take an additional time parameter tracking the time
between frames):
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>update</span><span> menu key delta</span> <span>=</span> 
  <span>let</span> <span>len</span> <span>=</span> length menu.options <span>in</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>next</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>+</span> 1<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>prev</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>-</span> 1 <span>+</span> len<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
  <span>match</span> menu.state <span>with</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>old_ind<span>,</span>new_ind<span>,</span> remaining<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>remaining</span> <span>=</span> remaining <span>-</span> delta <span>in</span>
    <span>if</span> remaining <span>&lt;</span> 0 <span>(* </span><span>is animation completed? </span><span>*)</span>
    <span>then</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>Static</span> new_ind<span>}</span> <span>(* </span><span>yes: return to static </span><span>*)</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>old_ind<span>,</span> new_ind<span>,</span> remaining<span>)}</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Static</span> ind <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>match</span> key <span>with</span> <span>(* </span><span>only process inputs when animations completed </span><span>*)</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Up</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>ind<span>,</span> next menu.selected<span>,</span> 100<span>)}</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Down</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>ind<span>,</span> prev menu.selected<span>,</span> 100<span>)}</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
So this will work decently well, however, we're now starting to mix
our animation code with the logic of the program, making it harder to
understand and also more probable for bugs to creep in.  Additionally,
while this happens to work for our simple example, the pattern isn't
scalable - adding more animations would require rewriting the entire
function.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, taking this purely functional approach to games development
has some <b>serious difficulties</b> with managing animations, but it would
be unfair to say that this is uniquely due to the functional
approach:
</p>

<p><b><i>The challenge of balancing animations flow with logic is inherent to the domain</i></b>
</p>


<p>
For the rest of this blog post, we'll shift gears to investigate how
algebraic effects can be used to implement animations when dealing
with a slightly more imperative game structure, however this is mainly
to simplify the implementation: the core ideas presented below can be
easily ported to a pure implementation.

<div id="outline-container-org0873648">
<h3 id="org0873648">Algebraic effects to the rescue</h3>
<div id="text-org0873648">
<p>
Taking a step back from our previous example, the fundamental issue
was that we were trying to mix <b>two</b> separate threads of control - one
for the core logic, and a separate one for the animation - in other
words, what we need is some kind of <b>non-local control flow</b>.
</p>

<p>
….as it just so happens, this is exactly the functionality that
algebraic effects provide.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7da722a">
<h4 id="org7da722a">What are algebraic effects?</h4>
<div id="text-org7da722a">
<p>
We'll sidestep a more detailed discussion of the theory, and instead
focus on the general picture for the end user: algebraic effects as
effectively "resumable" exceptions.<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
When defining an effect, the user specifies the type of the input
supplied by the caller, and the type of the output that the effect
should return on completion:
</p>


<p>
To perform an effect, we can use the builtin primitive perform:
</p>

<p>
At this point, the execution of the current program is stopped (much
like an exception), and control changes up the stack until the nearest
effect handler:

   <span>...</span>

  <section>
    <p>Following our <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">efforts to bring elementary OS to the ARM-based Pinebook Pro</a>, we’ve added experimental builds for the ARM-based Raspberry Pi 4 series—including the recently-launched Raspberry Pi 400—to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access</a> program. Like Pinebook Pro builds, Raspberry Pi support is considered an experiment and is not something we have committed to officially support indefinitely. However, if you’re one of the many folks with a Raspberry Pi 4 sitting around and wanted to see how a full, modern desktop operating system runs, elementary OS is now an option!</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi/desktop.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS"></p>
  <figcaption>My current desktop, powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Personally, I typically use Raspberry Pi 4 as a network device, e.g. a DNS server and for network-attached storage. However, I’ve been using elementary OS builds on it for the past week, and I’m impressed. While it won’t compete experience-wise with a high end desktop, it is a real option for casual computing, development, and writing. In fact, this blog post was written entirely on my Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS. It would even be possible to run the same network services on the hardware from within elementary OS just so you get a nice modern GUI when doing any local management.</p>

<p>Like with <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a>, there are some things you should know if you plan to use elementary OS Early Access builds on Raspberry Pi:</p>

<h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>

<p>Since Ubuntu has released Raspberry Pi images, we are able to rely on that work to ship a supported and updated kernel. Thanks to all of the folks at Canonical and in the Ubuntu community who have worked to make that happen!</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>elementary OS on Raspberry Pi 4 is not going to match the polished experience of a full modern desktop computer, largely due to our current software stack. GTK3 does not offer GPU-accelerated animations, so animations within apps are less smooth than we would like. Still, for a computer coming in at under $100, it’s impressive and perfectly usable for several tasks.</p>

<p>There are also some things you can do to improve performance. We would definitely recommend using some sort of cooling with your Raspberry Pi, whether that’s a a heatsink and fan (like the recently-announced <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-raspberry-pi-4-case-fan/">Raspberry Pi 4 Case Fan</a>), or a passive case like one from <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://flirc.tv/">Flirc</a>—my favorite for its looks and silence. Since Raspberry Pi 4 tends to throttle due to heat under desktop loads, cooling will help it stay more responsive. We also recommend trying USB3 storage as your boot drive, as it should be faster than a microSD card. Using a 1080p (or lower) resolution also works a fair bit better than trying to push a 1440p or 4K display, but your mileage may vary based on your use case.</p>

<h2 id="supported-raspberry-pi-models">Supported Raspberry Pi Models</h2>

<p>We recommend Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 400 with 4 GB RAM at a minimum—but the more, the better. (We don’t even recommend less than 8 GB for computers with much faster CPUs, graphics, and storage.)</p>

<p>Older models of Raspberry Pi (like the original, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 2 series, and Raspberry Pi 3 series) are not supported; elementary OS requires the faster processor, additional RAM, and 64-bit architecture of the Raspberry Pi 4 series. For older models, we recommend sticking to Raspberry Pi OS or a “headless” OS like Ubuntu Server.</p>

<h2 id="run-elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi">Run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>In its current state, we would not consider elementary OS on Raspberry Pi as polished of an experience as running on well-supported AMD- or Intel-based hardware.</p>

<p>That said, the audience for Raspberry Pi leans toward tinkerers and experimenters; as such, we’ve decided to publish our builds under our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access builds</a> program. This means dedicated <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">sponsors</a> of elementary OS who wish to run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi can download it from the same place as Early Access builds of elementary OS. As a note, all of this work has been focused on bringing the <strong>pre-release of elementary OS 6</strong> to Raspberry Pi, so all the usual disclaimers about pre-release builds apply here as well.</p>



<p>Once you have access to Early Access builds, head over to the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elementary/os/wiki/Raspberry-Pi">elementary OS wiki</a> to get it installed on your own hardware. If you find and file any issues, please remember to specify the build of the OS you downloaded as well as that you are running on Raspberry Pi—it will help us validate and triage issues much more quickly.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-to-andrew-david-hewitt-and-marius-meisenzahl">Thanks to Andrew, David Hewitt, and Marius Meisenzahl</h2>

<p>Bringing elementary OS to Raspberry Pi was a collaborative effort. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andrewc910">Andrew</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davidmhewitt">David Hewitt</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a> specifically worked to prototype, improve, and ultimately ship these builds. And of course countless folks across the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Debian, Canonical, Ubuntu, and more have worked for years on making the underlying system work well for us to build on.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, The birth of the first open source data enabled ventilator. </p><article>
      
<p>Back to March 20, 2020. <a href="https://twitter.com/waxzce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quentin Adam</a>, with some friends living in Nantes, is trying to build a ventilator prototype with 3D printing and Arduino, in response to a shortage of equipment. </p>



<p><strong>Project MakAir is started</strong>. </p>



<p>Quentin, a software expert and CEO of <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clever Cloud</a>, is struggling with the electronics part and looking for electronics engineers. Among his friends is Mathias, SenX CTO. That is how Mathias asked me to review the electronics part of the project. My first call with Quentin was to help him connect an old pressure sensor to an Arduino, during the late evening of March 20.</p>



<p><strong>The goal was clear: to mass-produce an open-source medical ventilator</strong>. Crazy! Looking at the project that day, it looked like an "amateur" project. So I did the first real schematics, the first BOM, the first Radiospares, and Farnell reference list during the weekend, discussing with more and more people on the MakAir Slack. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Amateur? Not really...</h3>



<p>Next Thursday, I understood that the small "amateur" project is quickly getting big. Two electronics companies detached people, and a whole regulatory team was up. In this team, there were some experts in medical devices. We also knew that we were on a shortlist of projects that the French government is looking at closely.</p>



<p>I soon realized that in Nantes, there is no one able to actually make the prototypes. <a href="https://blog.senx.io/connecting-a-beertender-to-warp-10-using-mqtt-on-lorawan-with-thethingsnetwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Engineers with prototyping knowledge</a> are scarce, I just know a few of them like me. So, on the 25th during the evening, in a few minutes, I convinced Cherine, a former Renault Sport colleague living near Paris who has the same knowledge of prototyping as me, to join the project as well.</p>



<p><strong>On the 26th, I joined the MakAir core team, choosing to confine myself with 17 other people to make project MakAir a reality</strong>. Cherine came from Paris the same day I came from Brest. At the same time in France, 100 people were already helping us remotely. </p>



<p>I brought with me all my personal tools, from soldering iron to oscilloscope, and tons of components. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>If I had been told this would last 25 days, I would have brought more than 3 days of clothing!</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Three days later, <strong>the <a href="http://www.cea.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEA</a></strong> (french government agency for atomic energy) is now supporting us. On the 31<sup>st</sup> of March, we all moved from Nantes to Grenoble CEA facility, traveling on a nearly empty motorway.</p>



<p>The first prototype had basic electronics: STM32 Nucleo, a small 4 lines screen, a few buttons, a good precision pressure sensor, and several servo outputs. <strong>This first prototype allows us to make a pig breath for 4 hours</strong> on the 3rd of April, only 2 weeks after the project started.</p>

<h2>Enters the Raspberry Pi</h2>



<p>What we learned from the first test on a pig:</p>



<ul><li>The ventilator did the job. The pig was alive and woke up correctly.</li><li><strong>There is a huge UX problem.</strong></li><li>The airflow measurement is really helpful.</li></ul>



<p>The experts from the medical world are now used to high-tech screens displaying curves with not only pressure, but real-time air volume blown into the patient lungs. Even in crisis time, we understand that our product does not meet their minimum UI/UX needs.</p>

<p>Always listen to the users. Even if we succeed in mass production of an open-source ventilator, if doctors want curves and measures of the number of air liters entering the lungs, we must do it. </p>



<p>Since the beginning, this project is time driven. We never consider the price, but we always look at worldwide stocks. In a time where lots of plants are closed in Europe, <strong>the supply chain is leading the project.</strong></p>

<p>As I just said, the supply chain rules the project. MakAir will have a raspberry to display curves. Nice coincidence for an open-source project!</p>



<p>By the way, the mass flow meter sensor was a huge problem. Since the beginning, MakAir did not want to disturb the production of existing ventilators. But this component is on the airway, it should be approved for medical use. In April, it was impossible to source any Sensirion or Honeywell mass flow sensors... Anyway, the next test will be done with a raspberry connected to the STM32. </p>







<h2>Enter Warp&nbsp;10</h2>



<p>On the 17th of April, the first batch of ventilators built in the CEA clean-rooms was ready. This batch was used for the 1st clinical tests. </p>



<p><strong>The pressure switches from the technical team to the regulatory team, remotely working on the project since the beginning. </strong></p>



<p>To prepare the next batch, we came back to Nantes. After 25 days, we switched from commando mode (18h/day, 7 days a week) to a more standard week (14h/day, the weekends with the family).</p>

<p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> of April, the prototype with a Raspberry Pi is ready for the next animal test. Two people had to fly to Grenoble CEA with this prototype, but the rest of us, and all the people remotely working on the project wanted to follow the experience. </p>



<p>So, the night before the test, I quickly deployed Warp&nbsp;10 on the raspberry and wrote a small script to copy data every 10s to another Warp&nbsp;10 server.</p>

<p>What is <a href="https://www.warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp&nbsp;10</a>? It is a time series platform. But unlike other TSDB (Time Series Database), there is a full analysis environment behind, and even a task scheduler. Compress time series, replicate to another server while managing network outage is really easy. Same tooling on the server and the connected object, that what I call easy IoT. To stream data, you just need a few WarpScript functions among <a href="https://www.warp10.io/doc/functionList" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the thousand available</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, the WarpScript pseudo code is:</p>



<pre><code>- Read the last value of makair.lastupload GTS
- take the last tick as start
- take now as end
- fetch locally all the makair GTS from start to end
- WRAP all the GTS
- build a script that UNWRAP and UPDATE the data
- do a remote execution of the script with REXEC 
- if the REXEC was a success, store end in makair.lastupload</code></pre>



<p>You can follow the <a href="https://www.warp10.io/content/04_Tutorials/01_WarpScript/30_Server_to_Server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server to server tutorial</a> to implement such a WarpScript, then save it as $WARP10HOME/warpscripts/makair/10000/upload_data.mc2 to schedule an execution every 10s.</p>



<p>To display data in real-time, <a href="http://studio.senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpStudio</a> did the job easily too. Autorefresh of the DataViz every 10s is a built-in function:</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>



<p>MakAir ventilators are designed to store everything in the <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp&nbsp;10</a> time series database. They also have built-in WiFi and LoRa. All these features are not yet available, because the priority is still to make an open-source approved ventilator. </p>

<p>Connected features + open-source software is an enabler for doctors and researchers to perform extensive data collection and try new algorithms in the machine. Warp&nbsp;10 is the best open source time series database to <a href="https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-for-iot-gdpr-compliant-before-gdpr-even-existed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">securely</a> store medical data and analyze it. It's not a walled garden.</p>



<p>If you need to connect medical devices to a time series database, <a href="mailto:contact@senx.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just ask us</a>.</p>



<p>MakAir is now entering the second phase of clinical tests. We can consider we are halfway to the goal. Keep in mind that among all the projects of ventilators announced by big companies, MakAir is the only one to reach the clinical tests step. <a href="https://makair.life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 people, backed up by CEA and a few french companies</a> are about to make a commercially available open source ventilator... </p>



<p>That's crazy when you think about it!</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>In this article we'll look at several case studies of data science being used to optimize marketing efforts at companies like Lyft, Airbnb, Netflix, Doordash, Wolt, Rovio Entertainment.</p><p>In large and analytically mature organizations, the <em>optimization</em> piece usually comes as a part of a larger <em>marketing automation</em> system, but as we'll see it's not always the case. Doing budget allocation to channels and campaign manually, but with the aid of data science tool set can be hugely profitable and might be a good first step towards a fully automated workflow.</p><p>Before diving into details, let's look at high level architecture of an automated process for online marketing. As a result of streamlining the process that's largely determined by the way online advertising platforms work, marketing automation platforms look very much alike across different companies. In general, these platforms are large systems that comprise the following:</p><ol><li>Data tracking system <br>Track conversion events (customer signups, payment events, subscriptions, micro-transactions, etc).</li><li>Attribution system<br>Connect conversion events with the user acquisition source. That is, for each user we want to know exactly the marketing channel and the campaign that brought them in.</li><li>Performance estimation system<br>Let's say a campaign brought in 1000 users. We want to know if it paid off. We know how much we spent on it, but how do we know how much revenue the users will bring us over their lifetime. LTV and conversion modelling comes into play here.</li><li>Campaign management system<br>Online ads are a very fertile field for variation testing and content generation. But even without testing multiple you variations of the same ad, companies typically target different segments in different ways, easily resulting in dozens or hundreds ads running simultaneously. Companies like Airbnb and Netflix invest heavily in systems that support ad creation and management (<a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/growing-our-host-community-with-online-marketing-9b2302299324">Airbnb article</a>, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/https-medium-com-netflixtechblog-engineering-to-improve-marketing-effectiveness-part-2-7dd933974f5e">Netflix article</a>).</li><li>Automated bidding and budget optimization<br>The largest ad serving platforms provide you with near real-time feedback on your ad performance. Connect this with the spend and projected LTV and you can get your ROI predictions and adjust budgets accordingly. With dozens or hundreds of campaigns and variations, the benefits of automation and optimization at this steps can be huge.</li></ol><p>In article we're interested in what role data science can play in the overall ad lifecycle, so we'll focus on the two parts that tend to benefit the most from mixing in data science: 1) performance estimation and 2) automated bidding and budgeting.</p><p>Before diving in, it's imporant to understand the<em> channel/campaign </em>nomenclature. By <em>channel</em> we consider an advertising platform, such as Google AdWords, Facebook, Youtube, etc. A <em>campaign</em> is a single piece of advertising aimed at specific audience, according to segments available on the <em>channel, </em>with a preset starting and end time.</p><p>When evaluating marketing performance, we might want to look at investment and ROI at the level of a channel, a single campaign or a group of similar campaigns. We'll see how these different levels of granularity influence the amount and quality of available data, and in consequence how that determines the approaches that can be taken.</p><h2 id="performance-estimation">Performance Estimation</h2><p>Ideally, for the purpose of marketing optimization we're interested in LTV and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) as the factor in the ROI equation: $$ROI=\frac{LTV}{CAC}$$</p><p>LTV modelling is a fundamental problem in business analytics and it is far from trivial to get it completely right. The exact models depend heavily on the type of business and the intended application. LTV models are generally more valuable if we can give good estimates very early in the user lifetime. However, the earlier we do it the less data we have at our disposal.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/overcoming-ltv-modeling-pitfalls/">Pitfalls of Modeling LTV and How to Overcome Them</a>, Dmitry Yudovsky outlines several challenges that make it impossible for a cookie-cutter approach for LTV estimation to exist:</p><ul><li>Machine learning approaches are sometimes completely inadequate.<br>There might be lack of data necessary for long term LTV predictions. Also, even if we do have a large business with tons of historical data, there are cases when training models on year old data doesn't work well - maybe the product or the entire market is very different than a year or two ago.</li><li>Depending on whether we want to use LTV estimates for ad optimization, CRM efforts or corporate financial projections, we might have different requirements for model accuracy and cohort granularity at which we're making predictions (eg. single user, single campaign, group of campaigns, all users, etc.)</li></ul><p>Of course the problem is not intractable, and there are several common approaches. We'll look at a few case studies found in tech blogs from DoorDash, Airbnb and Lyft Engineering teams.</p><p>In <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/07/31/optimizing-marketing-spend-with-ml/">Optimizing DoorDash’s Marketing Spend with Machine Learning</a>, Doordash Engineering present their approach, where instead of directly estimating LTV, they model conversion rates as a function of marketing spend. We'll see later how these cost curves help to neatly optimize budget allocation across channels and campaigns.</p><p>Experience (data) tells us that any marketing channel will reach saturation at some point, so we can model cost curves, ie. $Conversion=f(Spend)$<em> </em>using a power function of the form $a\cdot Spend^{b}$.</p><figure><img src="https://blogboard.io/blog/content/images/2021/01/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Cost curve of the shape $a\cdot Spend^{b}$. Image credit: <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/07/31/optimizing-marketing-spend-with-ml/">DoorDash Engineering</a></figcaption></figure><p>We can fit cost curves at any cohort level, and it's typically done at the granularity of a channel or campaign. Simply put, if for a given campaign we spent $x$ amount of money, and that brought us $y$ users, we have one data point, $(x, y)$.</p><p>However, when allocating budgets at a later stage, we might need to make decisions at the <em>campaign </em>level, which cause problems with insufficient amount of data. In the DoorDash Engineering article, Aman Dhesi explains this problem:</p><blockquote>For some channels like search engine marketing, we have thousands of campaigns that spend a small amount of money every week. This makes the weekly attribution data noisy. Some weeks these campaigns don’t spend at all, which makes the data sparse. Using this data as-is will result in unreliable cost curves and in turn suboptimal (potentially wildly so) allocation.</blockquote><p>At DoorDash they solve this problem by training separate models which use similar campaigns to fill in the gaps in the dataset with synthetic data. This approach brings with itself certain tradeoffs, described in the <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/07/31/optimizing-marketing-spend-with-ml/">original article</a>.</p><p>In a similar manner, as described in <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/lyft-marketing-automation-b43b7b7537cc">Building Lyft’s Marketing Automation Platform</a>, data scientists at Lyft would fit an LTV curve of the shape $LTV=a\cdot Spend^{b}$. However, they incorporate an additional degree of randomness by modelling $a$ and $b$ as random variables and estimating their parameters $(\mu_a, \sigma_a)$ and $(\mu_b, \sigma_b)$ from historical data. This helps them implement an explore-exploit approach in the bidding step, by instantiating LTV curves after sampling $a$ and $b$ from their respective distributions. We'll revisit this approach briefly at the end of next section.</p><p>As described in <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/growing-our-host-community-with-online-marketing-9b2302299324">Growing Our Host Community with Online Marketing</a>, at Airbnb they face a problem stemming from the nature of their product and the market. When predicting LTV for an Airbnb home listing, two major problems are:</p><ol><li>Ad conversions for hosts are a very rare event. This poses problems with building large enough data sets. It also influences data tracking and attribution, where these systems have to be as precise as possible in order not to lose or wrongly attribute any data points.</li><li>Time from ad impression (user seeing an ad) to conversion (home listed on Airbnb) can be very long, sometimes weeks. This is a problem if you want to optimize and re-budget your campaigns soon after rollout - you simply don't have enough data yet.</li></ol><p>In the same post, Tao Cui describes the architecture of each part of Airbnb's marketing platform as well as the motivation for building the entire thing, along with choices of tech stack. </p><p>In another article dating from 2017, <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/using-machine-learning-to-predict-value-of-homes-on-airbnb-9272d3d4739d">Using Machine Learning to Predict Value of Homes On Airbnb</a>, Robert Chang describes how they use machine learning (ending up using XGBoost in production) to estimate LTV of each listing. Framing it as a typical regression problem, they use hundreds of features, such as <em>location data, price with all the partial costs (eg. cleaning fee, discounts), availability, previous bookings, </em>to predict revenue from a listing after some fixed amount of time (eg. 1-year revenue). If you're curious, the post also describes some of the pieces of infrastructure used by the system and gives a high-level code examples of training pipeline construction.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/gaming/predictive-modeling-app-marketers-guide/pros-and-cons-of-different-ltv-based-predictive-models-insights-from-top-marketers/">Insights on the Pros and Cons of LTV-based Predictive Models</a> an article from AppsFlyer, we can find a summary of pros and cons of the three common LTV modelling approaches for app-based businesses:</p><ol><li>Retention/ARPDAU model<br>If we have a fairly old and stable product with some historical data, we can leverage the fact that we know the shape of the retention curve and can fit a power curve to several early-retention data points. We also know the <em>Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (ARPDAU) </em>which tends to be stable over time for most freemium and micro-transaction apps (such as free to play games). With some math we can arrive at an estimate of the expected LTV using these two measures. For example, to estimate LTV by day 90 of user's lifetime we would use the following equation: &nbsp;$$LTV_{90}=ARPDAU\cdot\sum_{d=0}^{90}retention[d]$$</li><li>LTV ratio model<br>As a simple example, in order to get $LTV_{90}$ we'll use historical data to estimate the ratio $\frac{LTV_{90}}{LTV_{7}}$ and use the observed 7-day LTV to predict the 90-day LTV</li><li>Behavior driven/user-level models<br>We'd use user-level features to train our favorite machine learning model for regression. …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>It's counterintuitive, but is it right?</p>


<p>In our paper <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a>, we say this about the availability of quorum systems of various sizes:</p>

<blockquote><p>As illustrated in Figure 4, smaller cells offer lower availability in the face of small numbers of uncorrelated node failures, but better availability when the proportion of node failure exceeds 50%. While such high failure rates are rare, they do happen in practice, and a key design concern for Physalia.</p></blockquote>

<p>And this is what Figure 4 looks like:</p>

<p>The context here is that a <em>cell</em> is a Paxos cluster, and the system needs a majority quorum for the cluster to be able to process requests<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>. A cluster of one box needs one box available, five boxes need three available and so on. The surprising thing here is the claim that having smaller clusters is actually <em>better</em> if the probability of any given machine failing is very high. The paper doesn't explain it well, and I've gotten a few questions about it. This post attempts to do better.</p>

<p>Let's start by thinking about what happens for a cluster of one machine (<em>n=1</em>), in a datacenter of <em>N</em> machines (for very large <em>N</em>). We then fail each machine independently with probability <em>p</em>. What is the probability that our one machine failed? That's trivial: it's <em>p</em>. Now, let's take all <em>N</em> machines and put them into a cluster of <em>n=N</em>. What's the probability that a majority of the cluster is available? For large <em>N</em>, it's 1 for <em>p &lt; 0.5</em>, and 0 for <em>p &gt; 0.5</em>. If less than half the machines fail, less than half have failed. If more than half the machines fail, more than half have failed. Ok?</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/quorum_avail_a.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Notice how a cluster size of 1 is worse than N up until <em>p = 0.5</em> then better after. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.5629&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Peleg and Wool</a> say:</p>

<blockquote><p>... for <em>0 &lt; p &lt; ½</em> the most available NDC<sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup> is shown to be the "democracy" (namely, the minimal majority system), while the "monarchy" (singleton system) is least available. Due to symmetry, the picture reverses for <em>½ &lt; p &lt; 1</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, the <em>minimal majority system</em> is the one I'd call a <em>majority quorum</em>, and is used by Physalia (and, indeed, most Paxos implementations). The <em>monarchy</em> is where you have one leader node.</p>

<p>What about real practical cluster sizes like <em>n=3</em>, 5, and 7? There are three ways we can do this math. In <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.5629&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">The Availability of Quorum Systems</a>, Peleg and Wool derive closed-form solutions to this problem<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup>. Our second approach is to observe that the failures of the nodes are Bernoulli trials with probability <em>p</em>, and therefore we can read the answer to "what is the probability that 0 or 1 of 3 fail for probability <em>p</em>" from the distribution function of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a>. Finally, we can be lazy and do it with Monte Carlo. That's normally my favorite method, because it's easier to include correlation and various "what if?" questions as we go.</p>

<p>Whichever way you calculate it, what do you expect it to look like? For small <em>n</em> you may expect it to be closer in shape to <em>n=1</em>, and for large <em>n</em> you may expect it to approach the shape of <em>n=N</em>. If that's what you expect, you'd be right.</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/quorum_avail_b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I'll admit that I find this result deeply deeply counter-intuitive. I think it's right, because I've approached it multiple ways, but it still kind of bends my mind a little. That may just be me. I've discussed it with friends and colleagues over the years, and they seem to think it matches their intuition. It's counter-intuitive to me because it suggests that smaller <em>n</em> (smaller clusters, or smaller cells in Physalia's parlance) is better for high <em>p</em>! If you think a lot of your boxes are going to fail, you may get better availability (not durability, though) from smaller clusters.</p>

<p>Weird.</p>

<p><strong>Correlation to the rescue!</strong></p>

<p>It's not often that my statistical intuition is saved by introducing correlation, but in this case it helps. I'd argue that, in practice, that you only lose machines in an uncorrelated Bernoulli trial way for small <em>p</em>. Above a certain <em>p</em>, it's likely that the failures have some shared cause (power, network, clumsy people, etc) and so the failures are likely to be correlated in some way. In which case, we're back into the game we're playing with Physalia of avoiding those correlated failures by optimizing placement.</p>

<p>In many other kinds of systems, like ones you deploy across multiple datacenters (we'd call that <em>regional</em> in AWS, deployed across multiple <em>availability zones</em>), you end up treating the datacenters as units of failure. In that case, for 3 datacenters you'd pick something like <em>n=9</em> because you can keep quorum after the failure of an entire datacenter (3 machines) and any one other machine. As soon as there's correlation, the math above is mostly useless and the correlation's cause is all that really matters.</p>

<p>Availability also isn't the only thing to think about with cluster size for quorum systems. Durability, latency, cost, operations, and contention on leader election also come into play. Those are topics for another post (or section 2.2 of <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>

<p>JP Longmore sent me this intuitive explanation, which makes a lot of sense:</p>

<blockquote><p>Probability of achieving a quorum will increase when removing 2 nodes from a cluster, each with failure rate p&gt;.5, since on average you're removing 2 bad nodes instead of 2 good nodes. Other cases with 1 good node &amp; 1 bad node don't change the outcome (quorum/not). Repeat reasoning till N=1 or all remaining nodes have p&lt;=.5 (if failure rate isn’t uniform).</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a name="foot1"></a> Physalia uses a very naive Paxos implementation, intentionally optimized for testability and simplicity. The quorum intersection requirements of Paxos (or Paxos-like protocols) are more subtle than this, and work like Heidi Howard et al's <a href="https://fpaxos.github.io/">Flexible Paxos</a> has been pushing the envelope here recently. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06696v1.pdf">Flexible Paxos:  Quorum intersection revisited</a> is a good place to start.</li>
<li><a name="foot2"></a> Here, an NDC is a <em>non-dominated coterie</em>, and a <em>coterie</em> is a set of groups of nodes (like <em>{{a, b}, {b, c}, {a, c}}</em>). See Definition 2.2 in <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bb/cs542-20Spr/readings/reliability/How%20to%20assign%20Votes-JACM-garcia-molina.pdf">How to Assign Votes in a Distributed System</a> for the technical definition of domination. What's important, though, is that for each <em>dominated coterie</em> there's a <em>non-dominated coterie</em> that provides the same mutual exclusion properties, but superior availability under partitions. The details are not particularly important here, but are very interesting if you want to do tricky things with quorum intersection.</li>
<li><a name="foot3"></a> Along with a whole lot of other interesting facts about quorums, majority quorums and other things. It's a very interesting paper. Another good read in this space is Garcia-Molina and Barbara's <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bb/cs542-20Spr/readings/reliability/How%20to%20assign%20Votes-JACM-garcia-molina.pdf">How to Assign Votes in a Distributed System</a>, which both does a better job than Peleg and Wool of defining the terms it uses, but also explores the general idea of assigning <em>votes</em> to machines, rather than simply forming quorums of machines. As you read it, it's worth remembering that it predates Paxos, and many of the terms might not mean what you expect.</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article class="page">







<div id="pagebody">

<section id="content" role="main">
<p>Backup systems could do with a common backup interchange format.</p>
<p>Many version control systems support the git “<a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-fast-export">fast-export</a>” format. It’s a simple format for exporting the contents of a version control repository so that it can be imported into another. It’s a fundamental basis for converting from one system to another.</p>
<p>Backup systems could have something similar. It would be a good to everyone as it frees people to change backup systems without having their backup history locked into their old system. There are several scenarios in which this could be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Migrating to a new backup system that can’t read backups made with the old backup system.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrating from one backup repository to another, when a straight copy of the repository files is not possible, for whatever reason. For example, if there is no file-level access to the backup repository, only a constrained API.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrating to a new configuration that can’t read backups made with the old backup system. For example, changing encryption secrets in a system that only allows one per repository.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My initial requirements for such a format:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s as simple as possible while still working. It doesn’t need to be efficient, only efficient enough to be practical to use.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s possible to stream the format: something like <code>oldbackup export | newbackup import</code> should be possible.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s as independent of the backup systems as possible, and doesn’t embed unnecessary assumptions of the design or implementation of the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My first sketch of a backup interchange format:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sequence of backup generations in order they were made.</li>
<li>Each generation has some metadata, and a list of files and hardlinhks.</li>
<li>Each file has an identifie unique to the generation, metadata (inode) and file content.</li>
<li>File content is a sequence of (offset, blob) pairs, to support sparse files.</li>
<li>Hard links are represented as (pathname, inode) pairs, where the first pathname is the name of the hard link, the</li>
<li>No attempt at de-duplication or re-using files from a previous generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>As YAML, this would look something like this:</p>

<p>YAML used here as an example, actual format may be something else.</p>

<p><em>It is interesting again at the cryptocurrency market if you have missed the latest news. The price of Bitcoin has broken records of the three-year remoteness, with a rate of over $30,000. Opinions about the future of the coin are divided – some believe that we are facing another bubble. In contrast, others believe that the financial market will no longer be the same and that Bitcoin will be much more expensive in the long run. I admit I am not quite sure what is going on. But I am sure ignoring it is at least weird, so I tried to figure out a little bit about what is going on, and in this article, I am going to share my thoughts on whether it is worth invest in Bitcoin.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="846" src="http://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-1024x846.png" alt="Bitcoin to dollar rate - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" title="Bitcoin to dollar rate" srcset="https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-1024x846.png 1024w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-300x248.png 300w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-768x634.png 768w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-1536x1269.png 1536w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-700x578.png 700w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong><em>Bitcoin to dollar rate</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Reasons to pay attention to Bitcoin</h2>



<p>If you have entirely closed financial affairs, enough life savings, and complete confidence in the reliability of the financial instruments you use, then you do not have to.</p>



<p>Similarly, if you believe that your daily needs are at the level you need at any time in your life, they will always be closed by your salary or business income. Namely, you are the kind of person who believes that there is real stability in our rapidly changing world with the regularly appearing “The Black Swan”.</p>



<p>Put, you either have enough money, or you have modest needs and indiscreet self-confidence. In that case, I guess you do not have to.</p>



<p>I am in a different situation. I do not believe in stability and see the absence of demand for many “lifelong professions” and the devaluation of savings and the meager pensions that people have worked for decades.</p>



<p>For that reason, I am interested in risk diversification. In professions, in businesses, in financial instruments. The latter today is the talk. I am willing to explore and consider any possibility to save the money I make and multiply it.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is such a tool. Subprime, perhaps with a foggy future – but a tool. And therefore – it is, at least, worthy of study.</p>



<h2>How to save money</h2>



<p>Some «experts» <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-6-bitcoin-price-predictions-to-watch-in-2021">claim</a> that the price of Bitcoin will reach $100,000, others forecast $300,000, of course, some say that even the figure of $1,000,000 for BTC is quite real. But what (and when, which is no less critical) will be the course, no one knows. All these statements are more like the publicity move of those who make them.</p>



<p>I am more interested in the other thing. When we talk about the Bitcoin rate, we peg it, for example, to US dollar. As we think it is the most reliable currency. But if we are talking about retaining the money for a long time, no financial advisor will ever advise you to keep all the money in it. The investment code indicates that it is necessary to buy different currencies and use other financial instruments (for example, stocks and bonds) to cover risks.</p>



<p>The dollar is rapidly going cheaper. Or everything becomes expensive. You can call it anything you want, but the point is the same. Everyone has examples. Some people rely on official statistics. I will bring out my life’s specifics by just looking at the significant expenses in my wallet. Ten years ago, the iPhone was sold for $499. A standard hotel room could be rented for $50. The price of real estate 20-30 years ago is not even worth remembering.</p>



<p>It is about inflation and about the complex interest that is often the problem. We may think that the numbers are changing slowly, but how in investment capitalisation of interest rates creates miracles and inflation produces a rapid depreciation of savings.</p>



<p>Let us talk about the US. The country with a strong economy, producing the dollar we are talking about. The average annual official <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/">inflation</a> is 2.06%. Many may even say that it can be neglected. Perhaps. If it were not for the capitalization of interest. The purchasing power of $100 in 2000 is equal to the purchasing power of $150 in 2020. And that’s average, groceries have gone up less, and for example, education have gone up much more.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="649" src="http://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-1024x649.png" alt="The purchasing power of the dollar considering «small» inflation 2% annual - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" title="The purchasing power of the dollar considering «small» inflation 2% annual - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" srcset="https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-1024x649.png 1024w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-300x190.png 300w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-768x487.png 768w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-1536x974.png 1536w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-700x444.png 700w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation.png 1820w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong><em><strong><em>The purchasing power of the dollar considering «small» inflation 2% annual&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>And so, again, back to the primary council on finance: to save, you must diversify risks. Real estate, gold, stocks – everyone chooses their instruments.</p>



<blockquote><p>We must remember – person who does not choose any financial instruments and keeps his dollars in bank account is getting poorer.</p></blockquote>



<p>The stock market has been considered a haven for many years. If you do not take a significant risk and do not try to overplay the market – it does help save, at least by covering inflation and, as a maximum allowing you to make money on investments.</p>



<p>But what we see today? Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, vast numbers of people were unemployed, and governments began to pay them various benefits. To cover the budget deficit, $3.5 trillion was <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/money/2020/05/12/coronavirushow-u-s-printing-dollars-save-economy-during-crisis-fed/3038117001/">printed</a> only in the United States. Just think about the number of new money that was newly printed and put on the market. We will not even talk about the fact that the dollar <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp">has not been backed </a>by gold for 50 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What happened in the stock market in 2020 could not be imagined by even the most optimistic analyst. In a year of pandemics, mass unemployment, and stagnant economies, it grows like crazy.</p>

<p>There is no tourism. Restaurants are closed. The State prints and gives out money. People spend it on stocks. Now it’s so conveniently done on the mobile app that even regulators already have <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/17/investing/robinhood-sec-settlement-deceptive-practices/index.html">questions</a> about this simplicity and gameplay.</p>



<p>People who never cared about stocks went to the stock market. And they started buying familiar brands. Economics? No, no one else cares. All that matters are the names that are in the public eye. Tesla’s case study is that the capitalization of the company has grown almost tenfold over the year. And its sales <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue">went</a> up…15 percent.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="518" src="http://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-1024x518.png" alt="Tesla stock price in 2020 - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" title="Tesla stock price in 2020 - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" srcset="https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-1024x518.png 1024w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-300x152.png 300w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-768x388.png 768w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-1536x776.png 1536w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-700x354.png 700w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong><em>Tesla stock price in 2020</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Whether there will be a collapse is not a valid question. A more appropriate question is when it will be. Even the most experienced experts are difficult to answer. Politicians have come into play, and the printing press is not yet scheduled to shut down. I do not doubt that there is a bubble in the stock market.</p>



<h2>And Bitcoin growth in 2020 is not a bubble?</h2>



<p>Now let us look at what is going on in the cryptocurrency market. At first glance, the situation there is remarkably similar to the stock market. Coins are rapidly expensive, and events are reminiscent of 2017. But there are several significant differences.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin has not risen in price due to media publications</h3>



<p>It only got on the news agenda after the price exceeded the three-year-old record. And if in 2017 the attention of «housewives» was focused on cryptocurrencies, today they do not invest in bitcoin – their focus is the stock market. In Google Trends, Bitcoin awareness has <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=bitcoin">increased</a>, but it is by order of magnitude less than three years earlier.</p>

<h3>Institutional investors join the Bitcoin market</h3>



<p>The growth of 2020 is mainly due to the investment business entry. Quoted on the stock market, MicroStrategy also invest in bitcoin – company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/microstrategy-to-raise-400-million-to-buy-even-more-bitcoin">purchased</a> 38,250 btc this year (at current rates of $1 billion). The largest payment services, Stripe and PayPal, began working with this cryptocurrency. Square allows customers to use the cryptocurrency as payment, and PayPal <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency">permitted</a> customers to buy Bitcoin directly from their PayPal accounts.</p>



<p>More and more professional invest in Bitcoin. Even the conservative Ray Dalio (the CEO of one of the largest funds) recently stated that he might have been very categorical and not even right about the future of Bitcoin. “I need to look at the Bitcoin and study it more”, – he recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ray-dalio-bitcoin/">stated</a>. Cryptocurrencies are added to the portfolios of Ark Investment Management, Fidelity Investments, and other funds. And not just investments funds. Even some pension funds are <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/pension-funds-double-crypto-asset-exposure-in-morgan-creeks-fund-to-1">starting</a> to invest in Bitcoin a small portion of their capital.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin is an alternative</h3>



<p>As mentioned earlier, in 2020, everything around us is volatile. Everything is feverish. Somewhere, bubbles are blowing up; somewhere; economies are falling. And capital, again, is looking for diversification. Because there is a lot of money globally, even a tiny fraction of it going to Bitcoin can cause the too high growth we see right now. Growth is driven by investment demand.</p>



<h2>Why bitcoin?</h2>



<p>Even those who are not familiar with the subject of cryptocurrencies have heard that <a href="https://orujaliev.com/invest-in-bitcoin/">Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency</a>. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. So why we talk about Bitcoin?</p>



<p>Bitcoin is finite. It is digital gold. Only much more convenient and liquid. The algorithm is programmed to make just 21 million coins. Now 18.5 million have been mined, but let us not forget that about 4 million are irretrievably lost according to various estimates. Theoretically, the algorithm can be modified, but to do so, 51% of the miners must join and vote for it. The situation is almost impossible because it will make their assets cheaper. </p>



<p>If you invest in bitcoin, bought one coin, you have and will have one. No State or politician can turn on the printing press and blur your share. Bitcoin is popular. There are hundreds of social networks globally, but Facebook owns the market because it overcame the critical group of users, and eventually, more people come there. Cryptocurrencies are similar. There are thousands coins. But <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/global-charts/">70 percent of all capitalization is Bitcoin</a>. If I may say so, it is a market standard. Attempts to create an alternative have been made and are underway, but none of them have succeeded precisely for that reason.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is convenient. No, it is not suitable to buy pizza in a restaurant. It has other challenges and opportunities. For example, it is useful to transfer large amounts of money between countries or to carry capital. You can have as many millions as you want in the account, fly to wherever you want …</p></div></div>

              <!--文章正文--><div><div><div><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0"><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">The Beijing-Shanghai Backbone Network (BSBN), the world’s first long-distance quantum-secured communication route, was put into service on Aug. 30. It links the two cities with a highly-reliable and expandable secure communication expressway</span></span>.</p><p><span size="+0"><span size="+0"><span lang="EN-US">The node in Beijing will also cooperate with Micius, an experimental quantum satellite launched early last year, to lay the foundation for </span><span lang="EN-US">an integrated space-earth</span><span lang="EN-US"> quantum communication network as well as a global quantum communication network.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">BSBN was developed under the leadership of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Several organizations have cooperated in the construction of BSBN, including the China Cable TV Network Co. Ltd., the Shandong Institute of Information and Communication Technology, the USTC Advanced Technology Institute, and the China Bank Regulatory Commission, among others.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><b><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">What is BSBN?</span></span></b>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">BSBN, known officially as the National Demonstration Project of Verification and Application of Quantum Secure Communication between Beijing and Shanghai, has been called the “information security expressway.” </span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">The inter-city quantum communication line, which measures over 2000 km and comprises 32 relay stations, connects the cities of Beijing, Jinan, Hefei and Shanghai. Data can be transferred through the network with absolute security.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span size="+0"><span size="+0"><span>“</span><span lang="EN-US">On the basis of the original fiber line, we utilized quantum key technology to give every message a unique encryption, and then transferred [the messages] through the traditional communication network,” said CHEN Yu’ao, a professor from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and also Chief Designer of BSBN.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">Relay stations were built to solve the problem of signal attenuation during the transmission of the quantum key. In contrast with traditional transmission technology, BSBN’s relay stations will not receive then resend messages in transit. As a result, the whole transfer process will remain under direct control, according to CHEN.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><b><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">Promising Prospect</span></span></b>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">A pilot project of BSBN was launched in January in Shanghai. The network uses quantum-secured fiber lines to connect seven financial institutes in Lujiazui’s Quantum Communication Industrial Park. Already, device adjustment for two of the institutes has been completed.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">Meanwhile, a command center and a big data center are also under construction.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">As part of the project, embedded control software for high-speed detection and quantum key distribution were developed for these centers, respectively.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">Several trials for the quantum communication network are now under way. As part of this process, data is transferred from the data center to another server in the same city, with quantum encryption by USTC. “Theoretically, it is impossible for data encrypted with quantum keys to be intercepted or interpreted. This is critically important for the transfer of financial data,” said REN Changqing, manager of the ICBC Data Center Network Department, one of the units involved in the trials.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">BSBN was constructed with fiber lines at relatively low cost, offering many promising application prospects. According to Prof. CHEN, BSBN can currently provide bandwidth of 100G, with a base project cost of less than RMB 600 million. In contrast, the current cost of comparable bandwidth is RMB 2 billion.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">More quantum communication lines will be built in the future to finally form a network, according to CHEN. “The changes will take place unnoticed; people will enjoy absolute information security without even realizing it,” he said.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">Prof. LU Zhaoyang, also from USTC, said he is expecting mass practical use of quantum communication within a few years. Traditional communication network hardware will be improved, rather than replaced. By installing quantum encrypting devices such as single photon detectors and quantum gateways on both the sender and receiver of the transmission, traditional communication networks can also conduct quantum communication, with obvious security improvements.</span></span>&nbsp;</p></span></span></p></div></div></div><!--文章正文-->

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This story starts with me having to simulate a faulty disk device for testing.
The Linux Kernel Device mapper is a good solution for this, so i created a
faulty device with a simple file backend:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>truncate</span> <span>-s</span> 1G /tmp/baddisk
 losetup /dev/loop2 /tmp/baddisk
 dmsetup create baddisk <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>EOF</span><span> 
    0 6050 linear /dev/loop2 0
    6050 155 error
    6205 2090947 linear /dev/loop2 6205 
 EOF</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These commands setup a new device on <em>/dev/mapper/baddisk</em> with <em>1GB</em> of size.
Starting from sector <em>6050</em>, there are <em>155</em> faulty sectors, where any write and
read operation should cause I/O errors.</p>

<p>I went on and used <em>dd</em> to write to the device, as the first faulty block
should start around <em>3MB</em>, i used the following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>To my surprise, the command succeeded. I assumed some error in my setup and
after re-creating the device mapper target, i tried again. This time with the
following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk
 <span>dd</span>: writing to <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error
 3096576 bytes <span>(</span>3.1 MB, 3.0 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0238947 s, 130 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>Nice, the device behaves as expected! While taking notes in another terminal
and switching back and forth workspaces, i issued the following command again:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>What? It succeeded writing <em>4.1MB</em> of data to a faulty segment of the disk
which should clearly fail! This was strange, but still, after many attempts
with this command writing to the complete device until it got end of space, no
I/O errors were reported by <em>dd</em>.</p>

<p>Looking at the <em>dmesg</em> output, the kernel correctly reported errors with the
underlying device:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> Buffer I/O error on dev dm-3, logical block 757, lost async page write
 <span>[</span>..]</code></pre></figure>

<p>And running <em>badblocks</em> on the device also correctly reported them.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> does dd not report this error?</p>

<p>The difference between the commands is the used block size, so i assumed some
caching beeing the cause for this situation, or maybe dd opening the file with
different flags like O_DIRECT or O_SYNC if smaller block sizes are used?</p>

<p>I straced the <em>dd</em> command and the openat/write and close functions behaved
exacly the same, this time i used a <em>5MB</em> block size for simpler debugging:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> openat<span>(</span>AT_FDCWD, <span>"/dev/mapper/baddisk"</span>, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 3
 write<span>(</span>1, <span>"</span><span>\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0</span><span>"</span>..., 5242880<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 5242880
 close<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>                                <span>=</span> 0</code></pre></figure>

<p>The strace output shows that the succeeding command opens the file without any
notable difference to the command writing with 512 bytes block size.  The write
and close functions return with no error whatsoever. <em>dd</em> simply does not
notice the data loss while writing to the storage!</p>

<p>Making <em>dd</em> use the <em>O_DIRECT</em> flag during file open, or the <em>O_SYNC</em> option
catches the error:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>5M <span>oflag</span><span>=</span>direct
 <span>dd</span>: error writing <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

<p>What is the reason for this? I assume dd, with its standard block size of 512
bytes does not the hit the linux kernels buffered I/O. And with bigger block
sizes, the I/O becomes buffered, async, and as it stands, dd as user space
application does not validate the write operation (using fsync) to notice
errors during buffered I/O operations by default.</p>

<p>This leads us to my next finding: “the linux fsync() gate” that dates back to
2018, starting with the following question on stackoverflow:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42434872/writing-programs-to-cope-with-i-o-errors-causing-lost-writes-on-linux">Writing programs to cope with I/O errors causing lost writes on Linux
</a></p>

<p>And resulting LWN articles:</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/724307/">Improved block-layer error handling</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752063/">PostgreSQL’s fsync() surprise</a></p>

<p>which provide great insight into the linux kernels error handling and how these
errors are upstreamed to user space applications while writing data to faulty
devices.</p>

<p>Long story short: If one uses <em>dd</em> with a bigger block size <em>(&gt;= 4096)</em>, be
sure to use either the <em>oflag=direct</em> or <em>conv=fsync</em> option to have proper
error reporting while writing data to a device. I would prefer <em>conv=fsync</em>, dd
will then <em>fsync()</em> the file handle once and report the error, without having
the performance impact which <em>oflag=direct</em> has.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1500 <span>conv</span><span>=</span>fsync
<span>dd</span>: fsync failed <span>for</span> <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

our JavaScript code where we parse POST request, do some custom logic and call <code>sendEmail(...)</code> on SES service.</p>
<h3 id="0-verify-e-mail-address">0. Verify e-mail address</h3>
<p>E-mail address verification can be done <a href="https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=eu-west-1#verified-senders-email:">here (eu-west-1)</a></p>

<h3 id="1-lambda-function">1. Lambda Function</h3>
<p>We will start with creating Lambda function and choosing NodeJS 8.1 environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jpomykala/a3548903e3454f7d65443053ec412b65">The full code can be found on GitHub Gist</a></p>
<h6 id="import-aws-sdk">import <code>aws-sdk</code></h6>
<p>When we have prepared environment we can start to implement the function. First important thing is that we need to import <code>aws-sdk</code> to use SES and other Amazon services.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>aws</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>aws-sdk</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/index.html">Link to <code>aws-sdk</code> documentation</a></p>
<h6 id="lambda-responses">Lambda responses</h6>
<p>Success and error responses. This part is more important than you think. If we return wrong JSON from lambda function to API Gateway,
the client (contact form in this case) will get HTTP 500 status. Code will be invoked and email sent anyway, but itâ€™s just a good practise to
follow the documentation.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>successResponse</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<p>By using this function we can easily turn on and off e-mail sending from certain domains.</p>

<p>Now we can deploy our function and move to API Gateway.</p>
<p><img src="https://jpomykala.com/assets/2018-08-04/send-mail-fuction-aws.png" alt="aws-lambda-function"></p>
<h3 id="2-api-gateway">2. API Gateway</h3>
<p>Setting up API Gateway for Lambda functions, should be straightforward. There is no need to code any thing, just click-and-play configuration.
In this case I setup my endpoint to receive any http method. For working contact form you will need only <code>http/post</code> method.

<h6 id="things-to-remember">Things to remember</h6>
<ul>
<li>Every time we change something on endpoint configuration we need deploy API again to see changes. <code>Actions -&gt; Deploy API</code></li>
<li>Remember about setting up CORS while using API Gateway. <code>Actions -&gt; Enable CORS</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We can scale this technique to multiple web pages with ease, but this solution in current form has few downsides.
For now the only one protection against DDoS or some similar attack is rate limiter included in Lambda function.
Right now there is no bot protection, no captcha or something like that. We can add Google re-captcha on the contact
form and setup rate limiting on both API Gateway and Lambda function, to avoid unnecessary costs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><figure><div></div></figure><p><span>On Friday, September</span> 13, 2019, Matthew Prince and Michelle Zatlyn, cofounders of the San Francisco  <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/cloudflare/">internet security firm Cloudflare</a>, stood on a slim marble balcony overlooking the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. A cluster of the company's executives stood near Prince, ready to shout out a countdown. “Louder! Loud!” Prince urged them. “Five! Four! Three! …” At 9:30 am sharp, the founders reached down to ring the exchange's famous bell, kicking off the day's trading and offering their 10-year-old company on the public market. It was a rite of passage and also their payday, a moment that unlocked many millions of dollars in newfound wealth.</p><p>More than 100 employees and investors cheered from the trading floor below, their phones held high to capture the scene. Kristin Holloway, employee number 11, looked up at the balcony and snapped photos, then popped them into a text to her husband, Lee Holloway, the company's third cofounder. He was home in California. Every so often, a familiar face pushed through the throng to say to her, “Lee should be here.”</p><p>In Cloudflare's early years, Lee Holloway had been the resident genius, the guy who could focus for hours, code pouring from his fingertips while death metal blasted in his headphones. He was the master architect whose vision had guided what began as a literal sketch on a napkin into a tech giant with some 1,200 employees and 83,000 paying customers. He laid the groundwork for a system that now handles more than 10 percent of all internet requests and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cloudflare-matthew-prince-wired25/">blocks billions of cyberthreats</a> per day. Much of the architecture he dreamed up is still in place.</p><p>But some years before the IPO, his behavior began to change. He lost interest in his projects and coworkers. He stopped paying attention in meetings. His colleagues noticed he was growing increasingly rigid and belligerent, resisting others' ideas, and ignoring their feedback.</p><p>Lee's rudeness perplexed his old friends. He had built his life around Cloudflare, once vowing to not cut his hair until the startup's web traffic surpassed that of Yahoo. (It took a few short months, or about 4 inches of hair.) He had always been easygoing, happy to mentor his colleagues or hang out over lunch. At a birthday party for Zatlyn, he enchanted some children, regaling them with stories about the joys of coding. The idea of Lee picking fights simply didn't compute.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He was becoming erratic in other ways too. Some of his colleagues were surprised when Lee separated from his first wife and soon after paired up with a coworker. They figured his enormous success and wealth must have gone to his head. “All of us were just thinking he made a bunch of money, married his new girl,” Prince says. “He kind of reassessed his life and had just become a jerk.”</p><p>The people close to Lee felt tossed aside. They thought he'd chosen to shed his old life. In fact, it was anything but a choice. Over the next few years, Lee's personality would warp and twist even more, until he became almost unrecognizable to the people who knew him best. Rooting out the cause took years of detective work—and forced his family to confront the trickiest questions of selfhood.</p><p>On the floor of the stock exchange that September morning, Lee's younger brother Alaric weathered the morning in a state of low-grade panic. He snapped selfies with early employees and fired them off in texts to his brother. Alaric had never worked at Cloudflare, and he knew barely anyone there. But his dark hair flopped over his forehead with the same distinctive swoop as his brother's, and his long, tapering face had the same dark eyes and olive skin. “It was surreal,” Alaric says. “People kept looking at me like they knew me.”</p><p>At home with his parents in San Jose, Lee, 38, was restless. He paced the rooms and hallways of the 1,550-square-foot house, a loop he'd been tracing since he'd moved in with them two years earlier. He didn't speak. His parents had the TV on, and they called him over whenever Prince or Zatlyn appeared onscreen.</p><p>Later, he paused at the family's Roku to search YouTube for videos of Cloudflare. Then he resumed his circuit: walking the halls, buzzing his lips, snacking on cashews.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Lee Holloway spends time with his youngest son at home on California's Central Coast.</span><span>Artwork by Amy Friend; Photograph by Jack Bool</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>What makes you</span>  <em>you</em>? The question cuts to the core of who we are, the things that make us special in this universe. The converse of the question raises another kind of philosophical dilemma: If a person <em>isn't</em> himself, who is he?</p><p>Countless philosophers have taken a swing at this elusive piñata. In the 17th century, John Locke pinned selfhood <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/memory/">on memory</a>, using recollections as the thread connecting a person's past with their present. That holds some intuitive appeal: Memory, after all, is how most of us register our continued existence. But memory is unreliable. Writing in the 1970s, renowned philosopher Derek Parfit recast Locke's idea to argue that personhood emerges from a more complex view of psychological connectedness across time. He suggested that a host of mental phenomena—memories, intentions, beliefs, and so on—forge chains that bind us to our past selves. A person today has many of the same psychological states as that person a day ago. Yesterday's human enjoys similar overlap with an individual of two days prior. Each memory or belief is a chain that stretches back through time, holding a person together in the face of inevitable flux.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The gist, then, is that someone is “himself” because countless mental artifacts stay firm from one day to the next, anchoring that person's character over time. It's a less crisp definition than the old idea of a soul, offering no firm threshold where selfhood breaks down. It doesn't pinpoint, for example, how many psychological chains you can lose before you stop being yourself. <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/neuroscience/">Neuroscience</a> also offers only a partial answer to the question of what makes you <em>you</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/neural-networks/">Neural networks</a> encode our mental artifacts, which together form the foundation of behavior. A stimulus enters the brain, and electrochemical signals swoosh through your neurons, culminating in an action: Hug a friend. Sit and brood. Tilt your head up at the sun and smile. Losing some brain cells here or there is no big deal; the networks are resilient enough to keep a person's behaviors and sense of self consistent.</p><p>But not always. Mess with the biological Jell-O in just the right ways and the structure of the self reveals its fragility.</p><p>Lee's personality had been consistent for decades—until it wasn't.</p><p>From an early age, he was a person who could visualize sprawling structures in his mind. Growing up in the 1990s in Cupertino, where his dad worked at Apple, Lee had early access to the latest computers, and he and his brother grew up bingeing on videogames. As a gamer, he was legendary among his friends for being able to read a complex situation, rapidly adjust strategies, and win match after match. And it wasn't just videogames. His childhood friend Justin Powell remembers Lee strolling into a middle school chess club tournament cold. He wasn't a member of the club, but he won the tournament anyway. Lee avoided becoming insufferable by channeling his wit into snarky commentary. “Watching a movie with him was like a version of <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>,” Powell says. “His very presence challenged you to keep up with him.”</p><p>Lee and his friends would cart their computers to each other's houses to play games together. He became curious about the machines themselves and started learning computer science, first in high school, then at a local community college and UC Santa Cruz, where an unlikely set of circumstances connected him with Matthew Prince.</p><p>Then a young entrepreneur, Prince was pursuing an idea for an antispam software tool when he encountered Arthur Keller, a UC Santa Cruz computer science professor. Keller and his students had already worked out a very similar concept. Prince and Keller agreed to share a patent, along with Keller's students. One of those students was Lee, and Prince hired him on the spot. “I had no idea this school project would turn into something much bigger,” Lee later said in a video interview with a group called Founderly.</p><p>Prince set up the company, Unspam Technologies, in Park City, Utah, about a mile from a cluster of slopes where he could indulge his passion for skiing. Lee moved into Prince's basement, at first working for free in exchange for food and housing. But Lee and the other Unspam engineers grew restless, and they started spinning up side projects, including one called Project Honey Pot, which tracked spammers as they crawled the web. That's all it did—it collected and published data on spammers, but it didn't do anything to stop them. Still, the project quickly amassed a loyal following.</p><p>In 2007, Prince left Utah to start business school at Harvard, and Lee moved to California to live with his girlfriend, Alexandra Carey. They'd known each other as undergrads, when she was a teaching assistant in his computer architecture class. Lee had goofed off in that class, once pranking the professor by scrawling childish notes on the transparencies of an overhead projector. Alexandra had been amused, but it wasn't until after college that a relationship bloomed. Living in different cities, they fell for each other while playing and chatting within a multiplayer videogame called <em>Savage</em>. Now, with Prince leaving Utah, it seemed a natural time for Lee to join Alexandra. They married in 2008.</p><div><div><p><span><picture><img alt="This image may contain Electronics, Computer, and Pc" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 775w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 775w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_768%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 768w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_768%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 768w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 640w" sizes="100vw"></picture></span></p><div><h3><a href="https://weekly.statuscode.com/story/wired-guide-to-data-breaches">The WIRED Guide to Data Breaches</a></h3><p>Everything you ever wanted to know about Equifax, Mariott, and the problem with social security numbers.</p></div></div></div><p>Lee and Prince kept working at Unspam from their respective cities, but as Prince was wrapping up business school, Lee called to tell him he was considering other job offers.

            <h3>Reed-Solomon error recovery in RAID-6</h3>
        </p>

        <p>
            https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html
        </p>

        
        
        
        

        
        
        
        

        
        <p>There are lots of resources on the Internet about RAID-6 error recovery and how you can create your own implementation of it, but most of those resources require spending a lot of time fighting with mathematical equations and figuring out the real algorithm.</p>
<p>In this post I'll try to give you a simple example how you can create your own error recovery solution based on what is used in RAID-6. More specifically, if you need to provide rendundancy across your mediums so that a failure of 1 or 2 mediums will be tolerated, look no further! ;)</p>
<p>If you'll read this post, as a bonus you'll gain knowledge about how RAID-5 error recovery works, because RAID-6 is an improved version of RAID-5 error recovery system.</p>

<p>Let's assume you have 3 disk drives with some data. Let's name those drives as <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>. In order to use the same error recovery technique as RAID-6 uses, you'll need two additional disk drives, the <code>PD</code> drive, and the <code>RS</code> drive. I'll describe what <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code> means in few moments. So, you'll need a total of 5 disk drives: <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code>, <code>D3</code>, <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image1.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>So, here's the situation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code> contain <em>arbitrary user data</em>, and it doesn't matter what their contents are. FWIW you can assume those drives are full of cat pictures.</li>
<li>The special <code>PD</code> drive (named after <code>Parity Drive</code>, sometimes called <code>P</code> in whitepapers) contains the XOR data, generated automatically from <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</li>
<li>The second special <code>RS</code> drive (named after <code>Reed-Solomon Drive</code>, sometimes also called <code>Q</code>) contains the Reed-Solomon codes, calculated from the same data as <code>PD</code>, namely from drives <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see how we can perform some basic operations on such disk array.</p>

<p>If we have properly calculated <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code> drives, we can lose up to 2 drives. How we recover from failures depends on which drives will fail. There are generally 7 cases that RAID-6 can handle. Next points will describe the scenarios, sorted from the easiest case, to the most complicated.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>PD</code> drive (failure of only one drive).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-losspd.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This case is very straightforward. The <code>PD</code> drive contains only autogenerated data, so in case we lose the <code>PD</code> drive, we can regenerate it by using only user data (stored on disks <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of one of the data drives: either <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> or <code>D3</code> (failure of only one drive).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-datadrive.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>In this case we're losing data, but since we only lose 1 disk, the recovery scenario is the same as in RAID-5 error recovery: we'll use <code>PD</code> drive <em>together with two non-missing data drives</em> to recover data from the missing data drive. It doesn't matter which data drive we lose, because if we have 2 data drives and the <code>PD</code> drive, we can always generate data for the third drive. The <code>RS</code> drive is not needed to regenerate the data drive in this case (and is not used at all in this failure case).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>RS</code> drive (failure of only one drive).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossrs.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Similar to the situation from point 1: we have all the data drives, and we can simply regenerate the <code>RS</code> drive by calculating Reed-Solomon codes from drives that did not fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>PD</code> drive and the <code>RS</code> drive (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-losspdrs.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This case is very similar to points 1 or 3, we have all the data intact, so we can generate contents of <code>PD</code> drive and then <code>RS</code> drive very easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>RS</code> drive and one data drive (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossdatars.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>In this case we're losing two disks, but only one lost disk is filled with data. Since we have <code>PD</code> drive intact, we can use it to regenerate data from missing data drive, so this case is not so different than case #2. After that, we will have all the data drives, so we can regenerate the <code>RS</code> drive easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>PD</code> drive and one data drive (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossdatapd.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This case is more complicated. We lose one user data drive (in this example <code>D3</code>), and we don't have the <code>PD</code> drive to aid with recovery, because we've lost it as well. We have to use the <code>RS</code> drive in conjunction with all user data drives that are still available (<code>D1</code> and <code>D2</code>) to regenerate the missing data drive <code>D3</code>. After we'll have all data drives regenerated, we can calculate the missing <code>PD</code> drive. This is the first case where recovery using Reed-Solomon codes comes into play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of two data drives (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossdatadata.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the most complicated scenario. We need to use both <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code> to regenerate both data drives. Reed-Solomon coding makes this case possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following sections, I'll try to describe those cases above with more detail, and provide some source code (in Python :P) that will perform actual recovery of data.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that real RAID-6 arrays don't really dedicate whole disk for <code>PD</code> or <code>RS</code>. Real arrays span this additional checksum data across all disks. There are multiple methods used by various controllers: left asynchronous, right synchronous, there can be an offset to the RAID data, there can be pattern delays, etc. Why it's done this way, and how exactly RAID-6 stripes looks like is beyond the scope of this blog post. So let's stick only to Reed-Solomon codes.</p>
<h2 id="test-data">Test data</h2>
<p>Let's define how our "user data" looks like. To keep things simple, let's pretend that our "disk drives" are 5 bytes big.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Disk</th><th>Data in ASCII</th><th>Data in HEX</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>D1</code></td><td>f i r s t</td><td>0x66, 0x69, 0x72, 0x73, 0x74</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>D2</code></td><td>s e c n d</td><td>0x73, 0x65, 0x63, 0x6e, 0x64</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>D3</code></td><td>t h i r d</td><td>0x74, 0x68, 0x69, 0x72, 0x64</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Let's go into the scenarios mentioned above in more details.</p>

<p>In order to generate the <code>PD</code> data, we need only the user data drives. In our case it's <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>. The <code>PD</code> drive consists of nothing more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR">XOR</a> of all user data.</p>
<ul>
<li>To generate offset 0 of the <code>PD</code> drive, you need to XOR all bytes from offset 0 from all disk drives.</li>
<li>Then, to generate offset 1 of the <code>PD</code> drive, you need to XOR bytes from offset 1 from all disk drives. E.g.:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>PD[0] = D1[0] xor D2[0] xor D3[0]
PD[1] = D1[1] xor D2[1] xor D3[1]
PD[2] = D1[2] xor D2[2] xor D3[2]
PD[3] = D1[3] xor D2[3] xor D3[3]
PD[4] = D1[4] xor D2[4] xor D3[4]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>PD[0] = 0x66 xor 0x73 xor 0x74  =&gt;  0x61
PD[1] = 0x69 xor 0x65 xor 0x63  =&gt;  0x64
PD[2] = 0x72 xor 0x63 xor 0x69  =&gt;  0x78
PD[3] = 0x73 xor 0x6e xor 0x72  =&gt;  0x6f
PD[4] = 0x74 xor 0x64 xor 0x64  =&gt;  0x74
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, it's that simple. Do it for the whole drives (in our case, 5 bytes), and you'll have the properly generated <code>PD</code> drive:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Disk</th><th>Data in HEX</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>PD</code></td><td>0x61, 0x64, 0x78, 0x6f, 0x74</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>So, in case when only your <code>PD</code> drive will fail, you can see it's trivial to regenerate it from the data drives <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, this is how RAID-5 error recovery works. If only one drive with user data will fail, we can use the <code>PD</code> drive to recalculate missing user data.</p>
<p>Let's say we're losing <code>D2</code>, so the drives that are still working are: <code>D1</code>, <code>D3</code>, <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code>. In this case, we don't even look at <code>RS</code>. All we need are the <code>D1</code>, <code>D3</code> and <code>PD</code> drives. To calculate missing data, you can use the XOR function again, like in the previous point.</p>
<p>To recover user data from offset 0, XOR the bytes from offsets 0 of disks with user data you haven't lost (<code>D1</code> and <code>D3</code>) together with the byte from offset 0 from the <code>PD</code> drive. Do the same thing for offset 1, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>D2[0] = D1[0] xor D3[0] xor PD[0]
D2[1] = D1[1] xor D3[1] xor PD[1]
D2[2] = D1[2] xor D3[2] xor PD[2]
D2[3] = D1[3] xor D3[3] xor PD[3]
D2[4] = D1[4] xor D3[4] xor PD[4]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>D2[0] = 0x66 xor 0x74 xor 0x61  =&gt;  0x73 (s)
D2[1] = 0x69 xor 0x63 xor 0x64  =&gt;  0x65 (e)
D2[2] = 0x72 xor 0x69 xor 0x78  =&gt;  0x63 (c)
D2[3] = 0x73 xor 0x72 xor 0x6f  =&gt;  0x6e (n)
D2[4] = 0x74 xor 0x64 xor 0x74  =&gt;  0x64 (d)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we can easily recover data from the missing drive. It doesn't matter which drive is missing; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR">XOR function</a> will work anyway.</p>

<p>Now we enter the realm of the Reed-Solomon codes and Galois fields. But don't worry, you don't have to be a mathematician in order to <em>use</em> it.</p>
<p>When we lose only <code>RS</code> drive, or when we initialize a new RAID-6-like redundation system, we simply need to regenerate it. In order to do that, we need to use the <code>gflog</code> and <code>gfilog</code> tables, which are always constant, plus data from our existing data drives <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</p>
<p>This is the <code>gflog</code> table, it always stays the same:</p>
<pre><code><span>    0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x19, 0x02, 0x32, 0x1a, 0xc6, 0x03, 0xdf, 0x33, 0xee, 0x1b, 0x68, 0xc7, 0x4b,

cryptographic functions and it provides <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (<em>TLS</em>) and <em>Secure Sockets Layer</em> (<em>SSL</em>) protocols to applications.</p><p>According to the <em>Arch Linux</em> <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/openssl/">OpenSSL package</a>, <strong>355</strong> packages, out of the
<em>11523</em> available, depend on it. You can find it installed on any Unix system
(and on Windows too!).</p><p>It started in 1998 as a fork of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSLeay">SSLeay</a> and it has been in development since.
Two full-time developers work on it, as well as many volunteers.</p><p>Fast forward to 2014: a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVE</a></em> had been issued regarding a high risk
vulnerability found in OpenSSL. It has been given the name <strong><a href="https://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a></strong>,
because it has been found in the <em>TLS</em>/<em>DTLS</em> heartbeat extension (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520">RFC6520</a>).
This vulnerability allowed attackers to steal sensitive data, such as secret
keys, user names and passwords.</p><p>All the community turned to the OpenSSL project, weighting its implementation
and security policy. Heartbleed have been promptly fixed, but there could be new
vulnerabilities in the future, if security was not properly prioritized during
development.</p><p>At this point, OpenBSD’s folks forked OpenSSL and started a new project:
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a>. It primary goals were to <strong>modernize the codebase and to improve
its security</strong>. This new project hasn’t been adopted by big distributions such
Ubuntu and Arch Linux; instead smaller distributions (at that time) replaced
OpenSSL with LibreSSL on their default configuration, such as Alpine and Void.</p><p>In the last years, LibreSSL have seen a decline in its usage. Alpine switched
back to OpenSSL (<a href="https://lists.alpinelinux.org/~alpine/devel/%3C20181011171746.4c01f758%40ncopa-desktop.copa.dup.pw%3E">link to the thread</a>). Many people and distributions are
considering doing the same, since OpenSSL got the improvement that LibreSSL
aimed for. And it’s still the <em>de facto standard</em> cryptographic library on Unix.</p><h2 id="why-replacing-openssl-now">Why replacing OpenSSL now?</h2><p>OpenSSL works fine, there is no denying that. Every software has <em>out of the box
support for it</em> so it costs no effort in term of additional mainteinance.
However, there are <strong>newer and lighter TLS and SSL implementations</strong>, which many
folks might prefer over the heavy OpenSSL’s one. I, too, prefer lightweight
libraries.</p><p>I am uninstalling LibreSSL on my systems, therefore this might be the perfect
time to experiment with something different. I have found an interesting (and
well done!) library called <em><strong><a href="https://wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a></strong></em> that claims to have an <em>OpenSSL
compatibility layer</em>. It also claims to be 20 times smaller than OpenSSL.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p><strong>wolfSSL</strong> is a small C library; It uses <em>autotools</em> to build and <strong>CMake</strong>
support is being added (sigh!). Upon running <code>configure</code>, I am overwhelmed by
the quantity of compile options available.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/wolf-ssl-configure.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>some of the wolfSSL configure options</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, there is one comfy option which I’ve used
when compiling wolfSSL: <code>--enable-all</code>. It enables all options, including
the OpenSSL compatibility layer and leaves out the <em>SSL 3</em> protocol.</p><p>Upon completing the build and installation (which takes a couple of
minutes), a library <code>libwolfssl.so</code> will be installed into <code>/usr/lib</code>, as
well as a pkgconfig file (<code>wolfssl.pc</code>) and all the headers.</p><h2 id="out-of-the-box-support">Out of the box support</h2><p>Key applications provide support for different SSL implementations other than
OpenSSL. For example <em>curl</em> supports <em>mbedTLS</em>, <em>BearSSL</em> and our <strong>wolfSSL</strong>.
To compile <em>curl</em> using wolfSSL, we just need to add <code>--with-ssl=wolfssl</code> and
we’re done. I am aware of only two packages that have out of the box support
for wolfSSL and they are <em>curl</em> and <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2">wget2</a></em> (not the legacy version!).</p><h2 id="openssl-compatibility">OpenSSL compatibility</h2><p><code>--enable-all</code> configure option enabled the OpenSSL compatibility layer.
To use this layer, according to the <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch13/">documentation</a>, we need to link the wolfssl
library manually by adding <code>-lwolfssl</code> as link argument. We also need to
include the path <code>/usr/include/wolfssl</code> so that the OpenSSL headers in
<code>/usr/include/wolfssl/openssl</code> will be picked up.</p><p>This way both wolfSSL and OpenSSL can coexist on the same system and the latter
can be replaced on a per project basis. However, that’s not what we want since
want to replace OpenSSL at a system level.</p><p>Adding the link flag to each package on the system or patching one by one
is not an option as it would take too much time. Let’s instead apply some
workarounds.</p><p>First, we create a symlink for the headers:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/include/wolfssl/openssl /usr/include/openssl
</code></pre></div><p>Then we create a symlink for each library. OpenSSL provides the following
libraries:</p><ul><li><code>libssl.so</code></li><li><code>libcrypto.so</code></li></ul><p>So we can run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libwolfssl.so /usr/lib/libssl.so
$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libwolfssl.so /usr/lib/libcrypto.so
</code></pre></div><h3 id="fixing-pkg-config">Fixing pkg-config</h3><p>Some software rely on pkg-config for checking OpenSSL dependency since
it provides the following pkg-config files:</p><ul><li><code>libssl.pc</code></li><li><code>libcrypto.pc</code></li><li><code>openssl.pc</code></li></ul><p>My system doesn’t currently have either OpenSSL or LibreSSL installed, so any
attempt to include OpenSSL by using pkg-config will fail. We can fix this by
adding a pkg-config file in <code>/usr/lib/pkgconfig/openssl.pc</code>:</p><pre><code>prefix=/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-musl
includedir=${prefix}/include/wolfssl

Name: openssl
Description: wolfssl C library.
Version: 4.6.0
Requires: wolfssl
Cflags: -I${includedir}
</code></pre><p>Our pkg-config file will include the correct directory containing the OpenSSL
headers. It will also import cflags and link flags from the wolfssl pkg-config.
Let’s try if it works as intended:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ pkg-config --cflags --libs openssl
-I/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-musl/include/wolfssl -lwolfssl
</code></pre></div><p>Yes! Now we just need create symlinks the other two pkg-config files:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/pkgconfig/openssl.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libssl.pc
$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/pkgconfig/openssl.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libcrypto.pc
</code></pre></div><p>Now we’re ready to compile system packages.</p><h2 id="compiling-system-packages">Compiling system packages</h2><p>Before actually going further into the various compile results, there are few
general changes that I’ve done:</p><ol><li>Include the default <code>/usr/include/wolfssl/option.h</code> provided in
<code>/usr/include/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/setting.h</code>. This way we will have a bunch of
defines already included that enable many wolfSSL features.</li><li>Remove some defines from <code>option.h</code> that disable old OpenSSL features, like
old SSL names. While I understand that these features are plainly old (or even
deprecated), projects will still use them as long as they haven’t been
removed upstream.</li><li>Define <code>OPENSSL_NO_WHIRPOOL</code> in the same header as above, since this feature
ins’t implemented in wolfSSL. There are other <code>OPENSSL_NO_*</code> defines there for
unimplemented features, but this one was missing.</li></ol><h3 id="wget">wget</h3><p><em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a></em>, which comes installed on any Unix system, is the first software we’ll
try building with wolfSSL and its OpenSSL compatibility layer.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/wget-error-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>wget compile error</figcaption></figure><p>wget complains about two undeclared identifiers:</p><ul><li><code>CONF_MFLAGS_DEFAULT_SECTION</code></li><li><code>CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_MISSING_FILE</code></li></ul><p>We can fix this by adding the defines from the OpenSSL file <code>openssl/conf.h</code>
to <code>/usr/include/wolfssl/option.h</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span># define CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_MISSING_FILE 0x10
</span><span># define CONF_MFLAGS_DEFAULT_SECTION     0x20
</span></code></pre></div><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/wget-error-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>wget link-time errors about missing symbols</figcaption></figure><p>We arrived at link-time, that’s huge! However, there are 8 undefined symbols:
6 symbols about unimplemented features in wolfSSL, such as <code>i2d_x509_PUBKEY</code>
and <code>a2i_IPADDRESS</code>; 2 symbols regarding wolfSSL functions. The latter could
probably be fixed by adding the proper compile time option to wolfSSL, like
<code>--enable-sslv3</code>.</p><h3 id="rhash">rhash</h3><p>rhash is an utility that calculates and verifies message digests, such as
<em>SHA256</em> and <em>MD5</em>. It is required by CMake, so we can consider it an essential
package. Compiling rhash led to many errors. Let’s look in depth at some of
them.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/rhash-error-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>rhash compile error about RIPEMD160_CTX</figcaption></figure><p><em>rhash</em> uses <code>RIPEMD160_CTX</code> which is not implemented by wolfSSL.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/rhash-error-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>rhash compile error about WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</figcaption></figure><p>This time, rhash access a member of <code>MD5_CTX</code> (which wolfSSL has replaced by
<code>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</code>) using <code>offsetof</code>. The original <code>MD5_CTX</code> struct looks like
this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MD5state_st</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>MD5_LONG</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>C</span><span>,</span> <span>D</span><span>;</span>
    <span>MD5_LONG</span> <span>Nl</span><span>,</span> <span>Nh</span><span>;</span>
    <span>MD5_LONG</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>MD5_LBLOCK</span><span>];</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>num</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>MD5_CTX</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</code> instead looks like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>/* big enough to hold wolfcrypt md5, but check on init */</span>

<span>#endif
</span><span></span><span>}</span> <span>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I think that this incosistency between OpenSSL and wolfSSL structs <em>will</em>
happen again with different data types.</p><h3 id="libssh2">libssh2</h3><p>From the official <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/">libssh2</a> site:</p><blockquote><p><em>libssh2 a client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol</em></p></blockquote><p>curl has a hard dependency on libssh2, so we can consider it another essential
package.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/libssh2-error-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>libssh2 build errors</figcaption></figure><p>This time there are only 2 errors, both about unimplemented features:
<code>EVP_bf_cbc</code> and <code>EVP_cast5_cbc</code>. The man pages are the best source of
information about OpenSSL functions; we can browse them by running:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ man EVP
$ man EVP_bf_cbc
$ man EVP_cast5_cbc
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s split the names and study each part:</p><ul><li><code>EVP</code> is a high-level interface to cryptographic functions</li><li><code>bf</code> and <code>cast5</code> are the name of the algorithms, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)">blowfish</a></em> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAST-128">CAST</a></em>
respectively.</li><li><code>cbc</code>, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#:~:text=Cipher%20block%20chaining%20(CBC),-CBC&amp;text=In%20CBC%20mode%2C%20each%20block,used%20in%20the%20first%20block.">Cipher Block Chaining</a></em>, is a mode of operation that tells OpenSSL
to operate on each block seperately from the others.</li></ul><p>Operating cryptographic functions in <em>CBC</em> mode isn’t really safe nor the
two algorithms above are really popular, so I understand why wolfSSL developers
might have prioritized other things over implementing the two functions above.</p><h3 id="ffmpeg">ffmpeg</h3><p><em><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a></em> is a powerful library and a collection of utilities for handling
images, audio and videos. It is required by <em>Firefox</em>, <em>Chromium</em>, <em>mpv</em> and
another hundred and a half software (at least). We surely don’t want a system
without this library.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/ffmpeg-error.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>ffmpeg build error</figcaption></figure><p>This time there is only one error (but others may still pop up later while
building!). The function <code>BN_sub_word</code> is missing. According to the man pages,
it is the arithmetic function that perform subtractions on big integers.
This seems pretty straightforward …</p></div></div>

<p>So in this situation I don’t have a lens on the front of the camera. So if the camera is going to fire without a lens on it, you have to go to the menus and you’ve have to turn on the setting which will allow the camera to fire when there’s no lens attached. There’s no coupling here. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26.png" alt="" width="1071" height="600" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26.png 1071w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px">This is just a space between the lens and the front of the camera. I did have to turn that feature on that will allow me to shoot without a lens in order to make this work.</p>

It almost has a tilt shift kind of quality like it’s you’re focusing on one point. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31.png" alt="" width="1072" height="599" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31.png 1072w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31-768x429.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px">When you get somebody up front like this, it gives you a blur all the way around.

<p>I’m learning as we go along here, it doesn’t have a flat plane of focus, but I think that’s because of the way I mounted the camera back there. It’s a little bit like a tilt shift. So I didn’t get them quite square, which is kind of cool because I get the face in focus, but the hands or the body go out of focus in the foreground. It’s just kind of cool looking.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39.png" alt="" width="1067" height="596" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39.png 1067w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39-768x429.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1067px) 100vw, 1067px"></p>
<p>One of the reasons I love to carry a light in my bag is anytime I’m doing a street portrait or something, a continuous light is so easy to flip up really fast. It gives us a little bit of light on the face and opens up the shadows. The <a href="https://bhpho.to/32nCIvK">LitraStudio</a> is perfect for that because it’s easy. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40.png" alt="" width="1074" height="601" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40.png 1074w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1074px) 100vw, 1074px">Turn it on and it’s so powerful, it’s worth the weight. It’s not like one of the little tiny ones Litra makes. I like the bigger heavier light because it just gives me so much more power. Especially in a situation like this where you have the sun to deal with.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42.png" alt="" width="1072" height="601" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42.png 1072w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px"></p>
<p>So there you have it. I’m going to do more of this. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44.png" alt="" width="1072" height="602" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44.png 1072w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px">I want to adapt some other lenses to my EOS R and just try to get weird views and that kind of gritty look. This actually was way cleaner than I thought it was going to be. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46.png" alt="" width="1071" height="600" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46.png 1071w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px">I don’t even have something blocking the light between the camera and the lens. I used just a little bit of tape in here. But it projects a great image on the sensor. It’s a little hard to focus but a lot of fun to shoot. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48.png" alt="" width="1071" height="600" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48.png 1071w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px">So I hope you enjoyed this.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>January 06, 2021</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><p>Screen readers are an essential part of using the web for people who are vision impaired, illiterate or have a learning disability.</p>
<p>Today’s screen readers traverse web pages and applications and read out user interface elements, content and allow users to navigate and interact with the web.</p>
<p>There are many screen readers available for different devices and platforms, each with differing levels of functionality, interfaces and features. The most common are JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver and TalkBack.</p>
<p>According to the latest <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/">WebAIM Screen Reader User Survey</a>, when it comes to desktop screen reader usage, JAWS and NVDA are practically equal in usage, with around 40% of respondents reporting that they use one or the other.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://jaketracey.com/webaim-graph.png" alt="Line chart of primary screen reader usage since October 2009. JAWS has steady decline from 68% to 40%. NVDA has steady incline from 3% to 41%. VoiceOver has a slow incline from 10% to 13%.">
<figcaption>Source: WebAIM</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Based on the graph above, there’s a clear pattern over the course of the last 10 years, with NVDA usage increasing as JAWS usage drops, culminating in an inflection point in 2019 when NVDA surpassed JAWS usage for the first time.</p>
<p>As a developer regularly faced with time constraints, I have often wondered: what should be the baseline in terms of testing for screen readers, and what browser and screen reader combinations are the most important to cover in order to achieve the greatest level of WCAG compliance?</p>
<h2>An issue of time</h2>
<p>Given that almost all web applications developed in 2021 are also used on mobile and therefore require testing on both iOS and Android devices, as well as Windows and macOS for desktop users, providing adequate support for such a broad range of scenarios becomes quite difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Let’s say in a best-case scenario, a given page or feature will be tested on the following combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS / VoiceOver</li>
<li>Android / TalkBack</li>
<li>macOS / Chrome / VoiceOver</li>
<li>macOS / Safari / VoiceOver</li>
<li>macOS / Firefox / VoiceOver</li>
<li>Windows / Microsoft Edge / NVDA</li>
<li>Windows / Chrome / NVDA</li>
<li>Windows / Firefox / NVDA</li>
<li>Windows / Microsoft Edge / JAWS</li>
<li>Windows / Chrome / JAWS</li>
<li>Windows / Firefox / JAWS</li>
</ul>
<p>I should clarify that by “best-case”, I am conveniently leaving out any versions of Internet Explorer, but as frustrating as it may be, including it would add at least another 2 rounds of testing.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that WebAIM also recommends using Microsoft Edge with Narrator, but given its low usage, we’ll leave it out (more on this later).</p>
<p>Hypothetically, depending on the size of the functionality or page implemented, let’s say each round of testing takes one hour to complete, assuming the developer has experience with each of these browsers and screen readers.</p>
<p>In this scenario, comprehensively testing screen reader support across all these combinations adds 11 hours of development work – and that’s just to test!</p>
<h2>An issue of fragmentation</h2>
<p>Web developers will be familiar with the issues surrounding browser version fragmentation, and this problem is compounded when testing with screen readers. Contending with not only varying levels of HTML, Javascript and CSS support in the browser can be tough, and to combat this, polyfills and tools like <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a> have made life a lot easier.</p>
<p>When it comes to screen reader version fragmentation, there is very little in the way of either documentation or support for developers. Fixing issues often comes down to a case of trial and error, retesting and hoping for the best.</p>
<p>A piece of information that would be incredibly useful in this area would be <em>penetration of screen reader updates</em> from the vendors. If, for instance, developers knew that there was a high adoption rate of updates among screen reader users, they could be confident that if a screen reader update resolved an issue, patches for older versions could be sunsetted. This approach has worked exceptionally well for browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.</p>
<p>Sadly, there’s not currently any way for a developer to identify the type or version of a screen reader that is being used, so implementing targeted fixes isn’t an option anyway right now.</p>
<h2>A case for dedicated accessibility testers</h2>
<p>Given the scope and time it takes to properly test across so many devices, browsers and screen readers, having dedicated accessibility testers embedded into teams can significantly increase the quality and speed with which properly accessible applications can be produced.</p>
<p>Let’s face it: developers already have a hard time keeping up with the pace of change in their own domain, let alone the level of knowledge required for comprehensive accessibility auditing.</p>
<p>That is not to say that developers should ignore accessibility completely. However, expecting someone to know about a specific bug on a particular combination of code, browser and screen reader is too much, even for the most experienced accessibility-focused developer.</p>
<h2>Why automation isn’t enough</h2>
<p>The old saying "a good programmer is a lazy programmer" comes to mind when I think about testing here. Being lazy myself (although possibly not that great of a programmer), I rely on automated tools like <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">axe</a> to do most of my accessibility for me. While the current range of tooling is excellent, and picks up the most obvious issues, when it comes to screen readers there’s no way around it: you need to manually test.</p>
<p>Why? Well, the current state of both browsers and screen reader support is all over the place. To highlight this, the Powermapper website has a neat <a href="https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/aria/">list of screen reader support for WAI-ARIA attributes</a>. Not throwing shade at any one – things are continuously improving with updates to browsers and screen readers – but the point stands. Current automated testing tools are not going to catch these problems because they essentially test the validity of code, in much the same way as a code linter does.</p>
<h2>A compromise, so we can all still get stuff done</h2>
<p>Not every team has the luxury of a dedicated accessibility tester, or even a dedicated tester for that matter. Sometimes, you just need to do the best you can, with the resources that you have available.</p>
<p>"When can we stop supporting this?" has been the desperate cry of developers for years when it comes to Internet Explorer 9/10 and most recently 11, and as their usage has dropped, so has the rate of developers losing their hair trying to get their code working.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to Microsoft Edge with Narrator, as mentioned earlier. With 1% of users in that survey, and possibly 0% of users for your application or site, is it worth testing on this combination at all? More specifically, what number of users justifies support, and the testing and development overhead that comes with it?</p>
<h3>Windows - Chrome (latest version), NVDA</h3>
<p>As of December 2020, Chrome is by far the most popular browser in the world, with 65.3% of users. Later versions of Microsoft Edge utilize the same rendering engine, so there is a high likelihood that if it works in Chrome, it will work similarly in Edge.</p>
<p>Based on the WebAIM stats, it is a safe bet that NVDA will begin to increase its lead over JAWS over the next few years. Given that it is also open-source and free, I can’t help but draw a comparison to the way Firefox overtook Internet Explorer in the 2000s browser wars.</p>
<h3>macOS - Safari (latest version), VoiceOver</h3>
<p>Safari is a fair distance behind Chrome in terms of users, with 16.7% share as of writing, but it has the benefit of being the default browser in macOS. It is also free, and the support for accessibility features with VoiceOver is second to none. In addition to this, because of the similarity with its mobile counterpart, most likely any issues that are identified in the desktop version will have similar fixes.</p>
<h3>iOS - Safari (latest version), VoiceOver</h3>
<p>Safari is by far the most popular browser on iOS and all other browsers on iOS use the WebKit rendering engine. VoiceOver is the gold standard for mobile screen readers (and the only option for iOS devices), and as such it makes sense to use this combination for testing iOS accessibility.</p>
<h3>Android - Chrome (latest version), TalkBack</h3>
<p>In a similar vein to iOS, being the default browser and screen reader combination for Android makes this a simple choice, as it will cover the vast majority of users on this platform. Although manufacturers do include their own browsers and there are quite a few other options on Android, the vast majority of the time they use the inbuilt rendering engine, so the expectation in terms of accessibility should be similar, if not identical, to the Chrome experience.</p>
<p>This is by no means a catch-all solution for everyone. Each circumstance will be different, and the best course of action would be to engage your users and ask rather than trying to make the decision for them.</p>
<p>The reality is that if your site or application’s design or functionality looks bad or works poorly for a large enough number of your users because it does not support the software that they use, it can have potential ramifications to your business, through sales or reputation. Similarly, poor accessibility will have a negative impact if your users are using older versions of screen readers and browser combinations.</p>
<h2>But what about JAWS, ZoomText, System Access, <em>insert screen reader here</em>?</h2>
<p>At the risk of being slightly incendiary, I dislike the idea of paying for something that I can get for free. NVDA is a project that has brought screen readers to everybody – including those without the financial means to pay for it – so I support it. Along with the clear trajectory of its usage uptake, it is not unreasonable to expect that the majority of users will adopt it in the next 5 to 10 years.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, however, your best bet when it comes to identifying where your testing efforts should be placed is to talk to your users to find out what their needs are and what software they use. If you don’t have access to this information, the proposed testing scope above will suffice for the vast majority of your site or application’s users, and most likely will continue to do so in the years to come.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<blockquote> <em>Odi et amo: quare id faciam fortasse requiris.</em><br><em>Nescio, sed fieri sentio et excrucior.</em> </blockquote>
<p><strong>This simple but heartfelt</strong> couplet (translation above by James Michie in 1969) is the best-known Latin love epigram â€“ a short poem in elegiac metre â€“ that survives from Ancient Rome. Composed by the poet Catullus around <span>55 BCE,</span> <span>number 85</span> of his book of <span>116 poems,</span> it pithily encapsulates the searing conflict of emotions that he claims to be experiencing in the course of his affair with a younger married woman, who is addressed in other poems as his â€˜girlâ€™ (<em>puella</em>) and by the pseudonym â€˜Lesbiaâ€™. But for such a short poem â€“ just 14 words in Latin â€“ it has raised a whole host of questions, and hundreds of pages have been written about it. What is the point of the poem? How should it be translated from the Latin? How does it relate to the poetâ€™s life and feelings? Its psychology comes across as complex and strikingly modern, as does much of Catullusâ€™s poetry; to some, the questions it raises might seem more suited to a post-FreudÂ­ian examination of mental conflict than to the concerns of an ancient poet. We might recognise that the opposite emotions of love and hate can be simultaneously entertained; but how, after all, does that work?</p>
<p>In its original Latin, <span>Poem 85</span> is a so-called elegiac couplet, in which a longer line (hexameter) is followed by a shorter one (pentameter). The words of the poem have been placed with care. The couplet is composed in a criss-cross pattern, beginning and ending with two verbs of intense emotional connotation: <em>odi</em>, â€˜I hateâ€™; and <em>excrucior</em>, â€˜Iâ€™m rackedâ€™. The first line concludes with the questÂ­ioning <em>requiris</em>, â€˜you askâ€™; the second opens with the answer <em>nescio</em>, â€˜I donâ€™t knowâ€™. The middle of the first line has <em>faciam</em>, â€˜I doâ€™; the middle of the second has its passive counterÂ­part <em>fieri</em>, â€˜is being doneâ€™ (related to <em>fiat</em> â€“ literally, â€˜let it be doneâ€™).</p>
<p>The couplet thus mimics by its shape the image of the poet being pulled apart in opposite directions, an image made explicit by the verb <em>excrucior</em>. That word (the root of our â€˜excruciatingâ€™) will have evoked for Romans the noun <em>crux</em> (plural <em>cruces</em>). Although in the <span>1st millennium CE</span> <em>crux</em> came to be heard almost exclusively to mean â€˜crossâ€™ with reference to the crucifixion of Christ, in CatullÂ­usâ€™s time it was more commonly used to signify the â€˜rackâ€™. This was the standard instrument of torture in the Roman world, to which unfortÂ­unate victims were bound by their hands and legs so that their bodies might literally be pulled apart.</p>
<p>While Catullus remains utterly infatuated with Lesbia, she has proved to be <br>distressÂ­ingly fickle to him</p>
<p>No less cruel and visible as a method of executÂ­ion in the Roman world was crucifixion. Catullus was in his teens when in <span>71 BCE</span> the slave-revolt led by Spartacus was quelled, and he would probably have witnessed at first hand the gruesome sight of 6,000 captured slaves being nailed or strung up to die on wooden crosses along the Appian Way leading from Rome to Capua. WhatÂ­ever the precise image intended by Catullus as a parallel to his own feeling of torment, what is evident is that the combination of hate and love, pulling him in different directions, is making him feel as if he is being â€˜racked to deathâ€™: the <em>ex</em> of <em>excrucÂ­ior</em> connotes a process leading towards expiry and extinction, as well as extenÂ­sion â€“ both in time and across space. Moreover, Catullus claims, thereâ€™s nothing he can <em>do</em> about it: heâ€™s simply the object of this torturous and self-contradictory feeling. His response to someone who might wish to enquire (<em>requiÂ­ris</em>) about what heâ€™s â€˜doingâ€™ (<em>faciam</em>) is that heâ€™s not â€˜doingâ€™ anything, but that he senses (<em>sentio</em>) it â€˜being doneâ€™ (<em>fieri</em>) to him: the passive form of the verb corresÂ­ponds to his own passivÂ­ity in the process heâ€™s describing.</p>
<p>However, just before Catullus presents himself as the helpless victim of opposing emotÂ­ions, the answer he gives to the imagined question is unequivocal: â€˜I donâ€™t knowâ€™. The implication of <em>nescio</em> (the negative of <em>scio</em>, â€˜knowâ€™, whence comes our word â€˜scienceâ€™) has been overlooked by generations of translators from the Latin, who have rendered the word <em>quare</em> as â€˜whyâ€™ or â€˜the reason whyâ€™ rather than â€˜howâ€™ â€“ even though itâ€™s clear that Catullus does know, as do his readÂ­ers, why or for what reason heâ€™s prey to emotional conflict. For instance, one of the poemâ€™s earliest English transÂ­lators, the poet Richard Lovelace (1617-57), renders it as:</p>
<blockquote>I hate and love; wouldâ€™st thou the reason know?<br>I know not, but I burn, and feel it so.</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the translator in the popular Loeb series, which prints classical texts with facing versions in straightforward English, in 1976 had it as:</p>
<blockquote>I hate and love. Why I do so, perhaps you ask? <br>I know not, but I feel it, and I am in torment.</blockquote>
<p>Such translations using â€˜whyâ€™ followed by â€˜I donâ€™t knowâ€™ ask us to suppÂ­ose that Catullus is claiming an inability to understand the reason for his painful emotional turmoil. Yet the poet has already made it abundantly clear, in several other poems describing his affair with Lesbia, that he knows the reason only too well: while he remains utterly infatuated with her, she has proved distressÂ­ingly fickle to him, willing to be unfaithful not only to her husband but to her adultÂ­erous liaison with the poet too. In <span>Poem 72</span> (my translation), Catullus analyses the effect on him of Lesbiaâ€™s infidelity:</p>
<blockquote>You used to say you had eyes for Catullus alone, <br>Lesbia, and would rather hold me in your arms than Jove. <br>My feelings for you then were not just vulgar lust,<br>but the kind of love a father feels for his children and their kin. <br>Now that I know your ways, my desire for you burns ever fiercer,<br>even though youâ€™re far shabbier in my eyes, and flightier. <br>How can this be, you say: itâ€™s because such hurtful treatment <br>is bound to make one desire oneâ€™s lover more, but like them less.</blockquote>
<p>How is it possible, in terms of logic or emotion, to feel both hate and love towards the same person at the same time?</p>
<p>In the final couplet here, Catullus explains to the reader, in terms very similar to those he uses in <span>Poem 85,</span> the paradox of his feelings. The enquirer doesnâ€™t need to ask the cause of the poetâ€™s pain, here described as <em>iniuria</em> (â€˜hurtful treatmentâ€™) because itâ€™s easy to understand: Catullus is wounded by Lesbiaâ€™s sexual intimacy with other lovers and hotly resents her behaviour; but his desire for her, perhaps intensified by the prospect of losing her to a love-rival, is even stronger.</p>
<p><strong>The reader might still </strong>ask how such divergent feelings as love and dislike can coexist in a lover and be directed towards the same object â€“ indeed, the final line above describes someÂ­thing that feels like such an emotional contradiction, the combinÂ­ation of desire with disliking. That divergence is, in <span>Poem 85,</span> yet more starkly expressed with â€˜I hate and loveâ€™ (rendered more emphatically in translations that repeat the â€˜Iâ€™: â€˜I hate and I loveâ€™). But, again, Catullus would expect the reader to ask not â€˜whyâ€™, but â€˜howâ€™; that is, how is it possible, whether in terms of logic or emotion, for someone to feel both hate and love towards the same person at the same time? Since Catullus knows, as do his readers, <em>why</em> heâ€™s prey to these contradictory feelings, only in answer to the question â€˜howâ€™ can it be reasonable for him to follow up, as he does, with â€˜I donâ€™t knowâ€™. Having declared his ignorance of how the perplexing phenomenon of simultaneous opposing emotions can arise, he then abandons analysis and simply testifies to his own torment.</p>
<p>The correctness of the translation of <em>quare</em> as â€˜howâ€™ is confirmed by lexical data. In Catullusâ€™s time and before (as found, for example, in passages written by Catullusâ€™s older contempÂ­orary, the orator Cicero) <em>quare</em> is used to mean â€˜howâ€™ or â€˜in what wayâ€™. It comes to mean â€˜whyâ€™ in the course of the languageâ€™s histÂ­Â­ory; but given the compelling contextual and linguistic arguments for the understanding of what Catullus is asking in <span>Poem 85,</span> what explanation can there be for the persistÂ­ent mistranslation of <em>quare</em> as â€˜whyâ€™ rather than as â€˜howâ€™ in English? (TransÂ­lations into other languages such as Italian, German and French also tend to fluctuate between rendering <em>quare</em> as â€˜whyâ€™ and â€˜howâ€™).</p>
<p>One answer must be that translators have been influenced by a later Latin couplet thatâ€™s as famous as Catullusâ€™s, and indeed alludes to it. A satirical squib <span>(number 32)</span> composed by the poet Martial in the late <span>1st century CE,</span> more than <span>100 years</span> after Catullusâ€™s death, uses the same couplet form:</p>
<blockquote>I donâ€™t like you, Sabidius, and Iâ€™m unable to say why:<br>All I can say is this: I donâ€™t like you.</blockquote>
<blockquote> <em>Non amo te, Sabidi, nec possum dicere quare: </em><br><em>Hoc tantum possum dicere: non amo te</em>.</blockquote>
<p>Nothing is known of the context of the epigram or of the implied feud between the poet and the otherwise unknown Sabidius. But the poem has won a firm, if anecdotal, place in the annals of Latin studies in England. The story (undoubÂ­tedly apocryphal) is told how, as a student at Christ Church College, Oxford, the writer Thomas Brown (1662-1704) committed a misdeÂ­meanour and was sent for punishment to the college dean, a <span>Dr Fell.</span> The dean required Brown to transÂ­late some Latin verse on the spot, and opened a book of epigrams at random to present him with Martialâ€™s couplet. After a momentâ€™s thought, Brown recited, allegedly to the deanâ€™s delight, his witty and memorable version of the poem:</p>
<blockquote>I do not like thee, Doctor Fell, <br>The reason why I cannot tell; <br>But this I know, and know full well, <br>I do not like thee, Doctor Fell.</blockquote>
<p>In the case of Martialâ€™s epigram, â€˜the reason whyâ€™ is a …</p></div></div></div>

<b>Generational references</b> are a new memory management technique that's easy, deterministic, and <i>very</i> fast.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
This technique is the first ingredient in Vale's final <a href="https://vale.dev/blog/hybrid-generational-memory">hybrid-generational memory</a> design, which is even faster. Our eventual goal is to be as fast as Rust, and perhaps even as fast as C++, while being safer than both. <a href="#note0" data-noteid="0">0</a>
</p>
<p>
This article explains how generational references work, how they compare to reference counting, and what makes it all so fast. <a href="#note1" data-noteid="1">1</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="built-on-single-ownership">
 Built on Single Ownership</h2>
<p>
Recall that in Vale, an object is freed when its <b>owning reference</b> goes out of scope. An object always has exactly one owning reference pointing to it.
</p>
<p>
We can have as many <b>non-owning</b> references as we want. <a href="#note2" data-noteid="2">2</a>
</p>
<p>
In other languages, when a programmer frees an object and then accidentally dereferences a non-owning reference to it, it can cause memory unsafety and vulnerabilities. <a href="#note3" data-noteid="3">3</a>
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to detect this situation and react to it safely. <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="generational-malloc-and-the-sacred-integer">
 Generational Malloc and the Sacred Integer</h2>
<p>
Generational references use <b>generational malloc</b>, which is like regular malloc, except at the top of every allocation is a <b>generation number</b>, which tracks how many objects have previously been at this memory location.
</p>
<p>
One could also think of it as describing "I am the <b>n</b>th inhabitant of this memory location".
</p>
<p>
Freeing an object will increment its generation number. Nobody else ever modifies it.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Later on, we use this number to see if a particular object is still alive, explained further below.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational malloc would normally be an adjustment to mimalloc or jemalloc, but we can simulate it with our own <span>genMalloc</span> and <span>genFree</span> functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>genFree</span> increments the generation number, and instead of calling <span>free</span> <a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a><a href="#note6" data-noteid="6">6</a>, remembers the allocation in a free-list. There's a free-list for every size class (16b, 24b, 32b, &lt;=48b, &lt;=64b, &lt;=128b, etc).
</li>
<li>
<span>genMalloc</span> pulls from a free-list if possible. If it's empty, it calls <span>malloc</span> and initializes the generation number to 1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find our experimental implementation in <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a>.

Vale's references are <b>generational references</b>. A generational reference has two things:

To create a reference to an object, we get its allocation's generation number, and include it in the reference.

To dereference a generational reference, we do a "liveness check" to see whether the allocation's generation number <b>still matches</b> our reference's target generation. <a href="#note7" data-noteid="7">7</a>

This prevents use-after-free problems, and makes Vale completely memory safe.

and the person who opens the door says:

Generational references are only the first steps towards hybrid-generational memory, but we decided to run some early experiments to see how it compares to existing memory models.
</p>
<p>
For this experiment, we benchmarked <a href="#note9" data-noteid="9">9</a> <a href="#note10" data-noteid="10">10</a> three flavors of Vale:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Unsafe</b>, with no memory safety, the equivalent of C++ (minus caveats, see below!)
</li>
<li>
<b>RC</b>, where we use naive reference counting for all our objects.
</li>
<li>
<b>GM</b>, which uses generational references.

<b>Note these caveats!</b> To isolate the difference between generational references and the other approaches:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In all flavors, we only allocate objects on the heap, except for primitives. Future versions will add stack allocations.
</li>
<li>
We used <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a> for all versions, though only GM ever touches the generation number, the other versions ignore it. Future versions will integrate generational malloc into jemalloc or mimalloc directly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we address these limitations, we can get more precise benchmarks against the other approaches.

Generational references are much easier for the CPU to handle than reference-counted references, because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Generational references have no aliasing/dealiasing overhead, just on dereference.
</li>
<li>
Generational references cause less cache misses.

 No Aliasing Costs</h3>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Reference counting is costly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Whenever we "alias" (make a new reference to an object), we have to dereference the object to increment its counter.
</li>
<li>
Whenever we "dealias" (throw away a reference), we have to:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Dereference the object to decrement its counter,
</li>
<li>
If the counter is zero, deallocate it.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
For example:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>launchShip</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>, <span><span><span>armada</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>List</span>&lt;<span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>)</span> <span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<br>    <p>  <span><span>armada</span><span>.</span><span>add</span>(<span>ship</span>)</span>;</p><p>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  
<p>
As you can see, reference counting incurs a cost whenever we alias or dealias. <b>Generational references don't have that cost.</b> The above snippet would have zero overhead if it used generational references.
</p>

</section>

      </div>
  


    </div>
    <div>
      <div>

<p>
Instead, generational references incur a cost whenever we dereference an object:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>getShipName</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>)</span> <span><span>str</span> </span><span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<p>  <br>  <br>  <span>ret <span><span>ship</span><span>.</span><span>name</span></span>;</span><br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  

</section>
<section>
<p>
This is cheaper because <b>programs dereference less than they alias and dealias:</b> our sample program had 4.7 million counter adjustments, but only 1.3 million liveness checks. <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a> <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3 id="more-cache-friendly">
 More Cache Friendly</h3>
<p>
Reference counting is not very "cache friendly". Adding and subtracting integers is basically free on modern CPUs, but the real bottleneck in modern programs is how <i>far</i> those integers are: if it's been recently accessed, it's in the nearby cache, and only takes a few CPU cycles to fetch. Otherwise the CPU will "cache miss" and have to bring it in all the way from RAM, which could take <b>hundreds</b> of cycles. <a href="#note13" data-noteid="13">13</a>
</p>
<p>
In our reference-counted <span>launchShip</span> example, the <span>ship.__ref_count++</span> could take a few cycles if <span>ship</span> is already in the cache, or hundreds of cycles if it's not.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational references are more cache friendly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When a generational reference goes away, we don't need to reach into memory (unlike RC, where we have to decrement a counter).
</li>
<li>
We don't need to increment when aliasing (see previous section); we don't need to reach into memory to increment.
</li>
</ul>

</section>

      </div>
  
<div>

      <div>
        <div>
    
<div id="note11" data-noteid="11">
<p><span>11</span></p><section>
<p>
 Half of these are aliasings and half are dealiasings. Aliasing happens whenever we access a member (e.g. <span>person.name</span>) or make a new reference (e.g. <span>&amp;person</span>).
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note12" data-noteid="12">
<p><span>12</span></p><section>
<p>
 Many languages are able to skip a lot of the adjustments, using static analysis. For example, Lobster can remove up to 95%. Our experiment doesn't have those optimizations; it compares naive RC to naive generational references.

<p>There's a classic old idiom, "don't put your eggs all in one basket". The reasoning goes, what if the basket breaks? What if the basket isn't big enough, or gets stolen, or was cursed by a witch or something? It's important to have redundancy, to spread the eggs across many basket so that there's no one single point of failure.</p>
<p>But if we look at society, if we look at the internet, if we look at the communities we've built ourselves around... unfortunately, I believe that's exactly what a lot of us are doing. Being able to be yourself, being able to choose how you present yourself to the world, being able to tailor your living environment to your needs and desires? That's all very, very important. But if you give the keys to your self-expression and the options for the communities you belong in to one small, largely unknown group of people, that's not good.</p>
<p>In this ludicrously in-depth article, we'll be discussing how society limits both individual and community self-expression both online and offline.</p>
<h2>Part 1: The Third Place</h2>
<p><img alt="A house, labeled '1', an office complex, labeled '2', and a '3' with a question mark" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/thirdplace.png"></p>
<p>Very, very broadly speaking, a working-class person (that is, not an "owner" like a CEO, landlord, or investment banker) lives their life in three kinds of places. The first place is home. It's where you sleep, it's where you do your hobbies, it's where you have privacy and family and possibly friends if you want to invite them over. The second place is work, where you do a job to contribute to society and receive wages.</p>
<p>But clearly, we do more than that. We go to other places. Grocery stores and shops, of course, but besides that. The "third place" is where you spend your time in public, in your community. American urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg, who came up with the concept of "the third place" in his 1989 book "The Great Good Place", defines the third place as (commonly seen as) eight characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no obligation to be here for legal, survival, political, etc. reasons. You can just <em>not show up</em>.</li>
<li>Everyone is equal. The rich, the poor, the minorities and the majorities all intermingle together in one common space.</li>
<li>Conversation and socializing is the main activity. You go here to "hang out".</li>
<li>They're accessible and accommodating for anyone who wants to visit.</li>
<li>It's a place where people regularly go, and whose regulars give the space its vibe and characteristics.</li>
<li>The physical place is not overly pretentious or imposed. It feels like <em>the community</em>, like an extension of home.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, the vibe here is more calm and friendly and playful than actively hostile and argumentative.</li>
<li>You feel like you have genuine ownership in the place, as if it's almost a communal home for you and the people you care about.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's a relatively high bar, when spelled out like that. In pandemic-era America you'd be very hard pressed to name a place like this. Offline, anyways. But this sort of pattern has shown up a lot in history, because as it turns out people <em>like</em> having a communal space to just vibe in.</p>
<h3>The Town Square</h3>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo.jpg"></p>
<p>The most obvious example in urban environments is the town square or the plaza. It's an open area in the middle of town, usually with benches and close access to shops and homes and such. Pictured is <em>La Plaza del Zócalo</em>, the main square of Mexico City. It's been a meeting spot for the people of the area since the Aztec times, an important location for numerous historical events, and significant enough to warrant its own Wikipedia page. That's really amazing for a 240 m^2 slab of concrete. What's even more amazing is that it <em>wasn't</em> always a slab of concrete. Here's a model of how it looked in 1910.</p>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo1910.jpg"></p>
<p>It was a big park area! With a bunch of trees and benches and everything. Unfortunately, the very shaky politics of 20th century Mexico left the area in major disrepair by the 1970s, and it became that. I am not from Mexico, nor do I know anyone from the region, so I can't comment on what that did to the community in Mexico City. But as an outsider, I'd consider the 1910 Zócalo much more friendly and inviting than the modern one, which is literally a flat surface with a flagpole in the middle all surrounded by a busy road.</p>
<p>Obviously that isn't the only example. These tend to be a staple of small European and Hispanic towns. Just, a place, in your neighborhood, to go and chill. Other famous examples include the Roman Forum, the Greek Agoras, the National Mall of Washington D.C, and the "quads" or "diags" of most college campuses.</p>
<h3>Shopping Malls</h3>
<p>It is incredibly worth pointing out that town squares only make sense in urban contexts, where there's a dense population of people who live, work, and shop in one general area. The appeal of town squares is that they're basically on the way to wherever you're going, so it's a really nice spot to meet up with friends or just go if you're bored.</p>
<p>Suburbia is <em>not</em> that. Or, more accurately, it is that, <em>at the scale of the car.</em> See, America's fascination of suburban sprawl has a long detailed history to it. Paraphrasing from (imo) a very good book, "Repairing the American Metropolis: Common Place Revisited" by Douglas S. Kelbaugh, the blame of sprawl can be pinned down largely on cultural reasons. First off, Americans always solved their resource and land division issues by expansion, growth, "moving out west". It was the safety valve to avoid actually thinking about difficult problems. At the time this was seen as the country's "manifest destiny", which eventually led to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfoQBTPY7gk">unnervingly cheery songs on children's television happily glossing over the genocide of Native Americans like it was no big deal</a>. And, heck, if we got all this elbow room, why not make everything really, really big? Big houses, big rooms, big parcels of land. And really, really cheap too, because of the glutton of natural resources. And sure, that'll get old and worn sometime, but some of the population will leave for greener pastures anyways, so there's no need to change anything.</p>
<p>So, around the early-to-mid 20th century, when cities were getting too full of colored people who were just demanding rights too loudly, most of the rich white people just up and left. They settled suburban areas outside the cities, less densely populated, with all the backyard space you need to cook out with your neighbors. And via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a>, it was possible to dig very deeply a concrete "us vs. them" line in the dirt. The newfangled highway system just made it easier to separate the houses from the factories, to drive a wedge in the population. Also, just to drive the point home, federal, state, and local governments have subsidized services like sewer pipe connections, energy, and road building, often funded by taxes generated from the more urban, more productive areas.</p>
<p>An incredibly good example of this is to compare Flint and Burton, MI to the surrounding cities of Grand Blanc, Flushing, and Davison. I could spend a lot of time on this but I'd rather just do a visual comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/grandblanc.jpg">
<img alt="Section of the Flint River of Flint, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/flintriver.jpg"></p>
<p>It should be laughably easy to tell which one is which. (The first pic is the Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, which was the first image Google gave me. The second pic is a section of the Flint River between downtown Flint and Kettering University. I took that pic during an urbex tour a few years back, because Flint was somewhat nearby and makes for <em>amazing</em> urbex pics.)</p>
<p>Where this starts to cause issues is that instead of having one core neighborhood with residential, commercial, <em>and</em> industrial areas (in a SimCity-esque model), we've split those sections into their own, largely independent areas, often harshly split on racial or class boundaries. We've got gigantic swaths of houses with maybe a corner store and a gas station, we've got giant industrial parks or office complexes, and we've got the commercial districts.</p>
<p>It's the commercial districts I really want to highlight here. If the residential areas are home, and the industrial/office parks are work, then clearly the third place is the commercial district. Now, there's two ways to approach that. </p>
<p><img alt="A strip mall" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/stripmall.jpg"></p>
<p>The most common approach is to just put a bunch of boxes next to each other, surround it with a parking lot, and call it "a strip mall". Occasionally there will also be a "big box" store, like a Wal-Mart or a Target or a Best Buy or a Kohl's or a Home Depot, either attached or detached.</p>
<p>In the very worst scenarios, you're subject to drive through the <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/10/30/the-stroad">"stroad", or street-road</a>, where all the shops each have their own driveway and their own parking space and it's hostile to both people <em>and</em> cars.</p>
<p>You drive here (or take the bus, if you're poor and you're fine with the once-an-hour service), you shop, you drive home. You don't really spend time here. There is literally nothing here besides concrete boxes. And also the constant issue of cars driving past you. Hope you like sprinting across five lanes of traffic moving at 40 mph!</p>
<p>Enter Austrian-born architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Gruen">Victor Gruen</a>. After fleeing to America from the Nazis, on account of being a Jewish socialist, he slowly worked up the career ladder, from draftsman to architect. And he absolutely saw the issues of suburban sprawl. In the 1950s he gave a speech where he called the suburbs "avenues of horror ... flanked by the greatest collection of vulgarity ... ever collected by mankind."</p>
<p><img alt="The Strand Arcade in Sydney CBD, Australia, opened 1892" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/arcade.jpg"></p>
<p>As an alternative, he envisioned a single building, a few shops surrounded by a shared courtyard, protected from the weather. Something of an iteration of the old "arcades", like the Strand Arcade in Sydney, Australia as pictured above. The courtyard was the most substantial improvement, it was somewhere to go <em>in between</em> shopping. The arcade was just a straight hallway normally, literally just shops in a building. The shopping mall was a <em>destination</em>.</p>
<p>Victor has larger goals in mind. He expected this to be just <em>one</em> part of a new, dense, suburban community. He imagined indoor malls with housing, with schools and libraries and doctor's offices and offices, perhaps surrounded outside by high density housing …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many DevRel and community teams struggle to demonstrate how their activity impacts key metrics, like revenue.</p><p>We recently learned of a new SaaS metric proposed by <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/">OpenView Partners</a> that we think can help, since it can contextualize the results of community activity within a broader business situation, and help show the impact of community on business growth.</p><p>It’s called <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/new-saas-metric/">Natural Rate of Growth</a> (NRG), and it’s essentially, “<em>how fast a company grows without even trying—before layering on incremental investments in sales and marketing</em>.” Here’s the equation:</p><pre><code>NRG = 100 x Annual Growth Rate x % Organic Signups X % ARR from Products</code></pre><p>In other words, <strong>if your company immediately halted paid search, banner ads, outbound efforts of the sales team, and big marketing campaigns, how much and how quickly growth increase?</strong></p><p>As it turns out, <em>many companies are asking this very question</em>, which creates the perfect opportunity for DevRel and community teams to shine by influencing NRG.</p><p>NRG exists to measure a product's ability to grow through a combination of non-paid traffic and product-centric upsells, like inviting teammates and upgrading one’s plan. <strong>These are areas community teams already influence, but most don’t have a great way to communicate the impact of their effort</strong>. We think NRG is one way to tell the story.</p><p>So how can a company drive more organic signups and ARR from products?</p><h3>Community drives NRG</h3><p>At <a href="http://orbit.love/">Orbit</a>, we think<strong> one way community delivers business value through the generation of organic signups</strong>, which has the side effect of driving ARR from products.</p><p>If you have a high gravity community with engaged and passionate users, they’ll continue engaging with each other whether or not your company is actively participating.</p><p>Just look at <a href="https://community.airtable.com/">Airtable’s community forum</a>. It sees hundreds of posts per week, with the vast majority of engagement coming from non-Airtable community members. If the Airtable team stopped replying to messages for a month, the community would continue to operate.</p><p>Search engines would continue indexing discussions that happen there, and other users would continue to find helpful community-generated content. That content would drive more usage, and lead to deeper product usage and interest in paid features, like Blocks, leading to in-product upgrades. In other words, NRG would increase.</p><p>If community drives growth, how can you increase and measure and expand your community?</p><h3>Gravity helps measure a community’s growth</h3><p>In the <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model">Orbit Model</a>, Gravity is the attractive force of a community that acts to retain existing members and pull in new ones, and we think it’s a key top-level metric company leadership should track.</p><p>It’s based on <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model#reach">reach</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model#love">love</a>, so an increase in gravity means two things.</p><p>First, it means the community has increased its ability to drive awareness about the community and the product it's built around (Reach). Second, it means the community has increased its level of activity, through PRs, content creation, active discussions, and more (Love).</p><p>When a community's influence and activity increase, so does its gravity.</p><h3>Gravity, NRG, and revenue</h3><p>So what about key SaaS metrics, like revenue and NRG?</p><p>Revenue is the end goal, but if community teams try to influence revenue directly, they risk alienating users with sales-centric tactics. Gravity will drop as everyone leaves the community.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/2c753578f9d8bcee8154d76bbfd88ad523c01c94-1220x470.png" alt="Text: Revenue is a natural second-order effect of high gravity. " title="Revenue &amp; Gravity"></p><p>For most communities, <strong>revenue is a natural second-order effect of high gravity</strong>. Just think of an ice cream cone. The larger the scoop on top of the cone, the more ice cream that drips down. With communities, <strong>as gravity increases, more users will end up in the adoption funnel</strong>.</p><p>That means DevRel and communities teams should focus on growing the Reach and Love of their community, leading to higher gravity, which then leads to more organic signups.</p><p>In most cases, <strong>higher gravity leads to more organic signups which leads to increased revenue.</strong></p><p>We think one effective way to demonstrate the impact of community activities, then, is by calculating NRG and showing how community and DevRel contribute.</p><p>As a result, we think DevRel leadership should consider NRG as a metric it reports on, and clearly demonstrate how community and DevRel investments move this important metric.</p></div></div>]]>

    <section id="description" data-title="Description">
      <p>Embedded applications with strong security requirements use sophisticated cryptographic algorithms and protocols. These algorithms and protocols are usually considered resistant against cryptanalysis (even if the algorithms sometimes rely on a kind of "very hard" problem which we don't know exactly how "hard" it is...) Inside the complete system they are implemented either in software or hardware form. Unfortunately any computation is eventually performed by a piece of hardware (microprocessor or hardware dedicated accelerator) and every hardware device leaks symptoms of its activity (power consumption, electromagnetic emanations, computation time, sounds, temperature variations, etc.) Attackers can exploit such "side channels" to retrieve embedded secrets. They can also inject and exploit faults by modifying the power supply, the clock frequency, shooting lasers on devices or even by modifying them. This course offers a survey of several well known hardware attacks. For each of them the conditions of success are explored and some counter measures are derived.</p>

And 14% are in distress—either challenged to meet their financial obligations or under operational pressure that requires significant restructuring. That represents a 43% increase over the previous year. The lack of additional government stimulus puts many of these companies at risk.</p><p>Those are among the most significant findings from the BCG TURN Radar index. The index, developed by BCG TURN, BCG’s special transformation, turnaround, and restructuring unit, tracks a company’s distress based on over 20 key performance indicators in three categories: financial, market, and qualitative. The Radar index reports on over 25,000 publicly-traded companies, with more than $100 million in revenue, across 80 countries and 20 industry sectors. There were 721 US companies tracked for distress. A company is measured against its peers, its industry, and the overall sample, and its score places it in one of three groups—either stable, stressed (underperforming in its industry or under internal or external pressure), or distressed.</p><p>The US picture is bleak, but not the worst on a global basis—in Central Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, the number of companies in distress has gone up 83%.</p><p>Overall, the BCG TURN Radar index portrays the US and global economy struggling as the pandemic maintains its grip.</p><h2><b>The US is hard-hit, and key sectors suffer, but others, boosted by pandemic demand, outperform</b></h2><p>Some US sectors have been particularly hard-hit—notably, those directly affected by the pandemic and those already challenged before the pandemic’s economic downdraft took hold.</p><p>Among the US industries suffering the most are automotive and mobility (52% stressed, 16% distressed), travel and tourism (61% stressed, 16% distressed), and retail (67% stressed, 18% distressed).</p><p>Health care providers, biopharma, the technology industry, and transportation and logistics have been the least impacted. All of these sectors have been boosted by pandemic-related demand. Health care providers and biopharma are showing significantly less stress than in the same period last year. Both have benefited from pandemic-related activity and investment. In 2019, almost 42% of biopharma companies were in distress. In 2020, that figure fell to 25%. In multiple sectors, there are big gaps between winners and losers, and research shows that large companies may achieve a stronger recovery.</p><p>“BCG TURN Radar confirms the impression created by stories of business failures and layoffs—the COVID-19 pandemic is causing deep, structural changes that are likely to be long-lasting,” says Luke Pototschnik, BCG senior partner, and head of the firm’s Transformation practice and BCG TURN in North America. “The impact may be most severe on companies that were challenged to begin with. But the good news is that there are actions companies can take—such as generating short-term cash to fund long-term investment—that can mitigate the worst of the downturn and help set them on the path to recovery.”</p><h2><b>Some subsectors stand out even in stressed industries, and the gap between winners and losers grows</b></h2><p>While the Radar index raises alarms about several major sectors of the US economy, it also finds winners even in underperforming sectors.</p><p>Many of the sectors faring worst are those that faced pre-pandemic structural challenges. “The automobile industry is struggling more than others,” says Pototschnik. “Even before the pandemic, it was dealing with significant changes such as the shift to electric vehicles, which requires investment. But in the pandemic economy, investment may be hard to come by.”</p><p>Similarly, the bankruptcy rate has been high in the already-challenged oil and gas sector, and Radar suggests that bankruptcies are likely to continue, with over 57% of the sector under stress and over 10% in distress.</p><p>Of more note is the widening gap between winners and losers in several sectors as some industries suffer while other outperform. “In most cases, outperformance is driven by pandemic-related consumer and business spending,” Pototschnik says.</p><ul><li>Most of the retail sector has moved from “stable” to “stressed,” with over 52% of restaurants in distress—but large groceries are doing well, with over 43% in stable territory.</li><li>Similarly, IT services are suffering, with over 50% in distress, but digital devices and services are thriving, with over 42% stable. The numbers reflect the sudden and massive shift from office work to remote work.</li><li>Shipping companies are performing strongly thanks to the upsurge in e-commerce, with 32% stable, while 47% of logistics companies are stressed as the result of an overall slowdown in global trade.</li></ul><p>“In several sectors, the gap between winners and losers is widening,” Pototschnik says. “Some of this may be the result of pandemic-related behavior patterns that will normalize over time. But some of these patterns, such as the shift to remote work, may be long-lasting, and some industry sectors may be permanently reshaped.”</p><h2><b>Bankruptcy rates will increase, data providers may thrive, and large companies have an advantage</b></h2><p>The Radar index does not predict future performance, and, as Pototschnik notes, “Prediction is made difficult by the complex dynamics of the pandemic. But the index, combined with our observation of certain macro trends, does suggest some outcomes.” Among BCG’s projections:</p><ul><li>Bankruptcy rates will increase, partly as a result of the robust and trustworthy bankruptcy process in the US and North America.</li><li>Bankruptcy is already underway in retail and in oil and gas. Telecom is in distress, in part due to its high investment requirements. Restructuring will come to manufacturing as supply chain networks are revisited, but instead of bankruptcy, transformation may take the form of changes in market structures.</li><li>Severe uncertainty is driving an appetite for data; industries and companies that provide data and analytics are likely to be strong performers. Technology will perform well in the long-term, even if the nature of office work is fundamentally changed. Travel and tourism will rebound once a vaccine Is developed, trusted, and distributed at scale. Sectors such as retail that have deeper business model problems apart from the pandemic are likely to lag.</li><li>Size may also be a predictor of survival. Radar shows that large companies, even in distressed industries, have more upside potential. “There are reasons why this makes sense,” Pototschnik says. “Large companies typically have healthier balance sheets. They have greater access to capital markets. They have more diversified product lines and portfolios. And they are less vulnerable than smaller companies to private-equity and activist intervention. All of these factors seem to add up to a greater margin of safety.”</li></ul><h2><b>Companies can take action to improve their odds</b></h2><p>Finally, individual companies can act to improve their odds for recovery. Separate BCG TURN research identifies the steps that leading companies take in times of crisis that lead to superior performance. Leading companies act proactively, investing in projects that generate short-term cash in order to fund long-term investments. They increase the pace of innovation, streamline the organization to maximize efficiency and capitalize on digital, and build crisis management and scenario planning capabilities to increase their resilience. “Companies that took these steps during the 2008–2009 financial crisis recovered faster and performed better than their peers,” Pototschnik says.</p><p>“The COVID-19 pandemic is a massive historic event—it is stressing companies, industries, and national and global economies to the limit,” Pototschnik says. “BCG TURN Radar indicates that that the stress is severe, and many organizations will be forced to restructure. But those that take a strategic view of restructuring and look at it as an opportunity to rethink their business stand a better chance of leading when the recovery ultimately arrives.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fmore-than-half-of-us-companies-are-under-financial-or-operational-stress-and-14-are-in-distress-as-pandemics-economic-impact-deepens-301201503.html&amp;t=ZTQ5OWFlZWU0YjA3MTE0NjdiZDZhYmUyZDU5YjJjMDk1YWE2ZTI2YSxQMVFpanA2SA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F639600728973934592%2F60-percent-of-us-companies-are-under-stress&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610225102">Boston Consulting Group (BCG)</a></b></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/624363186289852416/new-normal-for-tech-webinar">Shaping the new normal for tech post COVID-19 (webinar)</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A team of scientists at Freie Universität Berlin has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) method for calculating the ground state of the Schrödinger equation in quantum chemistry. The goal of quantum chemistry is to predict chemical and physical properties of molecules based solely on the arrangement of their atoms in space, avoiding the need for resource-intensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments. In principle, this can be achieved by solving the Schrödinger equation, but in practice this is extremely difficult. Up to now, it has been impossible to find an exact solution for arbitrary molecules that can be efficiently computed. But the team at Freie Universität has developed a deep learning method that can achieve an unprecedented combination of accuracy and computational efficiency. AI has transformed many technological and scientific areas, from computer vision to materials science. “We believe that our approach may significantly impact the future of quantum chemistry,” says Professor Frank Noé, who led the team effort. The results were published in the reputed journal <em>Nature Chemistry</em> (DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-020-0544-y" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-020-0544-y</a>).</p><div><p>Central to both quantum chemistry and the Schrödinger equation is the wave function – a mathematical object that completely specifies the behavior of the electrons in a molecule. The wave function is a high-dimensional entity, and it is therefore extremely difficult to capture all the nuances that encode how the individual electrons affect each other. Many methods of quantum chemistry in fact give up on expressing the wave function altogether, instead attempting only to determine the energy of a given molecule. This however requires approximations to be made, limiting the prediction quality of such methods.</p>
<p>Other methods represent the wave function with the use of an immense number of simple mathematical building blocks, but such methods are so complex that they are impossible to put into practice for more than a mere handful of atoms. “Escaping the usual trade-off between accuracy and computational cost is the highest achievement in quantum chemistry,” explains Dr. Jan Hermann of Freie Universität Berlin, who designed the key features of the method in the study. “As yet, the most popular such outlier is the extremely cost-effective density functional theory. We believe that deep “Quantum Monte Carlo,” the approach we are proposing, could be equally, if not more successful. It offers unprecedented accuracy at a still acceptable computational cost.”</p>
<p>The deep neural network designed by Professor Noé’s team is a new way of representing the wave functions of electrons. “Instead of the standard approach of composing the wave function from relatively simple mathematical components, we designed an artificial neural network capable of learning the complex patterns of how electrons are located around the nuclei,” Noé explains. “One peculiar feature of electronic wave functions is their antisymmetry. When two electrons are exchanged, the wave function must change its sign. We had to build this property into the neural network architecture for the approach to work,” adds Hermann. This feature, known as “Pauli’s exclusion principle,” is why the authors called their method “PauliNet.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the Pauli exclusion principle, electronic wave functions also have other fundamental physical properties, and much of the innovative success of PauliNet is that it integrates these properties into the deep neural network, rather than letting deep learning figure them out by just observing the data. “Building the fundamental physics into the AI is essential for its ability to make meaningful predictions in the field,” says Noé. “This is really where scientists can make a substantial contribution to AI, and exactly what my group is focused on.”</p>
<p>There are still many challenges to overcome before Hermann and Noé’s method is ready for industrial application. “This is still fundamental research,” the authors agree, “but it is a fresh approach to an age-old problem in the molecular and material sciences, and we are excited about the possibilities it opens up.”</p>

This is in some ways a rational response to elite failures, in some ways an inevitable consequence of the public becoming better educated, in some ways an unavoidable side effect of better information technology, and in some ways a deplorable thing that we should try to reverse. </p><p>But something I’ve become increasingly convinced of is that policymakers need to acknowledge that it’s a real feature of the landscape and adjust their decision-making accordingly. </p><p>In particular, they need to adjust it in an appropriate way. A very large share of the people involved in politics and government are lawyers, and their lawyerly instinct about the problem seems to be that you need to layer on more layers of process. If people are worried about the discretionary use of power, you need to make sure the decision-makers go through an elaborate compliance checklist. But as Princess Leia tried to explain to Grand Moff Tarkin, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wntX-a3jSY">“the more you tighten your grip, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.”</a> </p><p>When you try to address low trust through compliance, you end up where Andrew Cuomo is —&nbsp;he’s creating an elaborate checklist for vaccine prioritization which is hard to follow, so he’s ramping up penalties for people who don’t comply, which is slowing vaccine administration and further eroding trust. </p><p>But the same basic problem pops up everywhere from fiscal stimulus and quantitative easing to <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2020/12/31/streets-before-trust/">bike lanes</a>. </p><p>The correct way to respond to a low-trust environment is not to double down on proceduralism, but to commit yourself to the <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2020/12/31/streets-before-trust/">“it does exactly what it says on the tin”</a> principle and implement policies that have the following characteristics:</p><ul><li><p>It’s easy for everyone, whether they agree with you or disagree with you, to understand what it is you say you are doing. </p></li><li><p>It’s easy for everyone to see whether or not you are, in fact, doing what you said you would do. </p></li><li><p>It’s easy for you and your team to meet the goal of doing the thing that you said you would do. </p></li></ul><p>That’s not a guarantee of political or policy success. Maybe you will pick terrible ideas and be a huge failure anyway. But this triad for success under conditions of distrust at least creates the <em>possibility</em> of success, where people will look back and decide that what you did worked. Committing yourself to that triad may involve some waste and inefficiency relative to a more theoretically optimal scheme with more means-testing. </p><p>And it will almost certainly involve a bit more high-handedness and less community consultation. But it allows you to establish yourself as conditionally trustworthy in the sense that your policies do exactly what it says on the tin. And if you pick policies that work, you’re then in a position to rebuild trust as people see that confidence in you is rewarded.</p><h4>The vaccine prioritization fiasco</h4><p>In my December 18 post, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/vaccinate-elderly">“Give The Vaccine To The Elderly,”</a> I argued in favor of a pretty strict age-based prioritization system primarily because that would be a transparent and easy to implement mechanism. </p><p>As I researched it, I came across the fact — which has been flagged by others as well — that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was recommending a more complicated scheme in part on racial justice grounds. Because everyone loves culture war arguments, this became a huge controversy and several conservative states like Texas made big shows of rejecting the Social Justice Warrior concepts. That’s fine, but unfortunately, they did not accept the wisdom of implementing a transparent and easy to implement mechanism. </p><p>Instead, operating under the principle that everyone wants to be vaccinated in Group 1 they have divided Group 1 into three subgroups — 1A, 1B, and 1C. But then Group 1A is <a href="https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/immunize/vaccine/EVAP-Phase1A.pdf">subdivided into two separate tiers</a>, and we’re still awaiting word on how Group 1C will be subdivided, to say nothing of Group 2 or Group 3. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc22295e8-22ca-4271-b6f1-392f1e0b1c59_1286x540.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc22295e8-22ca-4271-b6f1-392f1e0b1c59_1286x540.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c22295e8-22ca-4271-b6f1-392f1e0b1c59_1286x540.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:540,&quot;width&quot;:1286,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:280147,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>So while New York and California, with their presumably more social justice-inflected vaccine distributions, have managed to disburse only 31 percent and 28 percent of their vaccine doses (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html">I’m going by New York Times data</a>), Texas and Florida, who made a big deal of rejecting ACIP, are not doing much better at 36 percent and 31 percent. The very worst performances are in Kansas, Georgia, Arizona, Mississippi, and Idaho, so there’s clearly a lot more afoot here than pure partisan politics. </p><p>And in many ways we still haven’t gotten to the real pain point of prioritization systems, which is going to be where people with “at least one chronic medical condition” get to cut the line. In the abstract, of course if you’re 52 and have a bad heart then you need the vaccine more than someone who’s 64 and in perfect health. But in practice, this means you are allocating vaccines not based on <em>actual</em> population health, but based on who is in possession of a note from their doctor. </p><p>The system, as implemented, will not do what it says on the tin. As people notice that, they will become more aggressive about wanting to cheat the system. And as backlash builds, pressure will build for tighter enforcement, which will further slow down administration. </p><p>A pure age-based system — “show up at CVS or Walgreens and they’ll give you the shot if you’re over 75” with the age cutoff steadily dropping over time —&nbsp;is not perfect. But it’s really easy to check people’s IDs, the rich and powerful have no good way to game that system, and the smooth operation of the system itself will build trust.</p><h4>Checks for everyone </h4><p>I cover American public policy professionally, and I would have trouble explaining to you exactly how the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program">Paycheck Protection Program</a> works. </p><p>Formally speaking, it’s a Small Business Administration loan guarantee program rather than a direct payroll subsidy like many European countries did. But when you peak under the hood, one of the key advantages of the PPP loan is that it will be forgiven if you meet certain criteria, including <a href="https://onpay.com/covid-19/ppp-loan-forgiveness">not laying off your employees</a> and using the money for certain <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program#section-header-5">specific eligible expenses</a>. </p><p>Because the program is complicated, it’s generated an endless series of compliance complaints:</p><ul><li><p>Because it’s supposed to be a small business program, a whole genre of journalism emerged complaining that too much PPP money was going to bigger companies —&nbsp;but of course, bigger companies employ more people.</p></li><li><p>Because it’s supposed to be a loan program but in practice a lot of the loans are forgiven, you get complaints about monetary losses to the government.</p></li><li><p>Because you’re <em>allowed</em> to accept a loan without applying for full forgiveness, some PPP recipients got money and did layoffs, generating complaints that it didn’t really protect payrolls.</p></li></ul><p>And on top of all that, there were significant administrative burdens associated with the program which generated a lot of complaints from business owners, the very people who are supposed to be enthusiastic about PPP.</p><p>Instead, a myth developed that the government — which put hundreds of billions of dollars in small business assistance on the table — was barely doing anything.</p><p>Fundamentally, I would say that the problem with the program is that it didn’t do what it says on the tin, in part because it’s not at all clear what it said on the tin. It seems to have started with the thought that the Fed keeping interest rates low was helping big businesses because they could sell bonds to ride out the pandemic, so there should be a comparable lending program for smaller companies. But if the government is going to help out smaller companies, it should make sure that it’s actually saving jobs. And if we’re going to give companies loans to maintain payroll, but they’re often not going to be able to pay the loan back, there should be loan forgiveness. In the end, Congress backed itself into something that was a lot closer to a European-style payroll subsidy program than to a loan program, but with most of the trappings of a loan program.</p><p>By contrast, sending $1,200 to almost everyone was seen as a huge success, and <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/12/28/78-of-likely-voters-support-2000-relief-checks">sending more checks is wildly popular</a>. </p><p>The checks did what they said on the tin. They didn’t attempt to distinguish between the deserving and the undeserving. They didn’t specify whether you had to use the check to make rent or could just blow it on a new iPhone. And they <em>also</em> didn’t attempt to address any particular racial social justice concerns. Critically, they didn’t claim to do any of these things. The only claim was that almost everyone would get some money, and they did. </p><h4>QE for the people </h4><p>A policy from the Great Recession that really flunked the “what it says on the tin” test was quantitative easing. </p><p>I think if you really understand how monetary policy works and have confidence in the Federal Reserve staff, then you’ll see that having the Fed buy a bunch of longer-term bonds is really not that exciting or weird. But most people don’t. </p><p>And unfortunately, as you become better-informed about monetary issues, it doesn’t actually become that much clearer why the Fed decided this would be a good thing to do. During a funny 2014 Brookings appearance, Ben Bernanke <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3b164d2e-4f03-11e4-9c88-00144feab7de">quipped</a> that “the problem with quantitative easing is that it works in practice, but it doesn’t work in theory.”</p><p>But think about that in terms of a low-trust society; the guy we’re supposed to trust to do the QE himself says he can’t give an explanation of how it works. </p><ul><li><p>Now of course you can read <a href="https://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/10/bernankes-speech-how-does-quantitative-easing-work-will-it-work.html">Tim Duy offer five mechanisms through which QE could work</a> back in 2010 — but he’s skeptical that the tools are powerful.</p></li><li><p>By 2016, Roger Farmer says that Bernanke is wrong and QE <em>does</em> work in theory, and <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/why-unconventional-monetary-policy-works-theory">offers a theoretical account of why it works</a> that is somewhat different from any of Duy’s theories.</p></li><li><p>By 2020, Bernanke has come around to the view that <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2020/01/04/the-new-tools-of-monetary-policy/">he now understands why QE works in theory</a>, though his view is closer to Duy’s than to Farmer’s. </p></li></ul><p>If you’re an insider to macroeconomic policy discussions, Bernanke’s quote is funny. But I think given all this, it’s …</p></div></div>

    <h2 id="how-i-decided-to-write-a-spellchecker-and-almost-died-trying">How I decided to write a spellchecker and almost died trying</h2>

<p>A few years ago I had a fun idea for a “weekend project”: pure-Ruby spellchecker. Ruby is my language of choice, and no-dependencies spellchecker seemed a small useful tool for the CI environment: for example, to check comments/docs spelling without installing any third-party software. I actually <em>could’ve</em> pulled out the project in its limited scope (only English, only spot misspelled words without fixing, limited dictionary) with just a flat list of known words, but that’s not what happened.</p>

<p>Back then, I decided to make a moderately generic tool, at least able to work with multiple languages. Fortunately (or so I believed!), there were many already existing and freely available spellchecking dictionaries distributed as LibreOffice and Firefox extensions. All of those dictionaries are in the format defined by the <strong><a href="http://hunspell.github.io/">Hunspell</a></strong> tool/library—which is an open-source library that is used for spellchecking in Libre/OpenOffice, Mozilla products (Firefox, Thunderbird), but also Google Chrome/Chromium, macOS, several Adobe products, and so on.</p>

<p>The dictionaries looked like easy to reuse text files with some (“insignificant” as it seemed) metadata, and the whole “use Hunspell dictionaries from pure Ruby spellchecker” project <em>still</em> felt like a “weekend-long” one, for the first few weekends. Only gradually the underwater complexity of the multilanguage word-by-word spellchecking uncovered. Eventually, I was distracted from the project and abandoned it, but I still had the fascination with the seemingly-simple, actually-mind-blowingly-complicated Hunspell, the software everybody used daily and hardly ever notice.</p>

<p>The idea to dig deeper into it, to <em>understand</em> it and <em>explain</em>, grew on me and bothered me for quite some time. And what is a better way to understand something, if not to retell it in your own words? After several lazy and not very far-progressed attempts to write something Hunspell-alike (twice in Ruby, once in Rust, once in Python), eventually, in February 2020, the task I settled down to solve is: “explanatory rewrite” of the Hunspell into high-level language with a lot of comments. I achieved this goal by December 2020, with the first release of the <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a> project: <strong>the port of Hunspell’s core algorithms into modern, well-documented, well-structured Python</strong>.</p>

<p>And now I want to share some insights of what I uncovered on the road: about spellchecking in general and Hunspell in particular.</p>

<p>In the ongoing article series, I’ll cover these topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is Hunspell, why is it significant, and why try to “explain” it (current article)</li>
  <li>Base spellchecking concepts: lookup and suggest, as seen by Hunspell</li>
  <li>How lookup (checking if the word is correct) works, and why it could be much more complicated than “just look in the list of the known words”</li>
  <li>How suggest (proposed fix for the incorrect word) works, and how hard it is to estimate its quality</li>

<h3 id="what-is-hunspell">What is Hunspell?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The information on Hunspell’s origins and history is mostly my guesses, following partial and incomplete sources everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hunspell (<small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunspell">Wikpedia article</a></small>), initially <strong>Hun</strong>garian spellchecker, emerged as an alternative for previously existing aspell/ispell/myspell somewhere in 2002 (I guess?). It was created by László Németh, in a need of supporting languages with complicated suffixing/prefixing rules and word compounding (such as Hungarian). Hunspell’s design seemingly proved itself to be flexible enough to support most of the world’s languages, and in a few years, it became the most used spellchecker in the world. You have most probably used it even if you’ve never heard the name before today: Hunspell is the default spellchecking engine in Chrome and Firefox, Libre/OpenOffice, Adobe products, and macOS (not an exhaustive list). Dictionaries in Hunspell format exist for almost all actively used languages for which the concept of word-by-word spellchecking makes sense<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Currently, Hunspell is maintained <a href="https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell">on GitHub</a> (repo has only around 1k stars, will you believe it?). It seems that maintenance is not that easy if you’ll weight the number of open issues and PRs, and the latest commits timeline: at the time of writing it (Jan 2021), the last commit to master was of May 2020, and the last release was 1.7 on Dec 2018. Hunspell’s codebase is mostly “old-school” C++. It is being slowly modernized and it has very few comments; there are thousands of two-branch <code>if</code>s to handle non-Unicode and Unicode text separately. There is also an attempt to rewrite Hunspell from scratch in a modern C++, which at some point was developed under the <code>hunspell</code> GitHub organization. Now it is independent and called <a href="https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell">nuspell</a> (and, while not yet supporting all of the Hunspell features, already “achieved” version 4.2.0).</p>

<p>Obviously, there are open-source spellcheckers other than Hunspell. GNU aspell (that at one point was superseded by Hunspell, but still holds its ground in English suggestion quality), to name one of the older ones; but also there are novel approaches, like <a href="https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell">SymSpell</a>, claiming to be “1 million times faster” or ML-based <a href="https://github.com/bakwc/JamSpell">JamSpell</a>, claiming to be much more accurate.</p>

<p>And yet, what makes Hunspell stand out is its coverage of the world’s languages. It is not ideal, but the amount of dictionaries ready to use immediately, and amount of <em>experience</em> of dealing with typical problems and corner cases, coded into the codebase, is hard to beat.</p>

<h3 id="why-rewrite-it">Why rewrite it?</h3>

<p>As I’ve already stated above, the goal of the Spylls project was to create an <em>explanatory</em> rewrite: E.g., the “retelling” of how Hunspell works in a way that is easy to follow and to play with.</p>

<p>The necessity of this approach came to me from three facts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hunspell is used almost everywhere and is taken for granted;</li>
  <li>It is much more complicated than one might naively expect;</li>
  <li>This complexity—and years of human work that was spent growing the project—is notoriously hard to follow through the Hunspell’s codebase and grasp in full.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, I wanted to <strong>make the knowledge behind Hunspell more open</strong>.</p>

<p>The way I have chosen was not, of course, the only one possible. I could’ve just read through the original code and write a series of articles (or, rather, a book?) on how it works. I could’ve thoroughly commented and republished the original source code. But I felt that <em>reimplementing</em> is the only way of understanding what’s and why’s of the algorithms (at least for somebody not being a Hunspell’s core developer); and that implementation in a high-level language will allow focusing on words and language-related algorithms, not memory management or fighting with Unicode.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that there are also a few “pragmatic” ports of Hunspell into other languages (in order to use it in environments where C++ dependency is undesireable), namely <a href="https://github.com/aarondandy/WeCantSpell.Hunspell">WeCantSpell.Hunspell</a> in C# and <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/nspell">nspell</a> in JS (very incomplete); and aforementioned <a href="https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell">nuspell</a> can also be considered a “port” (from legacy C++ to a modern one).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-python">Why Python?</h3>

<p>My language of choice is Ruby. It was also the first language that I’ve tried to port Hunspell into. I’d be happy to proceed with Ruby if my goal has been just a “pragmatic” library. And yet, when I decided that my goal is to make the knowledge of Hunspell’s algorithms accessible to a wide audience, I understood that Ruby is not the best choice: language reputation (slightly esoteric and mostly-for-web) would make my project lest noticeable; and my preferred coding style (mix of OO and functional, with lots of small immutable domain objects and fluent chains of iterators), while allowing me to be very effective, would make the code less accessible to other languages users.</p>

<p>What I needed was a high-level language, with as low boilerplate as possible; as mainstream as possible; as easy to experiment with and prototype as possible. Without diving into too much argument here, Python and modern JavaScript seemed to be the most suitable options, and, to be honest, Python was just closer to my soul. So, here we are!</p>

<p>The code style is mostly imperative (as it corresponds to how Hunspell is structured), with large-ish, but clearly structured methods, and a small number of classes/objects (mostly they are either “whole algorithm as a class” or almost-passive “structs” – or, in Python, dataclasses). I tried to limit myself in the usage of complex Python-specific features (like functools or itertools), but have a decent use of “list comprehensions” (as they are quite readable and Pythonic) and generators (lazy lists). Overall, I wanted the code to be good Python, but not too smart. Whether I succeeded, is up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a> has <strong>≈1.5k lines of library code</strong> in 14 files. It conforms (with <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#completeness">some reservations</a>) to all Hunspell’s integrational tests. Those tests look like a set of files each, consisting of “test dictionary + what words should be considered good, what words should be considered bad, what should be suggested instead of the bad words”, and there are <strong>127 of such sets to pass</strong>. There are <strong>2 thousand comment lines</strong> in the code, explaining thoroughly every detail of the algorithm and rendered at the <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell.html">Spylls documentation site</a>; note that besides docstrings at the beginning of each class and method, there are also inline comments in code—that’s why the documentation site uses custom theme with inline “Show code” feature.</p>

<p>With this being said, I am wrapping up the introductory post.</p>

<p><strong>In the <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">next series</a>: An introduction to Hunspell’s “lookup” and “suggest” concepts; and deeper dive into the lookup.</strong></p>

<h2><a name="2015-06-16" href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/16">Tuesday, June 16, 2015</a></h2>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" name="2015-06-16.1" href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/16.1">A constructive look at the Atari 2600 BASIC cartridge</a></h3>

<!-- Atari 2600 VCS, Atari 2600 BASIC, BASIC, IDE, integrated development system -->

<p>I installed <a href="http://stella.sourceforge.net/">Stella</a>
(an <a href="http://www.atariage.com/2600/">Atari 2600 VCS emulator</a>),
downloaded the <a href="http://atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=15">Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> cartridge</a>
and have been playing around with it for the past few days.
If I'm going to do some <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/14.1">Stupid Twitter Trick™</a> with it,
I might as well know how it works,
right?</p>

<p>And thus,
this review.</p>

<p>Honestly,
I don't think the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> has ever had a fair review.
It's pretty much reviled as a horrible program,
a horrible programming environment
and practically useless.
But I think that's selling it short.
Yes,
it's bad (and I'll get to that in a bit),
but in using it for the past few days,
there are some impressive features on a system where the <acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym> can't hold a full Tweet and half the <acronym title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</acronym> time is spent 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/026201257X/conmanlaborat-20">Racing The Beam</a>.
I'll get the bad out of the way first.</p>

<p>Input comes from the <a href="http://atariage.com/controller_page.html?ControllerID=4&amp;SystemID=2600">Atari Keypads</a>,
dual 12-button keypads.
If that weren't bad enough,
<em>I'm</em> using my keyboard as an emulated pair of Atari Keypads,
where I have to keep <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/16/AtariKeypad.jpg" type="image/jpeg">this image</a> open at all times.</p>

<p>Okay,
here's how this works.
I want to enter this line:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>A←A+1
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(Ah yes!
The “left arrow” for assignment.
Mathematicians rejoice!) 
Upon startup,
the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> cursor is white.
This is important,
because this tells you what mode you are in.
Hit a key when the cursor is white,
and you do the functions labeled in white above each key.
To get an “A,” you hit the bottom center button on the left controller
(the one with the arrow circling around it) until the cursor turns <em>blue</em>,
then you can hit the upper left key on the left controller (labeled “STATUS + A IF”).
It's a bit hard to see,
but yes, that “A” is indeed blue.</p>

<p>To get the “←” symbol 
(it's the top right button on the left controller)
you hit the bottom middle button the the left controller until the cursor cycles back to red,
then hit the upper right button on the left controller.
Then cycle the cursor back to blue to get the “A,”
then cycle to red to get the “plus” and the “1” 
(top left button on the right controller).</p>

<p>That's probably bad enough on the real thing.
On the <em>simulated Atarti 2600?</em>
Okay,
what key on my keyboard is the “cycle” key?
Then what key is the “A” key?
Here's what I have to type to get that line of code:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>xx1xxx3x1xxx19
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But to be honest,
it's on par with other <a href="http://www.ganjatron.net/retrocomputing/zx81/zx81-kbd.jpg" type="image/jpeg">keyboards of the time</a> and may be a bit better,
having actual tactile feedback instead of a simple membrane.
I'm also <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2000/02/15.1">picky about keyboards</a> so I'm <em>always</em> going to bitch about the keyboard unless it's an 
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/why-i-use-a-20-year-old-ibm-model-m-keyboard/">IBM model M</a>.</p>

<p>And given that the Atari 2600 only has 128 <em>bytes</em> of memory,
it's expected that the programs are going to be rather short.
I at first thought that you had 64 bytes for the program,
but no—it's 64 bytes for the program, <em>variables and runtime expression evaluation!</em>
That actually surprised me.
Even worse,
running this program over and over again (spaces added for clarity):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>1 A ← 1
2 B ← 2
3 PRINT A,B
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><em>leaks memory!</em></p>

<p>No,
really,
that program,
if run multiple times,
will eventually exhaust all of memory.
But not all programs leak memory.
This program,
if run over and over again (more on this little program in a bit):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>1 D ← 1
2 HOR1 ← HOR1 + D
3 IF HOR1 =  0 THEN GOTO 5
4 IF HOR1 ← 99 THEN GOTO 2
5 D ← 99 - D + 1
6 GOTO 2
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>won't leak so much as a byte.
Go figure.</p>

<p>Worse though,
is that each variabled used in the program
(and it doesn't matter if it's a predefined variable like <code>HOR1</code> or a user defined variable like <code>A</code>)
consumes <em>three bytes</em> out of the precious 64 bytes you get for your program!
On the plus side though,
unused variables (event the builtin ones) don't use space at all
(I figured this out by watching the <acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym> use in Stella).</p>

<p>The grahics are pretty pathetic as well.
There are two dots that can be manipulated.
The builtin variables <code>HOR1</code> and <code>VER1</code> control the horizontal and vertical position for one dot;
<code>HOR2</code> and <code>VER2</code> are used for the other dot.
The colors are fixed.
Oh,
and if the builtin variable <code>HIT</code> is 1,
the two dots are in the same position.</p>

<p>The positions are themselves limited to 0 to 99,
but that's because <em>all</em> variables are limited to the range 0 to 99.
The values wrap though—add 1 to 99 and you get 0.
Subtract 1 from 0 and you get 99.</p>

<p>Which leads us into the ugly.</p>

<p>Yes,
there are no negative values—everything is unsigned.
And the values are all limited from 0 to 99.
This stems from a unique feature of the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</acronym>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6507">the 6507</a>
(a cheaper variation on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a>).
That <acronym title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</acronym> can do math in either binary <em>or</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">binary-coded decimal</a>
and the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> uses the binary-coded decimal mode, which restricts the values from 0 to 99.
So while you don't have negative numbers,
you do in a way because of the way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic">the math works</a>.
99 plus 99 is 198,
but because the range is modulus 100,
the result is 98. 
Add 99 again,
and you end up with 97.  
I use this fact in the above program.
Line 5 negates <code>D</code>—it converts 99 to 1,
or 1 back to 99.
Essentially,
1 to -1 and back again,
causing the dot to slowly crawl back and forth across the screen.</p>

<p>But now we finally arrive at what's good,
or rather,
what's amazing about this program.</p>

<p>First and foremost,
it's an <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>.</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<p>Dispite it being only 4,096 bytes,
there's a pretty credible,
windowed(!) integrated development environment in there.
If you look back at the <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/16/AtariKeypad.jpg" type="image/jpeg">keypad</a>,
you'll notice the first six buttons on the left controller are labeled:</p>

<ol>
<li>STATUS</li>
<li>PROGRAM</li>
<li>STACK</li>
<li>VARIABLES</li>
<li>OUTPUT</li>
<li>GRAPHICS</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the various “windows” (and technically,
they <em>are</em> windows,
even if they don't overlap but are instead,
stacked vertically on the screen)
and the buttons there toggle the “windows” on and off.</p>

<p>The “STATUS” window 
(you can see it in the screen shot from <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/14.1">the other day</a>) 
shows memory usage (how many bytes,
called “symbols”) and how fast the program will run
(1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30 and 60 are the speed values and they reflect how often the interpreter is run—once a second,
twice a second, on up to 60 times a second).
The “PROGRAM” window obviously contains the program
(all nine lines if you have that many—and
the <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> automatically numbers the lines for you even though it doesn't use them or store them—more on that below).</p>

<p>The “VARIABLES” window contains a list of the variables used in the program, listed as:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>A is 1
HOR1 is 40
B is 2
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>“OUTPUT” is the text output window;
output of <code>PRINT</code>.  “GRAPHICS” is the laughable graphics screen.</p>

<p>Leaving the “STACK” window,
which is a misnomer actually.
It's not a true stack,
since there is no concept of “subroutine” in the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym>.
You could think of it as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRON_command">TRON</a>” as it actually shows you the execution of each statment that is abolutely amazing!
Imagine each line below being shown one at a time and you'll get a feeling for how this works.
We'll be following line 5 from the above program (assuming D is 1):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>D
D←
D←99
D←99-D
D←99-1
D←98
D←98+1
D←99
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>One more example,
to show that the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> also follows mathematical precedence.
Here, A is 1, B is 2 and C is 3.
The line of code we're following is:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>D←A+B*C
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and during execution:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>D
D←
D←A
D←1
D←1+B
D←1+2
D←1+2*C
D←1+2*3
D←1+6
D←7
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Strange as it sounds,
this blew me away.
I don't think I've ever seen anything like this.
Sure,
in debuggers where you execute a line at a time.
Or in assembly language,
instruction by instruction.
But never substeps in expression evaluation.
And of course,
you can always step through the code with the “STEP” button.
I just find it amazing that all of this,
as simple as it is,
can fit in 4,096 bytes of code.</p>

<p>How it stores the code internally is interesting.
Most <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym>s I'm aware of store the line number as part of the program,
but here,
that's not done.
Take this program for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>1 A ← 1
2 HOR1 ← HOR1 + 1
3 A ← A + 5
4 GOTO 2
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Internally in memory,
it's stored:</p>

<table>
  <caption>Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> program layout</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Byte</th><th>Symbol</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>BC</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E8</td><td>←</td></tr>
    <tr><td>01</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>F1</td><td>&lt;end of line&gt;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>B2</td><td>HOR1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E8</td><td>←</td></tr>
    <tr><td>B2</td><td>HOR1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E3</td><td>+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>01</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>F1</td><td>&lt;end of line&gt;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BC</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E8</td><td>←</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BC</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E3</td><td>+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>05</td><td>5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>F1</td><td>&lt;end of line&gt;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>A6</td><td>GOTO</td></tr>
    <tr><td>02</td><td>2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FF</td><td>&lt;end of program&gt;</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Not a line number in sight,
which means <code>GOTO</code> statements do a linear scan of the program
(a typical design choice of <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> systems on 8-bit computers at the time)
but the end of each line <em>is</em> marked.
Weird,
but whatever works I guess.</p>

<p>Variables are stored after the program, sequentially:</p>

<table>
  <caption>Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> variable layout</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Byte</th><th>Symbol</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>B2</td><td>HOR1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>EE</td><td>is (see below)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>02</td><td>current value</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BC</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>EE</td><td>is</td></tr>
    <tr><td>15</td><td>current value</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As best as I can tell,
the value <code>EE</code> is used when displaying the variables on the “VARIABLES” window,
and probably means “is.”  It's probably done that way to avoid a special case when displaying data—it can be treated the same when displaying the program.
I'm guessing there's not much space left what with the font data and code to support the <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> in addition to running a
(admittedly very simple) <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> interpreter for special casing the variables.</p>

<p>As a “proof-of-concept” it's an amzing piece of work.
As an actual product,
yes,
it <em>sucks</em>,
mostly because of the limitations of the hardware.
The ideas behind it are incredible though,
and I think it's gotten short shrifted because of the limitations,
which is sad.
There is something to learn from here.</p>

<div>

<h4>Update Wednesday, June 17<sup>th</sup>, 2015 at 1:56 AM</h4>

<p>I almost forgot—the <code>IF</code> statement is an expression!
You can do the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>A ← IF B = 15 THEN 40 ELSE 99
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and <code>A</code> will be 40 if <code>B</code> is 15,
otherwise <code>A</code> will be 99.
There aren't many languages I've used that have allowed this.</p>

Failing is <strong><em>the fastest way to success</em></strong>!</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/WJeSMrXAhgHYU4fZHfaaH/ef143f37f81945a4a0710040145433b3/1OL6dFH.gif" alt="slimemold"></p><p>Brainless, single-cell slime hunting for food.</p><p>In the world of software development, we’ve already accepted this as scientific fact. We embrace this and weave it into the foundation of our methodologies and systems. We know, with absolute certainty, that nothing is certain. The winner will be the little boat whose chart is scribbled on the back of a napkin and can pivot on a dime, not the monolithic Titanic who, despite the captain’s best efforts, is going to collide with that iceberg.</p><p>However, even though we recognize the advantages and the <em>need</em> to be <strong>agile</strong> in this industry, that does not mean that we’ve mastered all the ways to optimize this. While different Software Development methodologies can have their place for different problem spaces (just as different programming languages are better suited for some problems over others), one particular approach to <strong><em>failing fast</em></strong> has gained a lot of traction over the past decade. The <strong>DevOps</strong> methodology was forged from the fires of Agile, and today DevOps has been crowned the champion of how to build great software, quickly and wicked fast. Modern technology companies that thrive to compete place DevOps on the forefront of their mind.</p><h2 id="what-is-devops">What is DevOps?</h2><p>If you’re not already familiar with DevOps, the term can be a little confusing. DevOps began as a cultural movement within companies. Rather than Developer teams taking their code and throwing it over the fence for the Operations team to deploy and monitor (while the Security team haughtily throws their arms in the air over any concern—be it major or minor—introduced by the other teams), DevOps works to tear down these artificial walls.</p><p>The way this works in practice is through tight feedback loops and blurring the edges of responsibility. “DevOps” has turned from an idea into a career where you build a racetrack for product development. This enables the idea-to-deployment cycle to hasten. No longer do we need to take months to plan, build, test, release, deploy, evaluate. No longer do we need to make sure every release is perfect “because there’s no going back”. Now we can do what we do best: <em>Make mistakes.</em></p><p>You’ve heard of (or worked with) companies that deploy their code tens to thousands of times a day. This is incredibly powerful. Ideas always look a little different in practice and sometimes they turn out to be bad ideas. But sometimes those silly ideas that would have you laughed out of a boardroom turn out to be the ones worth their weight in gold. With the ability to experiment and quickly reset, we can fractal our way to the perfect solution for any problem.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/75VdZ4jr0QwzXgpU6gk6vW/fff263c59f6582aaf3fd60d72312ebfb/ComplexGargantuanFluke-size_restricted.gif" alt="ComplexGargantuanFluke"></p><p>Twining motion of vines trying to find something to climb.</p><h2 id="why-do-i-need-environments">Why do I need Environments?</h2><p>If your company is big enough, has the capital, and understands the need, you may be lucky enough to have a team of DevOps Engineers who work to help make sure everyone has the environments they need, and the tools to build and deploy code.You have your build and deploy pipelines. Your code only takes one push, merge, and a couple button clicks to make its way into production. You’re. Living. The. Life. </p><p>Okay, sure, there are rough edges. The Developers and QA might be a little agitated that they have “bad data” in their databases. This bad data causes weird shadow bugs that wouldn’t exist “for a real user”. You have Product Managers and UX/UI Engineers digging around your QA and Staging Environments to make sure the feature matches the requirements, but they run into these shadow bugs and in a panic, hold a meeting to discuss “why the application is broken”. </p><p><em>C’est la vie.</em> Your environments are starting to drift apart, but it’s okay. QA finds a bug, but they can’t be sure when it was introduced. The Developer isn’t sure either, there are a few features that others were working on that have all been merged into here. One major feature is ready, but the others are blocked. Hours tick into the evening as the team scrambles to fix the concerns, introducing more in their haste, until finally QA calls to cancel today’s deployment. Disappointed and mentally taxed, everyone finally goes home frustrated.</p><p>This happens regularly. It’s a clog in the system, but it is manageable. However, what you don’t know yet is that your competitor has committed to allocating resources to addressing this problem directly. It took them twelve months (a bit off from their original six-month estimate), but now the tooling is built out and QA can create a build from any branch, on the fly. Now the data is fresh, every time, freeing QA to get their hands dirty in this sandbox. The Product team is excited to be able to look at new features side by side before they’re released, and features can even be put on hold or tinkered with in isolation. </p><p>Meanwhile, your company is falling behind. The only way you’d be able to keep up is to spend the money <em>and the time</em> to build this for yourselves. It’s a big investment, a big time commitment, and your company is worried. What if the project fails? There’s a lot at stake here.</p><p>Environments are the key to rapid prototyping and quick feature releases, while maintaining a solid, battle-tested product. But environments are also expensive. The upfront and maintenance cost put them outside the scope for many companies and by the time a strong need rears its head, the architecture has evolved into a technical labyrinth. </p><p>At Release, we understand this problem in depth. We have customers who use Release to give themselves a competitive advantage after they realized environments were holding them back. A new concept in DevOps has emerged called <a href="https://releaseapp.io/ephemeral-environments" title="What is an Ephemeral Environment?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ephemeral Environments</a> which eliminates the bottleneck of shared staging environments.  An Ephemeral Environment is automatically created when a developer does a pull request and has just their changes on their branch. This environment spins up for UAT testing and when the branch is merged, it disappears. Developers never wait for access to environments as they appear as part of their development workflow.</p><p>We’re using Ephemeral Environments which has put us on fast-track to shipping deliverables that we can stand behind. The unfortunate truth is that building this infrastructure is necessary to have a fighting chance against the heavyweights. But the problem is that the cost and time required can be astronomical. The <a href="https://releaseapp.io/" title="Release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Release</a> platform specifically aims to solve this problem directly by providing Environments-as-a-Service. This way, you get all the advantages of environments, without the costs or headache of Doing It Yourself, freeing you up to focus on the business and the product needs. </p><h2 id="in-short">In short…</h2><p>Remember: Nobody knows what they’re doing. And that’s okay. Nobody’s ever known what they’re doing; we’re all just stumbling around. But if we stumble with purpose, we can fall into something that works. If we fail fast, we get to success faster. Our methodologies in software development reflect this, but in practice, building supportive infrastructure is costly. If we can get to a place where we optimtimize failing fast by deploying early and often, we can more quickly find what our product needs to be. We can find success <em>without ever having to know</em> what we’re doing.</p><h2 id="ephemeral-environments">Ephemeral Environments</h2><p>Curious about Ephemeral Environments and what they can do for you?

<p><span>This page will be an ever-evolving log of my backyard shedquarters. The last update was January 4th.</span></p>
<p>During 2020 I began working full-time from home in our 2 bedroom house. I completely took over the kitchen table
for a while because I thought the pandemic would only last a few weeks, which was adorable in hindsight. After a
couple of months I moved to the spare bedroom and set up shop in there. Our company has since decided to go
fully remote forever, so I needed a more dedicated space for working</p>
<p>Oh, also... my wife and I are expecting triplets sometime in the Spring of 2021!</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/triplets.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/triplets.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>So clearly our 2 bedroom is going to be tight with our soon-to-be family of FIVE.</p>
<p>I've always wanted a shedquarters because it seems so fun to build out the perfect workspace, so I decided to
pull the trigger on it sometime in October.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along on Twitter, here's the thread:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">About a month ago, I got a 10x20 shed
        delivered so I could build out a shedquarters office in my backyard. It's been a ton of fun (and
        work) so far! I'm going to share a lot of it on this thread over the next couple of months until it's
        done. (Also at <a href="https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk">https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk</a>.)

<h2>Build vs Buy</h2>
<p>The first question I had to answer was whether I was going to try to build a shed from the ground up, or buy a
pre-made one. Having never built anything before I thought it might be fun to try something relatively
low-stakes like a shed. I watched a ton of YouTube videos and felt pretty confident I could pull <em>something</em>
off.</p>
<p>However, in the end I decided that it would take <em>way</em> longer than I wanted to build it from the ground up, and
I have a lot of other projects that would suffer if I spent 3 months building a shed. I am so, so glad I decided
to buy a pre-made shell instead.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Builder</h2>
<p>There are lots of fancy options that come totally pre-done and look beautiful (<a href="http://kangaroomsystems.com/">Kanga
Rooms</a> being one of them). Those were way too expensive for my budget, and didn't
leave me quite enough room for customizing to my liking.</p>
<p>Those fancier options are really geared toward "turn-key home offices", while what I wanted was more of "a shed
I can turn into an office".</p>
<p>There are a shed load (get it) of shed manufacturers to choose from, at least here in Texas! The one I settled
on was <a href="https://www.lonestarstructures.com/">Lone Star Structures</a>. Their prices are great, their customer
service is amazing, and they have an online shed designer that lets you build out exactly what you're looking
for. They also delivered and leveled it for me, but more on that later.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot from my 3D design:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/render.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/render.jpg"></a>
<span><em>You can click on any picture to view it full size.</em></span></p>
<p>You can view the actual model here:
<a href="https://shedview.lonestarstructures.com/?lng=en-US#c7aadf9f04f8920f492af4f47b95021d">shedview.lonestarstructures.com/#c7aadf9f04f8920f492af4f47b95021d</a></p>
<h2>Building Size</h2>
<p>I decided to go with a 10x20 building, for two reasons. The first is that we only have about 10 feet of space in
the spot where the shed was going to go, so that limited the width. The second reason is that anything &lt;= 200
square feet does not require a permit.</p>
<p>We had an old shed that was 10 feet wide and 12 feet long, you can see how tight the width is:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/old-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/old-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/old-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/old-2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The only access to our backyard is through a large gate that is just over 11ft wide.</p>
<p><img src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/gate.jpg"></p><p>I have some pictures and videos of the delivery, you'll see just how tight it was even with the 10ft model.</p>
<h2>Floor Plan</h2>
<p>We don't have a garage, so that old shed was serving the purpose of storing "garage stuff", which the new
building would have to do as well. To accomodate both the needs of a new office and "garage stuff", I decided to
split the shed into two sections. A 10x16 space for the office, and a 10x4 space for the garage stuff.</p>
<p>Lone Star Structures has the option to add a 4 foot "loft" in their configuration tool, so I added the loft and
then specifically requested that they build out a wall underneath.</p>
<p>Here's a floor plan overview:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here's what it looks like in real life:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/loft.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/loft.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The large, double doors open from the yard into the storage area. You can see the stud wall Lone Star built for
me to partition the space. Eventually there will be a proper wall there and the two spaces will be totally
discrete.</p>
<p>Here's a shot from the inside looking out. You can see the "loft" that will be accessible from the office and
give me a bit more air conditioned storage space.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/pano.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/pano.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The astute reader will now note that when the wall is completed... there will be no way to get into the office!
More on that soon.</p>
<h2>Demolition of the Old Shed</h2>
<p>Before the new shed came, I had to get rid of the old one. I tried for a week or two to <em>give it away</em> on
Craigslist, but that failed hysterically. A couple of people asked if it would fit in their SUV. It's a 10x12
shed that weighs hundreds of pounds!</p>
<p>After being disappointed by Craigslist once again, I decided to borrow a sawzall and demolish it myself. It was
a lot of hard work, but this timelapse makes it look super easy:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OxhCjshVRvU?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Preparing the Pad for the New Shed</h2>
<p>Since the new shed is 8 feet longer than the old shed was, I needed to make the pad 8 feet longer. Lone Star was
responsible for leveling the shed (which they did a great job of), I just had to provide a pad that was within
12 inches (!) of level.</p>
<p>The old pad was a few inches lower than the surrounding ground, so I wanted it to be a little more uniform.</p>
<p>I started by tilling the ground and then used the broad side of a pick axe to break it up more. I repeated that
process for... ever. Tilling, axing, raking, over and over.</p>
<p>After I got it all level enough, I wanted to compact it down. Since I didn't have a tamper and didn't want to
spend 40 bucks on one I'll never use again, my genius neighbor and I made a pretty janky makeshift tamper out of
a sledgehammer and some boards. It mostly kind of worked!</p>
<p>It also looks hysterical and insane.</p>
<p><img src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/tamper.jpg"></p><p>Turns out the best tamper is not a sledgehammer attached to some boards, but rather an SUV. Maybe my best idea
so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Again, the timelapse make it look super easy, but it was a lot of work. Please validate me!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p8iIReB9CM?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Delivery Day</h2>
<p>The day the shed was delivered I was nervously just waiting around for them to show up. We live on a quiet
residential street that is not super wide, so I was a bit worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down the
street. I was also worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down our driveway, which is also not very wide.</p>
<p>Then a full on 18-wheeler turned the corner and I thought to myself</p>
<p><img src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/mistake.gif"></p><p>Not only did he have my shed on there, he had another one too! Like it was no big deal!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-bHsgYG2KM?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the face of a concerned person whose neighbors are coming outside to see what the ruckus is.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/concerned.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/concerned.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here I am talking to him trying to figure out just exactly what the plan is here, as if I could help.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg"></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, the guy that does this for a living (not me) was less concerned than the average software
developer (me), and apparently it <em>was</em> no big deal because he just tipped the magic trailer back and plopped it
in the street like a boss.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The guy (Joe) that drove the shed down the driveway and positioned in place was a wizard with his tiny little
forklift. I have no idea how he did it, because we had only inches to spare.</p>
<p>I'm so pumped for my new shed that I pre-emptively celebrate with a Diet Coke while Joe is toiling away
somewhere actually getting stuff done.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/celebrating.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/celebrating.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I did have to cut trees back in a few places on both sides of the driveway, so I wasn't <em>totally</em> useless.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/trees.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/trees.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Here's the whole 1-2 hour process nice and sped up.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKfLARMYZ_o?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once it was in place, Joe spent another 30 or 45 minutes getting it all level.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/leveling.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/leveling.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And now I have a shed! Monster is concerned that it may be too much house for him to handle, I haven't broken
the news that it's not actually for him.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/monster-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/monster-1.jpg"></a></p>
<h2>Adding a French Door</h2>
<p>Because I'm going to be having two separate partitions in the building with a wall in between, I'll need a way
to access the office. The doors that are already present on the shed access the tool/yard storage area.</p>
<p>When I was designing the shed I had the option to add a door and some windows using their online design tool,
but everything they offer is geared towards sheds because... they build sheds. I wanted something that looked
a little nicer since this is going to be my office and take up a large portion of our yard.</p>
<p>One of my friends recommended that I put in french doors that can serve both as an access point and let in a ton
of light. I found a good <a href="http://www.craddocklumber.com/">local lumber company</a> that I bought the door from. I
was able to customize it so that it swings <em>out</em> instead of in, because there isn't a ton of room for an
in-swinging door in the office.</p>
<p>They also delivered it for me. Turns out it's very very heavy. And beautiful!</p>

<p>For this part of the project I recruited my Dad and my brother-in-law because I knew it was going to be a tough
one to do solo.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-team.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-team.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We started by clearing the studs out of the section that the door was going to fit in. The placement was figured
so that I have enough room to put my desk in one corner without it overlapping into the door. We used a combo of
sledgehammer + prybar to get the studs out.</p>
<p>Note that this shed is so small (and has the loft wall), that there is
basically no load carried by this wall, so we could just knock the studs out without worrying. We did of course
frame the door in, but there's just so little to worry about in this regard because of the size of the building.</p>
<p>If you do something like this, don't listen to some guy on the internet, ask someone who actually knows what
they're doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-placement.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-placement.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Once we got it framed up, we took a sawzall and just started cutting it out! There's no going back from this
point, which was very scary.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg"></a></p>

<p>With the wall gone, it was time to dry fit the door and start getting it installed. This was the first time any
of us had ever installed a french door, so I was pleased that we got it pretty close! I think the rough
opening was bigger than it needed to be, but we added an extra 2x4 and lots …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>It’s 2am. You finally have a Lambda function running in a VPC. And all it took was 40 Terraform <code>resource</code> blocks and 8 hours of your life. You breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that you are the embodiment of DevOps.</p><p>The next day, after getting a good night of sleep, you realize that maybe your <code>hello-world-test</code> Lambda function isn’t as unique as you thought it was, and maybe somebody else has created a Terraform module that could have saved you a few hours with a more production-ready result.</p><p>One year later, you look back fondly on your days of not knowing what the heck you were doing, as you now publish new Lambda functions in minutes with a trusty Terraform module. But is this module something you wrote, or is it open-source? And what difference does that make?</p><p>This post makes an argument that you should try to use open-source Terraform modules when you can, and that you’re likely able to much more often than you might think.</p><p>At Transcend, we use open-source Terraform modules as much as we can to ensure we are always building our software on secure, tested infrastructure, built with best practices. While we still have a few small private modules that we use internally, over 60% of our over 500 used modules are open-source.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-terraform-module">What is a Terraform module?</h2><p><a href="https://terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Terraform</a> has taken over as a dominant force in the infrastructure-as-code world. It’s easy to get started with, open-sourced, and is incredibly powerful across dozens of cloud providers.</p><p>Terraform lets you create <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">resource blocks</a> that define a cloud resource, such as a server, IAM user, or database. As an extension, you can also group resources together into reusable <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">modules</a>.</p><p>To use a module, you create a new block in any terraform file and specify the block type as <code>module</code>, and point the <code>source</code> field to any module on <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the open-source registry</a>.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>module</span><span> "vault" </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>source</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"hashicorp/vault/aws"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>version</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"0.14.0"</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>In this example, the module points to the v0.14.0 version of <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/vault/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hashicorp’s official Vault module</a>. Pinning to a specific version is crucial with external modules, as it allows you to pin to a specific point in time.</p><p>I like to think of modules as a function. The <code>source</code> is the name of the function you want to call. The <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">variables you pass in</a> are the parameters, and the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">output blocks it defines</a> are the function result. The function body is updating cloud resources to match your defined <code>resource</code> configuration.</p><h2 id="arguments-for-using-open-source-modules">Arguments for using open-source modules</h2><p>While coding your own Terraform modules is tempting for those that like to get in the weeds and learn, there are some key reasons why leveraging existing open-source work is beneficial in the long run.</p><h3 id="1-major-components-of-your-infrastructure-are-not-unique">1. Major components of your infrastructure are not unique</h3><p>If each company could just copy-paste each others’ infrastructure and we could all have well-secured, easily maintainable, highly performant infrastructure at the press of a button, we wouldn’t need DevOps or Operations engineers. In the real world, things aren’t that easy as each company has its own requirements.</p><p>But even so, we often choose to rely on the same underlying technologies. Depending on your requirements, you might choose to deploy some apps directly onto servers like an EC2, or maybe you will containerize your app and deploy it to ECS or a Kubernetes cluster, or maybe your app works best on a serverless platform like Lambda. And in each of these cases, you still have many options to customize exactly how you want your infrastructure.</p><p>With nearly infinite different ways you can deploy and secure your applications, it may seem like using pre-built modules won’t work for your exact use case. But by accepting that you’ll still likely use services like VPCs, Lambda, Autoscaling groups, ECS/EKS, etc, we must admit that the level of “pre-built”-ness we need exists on a spectrum.</p><p>You wouldn’t use “we’re all unique” as justification for not using Terraform, or for not using Kubernetes, so we need to carefully evaluate if that argument applies for Terraform modules. And that leads us to…</p><h3 id="2-certain-open-source-modules-are-highly-reusable">2. Certain open-source modules are highly reusable</h3><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/a91P4mjYrtJM2FIOrAnv4/a1ae4616ec44b056e928a743656090f9/xavi-cabrera-kn-UmDZQDjM-unsplash.jpg" alt="An image of Lego blocks."></p><figcaption>Use (and re-use) building blocks. (photo by Xavi Cabrera on Unsplash).</figcaption></div><p>Maybe you don’t want a single “web-app” module like <a href="https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-web-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this one</a> that manages all of your infrastructure for an app for you. For new applications, it might be a good option, but maybe you don’t want your logs going to CloudWatch, as you use something else. Maybe you want to use Kubernetes because you have an existing cluster. Maybe you have an existing CI/CD pipeline and don’t want to use Codepipeline.  Maybe you want to use Istio for service registration instead of AWS App Mesh.</p><p>But the all-in approach is just one end of the spectrum, and the other is not using modules at all, and just defining each resource you need in a tedious manner that could end up with hundreds/thousands of lines of code required per application.</p><p>At Transcend, we’ve found the happy medium of using modules that aim to handle all resources within a specific AWS service (or sometimes a small handful). This means that we don’t search for full web-app solutions, but for modules related to <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VPCs</a>, <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lambda</a>, <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IAM</a>, etc.</p><p>As an example, here is a usage of the VPC module from terraform-aws-modules:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>module</span><span> vpc </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>source</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>version</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"v2.62.0"</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span>            </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"demo-vpc"</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>cidr</span><span>            </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"10.0.0.0/16"</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>azs</span><span>             </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"eu-west-1a"</span><span>, </span><span>"eu-west-1b"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  </span><span>public_subnets</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"10.0.1.0/24"</span><span>, </span><span>"10.0.2.0/24"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>  </span><span>private_subnets</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"10.0.11.0/24"</span><span>, </span><span>"10.0.12.0/24"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>enable_nat_gateway</span><span>     </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  </span><span>single_nat_gateway</span><span>     </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  </span><span>one_nat_gateway_per_az</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  </span><span>enable_flow_log</span><span>                      </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>create_flow_log_cloudwatch_log_group</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>  </span><span>create_flow_log_cloudwatch_iam_role</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>  </span><span>flow_log_max_aggregation_interval</span><span>    </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>60</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>If you are familiar with VPCs on AWS, this likely reads fairly easily regardless of if you’ve seen this module before. It creates a private cloud named <code>demo-vpc</code> that has public and private subnets in the <code>eu-west-1</code> region. The private subnets will have external internet access through a NAT gateway that is shared across AZs to save money. All network traffic will be logged to a new Flow Logs log group.</p><p>This short module declaration creates 25 unique resources in the AWS cloud and is highly customizable. Not only is it far quicker to write this module than it is to write out all 25 resources manually, but it is far less error-prone.</p><h3 id="3-open-source-modules-save-time">3. Open-source modules save time</h3><p>An excellent example of a module that makes use of other open-source modules is the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-awms-atlantis/blob/master/main.tf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">terraform-aws-atlantis</a> module used to create a CI/CD pipeline for your infrastructure code.</p><p>It creates a VPC, load balancer, ACM certificate, security groups, and an ECS service all using open-source modules. That likely made writing and maintaining that module much easier than using all custom resources, but the composition of all of those modules is what makes for the biggest time saver of all: You can directly use their pre-built solution if you want to, while also <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-atlantis/blob/master/variables.tf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">customizing it extensively</a>.</p><p>For larger applications like Atlantis, Hashicorp Vault, or Transcend Sombra, the initial setup can be daunting. But the Terraform community made a reusable <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/atlantis/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">module for creating Atlantis clusters</a>, Hashicorp paid <a href="https://gruntwork.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gruntwork</a> to create <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/vault/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a secure implementation of Vault</a>, and at Transcend we created a module for <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/transcend-io/sombra/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">our Sombra service</a> that can be self-hosted if our customers want complete control over the encryption of their data.</p><p>In particular I love the Hashicorp Vault module, as it let us scaffold up a working Vault cluster in a day or two, and we can be highly confident in the security of our cluster. For a server that’s main job is to hold our most sensitive secrets, that is a massive confidence boost.</p><p>When Vault came out with support for DynamoDb as a storage backend for secrets, we were immediately interested due to the global redundancy and high availability offered by Dynamo. Within a few weeks, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/releases/tag/v0.13.6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the Vault module was updated to support the new backend</a>, and migrating was easy.</p><p>If we had written our own Vault module, we would have had to change over the backend configuration ourselves, instead of just changing what flags/variables we passed to the module.</p><h3 id="4-open-source-modules-are-highly-configurable">4. Open-source modules are highly configurable</h3><p>In the above example, you’ll notice that we enabled <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VPC Flow Logs</a>. At one point, we were having some troubles with one of our VPC’s security groups and weren’t sure why some traffic wasn’t hitting it’s endpoint.</p><p>After researching flow logs and recognizing that they could help us debug, we added… </p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>enable_flow_log</span><span>                      </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>create_flow_log_cloudwatch_log_group</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>create_flow_log_cloudwatch_iam_role</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span></p></pre></div><p>…to our module, which handles creating a log group, giving the VPC access via a new IAM Role to publish the logs, and configures the VPC to write out Flow Logs to that log group.</p><p>These three lines create five <code>resources</code> in Terraform per VPC, and with dozens of VPCs throughout Transcend, it was wonderful to already have this functionality built into the modules before we needed it. A single PR with a small diff added Flow Logs support to all of our VPCs, all without needing to look up any documentation on specific resources.</p><p>The high amount of customization many open-source modules offer makes them great for production-readiness. Instead of searching for one module that does everything, you can compose the smaller modules to quickly scaffold almost any infrastructure you want.</p><h3 id="5-open-source-modules-are-easy-to-make-more-configurable">5. Open-source modules are easy to make more configurable</h3><p>Whether you use open-source modules or homemade, you’ll likely want to add features to the module at some point.</p><p>As an example, at Transcend we were using a <a href="https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cloudposse module</a> to manage our frontend CloudFront distributions. We noticed that the S3 buckets it stored the website asset files in were not encrypted, but as a best-practice at Transcend we encrypt all of our buckets.</p><p>We forked the repo, opened <a href="https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn/pull/60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a pull request that added support for encrypting the bucket</a>, and within a few …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is the most underrated generational shift in the world.</p><p>It saves everyone one hour per day in commute. It creates the biggest labor market in the world — a city in the cloud with hundreds of millions of people. It unlocks opportunity for everyone, regardless of where they live. It gives people more flexibility in working hours. The list goes on and on.</p><p>Remote work would be an unqualified panacea, if it wasn’t for one downside: it makes it harder to work together.</p><p>There’s less alignment than before. Conversations that used to take half an hour now stretch over days filled with Zoom meetings. And most importantly — work is less <em>fun</em> than it used to be. There’s less camaraderie, as it’s become harder to build culture and relationships between coworkers.</p><p>That’s certainly borne by the data. Buffer’s survey of 3,500 remote workers found that the two biggest struggles of remote workers are loneliness and “collaboration and communication.” And that was <em>before</em> the pandemic.</p><figure id="w-node-791ec061a5f0-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5ff4ffaaacc8fb2ac2c890bc_Biggest%20Struggle.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Beers on Friday evenings have been replaced by awkward “Zoom happy hours.” It’s become harder to build culture and camaraderie — the friction to jump onto a call is high enough to kill 90% of the chats that would have happened in the office.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-529857530ec2-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5ff5111a5c10c36583323985_Graph.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Taken individually, none of these interactions are very important. They’re of the “how’s it going?” variety. But collectively, they’re what culture is made of.</p><p>Ignoring the problem can be tempting. Work is still happening, after all. But it would be hard to overstate how important this issue actually is. There’s a reason why management books emphasize culture and team bonding so much — few things are more important, since everything else depends on this. In Brian Chesky’s words, “<a href="https://medium.com/@bchesky/dont-fuck-up-the-culture-597cde9ee9d4">Don’t fuck up the culture.</a>”</p><p>This too is supported by the data. <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-teams">An MIT study of 2,500 white-collar workers</a> found that: (emphasis mine)</p><blockquote><em>“</em><strong><em>35% of the variation in a team’s performance can be accounted for simply by the number of face-to-face exchanges among team members.</em></strong><em> [… T]he least valuable forms of communication are e-mail and texting.”</em></blockquote><h3>Virtual offices: how to have our cake and eat it too<br></h3><p>Fortunately, we think there is a way to have our cake and eat it too — to have all the upside of remote, and none of the downside.</p><p><strong>We believe we can make collaboration software that’s so powerful that remote work becomes not only as good, but significantly better than being in the office.</strong></p><p>We’ve called it Teamflow.</p><p>Teamflow is a virtual office for remote teams. It recreates the casual, unplanned chats and the seamless collaboration that people miss from physical offices.</p><p>Here’s how it works: you see your video in a bubble on a virtual floor plan. You can move that bubble around, and only hear people around you. That means that, to chat with someone, you just drag your bubble over, and start talking.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5ff5138f5508e8986a0174eb_teamflow-steps.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-3944ae63fcff-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5ff4f7229abf13808ad3c99d_Steps.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We’ve been running Teamflow in private beta for the last six months, and were blown away by the response.

<div><p>Thanks for signing up. We'll be in touch soon.</p></div><div><p>Oops! Something went wrong while signing up.</p></div></div></div><h3>Spatial Interface</h3><p><a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">John Palmer’s essay on spatial interfaces</a> is what inspired us to make space core to Teamflow.</p><p>In short, space comes intuitively to people. We had to become experts at it for our very survival — our sensorimotor skills are so good that roboticists talk of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox">Moravec’s Paradox</a>” to designate the fact that AI was kicking our world champions’ butts at chess as early as in the 90s, but it still can’t do things like driving, which any teenager can learn.</p><p>We were skeptical at first, but after more than 50,000 hours of meetings on Teamflow, we’ve seen spatiality deliver on its promise.</p><p>One of our customers’ new hires told me that it’s only when they started using Teamflow, a full 4 weeks after he onboarded, that he met some of his coworkers for the first time — and that’s with a company of only 25 people.</p><p>This is hardly a unique experience — people underestimate how jarring it can be to start a new job at a remote company. On their first day at work, nobody is going to click on a list of names on Slack just to introduce themselves. But when you see your coworkers’ face in the same space as you, it feels natural to drag yourself over and say hi.<br></p><h3>Integrated Apps</h3><p>The real job-to-be-done of videoconferencing tool is to help people work together — and collaboration is much more than communication. So we think it’s only natural that you’d be able to open your work tools right where your meeting is happening.<br></p><p>Teamflow lets you open apps in the space. For now, these include:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>A scratchpad</li><li>A whiteboard</li><li>A countdown timer</li><li>A universal embed app, letting you open links to your applications like Trello, Figma or Google Docs</li></ul><p>Now, don’t tell anyone, but that’s kind of our world domination plan right there. We aim to be the “meta-coordination layer” that Kevin Kwok wrote about in <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">The Arc of Collaboration</a>:<br></p><blockquote><em>There is a need for a layer across all the applications. A layer for things that should be shared across the apps as well collaborative functionality across them. There is some mix of presence, collaboration, coordination, and identity that should be ubiquitous across whatever apps are being used. A layer more attached to the people doing work and what they’re trying to accomplish—than which specific app they’re in.</em><br></blockquote><p>We believe that opening all your apps in the same space as your meeting is a much more natural way of working, eliminating what we call “Cmd + Tab fatigue.”<br></p><p>It’s a more natural way of sharing, too. No more “okay, hold on one sec, I’m paaaastiiiing the link here in the chat… Can everybody see it?” You just open the link in the space, and everyone sees it immediately.<br></p><p>Finally, it’s a more natural way of collaborating. The default way people collaborate with Zoom is by screensharing, something we view as fundamentally uncollaborative — not only can only one person screenshare at a time, they’re also the only ones who can drive. It instantly makes a meeting feel like someone is speaking <em>at</em> you. This stands in contrast with Teamflow apps, which everyone can use at the same time, making for more engaging meetings.</p><figure id="w-node-be233c7bbe62-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5ff4f82741be0c3b2aa5d5f8_Illo-Persistence.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><div>

<div><p>Thanks for signing up. We'll be in touch soon.</p></div><div><p>Oops! Something went wrong while signing up.</p></div></div></div><h3>Persistent rooms</h3><p>If Zoom is our new office, it’s a peculiar one, in that it “factory resets” between each meeting, making it a permanent blank slate — the digital equivalent of <a href="https://youtu.be/GHrdvwWsK54?t=25">Pied Piper’s new office</a> in the TV show Silicon Valley:</p><figure id="w-node-9e22d5a7866a-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5fe52dcd87b80e45262887ca_image4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>I think people underestimate the impact this has on collaboration. Imagine if you couldn’t keep anything on your desk, or put anything on the walls of your office. Humans are territorial animals — we need a space to call our own.<br></p><p>At the office, when a deadline looms for an important project, it’s common to set up a “war room” — a space dedicated to the project. These war rooms are very effective — the only reason we don’t use them more often is that space is so scarce.</p><p>So it’s ironic that we’re now given a medium with <em>unlimited space</em>, and instead of taking advantage of it, we limit it <em>even more</em> than what we had previously. We could have infinite war rooms — but instead, we get zero of them.</p><figure id="w-node-937b8f368b56-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5fe52df1d588368cdb032da6_image3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>This could be us but you playing</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Teamflow takes advantage of this infinite real estate. It lets you create one room for each of your projects, and the apps you open in that room persist: they’ll still be there when you come back. Imagine your Google Docs meeting notes, your Figma design, your project’s metrics dashboard — all together in one place.</p><p>This turns the current collaboration paradigm on its head. The way our tools work today is very app-centric. But the way we think about work is <em>project</em>-centric. Google Docs, Trello, or Jira don’t matter — the projects they enable do.</p><p>These three pillars — the spatial interface, integrated apps, and persistent rooms — form a cohesive whole. Apps live in the space, and persist. And together, we think they can make remote work better than being in the office.</p><h3>Making remote better than being in the office</h3><p>It may sound like a lofty goal, but it needs not be. It’s not like the quality of in-office work was a physical constant, the speed of light of collaboration.</p><p>In fact, there are many ways in which the physical world stands in the way of collaboration — and the benefits of a virtual office become obvious when cast under that light:</p><p>‍<br></p><div>

                    <p>New Year is a great time to summarize the past year! So let’s see what happened with GitLab product.</p>
<p><span>This time I decided to focus on new features that were released in 2020 and to represent some interesting data and insights as charts. </span></p>
<p><span>As providers of DevOps and ALM solutions (and partners of GitLab company for 4+ years and using GitLab ourselves for 5+ years) we work intensively with customers using GitLab or those who are looking for solutions that can be provided by tools like GitLab.</span></p>
<p><span>The data we’re based on is open source and available online so we used GitLab API and GitLab CI to generate some interesting charts (and we even used GitLab runners to process some data).</span></p>
<p><span>The data below is based on the last 12 monthly releases, i.e. 12.7 (January 2020) to 13.7 (December 2020)</span></p>
<p><b>Total: 711 new features were released in that period.</b></p>
<h3>The most 10 popular features created over the past year:</h3>

<p><span>This is a distribution chart. We collected all new features over the past year (12.7 -13.7) and checked what stage they belong to.</span></p>
<p>GitLab separates all features into 11 stages: Manage, Plan, Create, Verify, Package, Secure, Release, Configure, Monitor, Protect, and Enablement.</p>
<p>A more detailed chart demonstrating GitLab categories can be seen here:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="8.7.1"><div dir="ltr"><div><h3 id="viewer-foo"><span><span>We live in a digital age, technology has drastically changed how we live and keeping fit is no exception </span></span></h3><p id="viewer-9veah"><span>Because of the pandemic, more and more people have had to transition to working out at home, and as with most aspects of going into lockdown, technology has helped make that transition a lot easier. Here are 6 ways that technology is revolutionising working out at home whilst gyms have been closed! Will we ever need to go back?</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6dj21"><span>Wearable Technology </span></h2><p id="viewer-d9mjp"><span>Although it's been around for a while, wearable technology plays an important part in people fitness routines, such as fitness trackers which are always gaining in popularity with <span>one in five Americans now owning one. However, </span><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>it is debated</u></a><span> whether or not thes</span>e devices <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>help you to move more and get healthier</u></a>, because people mistake them for <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>motivational tools</u></a> whereas, in fact, the reason devices like Fitbit and Apple Watch exist is to help improve your fitnes<span>s routine, not make you stick to it. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-4eokf"><span>Wearable technology can provide you with valuable data and analysis into your performance, whether you're running, swimming or working out, by giving information about your heart rate, calories burned and more. The <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>new Apple Watch</u></a> will even tell you about your <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>blood oxygen level!</u></a></span></p><h2 id="viewer-rnpl"><span>Virtual Training Apps</span></h2><p id="viewer-ei0tn"><span>Mobile fitness apps have also taken the world by storm and with lockdowns around the world due to the pandemic, many people have turned to these apps to make the most of their time at home. Nowadays there are hundreds of fitness apps available covering almost any aspect of fitness and health you can think of.</span></p><p id="viewer-6ujkj"><span>There is no doubt that these apps are having an enormous impact on the industry, thanks to the practicality of having a "virtual trainer" on your phone but that isn't to say that they're better than having a personal trainer and a gym membership. Although some of these apps, especially home workout apps, may promise amazing results, for the moment they still can't compete with the advice from a personal trainer and the variety of equipment available at a gym. </span></p><p id="viewer-8caip"><span>These apps are probably best for when you're on the move, tracking things like running and cycling or if you simply haven't got the time to go to the gym. </span></p><h2 id="viewer-f5fkr"><span>Gamification</span></h2><p id="viewer-7p4vf"><span>Despite being a relatively new addition to the fitness world, this new gym trend seems quite promising. Gamification is <span>the application of typical elements of game playing like point scoring, competition with others and rules of play to other areas of activity, in this case, fitness.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-fc5od"><span>When gamification is present in a fitness experience, it creates a fun, challenging environment for participants by creating <!-- -->lead boards and a sense of achievement and competition. This tech often exists in training apps, allowing you and your friends to see each other's performance like in the Strava and Nike Training apps, but gyms are now trying to integrate it too.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-e1g3g"><span><span>Suggested Articles:</span></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-aqpj0"><p><span>⌚️</span><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Fitness Trackers: Helping us Get Fit or Just Another Gadget</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-2udnu"><p><strong>🍎 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Apple Event September 2020, everything you need to know</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-2o9hk"><p><strong>📱 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/smartphones-the-true-cost-of-upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Smartphones: The True Cost of Upgrades</u></strong></a><strong> ♻️</strong></p></li></ul><h2 id="viewer-98ft4"><span><strong>Smart, Connected Equipment </strong></span></h2><p id="viewer-evclh"><span>Some Gyms are now starting to offer smart and connected equipment to their members, offering them the ability to move from one gym to the other and <!-- -->continue to feed into their own personal data bank of performances. </span></p><p id="viewer-4c64s"><span>This new generation of equipment includes <!-- -->Bluetooth connectivity equipped spin cycles, treadmills and step machines and more! </span></p><h2 id="viewer-r6lc"><span>Virtual Reality Fitness</span></h2><p id="viewer-2i1v5"><span>Some gyms have even started using Virtual Reality (VR) fitness equipment with machines such as <!-- -->VirZOOM,<!-- --> a blend of stationary bikes and VR games and the <!-- -->Icaros flying machine<!-- -->, a core &amp; upper body focused VR. The main benefit of this is, of course, adding a bit of fun to your workouts, because there is no doubt that training your core while flying through space on your Icaros will be a bit more exciting than a set of lame crunches!</span></p><p id="viewer-915mg"><span>This ability to make have fun whilst working out and not have it all be about data and performance could be a game-changer for the industry, but in it's current state, VR fitness is by no means perfect. The obvious disadvantage is the awkwardness of working out in a headset, but that's not all, being a relatively new technology, debates on how long you should spend using a VR headset and what effects it could have on you brain and eyes in the long term are being had.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-d446h"><span>The Full Gym Experience - At Home! </span></h2><p id="viewer-77nna"><span>We've talked about virtual training apps, fitness trackers and connected equipment, but what if all this was to come in one, ultimate home fitness package?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>Megaphone is a podcast hosting provider. All podcast hosting providers collect listener stats, but that's only seen by the hosting provider and the podcaster themselves. Stats are fine, but Megaphone collects listener data in order to serve targeted ads to listeners. Not only that, they are sharing this data with big ad tech like Neilsen Media Research. Which is bad for privacy and creepy. So bad that some anti-tracking tools are blocking all podcasts hosted on Megaphone.</p><p>Full discloser: I use Megaphone as the hosting provider for my podcast.</p><h2 id="what-is-going-on">What is going on?</h2><p>Here's a video made by Megaphone explaining what they are doing and what MTM is.</p><figure><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/281670844?app_id=122963" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" title="Megaphone for Advertisers"></iframe></figure><p>In short they have a service called Megaphone Targeted Marketplace (MTM) which tracks listener behavior and pairs it with Nielsen segments to present listeners with ads that are targeted for them. It's actually some amazing tech because if you think about it, all that has to be done on demand in real time and new ads are stitched into the mp3 as it streams over to the listener. </p><p>A more longer version is that when you request an mp3 from Megaphone to listen to, you first request it from traffic.megaphone.fm. Then it redirects to adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud, which grabs all kinds of listener data such as geo location and type of device and sends that to <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/">Neilsen Media Research</a> to find a an ad for the listener. It then redirects the listener to the actual mp3 which is hosted on dcs.megaphone.fm. The problem is, listener data is now being collected by an advertising agency. Which means podcast listeners may be tracked across multiple shows even.</p><p>Megaphone <a href="https://megaphone.fm/adchoices">has a website which explains</a> their ad choices and even gives you a link to Neislen to opt out of targeted ads. However it's not clear that if you opt-out in the browser if it also opts-out for the podcast players too.</p><p>Also from <a href="https://www.megaphone.fm/terms/privacy">Megaphone's privacy policy</a> it explicitly says they are collecting listener data:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-4.png 1000w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-4.png 1484w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And later in the privacy policy it says this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-6.png 1554w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So Megaphone makes it clear they are collecting listener data and sharing it with ad tech companies (such as Neilsen) to insert targeted ads into podcasts.</p><p>And of course when people listen to podcasts they have no idea where it's hosted, and aren't going to look through this privacy policy to even know their data is collected and shared with advertisers.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-a-problem">Why is this a problem?</h2><p>Well as it turns out people don't like being tracked. And there's a whole suite of anti-tracking privacy tools out there. There are DNS sinkhole services like <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">pi-hole</a> and <a href="https://nextdns.io/">NextDNS</a> which block domains that track you, there are browser plugins to block this like <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">AdBlockPlus</a>, <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>, and <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">PrivacyBadger</a>, and there are browsers that block this too like <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>. These tools work tirelessly to figure out what website are tracking us and it blocks them so they can't do it anymore. Megaphone tracks listeners. </p><h2 id="megaphone-is-now-blocked">Megaphone is now blocked</h2><p>For the first time this has become an issue. At no point in the history of podcasting has this ever been an issue before, but now it is (thanks to Megaphone). In the last few months certain blocklists have began adding Megaphone to them. This means that people who use some of the tools above may not be able to play some of their favorite podcasts.</p><p>For instance when you go to my podcast website and try to play my podcast with an up to date version of Brave, you cannot play the audio. When you hit the play button you get a big red exclamation point.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image.png 998w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Then when you investigate what's going on you see that Megaphone was blocked.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-1.png 754w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And there's the real problem, Brave blocked traffic.megaphone.fm because it considers it a tracker. This means podcast listeners cannot play podcasts if they use certain privacy tools and tracker blockers. It's not like Brave can block just the tracking part of Megaphone and let through the audio. No it blocks the audio which fundamentally breaks the podcast listening experience.</p><h2 id="what-blocklists-is-megaphone-showing-up-on">What blocklists is Megaphone showing up on?</h2><p>Once again, when someone goes to listen to a podcast (mp3) hosted on Megaphone it first goes to traffic.megaphone.fm which is just a CNAME for adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud. And this <a href="https://blocklist-tools.developerdan.com/entries/search?q=adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud">does show up on some blocklists</a>. </p><p>(The ones with the green check marks means it appears in the blocklist. The red ones mean it was on the list previously.)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-3.png 1000w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-3.png 1486w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>That's 6 blocklists that lists Megaphone! </p><p><strong><a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> is blocking Megaphone</strong>. This is a privacy focused browser which has a feature called shields which blocks ads and trackers by default. Specifically it blocks traffic.megaphone.fm because that<a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=cname%3atraffic.megaphone.fm&amp;run=toolpage"> has a CNAME</a> resolution to adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud, which does appear on one of their blocklists. <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates-6/">Brave blocks CNAMES</a> which resolve to domains on the blocklist. </p><p><strong><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> is blocking Megaphone.</strong> This is a browser plugin to block ad content. It sees that when you go to download an mp3 it sends you to adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud and blocks it.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-5.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-5.png 1000w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-5.png 1256w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now the reason Brave and uBlock are blocking Megaphone is because they use the standard <a href="https://easylist.to/">EasyList blocklist</a>. But if you search EasyList you won't see Megaphone. Instead it's hitting the rules that look like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>.adserver. 
/adserver/*
_adserver.
###AdServer
##.ADServer
&amp;adserver=
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>So simply because they redirect people to <strong>adserver</strong>.va3.megaphone.cloud means that these rules above will block it. And Brave, AdBlockPlus, and uBlock all use this list.</p><p>So that makes 7 blocklists they are on!</p><p><strong><a href="https://nextdns.io/">NextDNS</a> is blocking Megaphone.</strong> This is a service that will block trackers through DNS queries. This is probably even more of a problem since this means listeners can't play the podcasts on any apps since the DNS service is blocking it. NextDNS uses the GoodbyeAds blocklist <a href="https://github.com/jerryn70/GoodbyeAds">https://github.com/jerryn70/GoodbyeAds</a>. Specifically the domains blocked are playlist.megaphone.fm, adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud, and player.megaphone.fm. </p><p><strong>Some pi-hole users</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/iv03ko/intermittent_difficulties_downloading_podcasts/">have reported that Megaphone was being blocked</a> when using certain blocklists. They've had to do workarounds like <a href="https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist/issues/137">adding a whitelist for Megaphone</a> to play their favorite podcasts.</p><p><strong><a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a> appears to be next.</strong> This is a browser plugin that also blocks trackers and currently has Megaphone.fm on their yellow list. <a href="https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/master/src/data/yellowlist.txt">https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/master/src/data/yellowlist.txt</a></p><p>If you include this yellow list, that puts Megaphone on 8 lists!</p><h2 id="podcast-directories-now-warn-listeners">Podcast directories now warn listeners</h2><p><a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> is an iOS podcast player and it has recently began warning users that Megaphone tracks listeners. Here is what it says:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/overcast2.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Here you see a clear difference also between stats and tracking. I am not saying stats are bad. Stats are good even. But this whole listener tracking thing is not something anyone wants or benefits from except the advertisers. </p><p>If you search for <a href="https://podnews.net/podcast/1296350485">my podcast on the Podnews.net</a> website you also see a warning there too, which looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-11.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-11.png 1000w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/image-11.png 1600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-11.png 1946w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It's not a good sign when podcast directories are now warning people that this hosting provider tracks listeners.</p><h2 id="my-show-doesn-t-track-listeners">My show doesn't track listeners</h2><p>This is where stuff gets mucky for me. I have a podcast hosted on Megaphone. I even used MTM in the past, but it's always felt creepy to me, so I switched it off because I don't feel comfortable tracking listeners like that. Which means I am leaving money on the table, but choose my listeners privacy over the extra money the show would generate. And I have confirmed that by disabling MTM, Megaphone won't share my listener data with Neilsen. Yet, because my show is hosted by a company that does track some listeners, I'm being negatively impacted by this. I have to tell listeners to whitelist my hosting provider so they can play my show. My show is suffering from collateral damage. And this is particularly bad because I make a podcast about all the nasty stuff that goes on over the internet. I look like a damn hypocrite for hosting with Megaphone. But it's not so easy to up and move hosting providers. First of all not many hosting providers do dynamic ad insertion, which is what I need, but second it would mean losing all my stats and having to do tech support on helping tons of listeners move over to the new RSS feed. And I like Megaphone as a host, they have a good service and I continue to use them even though I don't use MTM. Which means MTM isn't their secret sauce to success. It is only a small feature they offer and it isn't crucial to their business. They don't need it and they can succeed just as well. So I'd rather not leave them. I'd rather they make a better decision on what kind of company they want to be.</p><h2 id="tracking-listeners-like-this-is-creepy">Tracking listeners like this is creepy</h2><p>Megaphone's competitor is <a href="https://art19.com/">Art19</a> (Megaphone is bigger). Art19 just rolled out their own version of targeted ads. &nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ART19 wants to bring listener-targeted ads to podcasting. Fuck no! Podcasting is the last oasis where listeners aren't being targeted by who they are, but on what they listen to.

</figure><p>We can do effective advertising without the need to track user behavior. Let me give you an example. If someone uses a search engine and they search for "vacation destination ideas", from just their search alone you can give them very relevant ads telling them about certain travel deals. You don't need to know their age, location, income status to know that they are ready to take a trip and want some ideas. </p><p>The same goes for podcasts. I make a podcast about tech and hacking. So I can easily run ads about tech and security and my audience is probably interested in it. I don't need any fancy AI or big data algorithm to tell me what …</p></div></section></div>

<p>I’m probably going to have to eat this blog post 2 years from now…. oh well. I still believe that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">Async</a> has been mostly a failure since introduced in Python 3.4. Maybe I should be more specific, there seems to be a failure to adopt Async in the Python community and major packages at large. Sure, there are glimmers of hope like <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/">aiohttp</a>, but for the most part all the Async work and adoption seems to be on the fringes of the Python world. Why is this?</p>



<h2>Why has the adoption of Async in the Python community at large failed?</h2>



<p>I believe there are a few pretty straight forward reasons for this.</p>



<ul><li>It isn’t easy to use or understand how to use. It just isn’t Pythonic.</li><li>Its implementation has changed drastically over some minor Python versions, early in Async’s journey.</li><li>A combination of multithreading and multiprocessing can give the same speed improvements, in more straightforward way.</li></ul>



<p>Let’s cover each of these.</p>



<h3>It isn’t easy to use or understand how to use. It just isn’t Pythonic.</h3>



<p>Some of the examples and tutorials you run across right away might appear simple, try to lure you in. I can almost guarantee writing a fully async problem in the real world won’t be as straight forward and easy the first 100 times as you think it will be. Part of the reason Python has become so popular is that it is so approachable for the average person. It lowers the bar, for better or worse, of the programming entry point.</p>



<p>Async raises that bar again. Here is extremely simple example. </p>



<pre><code>import asyncio
from aiohttp import ClientSession
from datetime import datetime


async def fetch(url, session):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.read()


async def run():
    urls = ['http://www.cnn.com',
            'http://www.foxnews.com',
            'http://www.nbcnews.com',
            'http://www.abcnews.com',
            'http://www.usatoday.com/news',
            'https://www.bbc.com/news/world']
    tasks = []

    async with ClientSession() as session:
        for url in urls:
            task = asyncio.ensure_future(fetch(url, session))
            tasks.append(task)
        responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return responses

t1 = datetime.now()
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
future = asyncio.ensure_future(run())
responses = loop.run_until_complete(future)
for response in responses:
    print(response)
t2 = datetime.now()
timer = t2 - t1
print(f'Process took {timer} seconds')</code></pre>



<p>At first glance this might appear not too bad. But start to look closer, find all the <strong>async, await, ensure_future, gather</strong> etc. They are sprinkled throughout the code. It just isn’t that obvious. All the sudden the simple task of calling a bunch of website content. Granted it is pretty fast. <strong>Process took 0:00:00.896876 seconds</strong>.</p>



<p>Writing good async code just requires a different through process and approach from the normal Python routine. You have to think about understand the blocking parts of your codebase, figure out if the libraries you are using are async compatible or have async versions. You have to think about futures, awaiting, and event loops. It’s just a different way of thinking and once you commit to it, your codebase is going to look substantially different. And most likely trouble shooting is going to take on a new meaning. </p>



<h3>Its implementation has changed drastically over some minor Python versions, early in Async’s journey.</h3>



<p>When I first started to dabble with and write async Python code, when reading documentation and tutorials, it quickly became clear it mattered which version of Python I was on. It was evident that the form and function of writing Aync code had/has changed a lot between 3.4 and 3.6+. Enough where the code just wouldn’t work.</p>



<p>It was extremely confusing and frustrating at that point. When you have a new paradigm that is as hard to embrace and understand as Async, the last thing you want to do is the bait and switch. Also, the numerous different ways to express and accomplish the same tasks didn’t help either. </p>



<h3>A combination of multithreading and multiprocessing can give the same speed improvements, in more straightforward way.</h3>



<p>Let’s re-write the above example in a Multihreading way.</p>



<pre><code>from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import requests
from datetime import datetime


urls = ['http://www.cnn.com',
        'http://www.foxnews.com',
        'http://www.nbcnews.com',
        'http://www.abcnews.com',
        'http://www.usatoday.com/news',
        'https://www.bbc.com/news/world']


def get_url(url: str):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.content


t1 = datetime.now()
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=6) as thready:
    results = thready.map(get_url, urls)
for result in results:
    print(result)
t2 = datetime.now()
timer = t2 - t1
print(f'Process took {timer} seconds')</code></pre>



<p>Not bad, straightforward code, and by George it’s a little faster. <strong>Process took 0:00:00.793653 seconds</strong>. This is most likely the problem with Async being adopted into the mainstream Python community as a whole. It’s a hard sell to move from easy to write code and can be maintained and tested, to much more complex and hard to troubleshoot async code.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love async and write code as such when I get a chance. I think it’s a good mental exercise and I wish certain popular packages would support async. Pushing yourself to understand new way of writing code is always a good exercise. But I have my doubts about if Async will ever be a “mainstream” way of writing Python code now and in the future for most programmers. </p>

Fortune 500 companies, large U.S. federal government agencies, security vendors and operating system vendors are affected and its putting the spotlight on how fragile and sensitive the software development cycle is. Using best practices and digital certificates make you check some boxes on your checklist, but this hack shows clearly the need of additional protection. The bottom line is - if your CI/CD pipeline and your code release is unsafe, the door is wide open and invites people with bad intentions. Furthermore, all the money and effort you put into automation, vulnerability scanning and DevOps training is wasted.</p>
<p>This blog post covers the hack as well as the trusted CI/CD pipeline on a high level. If you're interested in the technical details please check our <a href="https://codenotary.com/blog/solarwinds-sunburst" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other blog post</a> as well. </p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-happened-here">What exactly happened here?</h2>
<p>SolarWinds, a popular IT monitoring and management vendor, made clear that hackers breached its systems and inserted malware into the software build process of its <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Orion platform</a>. As this was undetected for a long time, product updates shipped with the vulnerability for several months. That malware introduced a backdoor to access running <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/solutions/orion" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Orion</a> servers on customers infrastructures. </p>
<p>As many customers are using the Orion platform and do their job in having the software always updated, it's estimated that roughly 18.000 customers installed the backdoor and many got <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/fireeye-solarwinds-hack-genuinely-impacted-50-victims-a-15637" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">breached</a>. </p>
<p>Those affected include <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and FireEye, a cyber security vendor which first <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detected</a> the attack this month after the hackers stole <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/unauthorized-access-of-fireeye-red-team-tools.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proprietary security tools</a> it offers to its clients.</p>
<h2 id="the-legitimate-malware">The legitimate malware</h2>
<p>The real problem of this hack is its scope. </p>
<p>The attackers found a way to <strong>legitimize the malware</strong> by injecting it into the build pipeline. That build pipeline started to produce digitally signed and trusted software for over 18.000 customers worldwide. Currently it's not known, how many customers really installed the malware, but none of them would have questioned software signed and introduced by SolarWinds. And that's the real problem, the build pipeline produces builds and they are digitally signed with the SolarWinds certificate trusted by the Certificate authorities in Microsoft Windows, macOS and your browser. Revoking the digital certificate revokes the good and the bad software, as you can't differentiate between these.</p>
<p><strong>This given trust in digital certificates and company brand is the real issue.</strong></p>

<p>Let's make it clear! SolarWinds didn't run a security lacking, lousy maintained development lifecycle - they already did a lot to secure the build process and delivery by having architectural reviews, static and dynamic code analysis, open-source analysis, vulnerability checking and more.  After the hack was realized, they added more security related steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further restricting access rights to its build environment</li>
<li>Using a new code-signing certificate for new builds</li>
<li>Reviewing the build environment’s architecture, the privileged and non-privileged users with access to it, and the network surrounding it</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-avoid-these-attacks-in-the-future">How to avoid these attacks in the future?</h2>
<p>It wasn't a big open hole, the attackers used - it was a very sophisticated attack. Not entirely true, as there were some <a href="https://threatpost.com/solarwinds-default-password-access-sales/162327/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FTP credentials</a> in a public Git repository. Nevertheless, it's unclear if that FTP account was even part of that attack.</p>
<p>Of course, the big question to answer is, what can be done to avoid these widespread hacks in the future? Every vendor and security expert has its own favorite answer to it, but it all comes down to: There is a need for a comprehensive, holistic <strong>DevSecOps</strong> strategy, that aims to provide full observability:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is being used (bill of material)</li>
<li>when are certain components or open-source projects used</li>
<li>what is currently running in my build process</li>
<li>what is currently running in my production environment</li>
<li>who did introduce what component</li>
<li>who did approve what artifacts before being used/deployed</li>
<li>what is effected if the component will be updated or <strong>removed</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-trusted-cicd-pipeline">The trusted CI/CD Pipeline</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that highly sophisticated hacker can use the tiniest flaw to get into systems and won't stop to be very innovative. But that's not a reason to give up, only to make it harder for them every single day.</p>
<p>A trusted CI/CD pipeline where every used open source project, artifact, or module (hopefully) is known and compatibility tested before being integrated into a release that is going to be shipped or deployed is the most important start. </p>
<p>Therefore, our customers use CodeNotary to notarize every step and artifact within the pipeline by people (Developers, QA) or systems (vulnerability checker, compatibility testing software aso.).</p>
<p><img alt="trustedcicd" src="https://codenotary.com/images/blog/trustedcicd.jpg"></p>
<p>You can think of having the unique identity of every single artifact and the bill of material of your build cryptographically verifiably stored on an immutable ledger. Using CodeNotary Ledger Compliance you can choose to use a fast (up to 60.000 TX/min) worldwide distributed consortium blockchain (CodeNotary Ledger Compliance CI/CD) or an ultra-fast (up to 10.000.000 TX/sec) on-premise deployment (CodeNotary Ledger Compliance) or both.</p>
<p>When integrating the CodeNotary solution into your CI/CD pipeline, you gain <strong>4 main benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tamperproof history of all digital artifacts (single artifact and bill of material of the build)</li>
<li>Machines and people can notarize and authenticate every individual artifact inside or outside of your premises</li>
<li>Notarization can be done for every individual artifact using different states (Trusted, Untrusted, Unsupported)</li>
<li>Authentication can be done publicly by anyone with internet access (i. e. to check the current state of the download or build)</li>
</ul>
<p>The CI/CD protection can <strong>uniquely identify</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>git repositories (source code)</li>
<li>CI/CD pipeline (<a href="https://www.jenkins.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CircleCI</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TravisCI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a> and many more)</li>
<li>Container images</li>
<li>Files and folders (i. e. configuration files, build files, CI/CD recipes, installer binaries and many more)</li>
</ul>
<p>One benefit that should not be underestimated is the possibility to change the trust level of any digital object at any time and that everybody that should have access to that information can verify it. When using digital certificates you can only revoke that certificate for everything you ever signed, using CodeNotary you can precisely change the status of a certain release or artifact. </p>
<p><strong>Unlike the digital certificate approach using CodeNotary you can untrust your release the moment you realize there is a malware or even a non-approved component in it without giving up your whole trust chain.</strong></p>
<p>That allows fine grained observability of your build and release lifecycle as well as fine grained revocation of artifacts that have gone bad.</p>
<p>The combination of machine and user identity (separated from your SSO or inhouse user management), unique digital artifact identities and trust level (<strong>including a timestamp</strong>) is already powerful but worthless if stored in a normal database.</p>
<p><strong>Key is to store that information in an immutable ledger, that is always accessible and maintains the full history of changes.</strong></p>
<p>That is exactly what CodeNotary provides - tamperproof trust at every stage of your pipeline from source to deployment and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="secure-physical-access">Secure physical access</h2>
<p>Last but not least , we need to cover the physical access (SSH, Console, KVM) to the systems that run and distribute your code and builds.</p>
<p>Therefore, we're always looking to integrate security technology that allows protecting physical access as well. Crypto cards to secure the cryptographic root signing by the server or integrating Intel SGX and its protected enclave mechanism are just some examples how we make sure, that even a local physical access to manipulate artifacts can be observed and alerted on or of course protected against.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>The need of support for handling measurement units does not require any approval.
It is in particular true for the Ada programming language with its stress
on safety and maintainability. The proposed set of packages represents a
possible solution of the unit problem. Dimension checking is performed at
run-time, so performance is sacrificed for safety. However, an attempt was
made to reduce performance hit. The type Measure used to represent dimensioned
values can be constrained to a specific unit. Operations on constrained subtypes
of Measure could be potentially as efficient as floating-point operations.
They are declared inlined, so that at least theoretically, a decent compiler
could perform discriminant calculation and check at compile time.<p>
The key features of the approach:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    The type Unit denotes the dimension of a physical entity. The type Measure
    represents a dimensioned value;
  </li><li>
    Mixed unit arithmetic. Values in SI
    (<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/index.html">Le
    <b>S</b>ystème <b>I</b>nternational d'Unités</a>) units can
    be mixed with irregular units (such as foot and yard) as long as the result
    is defined;
  </li><li>
    Shifted unit support (a widely used instance of a shifted unit is degree
    of Celsius);
  </li><li>
    The type Measure is generic, parameterized by a floating-point type. A
    non-generic version based on the type Float is also provided;
  </li><li>
    String to Measure conversion supports as wide set of irregular units as 
	possible;</li><li>
    Currently the powers of the base unit components lie in the range -8..7. 
	This limitation has an implementation reason (absence of 64-bit modular 
	integers in some Ada compilers). For further discussion of this topic
    <a href="#64-bit">see</a>;</li><li>

	measurement unit editing and selection. The rest of the library can be used 
	independently on this part as well as on <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a>.</li></ul>

The units converter and mapper are small utilities provided as exercises to 
illustrate use 
of the software. The unit converter is a small dialog box where you can enter a 
dimensioned value and then convert it to SI. The unit mapper is a dialog box 
that converts value from one unit to another as you type it.
The source code is discussed in the section <a href="#3.2">3.2</a>.

Types</h2>
<p>
<a name="Measures"></a>
Two types are used for dealing with units. The type <a href="#Unit">Unit</a>
denotes the dimension of a physical entity. The type
<a href="#Measure">Measure</a> represents a dimensioned value it is defined in a
generic package <a href="#Measures">Measures</a> which is instantiated with the
desired floating-point type as the parameter:
</p><blockquote>
  <p><tt><span color="#0000FF">generic</span><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <span color="#0000FF">type</span> Number <span color="#0000FF"> is digits
  </span> &lt;&gt;;<br>
  <span color="#0000FF">package</span> Measures <span color="#0000FF"> is</span><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="Float_Measures"></a>The package <a href="#Float_Measures">Float_Measures</a>
is an instance of <a href="#Measures">Measures</a> for the standard Float type:
.
</p><p>
<a name="1.1"></a><a href="#1"><img src="http://www.dmitry-kazakov.de/ada/prev.gif" alt="[Back]" width="29" height="29"></a><a href="#6"><img src="http://www.dmitry-kazakov.de/ada/index.gif" alt="[TOC]" width="29" height="29"></a><a href="#1.2"><img src="http://www.dmitry-kazakov.de/ada/next.gif" alt="[Next]" width="29" height="29"></a></p><h3>1.1. The type Unit</h3>
<p><a name="Unit"></a><a name="Units"></a>The type <a href="#Unit">Unit</a> is defined in the package
<a href="#Units">Units</a>. A value
of the type <a href="#Unit">Unit</a> corresponds to a kind of physical entity,
like energy, charge or velocity. The package itself is rather useless, because
there are few things one can do with units. They are:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    Exponentiation, the power is an integer;
  </li><li>
    Multiplication;
  </li><li>
    Division;
  </li><li>
    Square root;
  </li><li>
    Conversion to String.
</li></ul>
<p>
Or in Ada terms the following functions are defined:<br>
</p><blockquote>
  <tt><span color="#0000FF">function</span>
  "<span color="#FF0000">**</span>" (<b>Left</b> : Unit; <b>Right</b> : Integer)
  <span color="#0000FF">return</span> Unit; <br>
  <span color="#0000FF">function</span> "<span color="#FF0000">*</span>"&nbsp;
  (<b>Left</b>, <b>Right</b> : Unit) <span color="#0000FF">return</span> Unit;<br>
  <span color="#0000FF">function</span> "<span color="#FF0000">/</span>"&nbsp;
  (<b>Left</b>, <b>Right</b> : Unit) <span color="#0000FF">return</span> Unit;<br>
  <span color="#0000FF">function</span> Sqrt (<b>X</b> : Unit)
  <span color="#0000FF">return</span> Unit;</tt></blockquote>
<p>
Values of the type <a href="#Unit">Unit</a> build a group. A value of
<a href="#Unit">Unit</a> type can be viewed as an unordered set of seven
base components (mass, length, time, current etc.). Each component has
integer exponent part. The function Sqrt is defined for only units which
components have even exponent parts. The exception Constraint_Error is propagated
when the result of an operation is illegal.
</p><p>
The package also declares the exception Unit_Error and the type:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
  <tt>
  <span color="#0000FF"><a name="Units.Code_Set"></a>type</span> Code_Set <span color="#0000FF"> is</span>
  (ASCII_Set, Latin1_Set, UTF8_Set);</tt></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>TL;DR: I have made my own WebGL framework, and it’s called Glii.</p>

<hr>

<p>It should be no secret that I have <a href="https://ivan.sanchezortega.es/devel/2019/02/14/a-rant-about-webgl-frameworks.html">strong opinions about WebGL frameworks</a>. So in true <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-going-to-build-my-own-theme-park-with-blackjack-and-hookers">Bender «I’ll make my own, with blackjack and hookers» spirit</a>, I’ve made my own. Save the blackjack and hookers, mind you.</p>

<p>It’s safe to say this is the culmination of five years worth of thoughts. My debut into WebGL was in <a href="https://www.mazemap.com/">MazeMap</a> (late 2015, I think), when I was in charge of speeding up the map rendering, after kinda giving up and submitting to <code>mapboxl-gl-js</code>. I tried to learn all I could, and I even created something dubbed <code>Leaflet.GL</code> that, sadly, after 3 or 4 full refacors, never saw the light.</p>

<p>Those refactors were whole mistakes. Luckily, I learned quite a lot from those mistakes.</p>

<p>The most important thing I learned is that WebGL was designed for C people and made by C people for C people. That means it was <strong>not</strong> designed, nor made by, nor made for, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> people, nor <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> people.</p>

<p>One big obvious thing to notice is that the WebGL API mimicks to perfection the OpenGL API (OpenGL ES 2.0 API, to be exact).</p>

<p>Another big couple things to notice (but only noticeable becuase I did some C back in my university freshman days) are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> lacks a counterpart to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">C’s <code>struct</code></a></li>
  <li>Therefore, <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> lacks a counterpart to C’s <code>struct[]</code> (an array of <code>struct</code>s)</li>
  <li>The memory layout of vertex attributes (as forced by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/vertexAttribPointer"><code>vertexAttribPointer()</code></a>) fits a <code>struct[]</code> <strong>perfectly</strong></li>
  <li>Therefore, <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> doesn’t have a straightforward way to deal with vertex attributes</li>
</ul>

<p>So WebGL is a <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> API port of a C API… that works with C data types/structures that are not available in <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>.</p>

<p>In hindsight, and <em>from the point of view of a web developer</em>, this seems like a huge architectural oversight.</p>

<p>Let me remark the «<em>from the point of view of a web developer</em>» bit. I’m sure the folks that designed WebGL had good reasons for the design, and had time constraints, and had compatibility constraints, and a hundred other things that made the API take its form. But at this point, I bet that ease of use by <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>/<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> people was not a (significant) factor.</p>

<p>I like to sum up that in one phrase:</p>

<p><strong>WebGL was never about bringing OpenGL to web developers; it was about bringing OpenGL developers to the web.</strong></p>

<p>As a <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>+<abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> person, it’s mind-bogglinly complex to get into WebGL. <em>However</em>, since the APIs are practically carbon copies, an OpenGL person could get into WebGL straight away - reusing formatted data (models, meshes) that can be fetched over the network and copy-pasting away chunks of C code.</p>

<p>Fast-forward my thoughts, and you’ll reach the conspiracy theorist part of my brain that thinks WebGL was a ploy by Google to bring 3D-ish Google Maps to Chrome <em>and nothing else</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, another thing that makes me mad is the way WebGL tries to be object-oriented (since everything in <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> is an <code>Object</code> that has a <code>prototype</code>), but fails miserably to provide any kind of object-orientation-derived convenience. Instead, we’ve got freaking pointer logic in <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate. Let’s assume we have our GL stuff initialized, get a texture, change some properties of that texture, and dump an image into it.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>+<abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> developer would dream of a <em>sane</em> way to do this, which would look like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>myTexture</span> <span>=</span> <span>glContext</span><span>.</span><span>createTexture</span><span>();</span>
<span>myTexture</span><span>.</span><span>setParameter</span><span>(</span><span>'wrapS'</span><span>,</span> <span>'repeat'</span><span>)</span>
<span>myTexture</span><span>.</span><span>fromImage</span><span>(</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my-img'</span><span>)</span> <span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instead, we got this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>myTexture</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createTexture</span><span>();</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bindTexture</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_2D</span><span>,</span> <span>myTexture</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>texParameteri</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_2D</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_WRAP_S</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>texImage2D</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_2D</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>RGBA</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>RGBA</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>BYTE</span><span>,</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my-img'</span><span>)</span> <span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let me comment on the <em>seemingly</em> idiotic code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// So far, so good</span>
<span>let</span> <span>myTexture</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createTexture</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Set the value of the "currently bound 2D texture" pointer to the texture</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bindTexture</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_2D</span><span>,</span> <span>myTexture</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Set a texture parameter (given some integer constants), not of to the (un)given texture,</span>
<span>// but of the texture pointed by the "bound 2D texture" pointer</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>texParameteri</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_2D</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_WRAP_S</span><span>);</span>

<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>texImage2D</span><span>(</span>
	<span>// Dump the `ImageData` of a `HTMLImageElement` into the texture currently pointed by</span>
	<span>// the "bound 2D texture" pointer.</span>
	<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_2D</span><span>,</span>

	<span>// Affect only the mipmap level 0. This would be a sane thing to specify, if</span>
	<span>// the MIN_FILTER parameter of the texture were using mipmaps.</span>
	<span>0</span><span>,</span>

	<span>// Set the format of the texture to RGBA. This is kinda sane, since dumping data</span>
	<span>// into a texture might drop some of the data to make the texture size smaller in memory</span>
	<span>// e.g. ignoring the alpha channel of fully-opaque images</span>
	<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>RGBA</span><span>,</span>

	<span>// Repeat the format, since the WebGL API literally forces this parameter to have</span>
	<span>// the same value of the previous parameter instead of providing overloads.</span>
	<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>RGBA</span><span>,</span>

	<span>// Specify the byte length of the image data, compeltely ignoring the fact that the</span>
	<span>// JS `ImageData` interface (and `HTMLImageElement`, and `BitmapImage`) can only be</span>
	<span>// 8-bits (one byte) per channel.</span>
	<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>BYTE</span><span>,</span>

	<span>// And the `HTMLImageElement` reference.</span>
	<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my-img'</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The more time I’ve spent with this, the more idiotic is <em>seems</em>. Again, this is from the point of view of a web developer, with special emphasis on the «<em>from the point of view of a web developer</em>» bit. I do guess that this makes sense to low-level C+OpenGL people somehow.</p>

<p>The prize to the most <em>seemingly</em> idiotic part of the API, however, goes to parameters that must be zero. From the <code>texImage2D</code> documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><code>border</code></strong>
    A <code>GLint</code> specifying the width of the border. Must be 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Listen, I’ve used a fair amount of APIs during my career. I’ve done <abbr title="Unified Modelling Language">UML</abbr>, I’ve read <em>design patterns</em>, I’ve created my fair amount of documented interfaces and APIs. And if I set aside my humility for a second, I can honestly say that <strong>having a public API require a parameter, and then force the users to always, unconditionally set that parameter to zero</strong> (or any other given static value) <strong>without explaining a good reason for that parameter to exist in the first place is utterly stupid</strong>.</p>

<p>Y’a know, at least slap “legacy” or “reserved for future use” in there.</p>

<p>But yeah, the more I’ve been dabbling with WebGL over the years, the more its API has begun <em>reeking</em> of C. I really mean no disrespect to the architects of OpenGL ES 2.0… but at the same time I cannot help but feel the <em>reek</em>.</p>

<p>I’m not even going to comment on the death of Flash and how HTML5+WebGL has failed to appeal to non-technical people, and why all artsy game devs are using Pico8 and Unity.</p>

<p>So, frameworks.</p>

<p>There have been a number of WebGL-based framweorks over the years. The most current list I could find is <a href="https://gist.github.com/dmnsgn/76878ba6903cf15789b712464875cfdc">in this gist</a> by <a href="https://dmnsgn.me/">Damien Seguin</a>, and it lists about 80 frameworks, toolkits, engines and frameworks.</p>

<p>And yet, none of them fulfill my needs.</p>

<p>Yes, it can be said that I have <em>special</em> needs. My WebGL career has been mostly failing to deliver <code>Leaflet.GL</code>, then doing all kinds of experiments on <code>Leaflet.TileLayer.GL</code>, failing to understand the overly complex architecture of <code>mapbox-gl-js</code> (now <code>maplibre-gl-js</code>), wondering about the OpenLayers abstractions for stitching tiles and reprojection, and creating the OpenLayers <code>GlTiles</code> data source (to replicate and expand the functionality of <code>Leaflet.TileLayer.GL</code>). This means I have a very specific set of requirements in a WebGL framework/toolkit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access to all the low-ish level functionality
    <ul>
      <li>Things like <code>Float32</code> textures</li>
      <li>Do not assume 3D, no transformation/projection/scene matrices by default</li>
      <li>No implicit render loop</li>
      <li>This requirement disqualifies all 3D/game engines</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Actual <abbr title="Object-Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> wrappers over GL concepts like textures, programs and framebuffers
    <ul>
      <li>This disqualifies most microframeworks and toolsets.</li>
      <li>At this point, I’m basically left with regl and luma.gl only.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No dragging around the <code>WebGLRenderingContext</code>
    <ul>
      <li>regl fails to deliver this <em>just about</em>.</li>
      <li>luma.gl fail to deliver this in a spectacular way, since it does provide lifetime/renderloop functionality but forces the developer to carry around the raw instance of <code>WebGLRenderingContext</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Semi-sane equivalent of a C <code>struct[]</code>
    <ul>
      <li>This was the reason <code>Leaflet.GL</code> development sucked 3 to 4 days every time I wanted to change <em>one</em> data structure</li>
      <li>No, luma.gl, <a href="https://luma.gl/docs/api-reference/webgl/accessor"><code>Accesor</code></a> misses the point.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tooling for <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> project sucks. I do not want to spend 10 seconds since saving a file to being able to see the results in a web browser. That means no typescript, and no bundling (no rollup, no webpack, no parcel).
    <ul>
      <li>luma.gl particularly sucks at this point, since its “hello world” <em>requires</em> a webpack toolchain.</li>
      <li>The pre-rollup times of Leaflet (the <code>debug/include-browser.js</code> times) were awesome in a way.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>… So. After <em>lots</em> of thinking and <em>lots</em> of learning from failures and a crystal-clear vision of how I wanted a WebGL API to be, and after a good couple of years worth of letting the ideas brew, I’ve done my own WebGL framework.</p>

<p>It’s called <strong>Glii</strong>, and I think it’s awesome. The name is homophonous with <strong>glee</strong>, because I can finally quickly prototype low-ish level GL algorithms and structures and be happy at the same time. I should create a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym">backronym</a> for it, like “GL Ivan’s Interface” or something.</p>

<p>Remember the texture example code from before? This is how it looks in Glii right now:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>GLFactory</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'glii/index.mjs'</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>glii</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GLFactory</span><span>(</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my-canvas'</span><span>));</span>
<span>let</span> <span>myTexture</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>glii</span><span>.</span><span>Texture</span><span>();</span>
<span>myTexture</span><span>.</span><span>wrapS</span> <span>=</span> <span>glii</span><span>.</span><span>REPEAT</span><span>;</span>
<span>myTexture</span><span>.</span><span>texImage2D</span><span>(</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my-img'</span><span>)</span> <span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It just <em>makes sense</em>. It wraps GL concepts in a <abbr title="Object-Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> fashion; I can forget about the <code>WebGLRenderingContext</code> entirely (because of some <em>clever</em> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">closure</a> bits); and since <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_script_type_module">browser support for <code>&lt;script type=module&gt;</code></a> is mature enough, no bundling is needed.</p>

<p>And the preliminary <abbr title="Unified Modelling Language">UML</abbr> class diagrams (generated via <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leafdoc">Leafdoc</a> and <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>) are a thing of beauty IMO:</p>

<p><img src="https://ivan.sanchezortega.es/img/2021-01-glii/class-diagram.dot.png" alt="Class diagram"></p>

<p><strong>Look at it</strong>. There’s no gigantic class, there are subclasses of stuff for convenience, there’s inheritance and composition and abstract classes, and I can finally understand <code>FrameBuffer</code>s from there.</p>

<p>We have a Peloton at home. Originally, I was skeptical, but then I found
trainers I like and it’s fun to ride with friends. And really takes the edge
off all-day Zoom meetings to ride during a meeting with the camera turned&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>But, being the guy that I am, I’ve been curious about how the head unit —
which runs a lightly skinned Android — was collecting stats
from the actual bike. I was also a bit annoyed that though the Peloton software
will happily read data from an <span>HR</span> sensor, and will upload your ride data to
Strava, there was no way for it to <em>broadcast</em> data about a ride to a local
fitness appliance — which meant that although I could track the fact that I
was doing an “indoor bike” ride on my Garmin watch, the watch would see a 0
mile ride because it got no bike&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>Then a couple months ago, I came across
<a href="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/">this blog post</a>
in which someone on the Internet was able to hook up their (bricked) Flywheel
bike to Zwift using a Raspberry Pi to decode the bike sensor data and broadcast
it over Bluetooth — and I was inspired to finally give this project a shot.
What should we call a device broadcasting stats from the Peloton, monitoring it
if you will? How about&nbsp;“PeloMon”?</p>
<p>Let’s get down to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>There are only two cables that plug into the tablet: a barrel jack carrying
<span>DC</span> power @ 12V (coming from the power brick), and a <span>TRRS</span> connector —
think “stereo aux cable”. So the data is clearly coming in on the latter.
Since I only wanted to observe the traffic between the <span>HU</span> and the bike,
not interrupt it, I used a headphone splitter cable to split the cable from the bike with an extra jack, and connected an aux cable from that extra jack
to the breakout. Such a connection might disrupt some high-speed communications
protocols, but my guess was that a) there wasn’t going to be that much traffic
to require anything fancy, b) nothing fast would be running over 3.5mm <span>TRRS</span>, and
c) this interface would be engineered with pretty wide tolerances for stability 
in a home environment. (Spoiler alert: all of these were&nbsp;true.)</p>
<p>The first step was to identify the pinout from the jack as best
as possible. Probing the leads with a <span>DMM</span> with the bike active showed that
Ring2 was at ground (0V with respect to the power supply’s ground)
with -5.5-6V between tip or ring1 and ground. Sleeve also appears to be
at ground, but it and Ring2 may not quite be the same (more on this later).
The negative voltages with respect
to ground are a pretty strong sign that we’re going to see <span>RS</span>-232&nbsp;signaling.</p>
<h2 id="decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer"><a href="#decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer">Decoding the wire protocol with a logic&nbsp;analyzer</a></h2>
<p>(If you’d like to load a PulseView trace to see the data for yourself, one session
file from a test ride is located in <code>peloton_decoding/resistance-stepped-10s.sr</code>
in <a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">the PeloMon GitHub repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Normally I’d wire up the breakout and hack something together on the Arduino
I have sitting around, but it turns out that logic analyzers have gotten
<em>really really cheap</em> so I splurged on a $12.50 one and thought I’d give it
a whirl — turned out to be a great idea that made it <span>WAY</span> easier to decode
the signals. With complete abandon regarding ground isolation and the voltage
tolerances of the <span>LA</span> (is it supposed to be able to handle negative voltage?),
I hooked it up to see what I’d get. These cheapo LAs emulate a Saleae Logic
analyzer and work fine in the open-source <a href="https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView">PulseView</a>&nbsp;software.</p>
<p><img alt="Hooking up the LA with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and GND on ring2" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-4ring1-5sleeve-gndring2.png">
</p><center><strong>Hooking up the <span>LA</span> with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and <span>GND</span> on ring2</strong></center>
<p><img alt="D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and GND on sleeve" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-2ring1-4ring2-gndsleeve.png">
</p><center><strong>D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and <span>GND</span> on sleeve</strong></center>
<p>There’s pretty clearly serial signaling going on over these wires! One
party seems to be sending requests on Tip every 100ms, and the other
party responds about a millisecond later on Ring1. While it wasn’t obvious
from the <span>DMM</span> whether signaling <span>GND</span> should be on Ring2 or Sleeve, from the <span>LA</span>
traces, it looks like there is less glitching on the response line if Ring2 is
used as <span>GND</span> - so we’ll do that. The narrow pulses are probably single bits,
so sampling at a high rate (a few hundred kHz) lets us measure the bit
rate as&nbsp;19200bps:</p>
<p><img alt="Counting samples in the LA shows a 19.2kHz signal" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-19200bps.png">
</p><center><strong>Counting samples in the <span>LA</span> shows a 19.2kHz signal</strong></center>
<p>PulseView also lets you add protocol decoders to particular wires. I put a <span>UART</span>
decoder on with D0 as “<span>RX</span>” and D4 as “<span>TX</span>”, and saw data, but with a ton of
low-level serial protocol errors. UARTs invert the signal going out on the wire
with the expectation that there will be another <span>UART</span> at the other end to
re-invert. Since we don’t have that second <span>UART</span>, we have to turn the “Invert <span>RX</span>”
and “Invert <span>TX</span>” options on in PulseView, and then we see clean data! I also
experimented with other serial options (data, parity, and stop bits), but the
first guess of 8N1 turned out&nbsp;correct.</p>
<p><img alt="Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-missing-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions</strong></center>
<p><img alt="Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-fixed-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!</strong></center>
<p>Following the data streams, we see that the data stream on the
Tip wire during a ride always consists of one of three different four-byte
packets, repeated round-robin every 100ms, with the responses on Ring1 to these
requests being longer, different in length depending on the request type, and
variable in content.
It seems likely then that the Tip shows us signaling from the head unit to the
bike, and Ring1 is the bike responding to the head unit with information
about variables like current speed, resistance, or power&nbsp;output.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, we’ve worked out the physical layer protocol for the Peloton
communications: <span>RS</span>-232 at 5.5V and 19200bps 8N1 encoding, with <span>HU</span>-to-bike
communications on Tip, bike-to-<span>HU</span> on Ring1, <span>GND</span> on Ring2, and something
ground-like on&nbsp;Sleeve.</strong></p>

<p>To investigate the encoding between the head unit and the bike, I used the
logic analyzer to capture a trace of the communications during a ride. (Shoutout
to Ben Alldis and his Ministry of Sound ride series!)
The data dump and scripts are available in the GitHub repository for this project
at https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon/, in the <code>peloton_decoding</code> subdirectory.)</p>
<h2 id="basic-packet-structure"><a href="#basic-packet-structure">Basic packet&nbsp;structure</a></h2>
<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decoder_plots.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>During a ride, about every 100ms (100.66-100.8ms) the <span>HU</span> sends a request
to the bike, and the bike responds about 300us (i.e., 0.3ms) from the end
of the <span>HU</span>’s request. The <span>HU</span> sends three different request packets round robin.
Each request type has a different response length from the&nbsp;bike:</p>
<table> 
<tbody><tr><th><span>HU</span> Request</th><th>Bike Response Length</th><th>Example Bike Response</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 41 36 F6</tt></td><td>8 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 41 03 30 30 30 C5 F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 44 39 F6</tt></td><td>10 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 44 05 30 30 30 30 30 2A F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 4A 3F F6</tt></td><td>9 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 4A 04 38 36 36 30 13 F6</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A few things are evident from simple inspection of the&nbsp;bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first byte is a header - seems to be F5 from the <span>HU</span> and F1 from the&nbsp;bike.</li>
<li>All packets end in&nbsp;F6.</li>
<li>The second byte that the <span>HU</span> sends seems to be a request type, and is mirrored in the second byte in the bike’s&nbsp;response.</li>
<li>The third byte of the bike response is the length of the full packet minus 5 — probably indicates the length of the data payload following&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Serial packets often carry a checksum, and here the second-to-last byte from either the <span>HU</span> or the bike seems to be that: it’s the sum (modulo 256) of all the bytes preceding&nbsp;it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the packet format seems to&nbsp;be:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>HU</span>: <code>F5 [request type] [checksum] F6</code></li>
<li>Bike: <code>F1 [request type] [payload length] [response bytes 1-n] [checksum] F6</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We can now throw together a quick plot of each response byte to look for&nbsp;patterns.</p>
<p><img alt="Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-peloton-bytewise.png">
</p><center><strong>Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride</strong></center>
<p>It appears that every byte ranges from 0x30 to 0x39 — which is exactly the
<span>ASCII</span> range for decimal digits 0 through 9. Furthermore, the earlier bytes in
each packet appear to vary more quickly than the later ones through a ride,
suggesting that the least-significant digit comes first. <strong>The Peloton bike
is encoding its responses as little-endian <span>ASCII</span> digits.</strong> It’s easy enough
to dump a plot of these values per response type now that we know the&nbsp;encoding:</p>
<p><img alt="Decoded values sent by bike to head unit during a ride" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-peloton-ascii.png">

<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decode_resistance.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Glancing at these graphs it’s pretty clear that we have ride data of the Peloton
trifecta — cadence, power, and resistance — with a couple weird things thrown in
for flavor. Comparing to the Peloton ride stats, <strong>request type 0x41 seems to directly
return cadence in rpm and request type 0x44 returns 10 times power in watts (i.e.,
current power output in deciwatts)</strong>. However, while the …</p></div></div>

I started my career with punch cards and I am ending in the era of cloud computing. Despite all this change, many principles that have helped me throughout my career haven’t changed and continue to be relevant. As I step away from the keyboard, I want to share six ideas I’ve learned from my career as a software engineer.</p><h2>1. Beware of the Curse of Knowledge</h2><p>When you know something it is almost impossible to imagine what it is like&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to know that thing. This is the curse of knowledge, and it is the root of countless misunderstandings and inefficiencies. Smart people who are comfortable with complexity can be especially prone to it!</p><p>If you don’t guard against the curse of knowledge it has the potential to obfuscate all forms of communication, including code. The more specialized your work, the greater the risk that you will communicate in ways that are incomprehensible to the uninitiated. Fight the curse of knowledge. Work to understand your audience. Try to imagine what it would be like to learn what you are communicating for the first time.</p><h2>2. Focus on the Fundamentals</h2><p>Technology constantly changes, but some fundamental approaches to software development transcend these trends. Here are six fundamentals that will continue to be relevant for a long time.</p><ul><li><strong>Teamwork</strong>&nbsp;— Great teams build great software. Don’t take teamwork for granted.</li><li><strong>Trust&nbsp;</strong>— Teams move at the speed of trust. Be the kind of dependable person you would want to work with.</li><li><strong>Communication</strong>&nbsp;— Communicate honestly and proactively. Avoid the curse of knowledge.</li><li><strong>Seek Consensus</strong>&nbsp;— Take the time to bring your whole team along. Let discussion and disagreement bring you to the best solution.</li><li><strong>Automated Testing</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp; Well-tested code allows your team to move fast with confidence.</li><li><strong>Clean, understandable, and navigable code and design</strong>&nbsp;— Think of the next engineer that will take over your code as your customer.&nbsp; Build code that your successor won’t have any trouble reading, maintaining, and updating.</li></ul><h2>3. Simplicity</h2><p>Fighting complexity is a never-ending cause. Solutions should be as simple as possible. Assume the next person to maintain your code won’t be as smart as you. When you can use fewer technologies, do so.</p><figure><blockquote><p><em>“A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”</em></p><p><cite><em>Antoine de Saint-Exupery</em></cite></p></blockquote></figure><h2>4. Seek First to Understand</h2><p>One of Stephen Covey’s seven habits is, “Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood.” This maxim has helped me more than any other advice to become a good listener and teammate. If you want to influence and work effectively with others, you first need to understand them. Actively listen to understand their feelings, ideas, and point of view before you begin trying to make your own thoughts known.</p><p><a href="http://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4305" data-permalink="https://www.bti360.com/what-ive-learned-in-45-years-in-the-software-industry/bti360-2019-237-2/" data-orig-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237.jpg" data-orig-size="600,388" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="bti360-2019-237" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237-400x259.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="388" srcset="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237.jpg 600w, https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237-400x259.jpg 400w, https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237-564x365.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><h2>5. Beware of Lock-In</h2><p>There will always be the next hot productivity product that will promise to revolutionize how software is built. Computer Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) tools, COTS, Enterprise Resource Planning products like Peoplesoft and SAP and, yes, even Ruby. They claim amazing reductions in cost and time if you buy into their holistic development philosophy. What is not always as obvious is the significant up-front costs or the constraints you may be committing yourself to. Lock-in used to primarily happen with vendors, but now it can happen with frameworks too. Either way, lock-in means significant cost to change. Choose wisely. New is not always better!</p><h2>6. Be Honest and Acknowledge When You Don’t Fit the Role</h2><p>At some point in your career you may find yourself in a role that isn’t a good fit. A bad fit isn’t a character flaw, but it’s a problem you shouldn’t ignore. There may be more than one solution to such a dilemma: you can evolve or the role can evolve. The key is to have the self-knowledge to recognize what is happening and get yourself out of an unhealthy spot. Being unhappy is in no-one’s best interests, and BTI360 recognizes this.</p><p>When I was at GM, you were a failure if your next move was not&nbsp;<em>up</em>—managing more people or taking on bigger, more complex projects. For many, this made for a miserable career path (see the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle">Peter Principle</a>). At EDS, the culture wasn’t like this. People moved in and out of management roles. There was no stigma associated with moving from roles with greater scope, like strategic planner, to roles with more narrow scope, like PM or project-level developer. I was one of the people who took advantage of this flexibility, moving from a role at the top of the technical pyramid back to being a project-level developer. I never looked back.</p><h2>Final Thoughts<img data-attachment-id="4294" data-permalink="https://www.bti360.com/?attachment_id=4294" data-orig-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldberg_Joel_2_circ-230.png" data-orig-size="230,230" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Goldberg_Joel_2_circ-230" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldberg_Joel_2_circ-230.png" data-large-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldberg_Joel_2_circ-230.png" loading="lazy" src="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldberg_Joel_2_circ-230.png" alt="" width="230" height="230"></h2><p>Even before I joined BTI360 I knew enough about the culture to know that it was a place that valued the kinds of principles I’ve described above. I hope each of you will take ownership of maintaining a strong engineering culture that will continue to make BTI360 a great place to build software.</p><hr><h2><em>In addition to his varied technical experience, Joel worked with a lot of interesting characters over his career, including W.

<p><span>W</span>hen Zeeshan and Imran Ali Khan moved to Pakistan in 2006 to set up an online real estate company, they didn’t really know what they were getting themselves into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back then, buying or selling a house in Pakistan was a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1322817">cash-heavy</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1570992">offline experience</a>. Internet penetration was about 6.5%, and there was little market transparency — people lived in fear of unwittingly purchasing or renting houses on illegally occupied land. There were no trustworthy digital real estate portals. But the brothers saw an opening. They were ambitious first-generation immigrants to the U.K. who had graduated with engineering degrees from Imperial College and Oxford and spent years launching online businesses from their London apartment.</p>



<p>By the time the brothers arrived in Lahore, they were seasoned entrepreneurs, having started a range of businesses in the early and late aughts, including an Alibaba-like e-commerce website, an air filter distribution company, and even a small gym. In 2006, along with their third brother, Haider, they set up Zameen, an online real estate service. This was the mid-2000s, and much of the property in Pakistan’s biggest cities was cartelized or controlled by the military. In parts of the country, the informal nature of ownership enabled the practice of <em>kabza, </em>the illegal occupation of land or housing by powerful locals. Low digital literacy rates made it difficult to reach potential buyers and sellers, and an underdeveloped payment infrastructure made things even more complicated. The simple idea of Craigslisting real estate meant overcoming a barrage of obstacles.</p>



<p>Now, 15 years later, the company claims to have 5.5 million monthly <a href="https://www.zameen.com/advertise/index.html">users</a> and has digitized more than a million land plots and housing units. Every month, it registers roughly 500,000 new listings, and local real estate agents estimate that 70% of all sale and rental transactions in Pakistan are initiated through<strong> </strong>Zameen, which means “land” in Urdu. More than that, however, the company transformed the way property sales work in Pakistan, the most urbanized country in South Asia. While the market used to be dominated by brokers who kept a tight grip on housing costs and availability, formerly private information is now available to everyone.</p>

<p>For the first six years of Zameen’s operation, the brothers were preoccupied with other businesses, and the country was dealing with its own problem: 2009<strong> </strong>was one of the bloodiest years on record for Pakistan. Terrorist attacks targeting civilians and security forces killed <a href="http://pakpips.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sr2008.pdf">3,021</a> people, according to the Pak Institute of Peace Studies (PIPS), and extremists controlled tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. At that point, Pakistan was among the <a href="https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=35383">most dangerous countries</a> in the world, with thousands emigrating to the U.S., U.K., and Canada. To international investors, the founders struggled to dispel “this errant notion of [Pakistan] being a troubled place where nothing is flourishing,” as Zeeshan later explained. But the brothers continued to believe that the company could work.</p>



<p>Prior to Zameen, newspapers were the dominant medium for advertising real estate in Pakistan. Agents preferred an offline, person-to-person approach, as many had trouble using technology. “Zameen used to send SMS leads to agents,” said Zeeshan. “They would even struggle with using SMS properly.”</p>



<p>Quality control was another problem. Listings had to be manually checked for fakes and price gouging. Unlike in developed markets, in Pakistan “there are no safeguards like escrow account services and mandatory regulation to protect both consumers and developers,” says Umar Nadeem, a housing market expert at Islamabad-based think tank Tabadlab. As of December 2019, there were more than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1384319">1.8 million pending</a> court cases, many related to property disputes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, since 1990, Pakistan has been in the midst of a massive urban migration. A recent <a href="https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/documents/2019-05/state_of_pakistani_cities_0.pdf">study</a> revealed that 10 cities account for 54% of the total urban population of 75 million. Around 2012, in the midst of this transition, owning property in urban areas became desirable. Interest was driven by wealthy expats buying properties back home, and sales were fueled by military-led housing projects and $70 billion in Chinese infrastructure investment. Nadeem estimates that parts of Karachi and Lahore saw <a href="https://www.tabadlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Designing-Affordable-Housing-Policy.pdf">the value of a plot of land rise by 400%</a> between 2008 and 2013. Hungry for quick returns, Pakistani buyers began aggressively flipping real estate, as an initial investment could be doubled within a few years. “Real estate, I don’t think it has had a bust cycle. It’s generally boomed over the years,” says Nadeem.</p>



<p>Zameen caught this wave. They ran local <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnR4V6sz8N0">television ads</a> targeting expats and diaspora Pakistanis. Noting an opportunity, the brothers closed most of their other businesses to focus on the site. “That was a great decision,” says Imran. By 2013, they’d signed up more than 3,000 real estate agencies across different states in Pakistan to provide them with listings. In out-of-the-way areas where brokers didn’t know how to use computers, they offered training and hired tech-savvy teenagers as “computer operators” to upload photos of properties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To convince reluctant real estate agents to list properties on Zameen, the founders built a large, dispersed sales team across Pakistan. This had the effect of making Pakistan’s real estate market more open. People suddenly had access to available property listings, price estimates, and contacts for sellers —&nbsp;information that had previously been impossible to get without hiring brokers in local communities. By the end of 2012, Zameen had registered 65,000 listings; by 2016, they notched 20 million page views — even without the support of a robust technological infrastructure. “For payment collection, we would have to send someone to pick up the money,” Imran says. “There was no [online payment] service back in those days.” The benefits were immediate —&nbsp;Zameen became the only online source of information about Pakistani real estate anywhere in the world. In the early days, “if you wanted to look up anything about real estate in Pakistan, you really couldn’t look anywhere else,” says Farooq Tirmizi, a Pakistani entrepreneur based in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>But even though the company charged fees to sellers, this alone wasn’t lucrative enough. Nor was it standard in Pakistan to charge property management companies to advertise listings online. According to Zeeshan, while a real estate agency in Europe or the U.S. might spend up to 25% of its budget on marketing, in Pakistan, that figure is closer to 0.5%. And because Pakistanis typically pay for properties in cash, there were rarely any sales commissions. As a result of all this, Zameen struggled financially, even as its user base grew. In 2015, reports surfaced stating that the company only reached $1 million in revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the brothers pivoted. First, they began offering exclusive marketing deals to real estate developers, claiming that Zameen would “sell the property for you.” When a property did sell, the company often charged a sizable commission. Then, in 2018, the Khan brothers decided to become real estate developers themselves. They began co-developing properties with builders and hired a land-acquisition team to source plots, learn local bylaws, and work with architects. “That kind of control is key to operating in emerging markets that are informal and unregulated,” says Zeeshan. By 2019,&nbsp;revenue soared to more than <a href="https://aimgroup.com/2020/02/03/zameen-com-posts-8-5m-in-revenue-leads-fdvs-portfolio/">$30 million</a>. Today, in addition to initiating the majority of real estate transactions in Pakistan, Zameen sells its own buildings — as of June 2020, they had eight ongoing development projects.</p>

<p>Not everyone is pleased with the brothers’ new strategy. Brokers who shared details of their arrangements with Zameen allege that they were taken advantage of. For the brothers, entering the marketing and real estate development businesses was about taking greater “control” of its supply side. “Typically, if you are a global classified portal, by virtue of strong laws, you can operate smoothly as a middleman and get value for your services. [In Pakistan] the farther away you are from being in control, the more difficult it gets to manage your business,” Zeeshan says. No formal complaints have been filed against Zameen, but there is growing discontent among agents.</p>



<p>“It was good as long as they were a marketing [classified] platform, but now they have become real estate agents themselves, and that puts us at a serious disadvantage,” a Karachi-based agent who has been on Zameen for five years and did not want to be identified for fear of retribution told <em>Rest of World</em>. (There is no evidence of Zameen giving precedence to its own listings.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The allegations Zameen faces are similar to those battering many big Silicon Valley companies —&nbsp;Amazon <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015?mod=hp_lead_pos2">selling its own goods</a> after gathering data about other products sold within its marketplace, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dominates-app-store-search-results-thwarting-competitors-11563897221?shareToken=st44e68b42ce5f45f5bd573dae5f8f0f5c">Apple favoring its own apps</a> in App Store search results. But Haider, the eldest brother, is quick to dismiss these comparisons. “Solutions are supposed to strengthen the local economy,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. “These brokers also make money.” Moreover, Haider says, given that Pakistan has a shortage of 10 million houses, more development is good for the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past year, local agents from Islamabad and Karachi have expressed concern that Zameen is abusing its position and called for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXcmwEn1uTE">boycott</a>. “They [Zameen] are using our data and now are doing their own marketing and sales,” a property dealer says in a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVGTH-ugZxw">video</a>. “We are handing our business to them,” he warns. Others have accused them of becoming an “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnxA6BHZnFk">online real estate mafia</a>.” When …</p></div></div>

January 6, 2021 | https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/ShellPipesTwoUsages | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/ShellPipesTwoUsages">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Unix shell pipelines have two usage patterns</h2>

	<p><small>January  6, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>I've seen a variety of recommendations for safer shell scripting
that use Bash and set its 'pipefail' option (for example, <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">this
one from 2015</a>).
This is a good recommendation in one sense, but it exposes a conflict;
this option works great for one usage pattern for pipes, and
potentially terribly for another one.</p>

<p>To understand the problem, let's start with what Bash's pipefail does.
To quote the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html">Bash manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command
in the pipeline, unless the <code>pipefail</code> option is enabled.  If
<code>pipefail</code> is enabled, the pipelineâ€™s return status is the value of
the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero
if all commands exit successfully. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason to use <code>pipefail</code> is that if you don't, a command failing
unexpectedly in the middle of a pipeline won't normally be detected
by you, and won't abort your script if you used '<code>set -e</code>'. You can
go out of your way to carefully check everything with <code>$PIPESTATUS</code>,
but that's a lot of extra work.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is where <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/BashPipes">our old friend <code>SIGPIPE</code></a> comes into the picture. What <code>SIGPIPE</code> does
in pipelines is force processes to exit if they write to a closed
pipe. This happens if a later process in a pipeline doesn't consume
all of its input, for example if you only want to process the first
thousand lines of output of something:</p>


<blockquote><pre>generate --thing | sed 1000q | gronkulate
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>sed</code> exits after a thousand lines and closes the pipe that
<code>generate</code> is writing to, <code>generate</code> gets <code>SIGPIPE</code> and by default
dies, and suddenly its exit status is non-zero, which means that
with <code>pipefail</code> the entire pipeline 'fails' (and with '<code>set -e</code>',
your script will normally exit).</p>

<p>(Under some circumstances, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/ShellPipelineIndeterminate">what happens can vary from run to run due
to process scheduling</a>. It can also depend
on how much output early processes are producing compared to what later
processes are filtering; if <code>generate</code> produces 1000 lines or less,
<code>sed</code> will consume all of them.)</p>

<p>This leads to two shell pipeline usage patterns. In one usage pattern,
all processes in the pipeline consume their entire input unless
something goes wrong. Since all processes do this, no process should
ever be writing to a closed pipe and <code>SIGPIPE</code> will never happen. In
another usage pattern, at least one process will stop processing its
input early; often such processes are in the pipeline specifically to
stop at some point (as <code>sed</code> is in my example above). These pipelines
will sometimes or always generate <code>SIGPIPE</code>s and have some processes
exiting with non-zero statuses.</p>

<p>Of course, you can deal with this in an environment where you're using
<code>pipefail</code>, even with '<code>set -e</code>'. For instance, you can force one
pipeline step to always exit successfully:</p>

<blockquote><pre>(generate --thing || true) | sed 1000q | gronkulate
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>However, you have to remember this issue and keep track of what commands
can exit early, without reading all of their input. If you miss some,
your reward is probably errors from your script. If you're lucky,
they'll be regular errors; if you're unlucky, they'll be sporadic errors
that happen when one command produces an unusually large amount of
output or another command does its work unusually soon or fast.</p>

<p>(Also, it would be nice to only ignore <code>SIGPIPE</code> based failures, not
other failures. If <code>generate</code> fails for other reasons, we'd like the
whole pipeline to be seen as having failed.)</p>

<p>My informal sense is that the 'consume everything' pipeline pattern
is far more common than the 'early exit' pipeline pattern, although
I haven't attempted to inventory my scripts. It's certainly the
natural pattern when you're filtering, transforming, and examining
all of something (for example, to count or summarize it).</p>

<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post, which I'll update periodically, explains the project's motivation
from several perspectives.  Because Unix shell is an old and successful
technology, there are many ways of looking at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<a name="toc_0"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Before explaining <strong>why</strong> I created Oil, let's review <strong>what</strong> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/02/24/bash.html">ships on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">now runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a new shell implementation that's part of the Oil
project.  It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run
<strong>existing shell scripts</strong>.  As of January 2018, I've made <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">major
progress</a> toward this goal.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've designed it, but not yet implemented it.  However, the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil">OSH-to-Oil
translator</a> works.</li>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, it should be <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It has more consistent syntax and semantics.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
better structured data types.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get <a href="#oil-glimpse">a glimpse of Oil</a> at the end of this document.  I
link to several blog posts; the ones that describe the Oil language most
clearly are the two on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil">Translating Shell to Oil</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, as I wrote in <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/10/06.html">Roadmap #5</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is your upgrade path from <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>. It's the only language that shell /
bash can be automatically translated to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Update 10/2019: Oil is no longer focused on auto-translation, but it's still
your upgrade path from bash.  See <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2019/10/04.html">You Can Now Try the Oil
Language</a> for up-to-date information.</em></p>

post with this answer.</p>

<h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<a name="toc_2"></a>
<h4>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h4>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

</ul>
<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<a name="toc_3"></a>
<h4>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h4>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small
amount of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a brand new cluster manager from Google (released around
2014), has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<a name="toc_4"></a>
<h4>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h4>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<a name="toc_5"></a>
<h4>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h4>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<a name="toc_6"></a>
<h4>Are you reinventing Perl?</h4>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>

<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<a name="toc_7"></a>
<h4>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h4>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="limit-to-posix"></a>
<a name="toc_8"></a>
<h4 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h4>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is <strong>incomplete</strong> and <strong>out of date</strong>.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2018, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
<strong>same philosophy</strong> as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>

<p>(a massive, 100-part essay)</p>

<p>I recently finished this excellent short book titled <em>What Has Government Done To Our Money</em>. <a href="https://mises.org/library/what-has-government-done-our-money">It’s available on the Internet for free</a> and I highly recommend reading it. But in case you want the key insights, here are my notes.</p>

<h3>Money as a medium of exchange</h3>

<p>1/ In an economy, there’s a variety of people. Different folks specialize in producing different things and each one of them desires different things.</p>

<p>2/ If there are only two people, they can barter (i.e. <em>directly exchange</em>) what each one of them has with what the other one needs. Even with two people, an exchange rate emerges (e.g. how many loaves of bread you both agree on for a pair of shoes?)</p>

<p>3/ But with more people involved, barter collapses because of two reasons: indivisibility and lack of coincidence of <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/jobs-to-be-done/">wants</a>.</p>

<p>4/ Indivisibility means that if you’re a shoe-maker, you can’t barter half a shoe for a loaf of bread (if that’s all that you need and you don’t want to overpay).</p>

<p>5/ Lack of coincidence of wants means that you may want a loaf of bread but the other person doesn’t need shoes, he needs a shirt and you don’t know how to make one. </p>

<p>6/ Of course, this can be solved via an indirect exchange. You can find a shirtmaker who wants shoes and use your newly acquired shirt for a loaf of bread. Problem solved?</p>

<p>7/ Yes, for now. But as you can imagine, this doesn’t scale well. As the number of people who want to trade expands, the lack of coincidence of wants becomes a bottleneck for general prosperity. Transaction costs of finding someone who wants what you have becomes too high.</p>

<p>8/ To solve this problem, people gradually start accepting a commodity that is divisible into smaller units and which they believe are widely demanded. Take butter for example. You accept it in exchange for the shoes you’ve made because you know you can find someone who wants butter easily and can pay him with a fraction of the butter weight you think is worth what that person is selling.</p>

<p>9/ Butter gradually becomes a widely used medium of exchange. But butter is not the only possible medium of exchange. Salt, tobacco, wheat and many other commodities <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_money">have been used as mediums of exchange.</a></p>

<p>10/ When multiple possible commodities are being used as a medium of exchange, only a few emerge as winners. Which one wins depends on two factors: a) marketability of the currency; b) <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/network-effects-economic-moats/">network effects</a>.</p>

<p>11/ Marketability is simply how good a commodity is in functioning as money. You need money to be easy to store, transportable, divisible, and durable. Some commodities fare better on these criteria than others.</p>

<p>12/ Network effects mean that the more widely a currency is accepted by others, the more likely is it to get accepted by others. (<a href="https://invertedpassion.com/bitcoin-is-mother-of-all-network-effects/">This is also why bitcoin is the mother of all network effects</a>).</p>

<p>13/ Gradually, because of better marketability and network effects, during the course of history, metals like gold and silver emerged as preferred mediums of exchange. </p>

<p>14/ A commodity like gold gets established as money when all other commodities have a relatively stable exchange rate with it. </p>

<p>15/ Nobody decides how many grams of gold is a cow worth. The market gradually determines this exchange rate by accounting for supply and demand for both commodities: gold and cows.</p>

<p>16/ The key to understanding money is to remember that it is a commodity whose utility is in facilitating exchanges, just like leather is a commodity whose utility is in making shoe soles.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You will get a lot of clarity once you STOP thinking about money in units of rupees or dollars, and START measuring it in units of “purchasing power”.</p>

<p>17/ To drive home this point, consider money as a commodity (like milk) that you can buy. What do you pay to “buy” money? Your goods and services. What do you get in return when you “sell” money? Other people’s goods and services.</p>

<h2>Benefits of money</h2>

<p>18/ The biggest benefit of money is in expanding the trade between people, and hence rewarding specialization. Increasing specialization creates prosperity as now you don’t just have shoes, you have sports shoes, party shoes, formal shoes, and so on. So, multiple types of shoes can exist because consumer <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/why-do-businesses-exist/">desire</a> for everything can now be measured in money.</p>

<p>19/ This money-driven price discovery helps foster innovation because entrepreneurs can race to produce goods and services that fetch more money, thereby creating things that wouldn’t exist otherwise.</p>

<p>20/ A stable price of goods also helps businessmen plan ahead in the future. They can allocate their resources effectively because they know a profit will emerge from the investment.</p>

<h2>Money as purchasing power</h2>

<p>21/ Just like goods and services can be measured in money (how many ounces of gold is this house), money can be measured in terms of what kinds of and how many goods and services can money get you (what can I afford if I have an ounce of gold?).</p>

<p>22/ It’s useful to imagine money as a commodity just like any other commodity (glass, TVs, English language classes, Facebook stock and so on). In an ideal world where price discovery is perfect, all commodities have an exchange rate with each other (how many hours of English language classes for a TV). </p>

<p>23/ Money is simply a commodity with the widest price discovery against all other commodities and <em>because</em> of that everyone accepts it. That is what gives money its purchasing power.</p>

<h2>The business of making money</h2>

<p>24/ What if a fairy comes and doubles the money that everyone has? Does everyone suddenly become twice as rich?</p>

<p>25/ No. Because money is a medium of exchange, it doesn’t get consumed in the process. If at all, money has very limited consumption uses (gold used in industrial uses or in dentistry). Except for those limited cases, double the amount of gold currency would simply double the prices of everything else.</p>

<p>26/ To understand this, imagine another commodity like milk. If via any method, we have twice the amount of milk in the world, its price will drop in half. </p>

<p>27/ Similar dynamics happen with money. Only by increasing the amount of money, no prosperity happens. Prosperity happens via innovation – when there are more (in number and type) goods and services available for people to enjoy.</p>

<p>28/ What about gold miners? Are they richer than others? Not really. Like any other business, mining of gold involves a cost. There’s a cost of discovery and acquisition of land rights for gold, people cost, machinery cost, and so on. </p>

<p>29/ Markets drive returns for any type of business to average returns (returns enjoyed by any other business). So, in the long run, gold mining doesn’t make the owners richer than say making butter. (Don’t believe me? Bitcoin mining offers real-world proof. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/asic-financing-driving-hashrate-bitcoin-mining-profitability">It’s no longer profitable to mine bitcoins</a>). </p>

<h2>The takeover of money</h2>

<p>30/ Kings and rulers of the past depended on <em>direct confiscation</em> of commodities as a way to sustain their armies and lifestyle. This is how taxation came along.</p>

<p>31/ Citizens have an incentive to evade taxation, and it’s also an operational nightmare. An easy and convenient alternative to taxation is controlling the money supply in the state. You can call it <em>indirect confiscation</em>.</p>

<p>32/ It starts by labeling a certain weight or volume of currency with a specific name. So, instead of saying something is worth an ounce of silver, you say something is worth a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_dollar">dollar</a>. Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling">a pound sterling is a name for a specific weight of silver</a>.</p>

<p>33/ Under the hood, a dollar was (supposed to be) nothing but a silver coin that weighs an ounce. But labeling it with a dollar abstracts that reality a little bit and sets the stage for people in power (the government or the king) to steal money from the general populace via coin debasement.</p>

<p>34/ Here’s how the coin debasement works: you stamp coins with your brand, you outlaw all other coins, you require taxes to be paid in stamped coins and when you get coins, you literally melt them and make more coins, each with less weight than before. You keep some of the newly invented coins for yourself and release the remaining.</p>

<p>35/ Such coin debasement is a subtle way of stealing (or redistribution, depending on how you look at things). In other words, debasement leads to inflation. You have more coins in circulation for a similar amount of “stuff” in the world so the prices of “stuff” rise.</p>

<p>36/ With debasement, over time, people notice that coins are getting lighter, but this is where naming a coin helps. Through the legal tender, you declare all coins to be at par with each other. So by force of law, you require people to treat a dollar that’s an ounce of silver similarly to a dollar that’s worth less than that.</p>

<p>37/ The result of this is what’s known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham’s law</a>: bad money drives good money out of circulation. As debasing of coins starts, people hoard coins that are debased and pretty soon only debased coins remain in circulation (which get debased even more by the kings). Over a period of time, this leads to coins being so light that they’re unusable.</p>

<p>38/ What also happens is that the non-debased, good quality coins get exported out of the state to other regions because they’re worth a lot more somewhere else. This leads to a flight of silver and gold out of the state, something that kings don’t desire.</p>

<p>39/ So the physics-based limits on how light coins can get keeps infinite debasement in check. And because debasement is in check, new money can’t be created indefinitely, so inflation is in check. But that game is about to get changed when governments and kings discover paper money.</p>

<h2>Banks as money warehouses</h2>

<p>40/ When you have a lot of coins, you’d want to store them at someplace that can protect them. That place can be called a warehouse for money, which is what a bank really is.</p>

<p>41/ Just like any other business, a bank …</p></div></article></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the beginning of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/">Terminator 2: Judgement Day</a>, John Connor uses a laptop to crack the PIN of a stolen debit card.</p>



<p>I don’t think I saw Terminator 2 in the theater. I probably watched it years later on LaserDisc but the scene left quite an impression on me. I had a similar reaction to the war dialer in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/">WarGames</a> and the black box in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/">Sneakers</a>.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was thinking about that scene from Terminator 2 recently which led me to googling, “What’s that laptop in Terminator 2?”</p>

<p>It’s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Portfolio">Atari Portfolio</a>, the world’s first palmtop computer. It was released in June 1989.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/portfolio.png" alt="Atari Portfolio"></p>

<p>It had a monochrome LCD with 240x64 pixels or 40 characters x 8 lines and ran off 3 AA batteries.</p>

<p>The next thing I wondered was, “How difficult would it be to write that program?” Not a program that actually cracks PIN numbers from debit cards, I don’t think you can actually do that with a serial cable and some aluminum foil wrapped around a debit card, but a program that can simulate the output of the palmtop in that scene.</p>

<p>Let’s gather some product requirements!</p>

<p>If we watch the video again, the first thing that happens is that it displays a banner for the program.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/pinip.jpg" alt="banner"></p>

<p>The image is clear enough that you can copy the banner easily.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PPPPP   IIIIIII   N    N
P   PP     I      NN   N IDENTIFICATION
P   PP     I      N N  N
PPPPP      I      N  N N   PROGRAM
P          I      N   NN
P       IIIIIII   N    N

Strike a key when ready ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, John hits Enter and the numbers start scrolling. If we look a few frames in:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/firstline.jpg" alt="first line"></p>

<p>We can see that the first line of numbers is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>12345678901234567890123457890123456780
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One might assume that this is just the digits 1 through 0 repeated four times, but upon closer look, it’s only 38 digits long. In the third set, the number 6 is omitted, and the last set, the number 9 is omitted.</p>

<p>The way the numbers decrease isn’t obvious either, but it seems like it prints about 5 lines at a certain length before decreasing the length by 1, but after the next set it decreases the length by 2 and then alternates back and forth until it identifies the 4-digit PIN code and dumps him back to a prompt.</p>

<p>Well, that seems pretty straightforward. I’ve been trying to get better at Python so here’s a script I wrote in Python 3:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env python3

<p>The script runs really quickly so I added a delay between lines so that you can see the same progression as in the clip. I’m sure there are other optimizations that can be made, but if I were administering this as a bad coding challenge for a tech interview, I’d pass myself.</p>

<p>Using Google Image Search, I found a site selling OEM plastic bezels for the Atari Portfolio which had this nice graphic of the front of the screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/bezel.jpg" alt="screen bezel"></p>

<p>After playing around with <a href="https://github.com/nbedos/termtosvg">termtosvg</a> a bit, in particular the <a href="https://github.com/nbedos/termtosvg/blob/develop/man/termtosvg-templates.md">SVG templates</a> feature, I managed to produce this crazy SVG:</p>

<p>Despite running <a href="https://html5zombo.com/">html5zombo.com</a> for over 10 years now, I’m not sure I really appreciated what SVGs were capable of until I built this one. They can embed images? CSS? Javascript? Any site that allows users to upload arbitrary SVGs and <a href="https://github.com/bertrandom/pinid">renders them</a> now has my utmost respect.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed making my little self-contained SVG, it bugged me that my Python code could never actually run on an Atari Portfolio. The Atari Portfolio runs “DIP Operating System 2.11” (DIP DOS) which is “mostly compatible” with MS-DOS.</p>

<p>In junior high, before anybody paid me to write software professionally, I used to write BBS software, mods, and door games in my spare time in a mix of Turbo Pascal and a scripting language called PCBoard Programming Language which was similar to BASIC. Based on my minimal research, if I could write this in Turbo Pascal and compile it, it’d probably run on an Atari Portfolio.</p>

<p>I haven’t written Turbo Pascal in about 25 years, but do you ever really forget?</p>

<p>I like a fork of DOSBox called <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/">DOSBox-X</a>, so I downloaded and installed the most recent SDL2 variant for OS X. Then I found a copy of Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0, which I’ll put <a href="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/tp7.zip">here</a> because it was kind of a pain to find.</p>

<p>You’ll find 4 files in that ZIP which are images of floppy disks. If you put them in a directory like <code>~/tp</code>, after you start DOSBox-X and mount a C Drive, you can mount them to the A Drive like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>imgmount a ~/tp/Disk01.img ~/tp/Disk02.img ~/tp/Disk03.img ~/tp/Disk04.img -floppy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then switch over to the A: drive and run INSTALL:</p>



<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_000.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_001.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_002.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_003.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>At some point in the installation, you’ll have to change floppy disks, because it’s 1992.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_004.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>You can do this by selecting <strong>Drive</strong> -&gt; <strong>A</strong> -&gt; <strong>Swap disk</strong> in DOSBox-X. It’ll go from Disk 1 to Disk 2. Then just keep doing that and pressing enter until you’ve installed all four disks.</p>

<p>After the installation is done, it’ll ask you to configure your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> and <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> because again, 1992.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_005.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>Neither of these are strictly necessary. DOSBox-X already sets the FILES higher than the recommendation and adding it to the path only really lets you run TURBO from anywhere. When it’s done, you can run:</p>



<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/turbo_000.png" alt="turbo pascal"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/turbo_001.png" alt="turbo pascal"></p>

<p>I’d spent so much time looking at this IDE when I was a kid that it made me a bit nostalgic. But then I started porting my Python script to Pascal and that nostalgia faded quickly. I’d like to say that I wrote the whole thing in here but at a certain point I had to switch to VSCode and then copy the file back into the DOS directory. To the people that still run <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/">WordPerfect for DOS</a>, I get it, but I also don’t get it.</p>

<p>Here’s the script I landed on after spending a lot of time on this <a href="https://wiki.freepascal.org/Basic_Pascal_Tutorial">Pascal tutorial</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>program pinid;
uses crt;

var i: byte;
var pos: byte;
var lines: byte;
var length: byte;
var decrease: byte;
var delay_amount: integer;

begin
     randomize;

     delay_amount := 25;

     clrscr;

     writeln('PPPPP   IIIIIII   N    N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P   PP     I      NN   N IDENTIFICATION');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P   PP     I      N N  N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('PPPPP      I      N  N N   PROGRAM');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P          I      N   NN');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P       IIIIIII   N    N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('');

     write('Strike a key when ready ...');
     readln;

     writeln('');
     writeln('');
     writeln('12345678901234567890123457890123456780');

     pos := 0;
     lines := 1;

     length := 38;
     decrease := 1;

     while true do
     begin
          for i:= 1 to length do 
               write(random(9));
          writeln('');
          delay(delay_amount);
          lines := lines + 1;
          if (lines = 5) then
          begin
               lines := 0;
               length := length - decrease;
               if (decrease = 1) then
                   decrease := 2
               else
                   decrease := 1;
          end;
          if (length &lt;= 4) then
               break;
     end;

     for i:= 1 to 10 do
     begin
          writeln('9003');
          delay(delay_amount);
     end;

     writeln('');
     writeln('PIN IDENTIFICATION NUMBER: 9003');
     writeln('');

end.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some quick explanations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pascal has type declarations. A byte can be a number from 0-255.</li>
  <li>files start with <code>program</code> and the name of the program, presumably because all modules share the same namespace but the filename is irrelevant</li>
  <li>modules are imported with the word <code>uses</code>. <code>crt</code> is a module for manipulating the screen</li>
  <li>:= is the syntax for variable assignment, so you can compare with = and differentiate between the two.</li>
  <li>If blocks are longer than one line, you have to wrap them with <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> instead of brackets or relying upon whitespace.</li>
  <li>If you don’t run <code>randomize</code> at the beginning of your script, hilariously it always seeds random numbers with the same seed and the output is the same.</li>
  <li>WRITE writes a string, WRITELN writes a string with a newline. READLN accepts input until a newline is received.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it work? Here’s the program running in DOSBox-X:</p>



<p>In the spirit of owning less stuff, I’ve gone through the mental exercise of what it would take to make the rest of this a reality but will not follow through on any of it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Buy an Atari Portfolio on Ebay.</li>
  <li>Buy an <a href="http://www.best-electronics-ca.com/portfoli.htm">Atari Portfolio parallel interface and probably a new screen bezel</a> because it’s likely scratched.</li>
  <li>Find a parallel cable in my box of cables.</li>
  <li>Find a PC or laptop with a parallel port, install MS-DOS v6.22 on it.</li>
  <li>Download <a href="http://ftp.pigwa.net/stuff/mirror/www.umich.edu/%257Earchive/atari/Portfolio/Telecomm/index.html">FT.COM</a> and put it on the PC.</li>
  <li>Build the EXE in Dosbox-X and transfer it to the Atari Portfolio.</li>
  <li>Steal a debit card.</li>
  <li>Wrap part of the card in aluminum foil, buy an Atari Portfolio serial interface, run a cable to the card.</li>
  <li>Run the program.</li>
  <li>Easy money!</li>
</ol>

<![CDATA[Introduction to Window Functions in SQL]]>
            </title>

January 6, 2021 | https://khashtamov.com/en/sql-window-functions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://khashtamov.com/en/sql-window-functions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    
                        <p>It is interesting that many people working with data have no clue about window functions in SQL. During the long period of time instead of using window functions I prefered coding on Python and <a href="https://khashtamov.com/en/pandas-data-analysis/">pandas</a>. Today I would like to introduce you to the concept of "window" and how it is related to data extraction from a SQL database.</p>

<p><strong>Window functions</strong> are applied to a subset/window of rows related to one another. In comparison to <code>GROUP BY</code> operation, window functions do not decrease the number of rows. Aggregate functions like <code>AVG</code>, <code>SUM</code>, <code>COUNT</code> could be used as window functions as well. Usually window functions are used to do analytical tasks. The following examples of queries will be performed on PostgreSQL database.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre><code>&lt;function&gt;(&lt;expression&gt;) OVER (
  &lt;window&gt;
  &lt;sorting&gt;
  &lt;window range&gt; -- optional
)</code></pre>
<p>Looks creepy 😲 We need more practice. Let's assume that we have a salary table:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/salary_table_1.png" width="80%" data-image="atvi5p4igh4g"></figure>
<p><!--more-->One day your boss approaches you, he wants to know who is the highest paid employee by department. We can use the <code>MAX</code> function to select the highest salary by each department.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    department,
    MAX(gross_salary) as max_salary
FROM Salary
GROUP BY 1;
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>

<ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3273608550190378" data-ad-slot="9434009847"></ins>


<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/department_max_salary.png" width="80%" data-image="department_max_salary.png"></figure>
<p>In order to select the person with the highest salary by department we can use a subquery and <code>JOIN</code>:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    t.gross_salary
FROM Salary
JOIN (
    SELECT
        department,
        MAX(gross_salary) as gross_salary
    FROM Salary
    GROUP BY 1
) t USING(gross_salary, department);
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/highest_paid_employees.png" width="80%" data-image="highest_paid_employees.png"></figure>
<p>But the query looks verbose and dirty, maybe we can do the same with window functions? Sure. All you need to do is to set up a window for <code>MAX</code> aggregate function: </p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    MAX(gross_salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as max_gross_salary
FROM Salary;
</code></pre>
<p>The column <code>department</code> is a window. It means that employees from the same department is a subset or window of related rows. The result of the query:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/window_functions_highest_salary.png" width="80%" data-image="window_functions_highest_salary.png"></figure>
<p>As you can see we have the new column called <code>max_gross_salary</code> which shows the highest salary in each department. In order to retrieve the list of most paid employees we do the following:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM (
         SELECT id,
                first_name,
                department,
                gross_salary,
                MAX(gross_salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as max_gross_salary
         FROM Salary
     ) t
WHERE max_gross_salary = gross_salary
ORDER BY id;
</code></pre>
<p>Now your boss asks you to prepare the report which shows the ratio of salaries by department and by the total wage fund because some departments have relatively low-income employees in comparison with other departments. You can solve it using subqueries:</p>
<pre><code>WITH gross_by_departments AS (
    SELECT
        department,
        SUM(gross_salary) as dep_gross_salary
    FROM Salary
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9, 2)) / dep_gross_salary * 100, 2) as dep_ratio,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9, 2)) / (SELECT SUM(gross_salary) FROM Salary) * 100, 2) as total_ratio
FROM Salary
JOIN gross_by_departments USING(department)
ORDER BY department, dep_ratio DESC
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/subqueries_salary_ratios.png" width="80%" data-image="subqueries_salary_ratios.png"></figure>
<p>As you can see Нина earns 71.4% out of HR department, but it is only 10.7% out of total wage fund. Аркадий on the other hand has 21.4% out of total wage fund and 41% out of IT department. Can we refactor the query to make it smaller and more readable? Yes! <strong>Window functions</strong>!</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9,2)) / SUM(gross_salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) * 100, 2) as dep_ratio,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9,2)) / SUM(gross_salary) OVER () * 100, 2) as total_ratio
FROM Salary
ORDER BY department, dep_ratio DESC; 
</code></pre>
<p>The expression <code>OVER()</code> means that the "window" is all rows.</p>
<h2>Window functions only</h2>
<p>We used the aggregate functions <code>MAX</code> &amp; <code>SUM</code> as window functions above. But SQL standard consists of functions which cannot be used as aggregates hence no way to apply them during grouping. Here is the list of them:

</p>
<ul>
<li>first_value</li>
<li>last_value</li>
<li>lead</li>
<li>lag</li>
<li>rank</li>
<li>dense_rank</li>
<li>row_number</li>
</ul>
<p>The comprehensive list of all window functions supported in PostgreSQL you can find <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Using window functions</h3>
<p>Let's use the <code>first_value</code> function in order to solve the very first problem where we were asked to get the name of the highest paid employee by each department. The function returns the very first values according to the provided window.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    first_value(first_name) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY gross_salary DESC ) as highest_paid_employee
FROM Salary
</code></pre>
<p>We are sorting the rows in our window by salary in a descending order, it means that the very first row will be a person with the highest salary.</p>
<p>Now let's use <code>last_value</code>. It does the opposite of what <code>first_value</code> does.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT id,
       first_name,
       department,
       gross_salary,
       last_value(first_name)
       OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY gross_salary DESC) AS lowest_paid_employee
FROM Salary
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/lowest_paid_employees_last_value_window_function.png" width="80%" data-image="lowest_paid_employees_last_value_window_function.png"></figure>
<p>If you look at the table you will see that the result is wrong. Why? Because of window ranges. By default if you provide the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause the window range is all preceding rows and current row, in SQL terms it is <code>ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW</code>. It means that the <code>last_value</code> for a particular column in a particular row is a column in the same row. In order to fix this problem we need to change the range to <code>ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</code>:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT id,
       first_name,
       department,
       gross_salary,
       last_value(first_name)
       OVER (
           PARTITION BY department
           ORDER BY gross_salary DESC
           ROWS BETWEEN
               UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
               AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
           ) as lowest_paid_employee
FROM Salary
</code></pre>
<p>This is how it looks visually:</p>
<figure><span id="selection-marker-start">﻿</span><span id="selection-marker-end">﻿</span><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/unbounded_preceding_current_row_unbounded_following.png" data-image="r9u3sqk8i9v7"><span id="selection-marker-start">﻿</span><span id="selection-marker-end">﻿</span></figure>
<p>The possible values:</p>
<ul>
<li>N PRECEDING, N number of rows until current row</li>
<li>CURRENT ROW</li>
<li>UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</li>
<li>UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</li>
<li>N FOLLOWING**, N number of rows following current row</li>

</ul>

<![CDATA[The Hiring Process at IMGZ]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-12-23">December 23, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>A few weeks ago, we wrote a massively successful <a href="#">IMGZ systems architecture article</a> that ended up going viral (note to editor: are we still allowed to say "viral" in 2020?) and upending the world of image hosting.
Here we were, a small newcomer, poised to take on the giants of the multi-billion-dollar image hosting industry with our new, innovative and daring business model of charging people for services.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, all the media attention caused our user count to skyrocket, and our subscription graph started exhibiting the familiar "hockey stick" pattern that every VC in Silicon Valley wants to be hit with:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/iQYRKWrE.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Rather unsurprisingly, such an influx of new users caused a deluge of new content being uploaded to the platform. We estimate that, with our current level of usage, up to a thousand images could be getting uploaded to the service every year.</p>
<p>Naturally, we immediately sprang into action to preserve the reliability of our infrastructure, and quickly drew up a scaling plan that would enable the service to withstand its newfound popularity. This is where our foresight when designing the service paid off, as the hosting provider we use let us quickly perform the necessary changes and provision an extra gigabyte of disk space.</p>
<h2>One thing becomes clear</h2>
<p>However, one thing became clear: We could not sustain this breakneck pace for long by ourselves. This was never more obvious than a few days ago, when we realized we were close to failing to meet our uptime guarantee for 2020, and had to take the service offline for a few days to bring our uptime down to what we promised.</p>
<p>This event highlighted that there is just too much to do in a fledgling startup that aims to become the next MySpace, and even more to do in one that specifically wants to <em>avoid</em> becoming the next MySpace. If we were ever to realize the IMGZ vision and change the world, we needed more people.</p>
<h2>We're hiring!</h2>
<p>If you're young, passionate about creating software that changes the world and don't know what "3x investor preference" means, you're exactly who we're looking for! You have the opportunity to join an innovative, fast-growing company with a modern technology stack.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we don't just want to serve images, no. The values of IMGZ are far loftier than that. At IMGZ we live and breathe images to the point where our values can only be communicated <strong>with</strong> an image:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/i9xyk2H2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In talking with various prospective hires, one thing became abundantly clear: Nobody joins a startup for the money, they do it to get rich. With this in mind, we found the perfect balance of the "early startup employee" compensation package: 50% stock, 50% equity, 0% salary.</p>
<p>That's right! We can maximize the potential of your stock by doing away with a significant company expense: Employee salaries. This way, your stock is much more likely to be worth a lot more (and you have a lot of it, since our packages start at three trillion shares per employee! That's a big number).</p>
<p>Everyone we discussed this with loved the approach, and it makes intuitive sense: Name one Google employee who became a millionaire from their salary. We bet you can't, yet all of us know the name of that cleaning lady who was given Google stock and now she has "VC" on her CV, you know the one we're talking about.</p>
<h2>Interview process</h2>
<p>Like any self-respecting Silicon Valley startup, we can't just settle for any old 10x rockstar developer who wants to join. Firing people is expensive, you know? That is why we have prepared a thorough, six-stage interview process.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being a pragmatic, practice-driven development team, and we want to see how you perfom in real-world scenarios, so you will be given a feature from our product roadmap and will be asked to develop it to your satisfaction. Afterwards, we will use this feature in our product and see how users like it. If they do, that will be a point in your favor.</p>
<p>Of course, we can't really know if you developed the feature yourself or paid someone on Fiverr to do it for you, so for the next stage of the interview we will ask you to invert a data structure on a whiteboard. None of us knows how or cares enough about what you're doing, so we'll pretend to not like random things about your solution until you're on the verge of tears, to evaluate how you fare against the ever-changing requirements that come with bad leadership.</p>
<p>If you pass the whiteboard interviews without cracking, we'll introduce you to everyone on the team, making sure you have at least eight hours of one-on-one time with various staff members, often more than once. This is just so we get to know you better and see what you're like in social situations.</p>
<p>After wasting a few days of your time and ours, we'll finally adjourn and haphazardly email each other about you, mostly trying to remember which applicant you were from flaws in your appearance. We'll then round up all the notes and observations from your technical interviews and summarize everything we know about you into one list.</p>
<p>For the final decision, we'll look at the list and evaluate you purely on your technical merits, trying to confirm the judgment that we've already subconsciously formed based on how much you are like us. If you are too different, we're sorry, no matter how good you are technically, we'll pass. In this company, we value one thing above all others: Diversity.</p>
<h2>Apply today!</h2>
<p>If the above sounds appealing, excellent! Reach out to us at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><span data-cfemail="0e66677c6760694e67636974206d6163">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> to get the ball rolling, and you might soon be "working" for the best image host in the world, IMGZ!</p>

  <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>One of the less known Vim features is “abbreviations”. It’s something similar to mapping, but it has a different purpose.</p>
<p>Abbreviations are a very flexible and really powerful tool.</p>
<p>For simplicity, this post will cover only the Insert mode abbreviations.
This is Part 1 of the post. Part 2 will be published soon.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="basic-use-of-abbreviations">Basic use of abbreviations</h2>
<p><strong>The command</strong><br>
The command for Insert mode abbreviations looks like this:</p>
<p><code>:iabbrev [&lt;expr&gt;] [&lt;buffer&gt;] {abbreviation} {expansion}</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> -  stands for Vimscript expression to create the expansion.</li>
<li><code>&lt;buffer&gt;</code> -  means that it only applies to the current buffer.</li>
<li><code>{abbreviation}</code> -  is the thing you type, or your “trigger”</li>
<li><code>{expansion}</code> - is your final outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything that’s inside a [] is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Correcting typos</strong><br>
Let’s start with the simple commands first.</p>
<p>Run this command in your Vim: <code>:iabbrev teh the</code>. Now enter the Insert mode and type <code>teh end</code>.
As soon as you hit <kbd>Space</kbd> after typing the <code>teh</code>, Vim will replace it with <code>the</code>.</p>
<p>You probably have a few or more words which you misspell quite often. This is a good way to solve that problem.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding commonly used phrases</strong><br>
Of course, you can store all of your abbreviations in your <code>.vimrc</code> file. For example:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev @@ hi@jovica.org
iabbrev ccc Copyright 2020 Jovica Ilic, all rights reserved.
</code></pre><p>You’re coding in C? How about:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev #i #include
iabbrev #d #define
</code></pre><p>Now, let’s create one abbreviation with a Vimscript expression. We can use <code>strftime()</code> function.
If you run this command in Vim: <code>:put =strftime('%c')</code>, you’ll insert the current date and time in your current buffer.</p>
<p>So, we can do something like this with an abbreviation:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev &lt;expr&gt; ddd strftime('%c')
</code></pre><p>Save your <code>.vimrc</code>, open Vim and try them out. Cool, ha? :)</p>
<p>Basic text expanding and correcting spelling mistakes are just the tip of the iceberg. You can use abbreviations to generate entire code snippets.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="advanced-use-of-abbreviations">Advanced use of abbreviations</h2>
<p>Let’s create an abbreviation for generating a C style comment:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev cc /*&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;/&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>Basically, after you type <code>cc</code> in Insert mode and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, a code snippet like this is generated:</p>
<p>In the expression above, we basically told Vim to type <code>/*</code> then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice(<code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>), type <code>/</code> and hit the <kbd>↑</kbd> key.</p>
<p>If you have to write Java code for a living, you could add something like this to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>So every time you type <code>psvm</code> and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, you get a snippet like:</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args){

}
</code></pre><p><strong>File-type specific abbreviations</strong><br>
What if you want to use the same abbreviation for multiple programming languages? This is possible, as you can use abbreviations in auto commands. This way, you can create file-type specific abbreviations.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to make one abbreviation for printing a string in Python and Java.</p>
<pre><code>"python
autocmd Filetype python :iabbrev ppp print("");&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;
"java
autocmd FileType java :iabbrev ppp System.out.println("");&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;
</code></pre><p>With these lines in your <code>.vimrc</code>, you can now hit <code>ppp</code> and <kbd>Space</kbd>, and depending on the file type, you’ll insert an appropriate snippet for printing a string!</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at another, more complex example:</p>
<pre><code>autocmd FileType c iabbrev start #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \int main() {
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \  printf("hello\n");
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \  return 0;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \}
</code></pre><p>So if you open a <code>.c</code> file, type <code>start</code> and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, you’ll get the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;

int main() {
      printf("hello\n");
        return 0;

}
</code></pre><p>This is pretty cool. But all these “Enters” and other keys we need to simulate make these expressions a bit overwhelming. There’s a better way!</p>
<p><strong>Vim commands in abbreviations</strong><br>
Let’s get back to the previous abbreviation we defined for Java:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>We can achieve the same result with the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;esc&gt;O
</code></pre><p>What happens here? Let’s see:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>psvm</code> - our “trigger” expression</li>
<li><code>public static void main(String[] args){</code> - first part of the string to insert</li>
<li><code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> - hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> once</li>
<li><code>}</code> - second part of the string to insert</li>
<li><code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> - hitting <kbd>Esc</kbd> once and entering the Normal mode</li>
<li><code>O</code> - Normal mode command, which puts you in Insert mode, one line above your current line</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of simulating every single keystroke, we can “hit” <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go to Normal mode. From there, we can run any command we want :)</p>
<p>How about creating a <em>for loop</em>, and placing our cursor in Insert mode, exactly where the cursor should be?</p>
<p>Here’s a simple C-style loop sample:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>&lt;=</span><span>NUM</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We could create an abbreviation like this:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev forl for (i=1; i&lt;=NUM; i++) {&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;Esc&gt;?NUM&lt;CR&gt;cw
</code></pre><p>What happens here:</p>
<ul>
<li>At first, we insert the first part of the string</li>
<li>Then we hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice, and insert the second part of the string (<code>}</code>)</li>
<li>After that, we hit <kbd>Esc</kbd></li>
<li>Then we perform a search backwards for string <code>NUM</code>, by “hitting” <code>?NUM</code> and <kbd>Enter</kbd></li>
<li>Lastly, we run the <code>cw</code> command which stands for “change word”. This way we delete the string <code>NUM</code> and stay in the Insert mode, ready to type a desired value.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 id="theres-more">There’s more</h2>
<p>There’s much more to be said about abbreviations.</p>
<p>Here are just a few interesting bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just like mappings, abbreviations can be local to a buffer.</li>
<li>Abbreviations are never recursive.</li>
<li>Abbreviations can be mapped.</li>
<li>To avoid the abbreviation in Insert mode, you can hit Ctrl-v before the character that would trigger the abbreviation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll cover things like these in the upcoming, Part 2, of this post.<br>
Also, abbreviations are something I’ll definitely cover in the new edition of <a href="https://jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/">Mastering Vim Quickly: From WTF to OMG in no time</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fluent conversion between data formats like JSON, XML and CSV</strong></p>
<p>Ever sighed when you wrote code to convert CSV to JSON for the thousandth time?</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>csv</span>
<span>import</span> <span>json</span>

<span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

    <span>json</span><span>.</span><span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Stop sighing and use <code><span>dataknead</span></code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>dataknead</span> <span>import</span> <span>Knead</span>
<span>Knead</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.csv"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.json"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or make it even easier on the command line:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>knead</span> <span>cities</span><span>.</span><span>csv</span> <span>cities</span><span>.</span><span>json</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>dataknead</span></code> has inbuilt loaders for CSV, Excel, JSON, TOML and XML and you can easily write your own.</p>
<div id="philosophy">
<h2>Philosophy<a href="#philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><code><span>dataknead</span></code> is intended for easy conversion between common data formats and basic manipulation. It’s not a replacement for more complex libraries like <code><span>pandas</span></code> or <code><span>numpy</span></code>, but instead can be a useful addition to those libraries.</p>
<p>The API is as minimal as possible and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">fluent</a>.</p>
<p>The loaders for the different file formats are built upon existing and well-tested libraries like <a href="https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict">xmltodict</a> and <a href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">openpyxl</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Install <code><span>dataknead</span></code> from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dataknead">PyPi</a>.</p>

<p>Then import</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>dataknead</span> <span>import</span> <span>Knead</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="basic-example-tutorial">
<h2>Basic example &amp; tutorial<a href="#basic-example-tutorial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let’s say you have a small CSV file with cities and their population called <code><span>cities.csv</span></code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>city</span><span>,</span><span>country</span><span>,</span><span>population</span>
<span>Amsterdam</span><span>,</span><span>nl</span><span>,</span><span>850000</span>
<span>Rotterdam</span><span>,</span><span>nl</span><span>,</span><span>635000</span>
<span>Venice</span><span>,</span><span>it</span><span>,</span><span>265000</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And you want to load this csv file and transform it to a json file.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>dataknead</span> <span>import</span> <span>Knead</span>

<span>Knead</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.csv"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.json"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You’ll now have a json file called <code><span>cities.json</span></code> that looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>"city"</span> <span>:</span> <span>"Amsterdam"</span><span>,</span>

        <span>"population"</span> <span>:</span> <span>850000</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Maybe you just want the city names and write them to a CSV filed called <code><span>city-names.csv</span></code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>dataknead</span> <span>import</span> <span>Knead</span>

<span>Knead</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.csv"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>"city"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"city-names.csv"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That will give you this list</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>Amsterdam</span>
<span>Rotterdam</span>
<span>Venice</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now you want to extract only the cities that are located in Italy, and write that back to a new csv file called <code><span>cities-italy.csv</span></code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>dataknead</span> <span>import</span> <span>Knead</span>

<span>Knead</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.csv"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>r</span><span>:</span><span>r</span><span>[</span><span>"country"</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>"it"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"cities-italy.csv"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This gives you this:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>city</span><span>,</span><span>country</span><span>,</span><span>population</span>

        <section>
            <div><p>I'm <em>still in the game</em>, so join me as I explore the highlights of a second year of independent business and creating Open Source software. I'll share my top blog posts by views, top interviews, books that have influenced me and a little about each project I maintain. At the end of the post I'll talk about what 2021 has in store.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a lot of help this year, so I want to thank all my company's customers, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/alexellis">my GitHub Sponsors</a>, and everyone who contributed or helped to share.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mostpopularblogpostsof2020">Most popular blog posts of 2020</h2>
<p>Over the past year, I've focused on developing the OpenFaaS and inlets brands, and I've also experimented with Medium's Partner Program. These are the four blogs where you would have seen me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openfaas.com/blog">openfaas.com/blog</a> - OpenFaaS tutorials and news</li>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/blog">inlets.dev/blog</a> - case-studies, tutorials and news on inlets</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/">blog.alexellis.io</a> - my original blog for experiments, technical writing, tutorials that don't fit with one of the other brands.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@alexellisuk">medium.com/@alexellisuk</a> - blog posts that I think can be monetized</li>
</ul>
<p>It's been encouraging to see my posts trending on Hacker News, Reddit and Twitter, along with being included in newsletters like <a href="https://kubeweekly.io/">KubeWeekly</a> and <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/cronweekly/">cron.weekly</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the most popular blog posts from the year ranked by views:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>I now have hundreds of blog posts going back several years, so it's difficult to read too much into the numbers, as it depends on how much traffic the site gets and where it has trended. A post on Hacker News could get 15k views overnight, and another more impactful post could get a steady stream of 3k per day from organic searches.</p>
<p>This year I've mainly focused on use-cases, and on capturing the imagination. In 2021, you'll see more of the same along with more guest posts on the blogs.</p>
<h2 id="bestinterviewsfeatures">Best interviews / features</h2>
<p>As part of <a href="https://github.com/readme">GitHub's readme program</a>, I was invited to write a feature-length piece on independent business and Open Source development</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readme/alex-ellis">Balancing open source sacrifice and success</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this gives you a deeper perspective on what it's like to be on the hook for a large OSS project.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/craigbox?lang=en">Craig Box</a> from Google reached out to me and asked me: "Why aren't you working for a FAANG company for 350K USD / year"?</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Craig had sketched out a brief history of my career in a Google Doc, and we were recording a podcast with his co-host</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/116-independent-open-source/">Kubernetes Podcast #116 - Independent Open Source</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Learn how a developer at a payroll company became a Docker Captain, caused a stir with a prototype, and quit his job to create an independent software business.</p>
<h2 id="influentialreads">Influential reads</h2>
<p>I've read a number of books this year that have had an influence on me. I can't say that I finished them all, but I did get something from each that has helped me with my journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://neildavidson.com/downloads/dont-just-roll-the-dice-2.0.0.pdf">Don't just roll the dice</a> - a short guide to software pricing by Neil Davidson - this book taught me about the "pricing curve" - and how once a price rises above 0USD (think open source), you lose part of your potential market. There is a sweet spot on the curve. It also taught me about "price anchoring" - where a similar product becomes the way people expect your offering to be priced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3hoCFpb">Before The Exit: Thought Experiments For Entrepreneurs by Dan Andrews</a> - this book showed me that a product or project gives a platform and outlet, that once taken away can leave a void. It also challenged the idea that selling a business is the only successful outcome. And that receiving a windfall of cash, isn't necessarily as fulfilling as we would hope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/38H5okY">The Irresistible Consultant's Guide to Winning Clients by David A. Fields</a> - the main learning in this book is that success is found not in selling what you think you are able to, but in finding what pain a customer might have, and offering a solution that could help. Likewise, they need to sense urgency and enough pain to buy the solution. It also has to be simple enough to make sense to them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A good example of this would be Tailwind UI - a series of HTML and CSS snippets built by a designer and marketed to developers. Most backend developers are hopeless at making things look nice on a webpage.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3oaFQU5">The Visual MBA by Jason Barron</a> - having spent so much of my life giving all of the value I was creating away for free, this book helped me understand a framework for testing business ideas and iterating on them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, from a business and sustainability perspective, Open Source software fails its creators and only benefits its users.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3hoG0Vd">Start with Why by Simon Sinek</a> - the premise of this book was enough for me to stop and question things. When you're responsible for picking what you're working on, then asking Why? becomes even more important. Why did I start OpenFaaS? Why am I still working on it?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a why and challenging it over time could save us all a lot of wasted time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common theme in all of these books was that customers buy ways to reduce and remove pain. It needn't be a 10x improvement, but it should be an obvious solution, and they need to have a sense urgency about fixing the problem.</p>
<p>I would also say that I've become more aware of "Indie Hackers" - these are solo developers who come up with what's usually a very trivial idea, but execute on it hard. One example that caught my attention was a service that just <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/">makes banner images for blog posts</a>. That was it. That was the product. From the outside, it looks like a simple idea that is easily copied, but by pressing in, he is now earning 8k USD per month from a platform, which I imagine costs very little to run.</p>
<p>When I compare this to my journey with OpenFaaS, and consider that its <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">recurring revenue on GitHub Sponsors</a> is only around 500 USD / mo, from one end-user company, it makes me question the ideology of Open Source Software.</p>
<h2 id="projecthighlights">Project highlights</h2>
<h3 id="inletscloudnativetunnels">inlets - Cloud Native tunnels</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>inlets was created to make tunnels something we could self-host, to get away from the limitations of SaaS products, and to integrate deeply with VMs, containers and Kubernetes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year I launched a landing page and blog for <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO</a>. To begin with it was just a few pieces of Tailwind UI tied together that showed pricing and features. It was a starting-point, but then over time it's evolved and now even has its own blog with guest posts.</p>
<p>Highlights for inlets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>inlets blog launched - the first post was about my inlets presentation on <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/10/08/advanced-cloud-patterns.html">"Advanced cloud patterns" at cert-manager's community day</a>. Since then I've seen several guest posts and an uptick in visits to the domain because of SEO and social sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business customers - inlets PRO has seen lots of customer interest over the year, and had its first business customers. I've got used to qualifying leads, following-up on free trials and more used to rejection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a>/<a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> providers - both gained new cloud providers like Hetzner, Azure and Vultr. I couldn't have done this without the support of the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/tag/0.7.0">inlets OSS + PRO syntax</a> - both were quite different and are now almost identical to help with adoption and to make it more intuitive for new users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal customers - some customers feel the price is fair, others expect it to be free. This is just the pricing curve doing its thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most personal customers are choosing inlets PRO to enable their local development, self-hosting needs or to get <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/self-hosting-kubernetes-on-your-raspberry-pi/">Ingress into their homelabs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It only takes a few seconds to create a tunnel server with inletsctl, but next year, if there's enough interest then I may look into building a managed inlets service.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="openfaasserverlessfunctionsmadesimple">OpenFaaS - Serverless Functions Made Simple</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My top highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> adoption and reception</li>
<li>Writing <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/introduction-to-serverless-linuxfoundation/">Introduction to Serverless Kubernetes for the LinuxFoundation</a></li>
<li>Going fully multi-arch for all OpenFaaS projects</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/openfaas-functions-with-github-actions/">Moving the templates to multi-arch with buildx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/birthday-invite/">Celebrating the 4th Birthday with the community</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For OpenFaaS my highlight would be <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>. faasd was initially an experiment to see if <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a> would make a good back-end for functions instead of Kubernetes. By removing the support for clusters which have natural latency through their event-drive nature, things like cold-starts got so rapid, that they stopped existing. The cost to run OpenFaaS dropped from "a Kubernetes cluster" to a 3 EUR / mo VPS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're still only scratching the surface of what faasd will mean for the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You end up with something that costs less than cloud functions, and has a much better developer experience, with the ability to "scale-up" into Kubernetes in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnZJXI377ak">Meet faasd. Look Ma’ No Kubernetes!</a> - a 10 minute video overview of the use-case, the differences, and how people are using it in production already.</li>

<h3 id="arkadeportablekubernetesmarketplace">arkade - portable Kubernetes marketplace</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a></li>
</ul>
<p>arkade now has 40 apps that you can install with one command, and dozens of CLIs that you can install much quicker than using brew or apt-get. This year I've seen around half a dozen projects copy the approach arkade uses to fetch binaries, so I think we're on to something there.</p>
<p>Its real value comes in compounding - when you need several CLIs or Apps for a tutorial or cluster, the speed-up in getting something deployed is huge.</p>
<p>Want self-hosted OpenFaaS, with a public IP and TLS certificate, but running on your laptop, with KinD?</p>
<pre><code># Get your CLIs

<![CDATA[Inductive Program Synthesis in JavaScript]]>
            </title>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Any compiler or transpiler is doing some form of program synthesis. But “proper” program synthesis usually means generation of high level programs from scratch, given only high level problem descriptions.</p>
<p>This post is about one of the most simple and straightforward methods of automatic program synthesis: inductive synthesis based on <strong>input-output examples</strong> specification and <strong>brute-force enumerative</strong> search.</p>
<h3>Synthesis task specification</h3>
<p>Let's start with a simple example. Suppose that we want to automatically generate a program that reverses an array.</p>
<p>How to formulate this task for the automatic program generator? One option is to just describe it in natural language. But it would be quite hard to automatically parse and understand. A simpler way is to provide examples of inputs and expected outputs:</p>
<p>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] → [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]</p>
<p>[5, 2, 7, 6] → [6, 7, 2, 5]</p>
<p>It's similar to a programmer working on a task using test-driven development, with a set of self-explanatory tescases.</p>
<h3>Brute-force search</h3>
<p>How to find a program that satisfies some input-output examples? There are several possible search strategies, but the simplest one is just with a brute force enumeration.</p>
<p>The idea is to generate all programs (within some size liimts and a limited language subset), and pick the first one that works correctly for all specified examples.</p>
<p>This is probably the least efficient approach of all, but with some additional optimizations and heuristics for reducing the search space it can actually be practical.</p>
<p>For example, an algorithm that won last year's synthesis competition <a href="https://sygus.org/comp/2019/">SyGuS-Comp 2019</a> in programming-by-examples track, is based on brute-force enumerative search strategy. As well as some previous years winners (<a href="#examples" id="ref1">EUSOLVER, Enumerative CEGIS Solver</a>). There are even some practical applications, for example brute-force search can be used for <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2462174">synthesising distributed systems protocols</a>.</p>
<h3>Generating Javascript</h3>
<p>For generating and manipulating programs, code has to be represented as a data structure. This is not a problem in homoiconic languages like Lisp, but in Javascript it’s harder.</p>
<p>One simple idea (used, for example in miniMAL project <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL">https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL</a>), is to use JSON for representing programs. In this case, JSON arrays are serving as an analog of Lisp s-expressions.</p>
<p>Similar to an s-expression, each JavaScript expression is represented as a JSON array. First element is a function name, and the rest of elements are for function arguments.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong></td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong></td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>Math.pow(x, 2)</td>
   <td>["Math.pow", "x", 2]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Math.pow(Math.sin(x), 2)</td>
   <td>[“Math.pow”, [“Math.sin”,  “x”], 2]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For operators, can use prefix notation:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>x = 2 + 2</td>
   <td>["=", x, ["+", 2, 2]]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>There are some special expressions formats: control flow, variables declaration.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let x = 1
   </td>
   <td> ["let", "x", 1]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i += 1) { console.log(i) }
   </td>
   <td>["for”, ”i”, ”0”, ”10”, ”1”,["block", [“console.log”, “i”]]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>if (i &gt; 1) { i = 1; }
   </td>
   <td>["if", [“&gt;“, “i”, 1], ["block", [“=“, “i”, 1]]]
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Also need syntax conventions for calling methods, accessing properties, and indexing arrays:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>let a = new Array(0, 1, 2)
   </td>
   <td>["let", "a", ["new Array", 0, 1, 2]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>a.shift()
   </td>
   <td>[".shift", "a"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let n1 = a.length
   </td>
   <td>["let",  "n1", [".length_", "a"]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let n2 = a[1]
   </td>
   <td>["let",  "n2", ["get_index", a, 1]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>a[1] = 2
   </td>
   <td>["set_index", a, 0, 0]
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This allows to represent a wide range of possible JavaScript expressions, and covers all language features needed for a simple demo.</p>
<p>Code for transforming from JSON representation to Javascript is fairly simple. It just has to traverse arrays, print out expressions elements in correct order, and deal with code formatting.</p>
<h3>Simple DSL</h3>
<p>For brute-force search to be feasible, search space has to be limited to some restricted domain-specific language subset, which depends on the kind of the target problem.</p>
<p>For example, can design a simple DSL targeted for simple array processing. It should have functions for array access and manipulation, simple arithmetics, and control flow functions.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td><strong>function</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>subtract
   </td>
   <td>number = number?? - number??
   </td>
   <td>["-", "number??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>add
   </td>
   <td>number = number?? + number??
   </td>
   <td>["+", "number??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>greater than
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? &gt; number??
   </td>
   <td>["&gt;", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>less than
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? &lt; number??
   </td>
   <td>["&lt;", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>equal
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? == number??
   </td>
   <td>["==", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>array length
   </td>
   <td>number = array??.length
   </td>
   <td>[".length_", "array??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>get array element at index
   </td>
   <td>number = array??[number??]
   </td>
   <td>["get_index", "array??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>set array element at index
   </td>
   <td>array??[number??] = number
   </td>
   <td>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>for loop
   </td>
   <td>for (let i in array??) { ?? }
   </td>
   <td>["for", "i", ["block", "??"], "in", "array??", ""]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>If condition
   </td>
   <td>if (boolean??) { ?? }
   </td>
   <td>["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""],
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In the DSL description, "??" stands for an undefined value, that can be replaced with an expression or a variable. This notation is taken from <a href="#sketch" id="ref2">SKETCH language</a>, where "??" represents a <em>hole,</em> a placeholder that the synthesizer can replace with an integer constant.</p>
<p>Some undefined values have annotated types. For example "number??" means that the argument should be replaced with an expression that has "number" return value. This allows for additional limitations on the search space.</p>
<h3>Algorithm for program generation</h3>
<p>How to generate all programs that can be represented with the DSL? The algorithm is fairly simple: start with some undefined values, and iteratively replace them with all possible options picked from the list of DSL expressions. Selected and pasted expressions would contain some undefined values of their own, so the process is repeated until all the options are used, or until expressions tree depth reaches some limit.</p>
<p>It’s like iterative template rewriting, and it’s easier to demonstrate with an example:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
	<td>1. Start with an empty/undefined program </td>
	<td>["??", "??", "??", "??"] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>2. Traverse the expressions tree, and pick the first occurring undefined value </td>
	<td>[<span>"??"</span>, "??", "??", "??"] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>3. List all options for replacing this value (expressions that have an empty return type) </td>
	<td><span>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]</span><br>
		["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""]<br>
		["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""]
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>4. Repace undefined value with the first option </td>
	<td>[<span>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]</span>, "??", "??" ,"??"] </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Steps 2-4 are repeated iteratively. Expressions tree is traversed depth-first, and each found leaf corresponds to a unique program. Press “next” button in the demo below, to see next iterations.</p>


<div id="demo2">

	<p>
		Demo: iterative program generation
	</p>

	<p>step</p>
	<p>reset</p>

	
</div>

<p>Generated programs are verified with the given input-output examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translate from JSON represenation to Javascript</li>
<li>Fill pre-defined input array variable with an example</li>
<li>Evaluate the program with eval()</li>
<li>Check if contents of the pre-defined output variable correspond to the output example.</li>
</ol>
<p>The demo below shows program generation for "array reversal" problem. Press “generate” button to see continuous generation, or use “next” to see generation steps. It generates and checks around a million of short programs per minute, and is able so solve the problem in ~10-20s. I tweaked the DSL to have a bare minimum of available expressions, for search to be faster. Size of the program is also limited by number of used varialbes (limited to 4). It would still work with larger more generic DSL, just would take more time.</p>

<div id="demo5">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This story starts with me having to simulate a faulty disk device for testing.
The Linux Kernel Device mapper is a good solution for this, so i created a
faulty device with a simple file backend:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>truncate</span> <span>-s</span> 1G /tmp/baddisk
 losetup /dev/loop2 /tmp/baddisk
 dmsetup create baddisk <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>EOF</span><span> 
    0 6050 linear /dev/loop2 0
    6050 155 error
    6205 2090947 linear /dev/loop2 6205 
 EOF</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These commands setup a new device on <em>/dev/mapper/baddisk</em> with <em>1GB</em> of size.
Starting from sector <em>6050</em>, there are <em>155</em> faulty sectors, where any write and
read operation should cause I/O errors.</p>

<p>I went on and used <em>dd</em> to write to the device, as the first faulty block
should start around <em>3MB</em>, i used the following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>To my surprise, the command succeeded. I assumed some error in my setup and
after re-creating the device mapper target, i tried again. This time with the
following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk
 <span>dd</span>: writing to <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error
 3096576 bytes <span>(</span>3.1 MB, 3.0 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0238947 s, 130 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>Nice, the device behaves as expected! While taking notes in another terminal
and switching back and forth workspaces, i issued the following command again:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>What? It succeeded writing <em>4.1MB</em> of data to a faulty segment of the disk
which should clearly fail! This was strange, but still, after many attempts
with this command writing to the complete device until it got end of space, no
I/O errors were reported by <em>dd</em>.</p>

<p>Looking at the <em>dmesg</em> output, the kernel correctly reported errors with the
underlying device:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> Buffer I/O error on dev dm-3, logical block 757, lost async page write
 <span>[</span>..]</code></pre></figure>

<p>And running <em>badblocks</em> on the device also correctly reported them.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> does dd not report this error?</p>

<p>The difference between the commands is the used block size, so i assumed some
caching beeing the cause for this situation, or maybe dd opening the file with
different flags like O_DIRECT or O_SYNC if smaller block sizes are used?</p>

<p>I straced the <em>dd</em> command and the openat/write and close functions behaved
exacly the same, this time i used a <em>5MB</em> block size for simpler debugging:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> openat<span>(</span>AT_FDCWD, <span>"/dev/mapper/baddisk"</span>, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 3
 write<span>(</span>1, <span>"</span><span>\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0</span><span>"</span>..., 5242880<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 5242880
 close<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>                                <span>=</span> 0</code></pre></figure>

<p>The strace output shows that the succeeding command opens the file without any
notable difference to the command writing with 512 bytes block size.  The write
and close functions return with no error whatsoever. <em>dd</em> simply does not
notice the data loss while writing to the storage!</p>

<p>Making <em>dd</em> use the <em>O_DIRECT</em> flag during file open, or the <em>O_SYNC</em> option
catches the error:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>5M <span>oflag</span><span>=</span>direct
 <span>dd</span>: error writing <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

<p>What is the reason for this? I assume dd, with its standard block size of 512
bytes does not the hit the linux kernels buffered I/O. And with bigger block
sizes, the I/O becomes buffered, async, and as it stands, dd as user space
application does not validate the write operation (using fsync) to notice
errors during buffered I/O operations by default.</p>

<p>This leads us to my next finding: “the linux fsync() gate” that dates back to
2018, starting with the following question on stackoverflow:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42434872/writing-programs-to-cope-with-i-o-errors-causing-lost-writes-on-linux">Writing programs to cope with I/O errors causing lost writes on Linux
</a></p>

<p>And resulting LWN articles:</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/724307/">Improved block-layer error handling</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752063/">PostgreSQL’s fsync() surprise</a></p>

<p>which provide great insight into the linux kernels error handling and how these
errors are upstreamed to user space applications while writing data to faulty
devices.</p>

<p>Long story short: If one uses <em>dd</em> with a bigger block size <em>(&gt;= 4096)</em>, be
sure to use either the <em>oflag=direct</em> or <em>conv=fsync</em> option to have proper
error reporting while writing data to a device. I would prefer <em>conv=fsync</em>, dd
will then <em>fsync()</em> the file handle once and report the error, without having
the performance impact which <em>oflag=direct</em> has.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1500 <span>conv</span><span>=</span>fsync
<span>dd</span>: fsync failed <span>for</span> <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

			<p>With Typescript 4.1, it’s now possible to use variadic tuple types to construct large types with what appears to be runtime code. The general idea is that we will utilize a chaining pattern, where each operation on the chain returns an expanded version of the chain’s type.</p>
<p>To motivate the example, let us consider a <code>Set</code> class. Our <code>Set</code> is a chaining class, where you may insert, remove, and check for the existence of numbers. To end the chain, you call <code>.value()</code> which returns an array of numbers.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how you might use <code>Set</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>const</span> <span>set</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Set()
  .insert(<span>2</span>)
  .insert(<span>4</span>)
  .insert(<span>8</span>)

<span>const</span> hasTwo <span>=</span> <span>set</span>.has(<span>2</span>) <span>// true
</span><span></span>

</blockquote>
<p>It would be interesting to have a version of <code>Set</code> which can infer that the final <code>value</code> type is the tuple type <code>[4, 8]</code>. This is what we will attempt to do.</p>
<h2 id="baldis-basics">Baldi’s Basics</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with a specification of the <code>Set</code> type which obeys our chaining constraints, such that the <code>insert</code> and <code>remove</code> method returns an instance of <code>Set</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set;
  insert(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> Set;
  remove(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> Set;
  has(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;
  value()<span>:</span> <span>number</span>[]
};
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>new (): T</code> syntax specifies a constructor, and allows the <code>new</code> keyword to be used, which in this case is an ergonomic choice.</p>
<p>The next improvement we will make is to add a tuple type parameter to <code>Set</code>, which extends an array of numbers. We will additionally make the default value of that type parameter the empty array. This type parameter represents the current contents of <code>Set</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  insert(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  remove(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  has(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;
  value()<span>:</span> Elements
};
</code></pre></div><p>In preparation, let us next specify that each member function which takes in a number, additionally takes in an inferred type based on the value which it is passed. Each of these types represent the specific value which was passed in.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  insert&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  remove&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  has&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;
  value()<span>:</span> Elements;
};
</code></pre></div><h2 id="tuple-insertion">Tuple Insertion</h2>
<p>In the following example, we can see how to represent the addition of a new element into an existing tuple type. This uses a recently developed tuple destructuring syntax. We could also prepend elements by switching the positions of <code>Ex1_Original</code> and <code>Ex1_NewElement</code> on the last line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>type</span> Ex1_Original <span>=</span> [<span>2</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>8</span>];
<span>type</span> Ex1_NewElement <span>=</span> <span>10</span>;
<span>type</span> Ex1_ResultantArray <span>=</span> [...Ex1_Original, Ex1_NewElement]; <span>// [2, 4, 8, 10]
</span></code></pre></div><p>We can use the above simple example to finish our <code>insert</code> method type, by specifying that <code>insert</code> returns an instance of <code>Set</code> with the type of our specific value appended to the current tuple type. We will additionally introduce some whitespace to reduce visual noise.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;

  insert&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set<span>&lt;</span>[...Elements, SpecificValue]<span>&gt;</span>;

  remove&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;

  has&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;

  value()<span>:</span> Elements;
};
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, we may use the <code>insert</code> and <code>value()</code> methods and expect they will infer the transient types automatically. This general approach for continually building up types in a “runtime-fashion” is very useful for writing easy-to-use and type-safe libraries.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>const</span> Ex2_Array <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Set().insert(<span>2</span>).insert(<span>4</span>).value(); <span>// [2, 4]
</span></code></pre></div><h2 id="tuple-removal">Tuple Removal</h2>
<p>As of yet, there is no built-in operation for tuple removal. However, it can be implemented using a recursive loop on the type level, the mechanics of which would detract from this article. Of note - at the time of writing, <code>ts-toolbelt</code> uses a less modern variant than the following, and will not work. I may attempt to explain tuple type loops in another article.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>type</span> Filter&lt;<span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>unknown</span><span>[],</span> <span>N</span>&gt; <span>=</span> T <span>extends</span> []
  <span>?</span> []
  <span>:</span> T <span>extends</span> [<span>infer</span> H, ...<span>infer</span> R]
  <span>?</span> H <span>extends</span> N
    <span>?</span> Filter&lt;<span>R</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span>&gt;
    <span>:</span> [H, ...Filter&lt;<span>R</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span>&gt;]
  <span>:</span> T;

<span>type</span> Ex3_Original <span>=</span> [<span>2</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>8</span>];
<span>type</span> Ex3_ResultantArray <span>=</span> Filter&lt;<span>Ex3_Original</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span>&gt;; <span>// [4, 8]
</span></code></pre></div><p>We can deputize this ability to empower our <code>remove</code> method to remove the corresponding element types from our tuple type.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;

  insert&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set<span>&lt;</span>[...Elements, SpecificValue]<span>&gt;</span>;

  remove&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Filter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;<span>&gt;</span>;

  has&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;

  value()<span>:</span> Elements;
};
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, we are able to insert, remove, and get the array value of the numbers we place into our <code>Set</code> object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>const</span> Ex4 <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Set().insert(<span>2</span>).insert(<span>4</span>).remove(<span>2</span>).value(); <span>// [4]
</span></code></pre></div><h2 id="tuple-insertion-2---duplicate-edge-case">Tuple Insertion #2 - Duplicate Edge Case</h2>
<p>Readers following along very closely may have noticed an issue with our <code>insert</code> method type - namely, that multiple insertions of the same value will emplace duplicates on the type level. Since <code>Set</code> is a set, this is not wanted.</p>
<p>Luckily, with our <code>Filter</code> utility type available, we can ensure no duplicates exist by first filtering out that value type.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;

  insert&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set<span>&lt;</span>[...Filter&lt;<span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;, SpecificValue]<span>&gt;</span>;

  remove&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Filter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;<span>&gt;</span>;

  has&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;

  value()<span>:</span> Elements;
};
</code></pre></div><p>Note that we could have just as well determined whether or not the value was already present, and decided whether or not to insert it. This underlines the isomorphism between the value-level and the type-level - specifically that in a lot of cases, any given operation you could think of has both a value-level component and a type-level component, including array operations, arithmetic, graph operations, etc.</p>
<p>As well, any given type specification will have multiple possible representations, with differing efficiency, albeit with respect to compilation time and memory in lieu of runtime cost.</p>
<h2 id="tuple-existence-checks">Tuple Existence Checks</h2>
<p>For existence check, we need another, similar type-level recursive tuple loop. With some meditation, you may be able to notice the similar structure between <code>Exists</code> and <code>Filter</code> - they operate on the same principle.</p>
<p>By design, we choose to say that in the case of a generic type <code>number[]</code>, any given number may or may not exist - which we represent via returning <code>boolean</code> rather than explicitly true or false.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>type</span> Exists&lt;<span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>unknown</span><span>[],</span> <span>N</span>&gt; <span>=</span> T <span>extends</span> []
  <span>?</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>:</span> T <span>extends</span> [<span>infer</span> H, ...<span>infer</span> R]
  <span>?</span> H <span>extends</span> N
    <span>?</span> <span>true</span>
    <span>:</span> Exists&lt;<span>R</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span>&gt;
  <span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;

<span>type</span> Ex5_1 <span>=</span> [<span>2</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>8</span>];
<span>type</span> Ex5_1_HasFour <span>=</span> Exists&lt;<span>Ex5_1</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span>&gt;; <span>// true
</span><span></span>
<span>type</span> Ex5_2 <span>=</span> <span>number</span>[];
<span>type</span> Ex5_2_HasFour <span>=</span> Exists&lt;<span>Ex5_1</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span>&gt;; <span>// boolean
</span></code></pre></div><p>We now have enough code to finish our type specification of <code>Set</code>, complete with a type-safe existence check.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;

  insert&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set<span>&lt;</span>[...Filter&lt;<span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;, SpecificValue]<span>&gt;</span>;

  remove&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Filter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;<span>&gt;</span>;

  has&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Exists&lt;<span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;;

  value()<span>:</span> Elements;
};
</code></pre></div><p>And we can finish the section with a few examples of existence checking. Even if we insert an element, remove it, and then check, we still get the correct result. In general, this will work until the compiler no longer has patience, which is an internal implementation detail. In that case, the compiler will claim that our <code>Set</code> contains <code>number[]</code>. Though for reasonable examples, our <code>Set</code> type checking works as we expect:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>const</span> Ex5_1 <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Set().insert(<span>2</span>).insert(<span>4</span>).insert(<span>8</span>).has(<span>4</span>); <span>// true
</span><span></span><span>const</span> Ex5_2 <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Set().insert(<span>2</span>).remove(<span>2</span>).has(<span>2</span>); <span>// false
</span></code></pre></div><h2 id="value-level">Value-Level</h2>
<p>A value-level implementation of <code>Set</code> is provided below, mostly to demonstrate the separation between value-level implementation and type-level specification, which is sometimes wise with more involved types.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>const</span> Set <span>=</span> (<span>class</span> {
  <span>private</span> <span>set</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span>[] <span>=</span> [];

  <span>public</span> insert(x: <span>number</span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>set</span> <span>=</span> [...<span>this</span>.<span>set</span>.filter((y) <span>=&gt;</span> y <span>!==</span> x), x];
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span>;
  }

  <span>public</span> remove(x: <span>number</span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>set</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.<span>set</span>.filter((y) <span>=&gt;</span> y <span>!==</span> x);
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span>;
  }

  <span>public</span> has(x: <span>number</span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>set</span>.includes(x);
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span>;
  }

  <span>public</span> value() {
    <span>return</span> [...<span>this</span>.<span>set</span>];
  }
} <span>as</span> <span>unknown</span>) <span>as</span> Set;
</code></pre></div><p>The downside is that we now are not doing any compile-checks against the implementation of <code>Set</code> - namely, we are not checking that <code>Set</code> actually does what the types says it will do. The issue with attempting that is that while that approach is possible, it would require every sub-function e.g. <code>includes</code>, etc. to also be just as type-safe. Essentially, for libraries in Typescript it’s my opinion that it’s safer and more readable to keep the type specification and the value-level separate. Application-side code should endeavor to do the opposite however.</p>
<p>It may be possible to automatically extract a simplified type of <code>Set</code> which we can validate our runtime implementation against, but it would be hard.</p>
<p>Final note: For pedagogic reasons, I have glossed over some nuance with respect to <code>new ()</code> - really, a wrapper type is needed to hide the member functions until the class is actually constructed, which is demonstrated on the TS Playground version of the code.</p>

And in true mythic style, it contains the seeds of its own eclipse. This is my <em>subjective</em> historical narrative of how that happened.</p><p>I’m using the name “Unix” to include the entire family of operating systems descended from it, or that have been heavily influenced by it. That includes Linux, SunOS, Solaris, BSD, Mac OS X, and many, many others.</p><p>Both major mobile OSs, Android and iOS, have Unix roots. Their billions of users dwarf those using clunky things like laptops and desktops, but even there, Windows is only the non-Unix viable OS. Almost everything running server-side in giant datacenters is Linux.</p><p>How did Unix win?</p><ul><li><p>It was built by programmers, for programmers. If you read the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FP01T4G5I2lk&amp;t=ZjZkZTg2MGQ0YjUyNmI3MGFjNjM1YTljNTYyOWNiZTIyZTA1NWFkNixXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610225117">early papers describing Unix</a>, you will see how the key abstractions (hierarchical filesystems, permissions, processes, interactive shells, pipes) have lasted conceptually unsullied for decades. That could only have happened if it exerted such a force field over geek minds that they propagated it.</p></li><li><p>The majority of it was written not in assembly language, but in C, a higher-level language, hence making it portable. This enabled relatively easy ports to a wide variety of hardware.</p></li><li><p>A freak historical accident. AT&amp;T Labs, where it was developed, was forbidden under its anti-trust settlement from commercializing products unrelated to its core telecom business. Hence, Unix was licensed very cheaply to universities, including UC Berkeley, which subsequently built one of the more influential branches of the Unix family tree—BSD. Apparently, AT&amp;T classified Unix as <a href="https://twitter.com/nuthaven/status/1254897999290892289?s=09">industrial waste</a> for tax purposes when licensing it!</p></li><li><p>Unix spread through academia, and those students spread it through corporations after they graduated. It’s a strategy that has been used by every major tech company, only in this case it was organic.</p></li><li><p>And then came the Internet, and the whole universe of daemons, tools, protocols, and utilities that undergirded it was built natively on Unix. That wasn’t a huge surprise because a lot of the people that built the Net were Unix natives. BSD open-sourced its TCP/IP stack, kicking off its wide adoption outside the military.</p></li><li><p>By the late 90s and early 2000s, Linux started taking over the server-side. It has become the ultimate virtuous cycle in open source. When picking a new kernel one is virtually forced to go with Linux because of the huge community and massive engineering that has gone into solidifying it. That’s probably why Android picked Linux even though it was running on the other end of the hardware spectrum.</p></li></ul><p>So how and why would we move past Unix?</p><ul><li><p>Unix, which got standardized into the POSIX spec, has accreted a tremendous amount of complexity over the decades. The <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.open-std.org%2Fjtc1%2Fsc22%2Fopen%2Fn4217.pdf&amp;t=NTU2MmI0ZjE4YzkwYTIwZWVmNDg3YjNhNDk0ZDNmNTU3NjMwMGFmYyxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610225117">POSIX spec</a> is <em>3000 pages</em> long. Linux now has nearly 400 system calls. What started as a clean, pure, minimal and elegant set of system abstractions has become a complex beast.</p></li><li><p>The very idea of the OS providing general-purpose abstractions with wide applicability is being challenged. When Unix was created, IO was orders of magnitude slower than CPU. There were enough CPU cycles to burn to provide these high-level abstractions, like a complex hierarchical filesystem. <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FSM3PhGGllL0&amp;t=NDU0OGNmMTE3ZjlmOGJmYjZjMWU4M2E3OTMxNDk5NjgxNTBkOWRiNixXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610225117">Now IO can easily saturate CPU</a>. At least on the server side, folks just want to get the fastest performance out of their hardware. That’s leading to the rise of frameworks like <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fspdk.io&amp;t=MWQ2MWI1ZDU0MWJlMDFhYjIyYjdmNzc1Y2Q3Y2YxNmNiMjg2MzAwMCxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610225117">SPDK</a> and <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdpdk.org&amp;t=M2FlNTRlOGE5OWMyNThkNWQ3NGJmN2M0YjcwYmIzMTIzYzExMzRhMyxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610225117">DPDK</a> that bypass heavy OS abstractions for storage and networking in favor of applications directly accessing the raw hardware, and rolling whatever abstraction they do need on their own.</p></li><li><p>The entire ecosystem in which an OS exists is changing. Application-level experiences are hermetic and make the underlying OS more or less irrelevant. Just look at Android or iOS or ChromeOS. Programming to a virtual machine (like the Java VM) makes programmers much more invested in their PL/runtime than the OS.</p></li><li><p>The above two points raise an interesting question: what does a modern operating system want? Look, for example, at <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ffuchsia.dev%2Ffuchsia-src%2Freference%2Fkernel_objects%2Fobjects&amp;t=MWZlNDYwYjZhOGJjODI2NWIzZGMxNzUyNzEzY2VlY2ZiMmY1M2E5ZCxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610225117">Fuchsia</a>, which is going in the direction of a microkernel with capabilities, that pushes most drivers and OS services out to userspace. These are ideas that have been floating in academic OS research for decades, but could never gain real mainstream acceptance because of the high barrier to making a viable real-world OS. This is the effect Rob Pike was talking about in his <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdoc.cat-v.org%2Fbell_labs%2Futah2000%2F&amp;t=YTgwMzllZTU1YWI1ZmViN2U2ZDdjNDZhM2VjZGQyYjAzODBiNDIyMCxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610225117">“Systems Research is Irrelevant”</a> talk.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I made a goal for myself in January 2020 to stop using Google products by the end of the year. That might sound like way too generous a timeline, but Google owned pretty much all of my data at that point, so it was a fairly large project. Plus I'm a slow and steady kind of person. I know if I give myself a generous enough timeline I can accomplish even things that seem too hard for me at first.</p>
<h2>First, Why</h2>
<p>Since I got into programming about 5 years ago, I kept hearing all these bad things about Google and how horrible of a company it is from other tech people. It always seemed a bit exaggerated to me, but the evidence has been piling up over the years. Learning about <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-the-pentagon-build-ai-for-drones-1823464533">their involvement</a> with the US military's <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Project%20Maven%20DSD%20Memo%2020170425.pdf">Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team (Project Maven)</a> was the last straw for me <sup id="footnote-1"><a href="https://kiramclean.com/blog/what-i-use-now-instead-of-google/#footnote-1-text">1</a></sup>, but even before I learned about that I was pretty uncomfortable with a lot of what I heard. In Google's defence they eventually did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210101083904/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html">pull out of the project</a> after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231204850/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html">massive backlash by thousands of employees</a>.</p>
<p>Still, I'm pretty convinced now that their continued existence is a catastrophe not only for public safety, but also for <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/3/21030688/google-amazon-ai-oil-gas">the environment</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html">gender equity</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/9739039/Googles-tax-avoidance-is-called-capitalism-says-chairman-Eric-Schmidt.html">the economy</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgexe8/google-fired-an-engineer-who-wrote-code-telling-googlers-they-had-a-right-to-organize">fair labour practices</a>, <a href="https://www.stallman.org/google.html#surveillance">privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00954-0">journalism</a>, <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/epstein-testimony">democracy</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/3/17168256/google-racism-algorithms-technology">race relations</a>, and the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/big-tech-out-of-control-capitalism-and-the-end-of-civilization/">project of civilization itself</a>. But anyway, the point of this post isn't to motivate you to also quit Google. I'll tell you how I really feel some other time.</p>
<p>The rest of this post is about the tools and services I replaced all the Google things with. I did mostly accomplish my goal, with a few caveats which I describe in the relevant sections.</p>
<h2>Replacements</h2>
<p>Here's the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>GMail → <a href="https://protonmail.com/signup">ProtonMail</a></li>
<li>Chrome → <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox developer edition</a></li>
<li>Google search → <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></li>
<li>Google Drive → <a href="https://www.sync.com/">Sync</a> and <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a></li>
<li>Google DNS → <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/">Cloudflare DNS</a></li>
<li>Maps → Apple maps</li>
<li>YouTube → Netflix, <a href="https://www.ted.com/">TED talks</a>, conference archives, and still a little YouTube (anonymously in a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox container</a>)</li>
<li>Google Analytics → <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a></li>
<li>Everything else (calendar, reminders, photos, docs, video chat, news feeds) → <a href="https://nextcloud.com/signup/">Nextcloud</a>, running <a href="https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/">on my own instance</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the long version:</p>
<h3>GMail → <a href="https://protonmail.com/signup">ProtonMail</a></h3>
<p>ProtonMail has free accounts, but I pay for the lowest level that allows use of a custom domain with it (€48/year) so I don't have to change my email address ever again if I want to switch providers. It was quite a pain to change my email address all over the place, but I started in May and just did it slowly over time. I highly recommend decoupling your email address from your email provider if you're considering switching. First of all an email from a custom domain seems more, not less, serious than a gmail address to most people. But the main reason is just so you don't have to change your email address ever again if (when) you want to switch to some newer, better email provider.</p>
<p>I set up forwarding from my old GMail account to my new email address then filtered my mail for anything sent to the old address. If it was someone or some place I wanted to continue hearing from, I updated my email address with them. If not I unsubscribed. This turned out to be a wonderful opportunity to purge my newsletter and other email subscriptions. Also I'm happy to report most companies are now (finally) respecting unsubscribe requests. Two (looking at you Geektastic and Rakuten) continued to spam me after I requested they stop, so now I filter out all their mail as spam.</p>
<h3>Chrome → Firefox developer edition</h3>
<p>I primarily use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox developer edition</a> now for my browser, including for work. The developer tools are just as good as Chrome's for the kind of work I do.</p>
<p>There are some web apps that literally or effectively only work in Chrome, which ironically perfectly illustrates the impetus for this whole undertaking. For those I use this <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium#downloads">ungoogled Chromium</a> browser, installed via homebrew.</p>
<p>I still have Chrome installed on my computer because I need it for some work things. We use chromedriver for some integration tests and it wasn't trivially easy to trick it into using my Chromium installation instead of looking for Chrome. Replacing chromedriver is a headache, and also not my call to make at work. But it's also not really the point for me. If Google was reduced to a browser that developers can easily launch and control programmatically, I'd be satisfied. I don't use it for anything other than running automated tests at work now.</p>
<h3>Google search → <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></h3>
<p>I mostly love DuckDuckGo, but there are certain categories of searches where Google returns better results. DuckDuckGo doesn't seem to return many results from forums (like stack overflow or other stack exchange sites), which is where there the answers to a lot of my questions are, unfortunately. So I still use Google Search sometimes, but I do it in a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox container</a> without being logged in to a Google account, which at least helps to avoid some of Google's incessant stalking.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo does seem to return better results when the answer is an image, video, or regular web page, which is cool, and I suspect means it would be a perfectly fine replacement for most people. For example this blog is easier to find via DuckDuckGo than Google, which is impressive because I share a name with a small-time TV celebrity who typically dominates search results. We even look sort of similar, it's wild.</p>
<h3>Google Drive → <a href="https://www.sync.com/">Sync</a> and <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a></h3>
<p>I use Sync to make my most used files available anywhere, and I've started moving a huge backlog of documents and notes I don't need to access often but don't want to throw away to Backblaze for longer term storage, just because it's cheaper. So far I just use their web UI to upload things in bulk and browse my files, but I'm looking into ways to do that more efficiently. I really need to de-clutter my digital life. I'm a major hoarder when it comes to digital files. I have scarcely deleted a document in the last 10 years, it's getting a bit ridiculous. But that's a goal for another year 🙂. For now I'm just putting all those files I don't really need to access but don't want to throw away in Backblaze to deal with later.</p>
<p>Between Sync and Backblaze I got 15GB of free storage, which is plenty for now, though as I move more and more or my scattered files over I'll have to start paying. Backblaze offers some of the cheapest object storage there is, at least.</p>
<h3>DNS → Cloudflare DNS</h3>
<p>I used to use Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4), now I use <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/">Cloudflare's</a> (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1).</p>
<h3>Maps, YouTube</h3>
<p>These ones are harder to replace. I use Apple maps now most of the time, but I still use Waze (which was acquired by Google) for directions sometimes if I'm driving somewhere. For media I mostly watch Netflix, but I also watch a lot of <a href="https://www.ted.com/">TED talks</a>. I used to also watch conference videos on YouTube. Now I check conference websites for those, and a lot of them have the recordings, although they're often hosted on YouTube anyway. And I also do still use YouTube sometimes, mostly for home workout videos, but also anonymously in an isolated container.</p>
<h3>Analytics → <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a></h3>
<p>It's been a while since I used Google Analytics, but I wanted to set up a basic hit counter for this blog and found Fathom. They provide simple privacy-focused analytics that work well enough for me. One really useful feature they have that I consider necessary now is being able to log analytics with a custom domain. Without this, visitors using ad-blockers don't get counted, which most estimates figure is now something like 40% of people, and probably more among tech-type people, like the ones most likely to find this blog.</p>
<p>I tried Cloudflare's new server-side analytics for a month, but the data didn't make as much sense (it showed the overwhelming number of visits to my homepage, even though the other analytics I had set up showed them going to one post that did well on Hacker News, which makes way more sense). Anyway, the numbers didn't seem to add up. I guess to be fair I <a href="https://twitter.com/kiraemclean/status/1340530206516387840">don't quite understand</a> how Fathom's numbers add up yet either, but their support has been helpful checking it out with me to try to help me reach some interpretation that makes sense. Fathom's dashboard is really simple, at least, which I like because it's easy to understand.</p>
<h3>Calendar, reminders, photos, docs, video chat, news feeds → <a href="https://nextcloud.com/signup/">Nextcloud</a></h3>
<p>For everything else I use Nextcloud now. I <a href="https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/">run my own instance</a> of it, but there are lots of providers where you can just sign up for a simple account like anything else if you're not an insufferable nerd who enjoys maintaining servers, like me.</p>
<p>This is where I have another caveat to mention. I haven't migrated all of my photos off of Google Photos yet because I have about 50,000 of them and it's just a really slow process. I estimated it would take me something like 70 hours to move them all manually, so I'm looking into better ways to do it. I'm confident I can find or maybe build something easier than manually downloading and uploading 50k files in less than 70 hours.</p>
<p>Nextcloud does the job of automatically syncing photos from my phone, though, which is all I needed to be able to delete Google Photos from my devices. I'm not sure I'll actually stick with Nextcloud for photos in the long run. The gallery is a bit lacking. It looks like <a href="https://piwigo.org/get-piwigo">Piwigo</a> might be a good alternative. Either way, I'm actually storing my photos in Backblaze, so I'll continue looking around for a different client for a bucket full of photos next year as I work on slowly culling my photos collection and migrating it to a new home.</p>
<h2>Total Cost</h2>
<p>I feel like I've won a lot by doing all this. I own my data now, so Google can't <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-users-locked-out-after-years-2020-10">arbitrarily take it away from me</a>, which gives me peace of mind. I'm no longer part of their ad ecosystem, being tracked all around the internet and having my attention sold to the highest bidder. And I also feel good about "voting with my feet", so to speak. The fewer people use Google's free products, the lower their ability to sustain their unethical business model based on selling mass surveillance data.</p>
<p>But I also lost some. Specifically a few …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="http://www.ajasinger.com/"><i><span>Aja Singer</span></i></a><i><span> is the former founding Creative Director at </span></i><a href="https://www.ofmercer.com/"><i><span>Of Mercer</span></i></a><i><span>, where she </span></i><i><span>helped grow the brand from its initial concept into a multi-million dollar company. Prior to that, she </span></i><i><span>was a cofounder of womenswear brand Alex &amp; Eli, responsible for brand strategy and visual identity. She currently runs a branding-focused newsletter, </span></i><a href="https://ajasinger.substack.com/people/6528929-aja-singer"><i><span>For the Love</span></i></a><i><span>, and helps companies with creative and brand strategy. To chat with Aja about your branding needs, </span></i><a href="https://calendly.com/ajasinger/30min"><i><span>book time with her here</span></i></a><i><span>.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p><b>You’ve been the creative force behind two early-stage womenswear brands - what did you get right and wrong with each?</b></p>
<p><span>With my first brand, Alex &amp; Eli, I really pushed myself from a creative and business perspective -- trying out new things and experimenting to see what worked and what didn’t. I’ve tried to carry that attitude through to all of my startups. The mistake I made was listening to advice from too many people.</span><span> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Just because someone has extensive industry experience does not mean they know what’s right for your business.&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>With Of Mercer, I really prioritized getting to know our customers and having an ongoing dialogue with them through emails, surveys, phone calls, and even in-person consultations. This gave me huge insights into their lifestyles so I could better serve their needs. I’d recommend this to every founder, even before they have a product to sell.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What does a good startup branding plan look like?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Branding encompasses so much more than just a font or color; it’s the soul of a brand. First, you need to understand what the brand stands for, it’s value proposition, who it’s serving, and how you want your customers to feel when interacting with it. The visuals and messaging are a reflection of those ideas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To get started, I recommend going through a few branding exercises with the whole team. A brand expert can take you through them, but if you’re looking to nail down your brand before you’re able to partner with one, it’s ok to work through them on your own. Start by defining your perception of your brand, your customer, and what your brand stands for.&nbsp; A great way to do this is to give everyone post-it notes (which you can also do virtually with a tool like Figma) and have them write down words they associate with each category. This allows you to quickly see where thinking is aligned and where you need more clarification. By narrowing these words down to three per category, as a group, you’ll have a good initial understanding of your brand and customer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I work with clients, I’ll walk them through this series of exercises. Once the core identity of the brand is defined, I take a similarly collaborative approach to developing the visuals. We’ll discuss what colors, fonts, and aesthetics team members are drawn to, other brands they like, and brands they don’t, and talk through a number of other visual cues until we’ve all agreed what form the brand should take. I’ll then create a few options to discuss, experiment with (to make sure they fulfil all the needs of that particular brand), and fine-tune, until we’ve defined the visual identity.</span></p>

<p><b>When should startups decide on their branding?</b></p>
<p><span>All the branding elements should be fleshed out very early in a startup’s lifecycle -- a thorough understanding of them will inform every aspect of your business. As for the brand’s visual identity and voice, having this clearly defined and articulated shows potential customers what you offer and what you stand for, which is especially beneficial for direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands. As a DTC startup, branding is the only way to convey your message and value proposition to customers, so it’s crucial to have that fully realized from launch.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What should go into that decision process?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>I usually start with the series of exercises mentioned above. From there, it’s an ongoing dialogue and refinement process, getting to the core of what a brand looks and sounds like based on those defined core tenets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>For an early-stage startup, when things are changing quickly, it’s best to revisit your brand identity (especially the voice and messaging) every six months or so to make sure it’s aligned with your business goals and trajectory. As for an entire re-brand, you should consider it when hitting other milestones, such as a high-impact sales target, or a new round of funding. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>This generally means your business has had meaningful growth, and your brand identity should evolve along with it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What tools do you use with or recommend for your clients?</b></p>
<p><span>If you’re just starting out, a shared Pinterest board is honestly a great tool for collecting inspiration. Once you’ve honed in on a few themes, you can collect them in </span><a href="https://www.figma.com/"><span>Figma</span></a><span> (which is fantastic because it’s collaborative) to further define the vision. And if you’re looking to translate your ideas into a logo, Upwork has some cost-effective graphic designers. However, if you aren’t working with a branding expert yet, make sure you’ve clearly defined your brand so that any freelancer you work with thoroughly understands your brand’s identity.</span></p>

<p><b>Has your creative process changed now that meetings are mostly remote?</b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My workflow has not changed that much (although I do miss in-person meetings). What </span><i><span>has</span></i><span> changed is that I used to gather inspiration from all the cultural activities available in NY, so I spend a lot more time exploring online now. I miss the serendipity of wandering around New York -- seeing new things and meeting new people with new ideas, but there is still so much available online. Social media is a fantastic resource (I check both Instagram and Twitter regularly), and I subscribe to a number of mailing lists and newsletters for the purpose of discovery. I love </span><a href="https://www.sightunseen.com/subscribe/"><span>Sight Unseen</span></a><span> (for all things design), </span><a href="https://thingtesting.com/"><span>Thingtesting</span></a><span> (for new brands), </span><a href="https://www.typewolf.com/"><span>Typewolf</span></a><span> (for font inspiration), to name a few.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What inspired you to start </b><a href="https://ajasinger.substack.com/people/6528929-aja-singer"><b>your newsletter</b></a><b> and how did you get your first subscribers?</b></p>
<p><span>Truthfully, I wanted to get some practice writing regularly! Also, during my time as a founder and while in the e-commerce space, I had thought a lot about startups, branding, and consumer trends but hadn’t had the opportunity to share that knowledge. A newsletter seemed like a great way to do that. The first few issues went out to around 100 subscribers. I told everyone I knew that I was starting a newsletter and it just grew organically from there, with people sharing with friends and on social media. Writing the articles is definitely a lot of work, but I really enjoy diving into topics that I’ve either thought a lot about, or am curious about. Knowing that founders and marketing and brand professionals find it helpful makes it all the more rewarding.</span></p>

<p><b>Which companies do you think are getting branding and messaging right?</b></p>
<p><span>Apple and Nike are incredible examples of brands that have a clear, concise brand vision that’s consistent, yet effectively adapted to every brand touchpoint. As for startups, I think </span><a href="https://patternbrands.com/"><span>Pattern Brands</span></a><span> has done a fantastic job at taking a belief system (enjoying daily life) and building a family of brands around it. And I love </span><a href="https://starface.world/"><span>Starface’s</span></a><span> brand and incorporation of their mascot, Big Yellow -- it’s bringing a fun, welcoming and judgment-free attitude to the skincare space.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What have you been reading lately?</b></p>
<p><span>I read the New York Times and New York Magazine religiously, and I just started reading two books — </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536299"><span>The Vanishing Half</span></a><span> by Brit Bennett and </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299"><span>Atomic Habits</span></a><span> by James Clear.</span></p>

<p><b>What’s a great piece of advice you've received?</b></p>
<p><span>Don’t overthink it. (Although I usually still do!)</span></p>

<p><b>How do you unwind these days?</b></p>
<p><span>Yoga (especially </span><a href="https://www.skyting.com/"><span>Sky Ting</span></a><span>!), going for walks with my husband, and reading. Hopefully I’ll be adding travel back to that list sometime in the future!</span></p>

<p>The goal for this project is to design, 3D-print and assemble the enclosures for several small desktop computers. This series was created during the covid19 pandemic, to get familiar with modern parametric 3D design tools, the limits of 3D printing and fabrication. </p>



<p>A screen size is chosen first, together with the desired components, and then an enclosure is designed around all the constrains (including FDM 3D printing limitations). </p>



<p>All of these have been designed in Autodesk Fusion360 and printed at home on an inexpensive Creality Ender 3.</p>







<h2>4:3 10″ LCD Terminal</h2>



<p>Designed around a 10″ 1024 x 768 IPS LCD. Raspberry PI 4, Ducky One SF Keyboard, black PLA.</p>















<h2>16:9 5″ LCD Terminal</h2>



<p>Designed around a 5″ 800 x 480 LCD. Raspberry Pi 3, Official Raspberry Pi keyboard, black PLA. </p>















<h2>16:9 5″ LCD Terminal v2</h2>



<p>Revised for a more modern look and a smaller footprint. It runs a Raspberry Pi 4, printed on orange PLA. Wireless USB keyboard from ali-express.</p>















<h2>UltraWide 8.8″ LCD Terminal</h2>



<p>Designed around an ultrawide 8.8″ 1920 x 480 LCD, with a rather exotic 4:1 aspect ratio. As this exceeds my 3D printer bed size, I had to figure out a way to split the design in two parts, and how to assemble them effectively. This one is powered by an Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB, allowing it to run OpenGL natively. Ducky One2 SF keyboard. Printed on “copper” PLA.</p>















<h2>Minimal 4:3 8″ Terminal</h2>



<p>1024 x 768 8″ IPS LCD. Designed with the goal of the smallest possible footprint, leaving components out in plain sight. Raspberry pi 4, official Raspberry Pi Keyboard. Printed on neon yellow transparent PLA.</p>















<h2>Other Concepts</h2>



<p>Some rejects I produced along the way…</p>







<p>Retro TV</p>







<p> Macintosh Classic inspired design</p>

                    <p>Lets get one thing out of the way, declaring dependencies like this:</p><pre><code>implementation 'org.apache.tapestry:commons:5.5.0'
</code></pre><p>is waaaaay better than declaring them like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tapestry&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;commons&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;5.5.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre><p>This is where the positives for Gradle end.</p><p>First off, you cannot <em>not</em> learn Maven. The entire Java world is built using Maven conventions. Every artifact published on Maven Central has a maven <code>pom.xml</code> file. So using Gradle means you learn both Maven and Gradle.</p><p>Learning Gradle also means that you have to understand Groovy at some level, to understand how your build script is being composed. But Gradle adds it own DSL to the mix making it impossible to decipher what Groovy language constructs are being used for a particular line in a Gradle script. &nbsp;For example, one can't just define a global variable and use it in the script. Instead it has to be in an <code>ext</code> block.</p><h3 id="we-don-t-need-the-advanced-features">We don't need the advanced features</h3><p>Astradot's Java projects are small microservices. All we need from a build tool is to download dependencies, compile, jar and run a few basic tests. All the advanced, mindbending, quantum-entangling caching features that Gradle has are simply not needed.</p><p>Maven is old and robust. All editors understand it. Intellij's support for it is flawless. The XML while verbose is easily understood.</p><h3 id="there-is-an-exception-though-">There is an exception though...</h3><p>Wait, there actually <em>is</em> a place we use Gradle. That is for our Java Tracing Agent. The requirements for putting together the agent are not like your typical Java jar. Neither Maven nor Gradle could build it out of the box. Our initial thinking was to write a custom build tool for it. However, this is where we found that Gradle absolutely shines. Doing a completely custom build, where you are taking full advantage of the dynamism of having groovy as a full-fledged programming language as opposed to just a declaration format made Gradle the perfect tool for the job.</p><h3 id="that-said">That said</h3><p>For everything else, we saw no reason to choose Gradle over Maven. We do miss those single-line dependency declarations though.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> is software that facilitates remote meetings and collaboration. Its popularity soared in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also been the focus of increased privacy and security concerns.</p><p>Some of these concerns are valid and have been addressed by the company. Other concerns are unfounded or exaggerated.</p><p>Whether you like Zoom or not, you can use technology from the 1950s (old rotary dial telephones) to participate in Zoom meetings without compromising security.</p><p>This short write-up will demonstrate how to do that.</p><h2 id="what-you-need">What you need</h2><ol><li>An old rotary dial telephone. I use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_500_telephone">Western Electric Model 500</a> (1950).</li><li>A modern cell phone. Android or iPhone.</li><li>A DTMF app installed on your cell phone. I use <a href="http://www.wolphi.com/ham-radio-apps/dtmf/">this Android app</a>.</li></ol><h2 id="steps">Steps</h2><ol><li>Dial into the Zoom Meeting using the rotary dial telephone.</li><li>When asked to enter the meeting ID, use the DTMF app on your cell phone to playback the meeting ID number.</li></ol><p>For best results, store the meeting ID number in a macro before the meeting (so you can play it back quickly) and hold your cell phone close to the rotary phone receiver with the volume turned up.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>No matter how you feel about Zoom, the company should be applauded for providing so many connection options. Otherwise, this method would not be possible.</p><p>Old rotary phones are very simple, well-understood and secure. They have few moving parts, no Internet connection, no personal information and run no software.</p><p>If you have security or privacy concerns about using Zoom, please try this approach. I hope it helps.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/zoom">zoom</a></li><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/phones">phones</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>
