                <p>In <a href="https://theirtimeline.com/1-million-sales-in-1-year-a-chronological-study-of-jack-butchers-visualize-value-part-1-the-unsung-era/">part 1</a>, we documented how Visualize Value was created as an attempt to productize the whole system of allowing businesses to better market themselves to customers. It was not a smooth sailing journey- there was no clear product until 11 months in.</p><p>In part 2, we will focus on the growth of VV's first digital product- Daily Manifest. </p><p>We will learn how Jack:</p><ol><li>more than tripled the price of his product... and continued having incredible sales,</li><li>created a community that was attuned to his creative process and eager to learn from him, and</li><li>introduced synergy among his offerings so that each offering helped to drive the sales of others.</li></ol><p>Let's dive in.</p><h2 id="recap">Recap</h2><p>Here are some stats from Visualize Value around the point of Daily Manifest launch (December 16 2019):</p><p>🗓 November 24 2019: Around 270 likes for a Tweet. While this is a major improvement over the initial tweets, there is nothing to suggest that Visualize Value will grow exponentially to its current scale of having a few thousand likes on each tweet.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Value.” <a href="https://t.co/dTYp5oqeU4">pic.twitter.com/dTYp5oqeU4</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1198295935580884992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>It is also hard to trace the exact factors that allowed Visualize Value to gain more exposure. A possible answer, aside from the natural compounding of his content, is that Jack has been going onto other platforms to talk about Visualize Value. An example is <a href="https://www.mavenadviser.com/podcast5/jack-butcher">the interview that he did with Maven Adviser</a>, released on November 28 2019.</p><p>At this point in time, Jack probably felt comfortable enough with the quantity and quality of Visualize Value's graphics that he decided it's time to gain more exposure via guesting on other platforms.</p><p>The key lesson here (discussed in <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/173-dru-riley-of-trends-vc">Courtland Allen's interview with Dru Riley</a>):</p><ul><li>Instead of rushing for the launch (or putting our product in front of as many people as possible), it is wiser to instead put it in front of a small audience and iterate until we find a product that works. If we refer to the first tweet above, we can already see the distinctive Visualize Value design in it. Contrast this with the account's initial tweets, which had different design elements.</li></ul><h2 id="rise">Rise</h2><p>🗓 February 17 2020: 15,000 VV followers on Twitter. It took about 13 months for Jack to accumulate this audience size. Again, one of the key principles of Jack's success is leveraging on existing audiences of other individuals and adding value to those individuals. How can you do something similar for your product?</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1229149748424331266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 February 25 2020: 1,000th order for Visualize Value's Daily Manifest. This is inline with the rough approximation that less than 10% of your audience will be active product buyers. For VV's case, it was around 3%.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just hit our 1,000th order. Thank you.</p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1232137721998692353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>🗓 March 6 2020: Build a community. Now that Jack has created a sufficient audience size on Twitter, the next step is to create an environment for your audience to interact more closely with each other and you. This community can also provide closer feedback on what they hope to get from you, and you can create products that satisfies their need.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1235688840830033924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 March 10 2020: $15.5k in revenue that took 14 months to grow. The first 11 months were spent iterating. Jack's ability to create bite-sized visuals (3 to 4 posts a day) allowed him to go through a huge number of iterations, thus speeding up the networking and audience building process.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It has taken me about 14 months to grow <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@visualizevalue</a> from $0 a month to $6k~ a month.</p><p>All while running an agency that is significantly more profitable, but significantly less specific, and all service based.</p><p>The product game is harder, but more satisfying. <a href="https://t.co/zepfk4Ix31">pic.twitter.com/zepfk4Ix31</a></p></div>— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1237219734233505792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>🗓 March 13 2020: Expanding on the community aspect, Jack launches his first office hours. You want to iterate a new product/service among a smaller (and ideally your close) audience, before launching it to the general public. Office hours also help to create a stronger bond among his community as it is a real-time event.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1238306163843903488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 March 30 2020: $5k sales in 24 hours. The trick? A substantial price increase + limited time is always an amazing combination to drive sales. This is a strategy often used- selling at a cheaper price initially to validate market + collect testimonials, then raising the price.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1244308058869772288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Transparency time:</p><p>Results from a pre-price raise promotion:</p><p>$5k in 24 hours from a $19 product. </p><p>Thanks to all new members.</p><p>Now $57. Until it isn’t.</p><p>I’ll be breaking this all down in more detail in the VV community. </p><p>Hop in here: <a href="https://t.co/Zepgmxfnke">https://t.co/Zepgmxfnke</a> <a href="https://t.co/O1xay3CkOl">pic.twitter.com/O1xay3CkOl</a></p></div>— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1244475521292959747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 April 16 2020: The Daily Manifest made over $10k in sales. This ridiculous amount of sales of a one-page pdf is not driven by the sole prospect of daily planning; rather, the audience is also enticed by the prospect of joining a community that can teach them how to communicate better and earn more.</p><p>Jack's genius is in integrating different products and services so that there is synergy among them. What is a simple product of yours that you can add value to by integrating it with other services?</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1250618935415910400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Do surgeries work? Most of us assume they do, but is there any scientific evidence that they do?</p>

<p>In this episode, I talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/drianharris">Dr Ian Harris</a> who is a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Australia. He is a practicing orthopedic surgeon specializing in trauma surgery. Outside his practice, his research interests broadly cover the topic of surgical effectiveness and clinical research.</p>

<h3>Dive into Dr Ian Harris’ research</h3>

<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28592661-surgery-the-ultimate-placebo">Book</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g3253">Relevant paper</a> backing the claim that most surgeries are ineffective</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes and key insights</h3>

<p>1/ <strong>What is a placebo surgery?</strong> It’s where you make an incision but not do anything. </p>

<p>It’s analogous to traditional placebo in medicine, where a sugar or salt pill is given instead of an active chemical to see whether the intended medicine has an actual impact.</p>

<p>2/ <strong>Majority of surgeries that Dr Ian Harris and other researchers have studied in fact are not more effective than placebos</strong>. This is shocking because even when we have no proof that they work, many of these surgeries are happening even today.</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Examples of such ineffective surgeries include back pain surgeries and knee pain surgeries.</strong> For such surgeries, randomized control trials have found that if you make an incision in the knee but don’t do anything, it’s as effective as actually conducting the surgery of the knee.</p>

<p>4/ Why do patients get better if the surgery doesn’t work? It’s because<strong> many diseases or pain have a natural progression</strong>, and we generally seek surgical/medicinal intervention when we’re in the worst condition. If the body heals / condition becomes better after that, we attribute improvement to the intervention rather than thinking it could have happened anyway (due to the natural course of the condition).</p>

<p>5/ As Dr Ian Harris said, the unsaid attitude could be stated like: “<strong>you have to operate on patients quickly before they get better</strong>“.</p>

<p>Remember: in many cases, if you get sick, you get better after that. And that is why placebos seem to work.</p>

<p>6/ It’s shocking to hear that randomized controlled trials (RCT) for many surgical interventions end up finding that they’re ineffective.</p>

<p>But what’s most shocking is that <strong>many other interventions have never been subjected to an RCT against a placebo</strong>. For many of the common procedures traditionally practiced, we don’t know whether they work at all or not.</p>

<p>7/ For sure, there are many studies that study variations of surgical methods. That is, they try to find out whether an incision from the left is better or from the right. </p>

<p>But very few studies try to find out whether the incision does anything at all for the patient. Shocking, but that’s the truth.</p>

<p>8/ In that sense, <strong>surgery is different than medicine</strong>. All new pharmaceutical molecules are subjected to rigorous clinical trials where they’re tested against placebo or doing nothing. In many countries, there’s no such procedure for surgical treatments. If there is a procedure for new surgical procedures, nobody is testing old ones that have been getting performed every day without evidence.</p>

<p>8/ If research indicates many of the currently practiced surgeries don’t work, why are they still practiced?</p>

<p>Well, <strong>if your salary depends on not believing something, you won’t believe it.</strong></p>

<p>9/ And such <strong>denial is not new</strong>. The most common surgical procedure in history was bloodletting. This practice which lasted for thousands of years was only questioned in mid 19th century, and even after randomized trials showed that it hurt the patient, it wasn’t abandoned suddenly. It died a slow death as its practitioners started dying. </p>

<p>10/ Even today, the fact that practices like Homeopathy survive suggests that <strong>seeking evidence of what works isn’t a big priority for society</strong>. Perhaps keeping traditions is a bigger priority.</p>

<p>11/ But because it’s costly and risky to perform surgeries, the urgent question is: <strong>what surgical procedures are today’s equivalent of bloodletting</strong>? And those that we know are bloodletting, how do we get rid of them as a society?</p>

<p>12/ As a patient, what should you do? Dr Ian Harris recommends that every time your doctor recommends a medical procedure, <strong>ALWAYS ask for risks and benefits</strong>. </p>

<p>Risks are a given and doctors generally are happy to talk about them. But nobody asks for benefits because they’re assumed to be there. </p>

<p>Ask and confirm about benefits explicitly.</p>

<p>13/ What if the pain isn’t going away at all? Should you then get surgery?</p>

<p>Golden advice by Dr Ian -&gt;  “<strong>the severity of your symptoms does not change the effectiveness of the operation</strong>“</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last weekend, I played in the Women Unite Over CTF, hosted by <a href="https://www.womenhackerz.com/">WomenHackerz</a> and several other organizations.&nbsp; There was a fantastic turnout, with 1,000 women playing!&nbsp; For many of the participants, it was their first time playing a CTF.</p><p>After the event was over, there was some discussion on what to do if you wanted to play more CTFs, if you got stumped a lot, etc.&nbsp; This is intended to be <strong>a guide for beginners who have just started playing CTFs</strong> (or for people who have never played, but would like to).</p><p>It certainly isn’t the only CTF resource out there, but I find that a lot of the resources are either big information dumps (hard to pick through as a beginner) or links without context or guidance on how to improve.&nbsp; This post seeks to change that.&nbsp; : )</p><h2 id="what-is-a-ctf">What is a CTF?</h2><p>CTF stands for “<strong>capture the flag</strong>.”&nbsp; It’s a hacking competition where the challenges (or a hacking environment, or both) are set up for you to hack.&nbsp; Once you successfully solve a challenge or hack something, you get a “flag”, which is a specially formatted piece of text.&nbsp; You can then submit that flag for points… the player or team with the most points wins!</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPcqmx1mpCOJJp6/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>Each challenge is usually oriented around a single concept.&nbsp; By solving challenges, you (hopefully!) learn about a new concept, vulnerability, tool, class of attack, etc.</p><h3 id="ctf-styles">CTF Styles</h3><p>Most CTFs are “<strong>jeopardy style</strong>", meaning that there are a handful of categories, and each of the (typically standalone) challenges falls in to one of those categories.</p><p>The categories vary from CTF to CTF, but typically include:</p><ul><li><strong>RE (reverse engineering)</strong>:&nbsp; get a binary and reverse engineer it to find a flag</li><li><strong>Pwn</strong>:&nbsp; get a binary and a link to a program running on a remote server.&nbsp; Cause a buffer overflow, etc. to bypass normal functionality and get the program to read the flag to you.</li><li><strong>Crypto</strong>:&nbsp; crypto means cryptography!&nbsp; Get an encrypted flag and figure out how to decrypt it (includes both classical and modern ciphers)</li><li><strong>Web</strong>:&nbsp; web-based challenges where you are directed to a website, and you have to find and exploit a vulnerability (SQL injection, XSS, etc.) to get a flag.</li><li><strong>Forensics/Stego</strong>:&nbsp; given a PCAP file, image, audio or other file, find a hidden message and get the flag.</li><li><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; this is a bit of a grab bag.&nbsp; Includes random puzzles, electronics-based things, OSINT, anything that doesn’t fit into the other categories.</li></ul><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/1vZaAcldbX8Xh6lMlV/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>Jeopardy isn’t the only style.&nbsp; There are a few <strong>attack/defense CTFs</strong>, where you are given control of a server that you must protect from other players, while also attacking other servers.&nbsp; These are fairly rare (and pretty difficult to set up, I imagine).</p><p>There are also CTFs that emulate <strong>pen testing</strong>, where you are given a target VM (“box”) to hack into, and escalate your privileges until you are a root user.&nbsp; These are also fairly rare but a lot of fun.&nbsp; Check out <strong>Metasploitable</strong> in late November (<a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2018/11/05/announcing-the-2018-metasploit-community-ctf/">here is the announcement from 2018</a>), or <strong><a href="https://hackthebox.eu/">Hack The Box</a></strong> year-round.</p><h2 id="logistics-and-how-to-find-ctfs">Logistics and How to Find CTFs</h2><h3 id="wait-before-you-go-any-further">Wait!&nbsp; Before you go any further</h3><p>It’s definitely more fun to play with friends, or even internet strangers.&nbsp; Playing with other people means that you can get each other unstuck, and you can also support each other when you make progress, get a new tool working, or find a flag… or when you don’t.&nbsp; Especially when you’re new, CTFs can feel like repeatedly banging your head against the wall (there’s so much to learn in this field!).&nbsp; Having others to play alongside can definitely help lift that emotional burden when things aren’t going well, and give you people to celebrate with when you make a breakthrough.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/haBeggedmenEA/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>You might think, “who am I going to convince to play CTFs” with me?&nbsp; &nbsp;There are many online groups that are open to beginners.&nbsp; A short list includes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://opentoallctf.github.io/">OpenToAll</a></li><li><a href="https://www.womenhackerz.com/">Women Hackers</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1068173165610831872">CTF Circle</a></li></ul><p>You can try Slack/Discord for local security meet-up groups to see if there’s any interest in teaming up.&nbsp; Same goes for university groups, if you’re a student.&nbsp; Finally, you can also check Slack or Discord for a given CTF, as often there are other people looking for teammates.</p><p>Even if your first response to this idea is “oh hell no”, give it try, at least once.&nbsp; : )</p><h3 id="where-to-find-ctfs">Where to find CTFs</h3><p>There are <strong>in-person CTFs</strong> (especially if you live on the east or west coast in the US) throughout the year, plus many at <strong>conferences</strong>.</p><p>But there are also plenty of <strong>online CTFs</strong>, which is what I mostly play.&nbsp; They typically happen on weekends, and run for 1-3 days, although some go for a week or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;To find them, check out <a href="https://ctftime.org/"><strong>CTFTime</strong></a> and click on “Upcoming”.&nbsp; This is continually updated (and sometimes at the last minute).&nbsp; Also keep an eye out on Twitter.</p><p>A few CTFs and CTF platforms are <strong>available online, year round</strong>.&nbsp; See the bottom of this post (“Bonus Round!") for more.</p><h2 id="and-now-for-the-resource-list">And now for the resource list!</h2><p>There’s really no substitute for actually doing CTF challenges, even if you only make a little bit of progress.&nbsp; This resource list has a few goals:</p><ul><li>Equip you with enough tools and knowledge to get started on a CTF challenge in a given category</li><li>Point you towards additional resources if you want to build up your skills outside of time-limited CTF events, and alert you to any category-specific sites or platforms</li><li>Give you a basic list of things to try if you have no idea where to start with a challenge</li></ul><p>There’s a LOT to learn.&nbsp; If you’re new, I recommend that you <strong>find a few beginner CTFs that are “jeopardy” style, and try a few challenges from each category and see what you enjoy doing</strong>.&nbsp; If you like doing one category, that’s great!&nbsp; It’s also great if you like to do a bit of everything.&nbsp; My top recommendation for a “jeopardy”-style beginner CTF is <strong><a href="https://picoctf.com/">PicoCTF</a></strong>, but there are more options in the “Bonus Round!” section at the bottom of this post.</p><p>This guide is by no means comprehensive.&nbsp; I know there are a ton of sites and resources out there.&nbsp; I wanted to share my top picks for each category, with options for different learning styles.</p><h2 id="re">RE</h2><p>Reverse engineering (RE), involves taking a binary and, well, reverse engineering it to determine its functionality (and find a flag).</p><p>In industry, RE skills are used for vulnerability research.&nbsp; You might be given a software program and asked to find vulnerabilities (without having source code).&nbsp; Similarly, malware research involves a lot of reverse engineering.&nbsp; In my view, it’s a bit more niche than its inclusion in CTFs would lead you to believe, but still a challenging/fun category.</p><p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/4UzW8S83pWoKs/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><h3 id="resources-to-get-started">Resources to get started</h3><p>It can be pretty daunting to get started in reverse engineering, especially if you have little or no experience in low-level programming languages like assembly.&nbsp; As you get started, try to find something in the code to orient yourself… a call to a standard library function (read, scanf, printf, etc.), comments, strings, etc.&nbsp; Then keep expanding and iterating from there.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Learning by doing</strong>:&nbsp; My top recommendation is <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong>.&nbsp; It’s a game where you try to reverse engineer (fictitious) bluetooth locks of increasing difficulty.&nbsp; It’s all in-browser (which means no tool setup), and has a tutorial level that introduces you some of the assembly and environment.&nbsp; I have <a href="https://jaimelightfoot.com/blog/category/microcorruption/">write-ups for each level</a> if you get stuck.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning by reading</strong>:&nbsp; I’m going to double dip between this section and Pwn.&nbsp; I’d suggest <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441">Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</a></strong> and then <strong><a href="https://practicalbinaryanalysis.com/">Practical Binary Analysis</a></strong>.&nbsp; Hacking: The Art of Exploitation takes you from a very basic level through C, assembly, program memory, exploits, and much more.&nbsp; It’s incredibly thorough and definitely worth a read</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning by watching</strong>:&nbsp; Live Overflow has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN"><strong>series on binary exploitation</strong></a>.&nbsp; Check out the playlist of videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN">here</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="re-focused-ctfs">RE-focused CTFs:</h3><p>I’m going to suggest <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong> one more time.&nbsp; : )&nbsp; There’s also FireEye’s yearly <strong><a href="http://flare-on.com/">Flare-On</a></strong> challenge, which will probably kick your ass (it always kicks mine) but it’s worth a try.</p><p>You can also find plenty of RE challenges in jeopardy-style events, both year-round and regular/short-term CTFs.</p><h3 id="tools-and-other-resources">Tools and other resources</h3><p>You will definitely need special tools to do RE challenges.&nbsp; There are lots of tools to choose from, as well as different categories of tools (disassembler, decompiler, debugger, etc.).&nbsp; In addition to having varying functionality, different tools are needed for different file types.</p><p>If you are a total beginner, I’ll once again recommend <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong>.&nbsp; A lot of the tools listed below can be difficult to set up, and in the interest of removing barriers to entry, I’m suggesting Microcorruption as an introduction to RE, because you don’t have to install anything to get started.</p><p>Eventually though, you’ll want to install and get familiar with different tools:</p><ul><li>My favorite is <strong><a href="https://binary.ninja/">Binary Ninja</a></strong> and have done some previous write-ups using it.&nbsp; I like the UI/UX and the available features.&nbsp; The only downside is that you need a license (I got mine originally through a BSides RE workshop, otherwise it’s $149).</li><li>There are plenty of free options as well.&nbsp; My second choice is <strong><a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a></strong>, which is free and fairly beginner friendly.&nbsp; There’s also <strong><a href="https://www.radare.org/r/">Radare</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.ollydbg.de/">Ollydb</a></strong>, <strong>gdb</strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml">IDAPro</a></strong>, <strong>Objdump</strong> and many more.</li></ul><p>Similar to “try a bunch of categories and see what you prefer”, I recommend trying a bunch of tools and see what you prefer.&nbsp; I realize that installing a bunch of tools can be a gigantic pain in the ass, so here are a couple VM options that get you a bunch of pre-installed tools:</p><ul><li><strong>FireEye</strong> provides a VM image as part of their Flare-On competition (<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/07/flare-vm-the-windows-malware.html">see this link for more info</a>) that includes many pre-installed RE tools.</li><li>You can also install a <strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali</a> VM</strong>, which comes pre-installed with various tools as well.</li></ul><p>As for more resources, <strong>OpenToAll</strong> has a <a href="https://github.com/OpenToAllCTF/REsources">fantastic list of RE Resources here</a>.&nbsp; This includes some foundational knowledge like C, x86 assembly, and more.</p><p>There’s also this free <strong><a href="https://www.begin.re/">beginner RE workshop</a></strong> that uses IDA.</p><p><strong>If you have no idea where to start with an RE challenge</strong>:&nbsp;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Let’s say my goal this year is to get to 10k monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>

<p>MRR first, everything else second. I would ruthlessly cut out all activities that don’t lead to a measurable MRR increase. For example, I would stop writing blog posts like the one you’re currently reading. I certainly wouldn’t create fun projects like What to Tweet or take the time for non-transactional Zoom calls.</p>

<p>I would focus on my revenue generating projects, crank up the advertising machinery and do everything I can think of that potentially increases my MRR.
I’m fairly confident that I would reach 10k MRR by the end of the year. But at what price?</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back for a second.</p>

<p>You know who manages by metrics? Big companies like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>And what do they have in common?</p>

<p>Their core product got notably worse over time.</p>

<p>Google’s search results are dominated by ads and many users now use workarounds to find what they’re looking for (“Best headphone reddit”). LinkedIn looks like Minesweeper. Facebook was a fun place to meet friends. And if you search for an electronics product on Amazon, you immediately feel like you’re at a flea market in the middle of Shenzhen.
This is the result of hundreds of decisions that were motivated by a short-term focus on specific metrics like revenue and click rates. And while these decisions most likely optimized the metrics, they made the user experience worse.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t have the technology to measure the right thing. Or maybe the “right thing” is inherently immeasurable.</p>

<p>Or, and that’s my personal favorite, we’re dealing with a Schrödinger’s cat like situation. The “right thing” is only the right thing as long as we’re not trying to optimize it.
This is known as Goodhart’s law. “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.“</p>

<p>Let’s consider another example.</p>

<p>Who else manages by metrics? Politicians!</p>

<p>Instead of some boring historic example (there are plenty, just read “Seeing like a State”), I’m going to spice things up by talking about something that’s happening right now.
It’s not hard to anticipate what I want to talk about since there’s precisely one thing that’s currently happening: Covid-19.</p>

<p>Politicians try to manage the situation by focusing on metrics like the “R number”. At least here in Germany the motto is: let’s lower the R number at all costs.
Turns out the cost of this strategy is incredibly high. It’s just not immediately measurable.</p>

<p>For example, everyone’s getting fatter since all gyms and sport clubs are closed. Most people are developing unhealthy eating habits because there’s simply nothing else to do. Social connections are rapidly degregating even though everyone knows how important they’re for the human wellbeing.</p>

<p>I’m not a doctor and don’t play one on the internet, but I can easily imagine that there are lots of further unintended consequences of the current lockdown policy. For example, since most people now spend most of their time indoors alone and wear masks when they leave their homes, their immune system isn’t stressed regularly like it usual is. Hence I wouldn’t be surprised if many people will get sick of other diseases once the lockdown ends as a result of weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I’m all for taking Covid seriously. In fact, I’ve been hoarding masks since 2009. I spent the summer of 2009 with a bunch of friends in Lloret de Mar (a party hotspot in Spain) just when news of the swine flu started to emerge. Long story short, everyone in our group got sick (20+ people) except for my girlfriend and me because we’ve been wearing masks.
Now the most famous example how focusing on metrics can have unhealthy consequences is the cobra effect. I’ll just quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The term cobra effect originated in an anecdote that describes an occurrence during India under British rule. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi. The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one more example I always have to talk about when the topic comes up: academia.</p>

<p>Stagnation apologists love to argue that the lack of progress in science is simply a result of the fact that all low-hanging fruit are gone.</p>

<p>That’s complete nonsense. There’s still plenty of low-hanging fruit. It’s just that everyone is so busy chasing meaningless metrics that they can’t see them.</p>

<p>In academia the metric of choice usually has something to do with the number of citations. But just like Google’s backlink-driven algorithm (which was in fact inspired by academia’s citation metrics) was quickly gamed by savvy webmasters, academia’s algorithm is gamed by careerists.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about some tiny minority here. If you want to survive in academia, you have to play the citation game. And if everyone is cheating, at the very least you have to do the same to stand a chance.</p>

<p>You have to partner up with others because five people can write five times as many papers. You agree to constantly cite each other. Likewise, you focus on incremental additions to established ideas because that’s the safest way to new publications regularly. You work on the stuff everyone else is working on because how else are you going to get citations?</p>

<p>And one thing you absolutely have to avoid like the plague is the risky and deep kind of research that leads to real progress in the field.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that citations are a bad metric, and we need to come up with smarter ones. Instead, it’s just Goodhart’s law in action.
Every attempt to manage academia makes it worse.</p>

<p>As soon a new metric is introduced it will misdirect the attention of scientists towards playing the game, instead of progressing science.</p>

<p>I talked about three areas, but the same pattern occurs almost everywhere. For example, just remember when everyone started minimizing fat in their diet or how grades are used to measure “learning”.</p>

<p>Crucially the problem is not the specific metric that’s being used. Whatever new metric gets introduced will soon again be made useless by Goodhart’s law. The metrics game will always be akin to Whac-A-Mole.</p>

<p>Now where does this leave us? If management by metrics doesn’t work, what else should we do?</p>

<p>First of all, I think that looking at metrics can be helpful. They just shouldn’t be the sole yardstick decisions are measured against.</p>

<p>And while the map never will be the territory, the picture you’re looking at gets more accurate the more metrics you consider. For example, if politicians would not just consider the R number but hundreds of metrics that take different aspects of a population’s wellbeing into account, the decisions would be better ones.</p>

<p>The obvious problem is that decisions become much harder if you consider more than one metric.</p>

<p>But more importantly there are so many factors we can’t measure that nevertheless should be taken into account.</p>

<p>The more I think about it the more I become convinced that it all boils down to talking to people.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about surveys that distill thousands of standardized “conversations” into a few numbers or analytics tools that do similar things for behavior. I’m talking about real one-on-one interactions.</p>

<p>Just imagine if Jeff Bezos would talk to hundreds of real (non pre-vetted) Amazon customers each month and take what he hears in these conversations seriously. Or if politicians would have long conversations with regular people from all wakes of life. Or if academic committees would actually talk to applicants before filtering them out based on citation metrics.</p>

<p>In our hyper rational world it’s extremely hard to justify decisions based on the mere gut feeling you got from a few conversations. But this is exactly what people should be doing.</p>

<p>Engagement metrics will never tell you if users are genuinely happy when they use your product. But a few genuine conversations will.</p>

<p>A resume will never tell you if a person is genuinely interested in uncovering unknown truths about nature. But a 30-minute conversation will.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s so much easier to reach a consensus if you just hire the candidate with the highest citation metrics or implement the feature that will lead to the largest revenue increase in the next quarter. But while it’s the easiest decision it’s usually not the best one.</p>

<p>And I think the same applies not just to managing organizations but also to managing ourselves.</p>

<p>Just by listening to my own body I’ll always know better than any fitness tracker if I slept well, better than any blood test if my diet is healthy, and better than my bank account if I’m happy.
That doesn’t mean that I’ll not use a fitness tracker, make regular blood tests, or check my bank account. But I certainly won’t allow them to dictate my decisions.</p>

<p>I’ll look at all the facts and take everything in, even the stuff that can’t be measured, and then I’ll just go with my gut.</p>

        <p>Throughout my engineering career, I've come across dozens if not hundreds of equipment suppliers. But there are a few suppliers that leave a long lasting impression. Thorlabs is one of them. Why?</p><p>It is quite silly actually. Everytime I order a linear actuator, motorized stage or axis controller... something that's just normal industrial hardware, it ships unremarkably with billable weight in hundreds of dollars, docks and sits at the shipping &amp; receiving until I haul it into the lab. Cut open the box, and you see this:</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://jlfenimore.wixsite.com/jenniferfenimore/lab-snacks</figcaption></figure><p>This little red box brings so much joy it is hard to describe. Thorlabs shipping boxes contain one or more of these red boxes, it's got - cookies, candies, granola bars, chips, etc. with seemingly a singular heartwarming goal - to put a smile on my face. They didn't have to do it but they did. And they've been doing this for many years. Infact, they've trademarked "Lab Snacks" which is such a cool name on its own! Food and Drink are not allowed in our lab, except when it comes to the Thorlabs Snacks.</p><p>Thorlabs founder, Alex Cable, wrote an <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">article</a> about his vision of what customer centricity is, there is so much to learn from it, Wikipedia quotes:</p><blockquote>An important part of Thorlabs' brand and culture is Lab Snacks. Lab Snacks were created to support the famished grad student researching all night, serving as an occasional meal for someone hard at work.</blockquote><p>I implore you to read the original <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">article</a> because it exemplifies what a CEO and Founder should do to build an honest, customer centric business and how to genuinely connect with them. Everything at Thorlabs, from their phone support to documentation, is focusing on how best to make you, the customer, successful. Therein lies their success and they double-down on it.</p><p>Thorlabs has left such a long-lasting impact on me that I am writing this post after last enjoying Lab Snacks 2 years ago.</p>

<p>Let me state up front that, while we’re going to be talking about an open source project that was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833206">recently submitted</a> to Hacker News’s “Show HN” section, the intent of this post is not at all to shame the developer who tried their damnedest to do the right thing. They’re the victim, not the culprit.</p>



<h2>RSA, Ya Don’t Say</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, an HN user shared <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet">their open source fork of a Facebook’s messenger client</a>, with added encryption. Their motivation was, as stated in the readme:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>It is known that <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-reads-messenger-messages/">Facebook scans your messages</a>. If you need to keep using Facebook messenger but care about privacy, Zuccnet might help.</p><p>It’s pretty simple: you and your friend have Zuccnet installed. Your friend gives you their Zuccnet public key. Then, when you send a message to your friend on Zuccnet, your message is encrypted on your machine before it is sent across Facebook to your friend. Then, your friend’s Zuccnet decrypts the message. Facebook never sees the content of your message.</p><p>I’m not a security person and there’s probably some stuff I’ve missed – any contributions are very welcome! This is <em>very</em> <strong>beta</strong>, don’t take it too seriously.</p></div><cite>From Zuccnet’s very humble README.</cite></blockquote>



<p>So far, so good. Facebook is abysmal for privacy, so trying to take matters into your own hands to encrypt data so Facebook can’t see what you’re talking about is, in spirit, a wonderful idea.</p>







<p>However, there is a problem with the <em>execution</em> of this idea. And this isn’t a problem unique to Zuccnet. Several times per year, I come across some well-meaning software project that makes the same mistake: Encrypting messages with RSA directly is bad.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet/blob/42e351e36b3b5dbaef06256ed11313fab77adb25/src/util/crypto.js#L57-L84">Zuccnet source code</a>:</p>


<pre title="">const encryptMessage = (message, recipientPublicKey) =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessage = crypto.publicEncrypt(
    {
      key: recipientPublicKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(message),
  );

  return encryptedMessage.toString("base64");
};

/**
 *
 * @param {String} encryptedMessage - base64 encoded string
 */
const decryptMessage = encryptedMessage =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessageBuffer = Buffer.from(encryptedMessage, "base64");
  const { privateKey } = getOrCreateZuccnetKeyPair();
  const message = crypto.privateDecrypt(
    {
      key: privateKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(encryptedMessageBuffer),
  );
};
</pre>


<p>To the Zuccnet author’s credit, they’re using OAEP padding, not PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This means their code isn’t vulnerable to Bleichenbacher’s 1998 padding oracle attack (n.b. most of the RSA code I encounter in the wild is vulnerable to this attack).</p>



<p>However, there are other problems with this code:</p>



<ol><li>If you try to encrypt a message longer than 256 bytes with a 2048-bit RSA public key, it will fail. (Bytes matter here, not characters, even for English speakers–because emoji.)</li><li>This design (encrypting with a static RSA public key per recipient) completely lacks forward secrecy. This is the same reason that <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP encryption sucks</a> (or, at least, one of the reasons PGP sucks).</li></ol>



<p>There are many ways to work around the first limitation.</p>



<p>Some cryptography libraries let you treat RSA as a block cipher in <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/">ECB mode</a> and encrypt each chunk independently. This is an incredibly stupid API deign choice: It’s slow (asymmetric cryptography operations are on the order of tens-to-hundreds-of-thousands times slower than symmetric cryptography) and you can drop/reorder/replay blocks, since ECB mode provides <em>no semantic security</em>.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="61" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/glitch-ecb/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png" data-orig-size="224,224" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="glitch-ecb" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png 224w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px"><figcaption>I have strong opinions about cryptographic library design.<br>(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/SwizzlestixUK">Swizz</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A <strong>much</strong> better strategy is to encrypt the data with a symmetric key, then encrypt <em>that key</em> with RSA. (See the <a href="#rsa-pkcs1">end of the post</a> for special treatment options that are especially helpful for RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.)</p>



<p>Working around the second problem usually requires an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE), similar to what I covered in my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/11/14/going-bark-a-furrys-guide-to-end-to-end-encryption/">Guide to End-to-End Encryption</a>. Working around this second problem <em>also</em> solves the first problem, so it’s usually better to just implement a forward-secret key exchange protocol than try to make RSA secure. </p>



<p>(You can get forward secrecy without an AKE, by regularly rotating keys, but AKEs make forward secrecy automatic and on-by-default without forcing humans to make a decision to rotate a credential– something most people don’t do unless they have to. AKEs trade user experience complexity for protocol complexity–and this trade-off is almost universally worth taking.)</p>



<p>Although AKEs are extremely useful, they’re a bit complex for most software developers to pick up without prior cryptography experience. (If they were easier, after all, there wouldn’t be so much software that encrypts messages directly with RSA in the first place.)</p>



<p>Note: RSA itself isn’t the reason that this lacks forward secrecy. The problem is how RSA is used.</p>



<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>



<h3>For Developers</h3>



<p>First, consider <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">not using RSA</a>. Hell, while you’re at it, <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">don’t write <em>any</em> cryptography code that you don’t have to</a>. </p>



<p>Libsodium (<a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages">which you should use</a>) does most of this for you, and can easily be turned into <a href="https://github.com/soatok/rawr-x3dh">an AKE comparable to the one Signal uses</a>. The less cryptography code you have to write, the less can go catastrophically wrong–especially in production systems.</p>



<p>If jettisoning RSA from your designs is a non-starter, you should at least consider taking the Dhole Moments Pledge for Software Developers:</p>



<blockquote><p>I will not encrypt messages directly with RSA, or any other asymmetric primitive.</p><cite>Simple enough, right?</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead, if you find yourself needing to encrypt a message with RSA, remind yourself that RSA is <em>for encrypting symmetric keys, not messages</em>. And then plan your protocol design accordingly.</p>



<p>Also, I’m pretty sure RSA isn’t random-key robust. Ask your favorite cryptographer if it matters for whatever you’re building.</p>



<p>(But seriously, you’re better off not using RSA at all.)</p>



<h3>For Cryptography Libraries</h3>



<p>Let’s ask ourselves, “Why are we forcing developers to know or even care about these details?”</p>



<p>Libsodium doesn’t encumber developers with unnecessary decisions like this. Why does the crypto module built into JavaScript? Why does the crypto module built into <em>most</em> programming languages that offer one, for that matter? (Go is a notable exception here, because their security team is awesome and forward-thinking.)</p>



<p>In my opinion, we should stop shipping cryptography interfaces that…</p>



<ul><li>Mix symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in the same API</li><li>Allow developers to encrypt directly with asymmetric primitives</li><li>Force developers to manage their own nonces/initialization vectors</li><li>Allow public/private keys to easily get confused (e.g. lack of type safety)</li></ul>



<p>For example: <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">Dhole Crypto</a> is close to my ideal for general-purpose encryption.</p>



<h3 id="rsa-pkcs1">Addendum: Securing RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5</h3>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> Neil Madden informs me that what I wrote here is actually very similar to a standard construction called <a href="https://kel.bz/post/kem/">RSA-KEM</a>. You should use RSA-KEM instead of what I’ve sketched out, since that’s better studied by cryptographers.</p>



<p>(I’ve removed the original sketch below, to prevent accidental misuse.)</p>

<p>I’m trying to convince friends and family to switch to Signal. Opened the Signal App after several months today and I was welcomed with 100+ unread “X just joined Signal” messages. And it irritated me right away! Not for some privacy concern but because looking at 100+ automated, unread messages is simply unpleasant. So many email apps base their whole business plan around the ‘zero inbox’ idea. Instead here I was on Signal, greeted with unnecessary messages. You don’t expect me to click each one to mark as read! Or go look for solutions to bulk-delete or mark-all-read right after I signup. The two friends that I had chatted with long back were embedded deep into the sea of these messages.</p>
<p>I go back and forth between whether first impressions are as important — but dare I say, for Web and Mobile Apps they are.</p>
<p><strong>Signal ought to act confidently about its presence in the messaging Apps domain now and not act as a newbie in the market.</strong></p>
<p>P.S.: There’s an option under settings to Switch Off the “Contact Joined Signal” notifications. This should be default off or completely removed from the App.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust has taken the programming language world by storm. Since its 1.0 release in 2015, it has been one of the most loved programming languages with a loyal following of developers and contributors.</p><p>To learn why this language is favored so much between developers, we have started a new series on Rust in production. In it, we’ll interview people that have used Rust for significant projects: apps, services, startup MVPs, and others.</p><p>For the first installment of the series, we interview Michael Fey, VP of Engineering at <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. Read further to find out why they chose Rust for their product, the benefits of Rust for security-centered applications, and what cool libraries you should look into if you’re developing something similar in Rust.</p><h3 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</h3><p>1Password is a password manager trusted by millions of people and 70,000 businesses to secure their sensitive data. It remembers all your passwords so you don’t have to, and comes with apps for all major browsers, plus desktop and mobile.</p><p>I am the VP of Engineering for Client Apps here at 1Password. If you have ever had the pleasure to use 1Password on your Mac, Windows PC, iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or tablet, or in your browser, then you’ve been lucky enough to use something my team has built. We’ve been around since 2004, and we take a lot of pride in building a well-crafted experience and keeping people safe online.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/xa/xarnasmy.111_(5).jpg" alt="Michael Fey" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="can-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-1password%3F-how-big-a-part-of-your-codebase-is-written-in-rust%3F">Can you talk about the stack of 1Password? How big a part of your codebase is written in Rust?</h3><p>We’ve been using Rust in production at 1Password for a few years now. Our Windows team was the frontrunner on this effort to the point where about 70% of 1Password 7 for Windows is written in Rust. We also ported the 1Password Brain – the engine that powers our browser filling logic – from Go to Rust at the end of 2019 so that we could take advantage of the speed and performance of deploying Rust to WebAssembly in our browser extension.</p><p>These have been in production for the last few years and we’ve seen great success. So much so that we’re now in the midst of a complete rewrite of nearly our entire product lineup, and Rust is a major part of that story. We are using Rust to create a headless 1Password app that encompasses all of the business logic, cryptography, database access, server communication, and more wrapped in a thin UI layer that is native to the system on which we’re deploying.</p><h3 id="did-any-of-rust%E2%80%99s-advantages-like-speed-or-type%2Fmemory-safety-influence-the-choice-of-using-rust-for-1password%3F">Did any of Rust’s advantages like speed or type/memory-safety influence the choice of using Rust for 1Password?</h3><p>One of the main things that drew us to Rust initially was the memory safety; it definitely excites us knowing that Rust helps us maximize our confidence in the safety of our customers’ secrets. Beyond memory safety, though, there’s so much more we love about the Rust ecosystem. There is a significant performance benefit to the lack of a traditional runtime; we don’t have to worry about the overhead of a garbage collector, for instance. Rust offers a form of “program correctness” and many guarantees against undefined behaviour at runtime. The strong type system enforces these rules at compile-time. Carefully aligning application logic with Rust’s strong type rules makes APIs difficult to use incorrectly and results in simpler code that’s free from runtime checking of constraints and invariants; the compiler can guarantee there are no invalid runtime code paths that will lead your program astray before it executes. Having to perform less runtime state validation leads to cleaner, more efficient, more focused, and higher quality code. Rust requires very little runtime debugging compared to other languages. If it compiles, you can be fairly sure it won’t exhibit unexpected behaviour. It may not be what you <em>want</em> but it will be “correct”. 🙂</p><p>Another very powerful (and often overlooked) feature of Rust is its procedural macro system, which has allowed us to write a tool that automatically shares types defined in Rust with our client-side languages (Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript). The output from this tool handles the serialization/deserialization process automatically, meaning our client-side devs can continue to work in their language of choice while interacting with the Rust library and can be free from the concerns of JSON parsing over the foreign function interface (FFI). We get all of this while enjoying the benefits of compile-time type checking in every one of our target languages. We’ve integrated this tool into our continuous integration server as well, meaning that changes to the Rust models can result in compilation failures in the client applications that are caught during our review process.</p><p>This tool has been an integral component in our development process, allowing us to move much more quickly than ever before. Once our types are defined in Rust, we are able to immediately generate equivalent types in our client-side languages. This allows our devs to focus on solving problems without having to hand-roll boilerplate code to communicate over the FFI.</p><h3 id="how-good-is-rust%E2%80%99s-support-(library-and-otherwise)-for-developing-security-centric-applications-like-1password%3F">How good is Rust’s support (library and otherwise) for developing security-centric applications like 1Password?</h3><p>There is more than enough to build a majority of the base that security-centered applications require. There are two large, prominent cryptography platforms (<em><a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring">ring</a></em> and the <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">Rust Crypto</a> group) that together provide a wealth of functionality. As I mentioned above, writing with Rust itself gives you much greater confidence in your memory usage and makes it much harder to accidentally introduce a memory-related exploit into your application. There is also a wonderful system in place for keeping track of vulnerabilities that do show up from time to time in Rust crates: the <a href="https://rustsec.org/">RustSec</a> database, which is community-sourced by other Rust developers and is updated frequently with new information that can be consumed in CI audit scans. The batteries-included test framework that Rust and Cargo also include mean that you always have an easy way to write unit-test suites for correct behavior in critical code, like any cryptographic functions that you write.</p><p>While safe native Rust libraries for everything are the dream (and they will come in time), there is always the option to dip down and easily consume something in C or from native platform libraries. We use this to great effect in our Rust code for things like calling out to the native implementations of biometric unlock (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) and platform-specific settings implementations like NSUserDefaults on Apple platforms.</p><h3 id="any-particular-rust-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Any particular Rust libraries that you want to feature?</h3><p>Absolutely. Tokio, Hyper/Reqwest, Ring, and Neon all have a home in 1Password and are fundamental in allowing us to tackle this ambitious project at all. You should also check out our <a href="https://crates.io/crates/password-rules-parser">password-rules-parser</a> on <a href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, which is based on a spec primarily being backed by Apple. Their tools and docs can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/">here</a>.</p><h3 id="where-is-rust-great-to-use%2C-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Rust great to use, and where does it fall short in your stack?</h3><p>Rust has fulfilled 90% of what we were hoping for when we started this project. We’ve been able to deploy it to nearly every one of our target platforms in some way shape or form (with the exception of Apple Watch). The language itself has been designed with modern sensibilities and is improving with every release. It has great documentation and an active community.</p><p>Although there are countless crates available for use, we did have to roll our own logging and tracing tools to ensure that they were safe to use in 1Password. Additionally, we constructed a substantial localization implementation to meet the requirements of our products.</p><p>It did fall short for us in one key area: We were hoping WebAssembly would take us further in the browser and our browser extension than it has. WebAssembly has been great as a function library, but attempting to stand up an entire runtime in WASM has been a challenge. Many of the issues we ran into, however, were not limitations of Rust but of WebAssembly as a deployment platform.</p><h3 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-while-developing-1password-with-rust%3F">What was the biggest challenge while developing 1Password with Rust?</h3><p>Many of the folks on our team were new to Rust, and they experienced the typical learning curve that comes with its memory management and ownership model. We are also finding the compile times to be pretty beefy; our CPUs and fans are definitely getting a workout. 😄</p><h3 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h3><p>Absolutely.</p><p>If you’re new to Rust, start small and build on top of that. We ran a large number of experiments when we were getting started to try and find the edges of what a Rust-based solution could provide.

		<blockquote>
<p>We have made Arm servers&nbsp;boring.</p>
<p>Jon&nbsp;Masters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Standards are boring. Satisfied users may not want to migrate to other boards
the market tries to sell&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>So Arm market is flooded with piles of small board computers (<span>SBC</span>). Often they
are compliant to standards only when it comes to&nbsp;connectors.</p>
<h3>But our hardware is not&nbsp;standard</h3>
<p>It is not a matter of ‘let produce <span>UEFI</span> ready hardware’ but rather ‘let write
<span>EDK2</span> firmware for boards we already&nbsp;have’.</p>
<p>Look at Raspberry/Pi then. It is shitty hardware but got popular. And group of
people wrote <span>UEFI</span> firmware for it. Probably without vendor support&nbsp;even.</p>
<h3>Start with <span>EBBR</span></h3>
<p>Each new board should be <span>EBBR</span> compliant at start. Which is easy — do ‘whatever
hardware’ and put properly configured U-Boot on it. Upstreaming support for your
small device should not be hard as you often base on some already existing&nbsp;hardware.</p>
<p>Add <span>16MB</span> of <span>SPI</span> flash to store firmware. Your users will be able to boot <span>ISO</span>
without wondering where on boot media they need to write&nbsp;bootloaders.</p>
<p>Then work on <span>EDK2</span> for board. Do <span>SMBIOS</span> (easy) and keep your existing Device
Tree.  You are still <span>EBBR</span>. Remember about upstreaming your work — some people
will complain, some will improve your&nbsp;code.</p>
<h3>Add <span>ACPI</span>, go <span>SBBR</span></h3>
<p>Next step is moving from Device Tree to <span>ACPI</span>. May take some time to understand
why there are so many tables and what <span>ASL</span> is. But as several other systems show
it can be&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>And this brings you to <span>SBBR</span> compliance. Or SystemReady <span>ES</span> if you like&nbsp;marketing.</p>
<h3><span>SBSA</span> for future&nbsp;design</h3>
<p>Doing new SoC tends to be “let us take previous one and improve a bit”. So this
time change it a bit and make your next SoC compliant with <span>SBSA</span> level 3. All
needed components are probably already included in your Arm&nbsp;license.</p>
<p>Grab <span>EDK2</span> support you did for previous board. Look at <span>QEMU</span> <span>SBSA</span> Reference
Platform support, look at other <span>SBSA</span> compliant hardware. Copy, reuse their
drivers, their&nbsp;code.</p>
<h3>Was it&nbsp;worth?</h3>
<p>At the end you will have <span>SBSA</span> compliant hardware running <span>SBBR</span> compliant&nbsp;firmware. </p>
<p>Congratulations, your board is SystemReady <span>SR</span> compliant. Your marketing team may
write that you are on same list as Ampere with their Altra&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Users buy your hardware and can install whatever <span>BSD</span>, Linux distribution they
want. Some will experiment with Microsoft Windows. Others may work on porting
Haiku or other exotic operating&nbsp;system. </p>
<p>But none of them will have to think “how to get this shit running”. And they
will tell friends that your device is as boring as it should be when it comes to
running <span>OS</span> on it == more&nbsp;sales.</p>

January 20, 2021 | https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>During a recent “Zoom” lecture a student asked me a question about outliers. In the process of answering I realized something that I knew was true but had never seen explained in any sources. This post is my first attempt to develop an <strong>analogy that connects least squares methods, like regression or PCA, to physical intuition about springs or elastics</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-simplest-version">The simplest version</h2>
<p>To illustrate I will use data from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html">gapminder</a> conveniently provided in an R package by Jenny Bryan. Consider these two variables in the dataset, GDP per capita and life expectancy, plotted here in a standard scatterplot:</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>(To have a less busy plot, one with fewer points, I’ve subsetted the data to the year 2007 and countries in Asia).</p>
<p>Now we’re going to bring physical intuition into this by imagining these points as physical objects. For example, we can interpret the mean <span>\((\bar x, \bar y)\)</span> = 6252.7, 70.7 as the center of mass (if we assume every point has the same mass). This is the larger, blue point in the plot above. It’s not really important to think of mass specifically, just that this point is the center of the physical ensemble.</p>
<p>We need a few simple rules for our physical system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the data is not allowed, i.e.&nbsp;the points are immovable.</li>
<li>For methods like regression (or PCA), we imagine a rigid object like a line (or hyperplane, in multiple regression) passing through the points, and the points exerting some force that changes the position of this body</li>
<li>If these methods use the standard least squares loss function then this force can be represented by springs or elastics, all of the same length and strength, attached at one end to the points and on the other end to the line (or hyperplane).</li>
</ul>
<p>This line (or hyperplane) may bounce around at first as the springs pull it toward their anchoring points, but eventually it settles into an equilibrium where the forces from all the opposing springs are balanced out. In this equilibrium state we have two immediate consequences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The rigid object (line or hyperplane) <em>must pass through the center point</em>. If it did not, there would be a net force acting on the object pulling it toward the center point, hence it would not yet be at equilibrium. In other words, all of the forces that would <em>shift</em> the object are exactly balanced out so it does not shift.</li>
<li>The same is true about <em>torques</em>, all of the forces that would <em>rotate</em> the object are balanced out.</li>
</ol>
<p>For regression we need one more rule: the springs are guided so they only pull in directions aligned with the axis of the outcome variable, i.e.&nbsp;“vertically.” Let’s call this the <strong>vertical rule</strong> for reference later.</p>
<p>Here is our simple example in picture form:</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>(To create this plot I have copied the <code>geom_spring</code> example by <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasp85/status/1331338379636649986">Thomas Lin Pedersen</a> from (the new version of!) the <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/spring1.html">ggplot2 book</a>).</p>
<p>If you are not immediately convinced that this intuition pays off, consider the issue that motivated me to think of this in the first place: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influential_observation">influential outliers</a>, points with high “leverage” in the statistical sense. The definition of statistical leverage is a bit complicated. But we can get the right intuition about it from a physical sense rather than those formal definitions. See the point in the bottom left of the plot above? Since it is pulling closer to the end of the line it has more leverage in the actual <em>physical</em> sense. This is the explanation I prefer to give students who aren’t taking a mathematical statistics course.</p>
<p>(In case you’re wondering, that point is Afghanistan, a nation where the United States remains at war for almost two decades now…)</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens when we move this one point so its leverage is being used to rotate the line clockwise instead of counter-clockwise. The old regression line, before this change, is shown as a faded line below for comparison.</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>Notice the following changes: the center of mass has shifted a little, the point we moved is now a greater distance from the line so its force is larger, and the line has rotated noticeably due to the influence of this one point, even though our dataset has over 30 points, because that point has a lot of leverage.</p>
<h3 id="hookes-law">Hooke’s law</h3>
<p>Is this intuition correct? Can we really think of least squares solutions (e.g.&nbsp;regression lines) as the equilibrium of a system of springs? Yes, or elastic rubber bands, or any material with linear elasticity, i.e.&nbsp;that follows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law">Hooke’s law</a>. Let’s consider how to apply this to regression, where for each point <span>\((x_i, y_i)\)</span> in the data, the spring attaches to the regression line at the point <span>\((x_i, \hat y_i)\)</span>. So the spring is stretched to a length of <span>\(|r_i| = |y_i - \hat y_i|\)</span>, and Hooke’s law says each spring is pulling on the line with a force proportional to this distance.</p>
<p>When the system of the line and springs has stopped moving and settled into an equilibrium, this equilibrium position minimizes the <em>energy</em> of the system, which in this case is just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#Potential_energy_for_a_linear_spring">potential energy</a>. The potential energy stored in a spring that is stretched a certain distance is the integral of the force over that distance, and since the force scales with the distance this means the energy scales with the squared distance. Hence, the equilibrium of this physical system <strong>minimizes the total potential energy</strong>:</p>
<p><span>\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2}k |r_i|^2 = \frac{1}{2}k \sum_{i=1}^n  (y_i - \hat y_i)^2
\]</span> where <span>\(k &gt; 0\)</span> is the spring “stiffness” constant. The line that minimizes this is the same as the least squares regression line because the constants in front don’t change the minimizer. This argument works just as well for multiple regression as simple regression, even if we can’t visualize the higher dimensional plots involved. We can still think of springs that are pulling, perpendicular to the <span>\(y\)</span>-axis, on a hyperplane. In this case there can be torques in various different hyperplanes passing through the center of mass but they’re all balanced out, so the hyperplane doesn’t get “tilted” in any direction (if it’s in equilibrium).</p>
<h2 id="principal-components-analysis">Principal components analysis</h2>
<p>Although PCA is often considered a more advanced topic than (simple) regression, its justification in our physical analogy is actually simpler. All we need to do is drop the <strong>vertical rule</strong> that was required for regression. In this case, the springs are allowed to rotate their angle of departure from the points, and their position of attachment to the line (or hyperplane) can slide to accommodate this change in angle. This results in an equilibrium where the springs are stretched as little possible. The total potential energy reaches a lower value because the springs are no longer constrained in which direction they can pull.</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>I’ve plotted the line in a different color to emphasize that it’s <a href="https://benediktehinger.de/blog/science/scatterplots-regression-lines-and-the-first-principal-component/"><strong>not</strong> the regression line</a>. Notice that the springs are no longer pulling vertically, instead they connect to the line at the point on the line which is <em>nearest</em> (as measured by overall distance, not just distance in the <span>\(y\)</span>-coordinate alone).</p>
<p>(This is also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_least_squares">total least squares</a> or a special case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deming_regression">Deming regression</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="model-complexityelasticity-machine-learning-or-ai">Model complexity/elasticity: machine learning or AI</h2>
<p>We can keep building on this analogy by using it to understand more complex modeling methods with another very simple idea: <strong>elasticity of the model object itself</strong>. Instead of a rigid body like a line (or hyperplane), if we imagine it’s made of an elastic material that can be (locally) stretched and deformed then we can get more complex types of regression models.</p>
<p>In this analogy, simpler models like linear regression correspond to more rigid objects like an unbendable metal stick, and more complex models allow flexibility or elasticity when fitting the conditional expectation function like a bendable plastic stick, a rubber band, or even a tensionless string in the most complex case where the model is allowed to fit the points perfectly.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the local polynomial regression method (<code>loess</code>) used by default in the <code>ggplot</code> function <code>stat_smooth</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="624" data-distill-preview="1"></p>
<p>This intuition is not only useful for learning the basic ideas of model complexity and machine learning, it can even be used for cutting-edge research. For example see this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06943">recent paper</a> on elasticity in neural networks (by my friend Weijie Su and his coauthor!)</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>I think there’s a lot of <em>potential</em> here for statistics education, especially for younger students. It wouldn’t be too difficult to create a physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine">classroom demonstration</a> using springs or elastics, especially for the PCA case since that wouldn’t require any guiding tracks to constraint the force direction to be vertical.</p>
<p>I also need to teach myself some more advanced plotting to <code>gganimate</code> these examples. If I succeed I’ll update this page.</p>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<p>I was surprised by how difficult it was to find any references for this elementary idea that provides physical intuition for such an important method as least squares regression. If you’re aware of any others please contact me because I would be glad to know of them.</p>

Custom Static Analysis Rules Showdown:<br>
Brakeman vs. Semgrep
</p>
<p>
By Jason Kielpinski (Tech Reviewers: Justin Collins, Erik Cabetas, Clint Gibler)
</p>
<p>
In application assessments you have to do the most effective work you can in the time period defined by the client to maximize the assurance you’re providing. At IncludeSec we’ve done a couple innovative things to improve the overall effectiveness of the work we do, and we’re always on the hunt for more ways to squeeze even more value into our assessments by finding more risks and finding them faster. One topic that we revisit frequently to ensure we’re doing the best we can to maximize efficiency is static analysis tooling (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing" target="_blank">aka SAST</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Recently we did a bit of a comparison example of two open source static analysis tools to automate detection of suspicious or vulnerable code patterns identified during assessments. In this post we discuss the experience of using Semgrep and Brakeman to create the same custom rule within each tool for a client’s Ruby on Rails assessment our team was assessing. We’re also very interested in trying out GitHub’s CodeQL, but unfortunately the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24648281" target="_blank">Ruby support is still in development</a> so that will have to wait for another time.
</p>
<p>
Semgrep is a pattern-matching tool that is semantically-aware and works with several 	languages (currently its Ruby support is marked as beta, so it is likely not at full maturity yet). Brakeman is a long-lived Rails-specific static-analysis tool, familiar to most who have worked with Rails security. Going in, I had no experience writing custom rules for either one.
</p>
<p>
This blog post is specifically about writing custom rules for code patterns that are particular to the project I'm assessing. First though I want to mention that both tools have some pre-built general rules for use with most Ruby/Rails projects -- Brakeman has a fantastic set of built-in rules for Rails projects that has proven very useful on assessments (just make sure the developers of the project haven't disabled rules in config/brakeman.yml, and yes we have seen developers do this to make SAST warnings go away!). Semgrep has an <a href="https://semgrep.dev/r?lang=ruby&amp;sev=ERROR,WARNING,INFO&amp;tag=security,owasp,best-practice" target="_blank">online registry of user-submitted rules for Ruby</a> that is also handy (especially as examples for writing your own rules), but the current rule set for Ruby is not quite as extensive as Brakeman. In Brakeman the rules are known as “checks”, for consistency we’ll use the term “rules” for both tools, but you the reader can just keep that fact in mind.
</p>
<p>
First custom rule: Verification of authenticated functionality
</p>
<p>
I chose a simple pattern for the first rule I wanted to make, mainly to familiarize myself with the process of creating rules in both Semgrep and Brakeman. The application had controllers that handle non-API routes. These controllers enforced authentication by adding a before filter: <span>before_action :login_required</span>. Often in Rails projects, this line is included in a base controller class, then skipped when authentication isn't required using <span>skip_before_filter</span>. This was not the case in the webapp I was looking at -- the before filter was manually set in every single controller that needed authentication, which seemed error-prone as an overall architectural pattern, but alas it is the current state of the code base. 
</p>
<p>
I wanted to get a list of any non-API controllers that lack this callback so I can ensure no functionality is unintentionally exposed without authentication. API routes handled authentication in a different way so consideration for them was not a priority for this first rule.
</p>
<p>
Semgrep
</p>
<p>
I went to the Semgrep website and found that Semgrep has a <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank">nice interactive tutorial</a>, which walks you through building custom rules. I found it to be incredibly simple and powerful -- after finishing the tutorial in about 20 minutes I thought I had all the knowledge I needed to make the rules I wanted. Although the site also has an online IDE for quick iteration I opted to develop locally, as the online IDE would require submitting our client’s code to a 3rd party which we obviously can’t do for security and liability reasons. The rule would eventually have to be run against the entire codebase anyways.
</p>
<p>
I encountered a few challenges when writing the rule:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It's a little tricky to find things that do not match a pattern (e.g. lack of a <span>login_required</span> filter). You can't just search all files for ones that don't match, you have to have a pattern that it does search for, then exclude the cases matching your negative pattern. I was running into a <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1892" target="_blank">bug</a> here that made it even harder but the Semgrep team fixed it when we gave them a heads up!
</li>
<li>
Matching only classes derived from <span>ApplicationController</span> was difficult because Semgrep doesn’t currently trace base classes recursively, so any that were more than one level removed from <span>ApplicationController</span> would be excluded (for example, if there was a class <span>DerivedController &lt; ApplicationController</span>, it wouldn't match <span>SecondLevelDerivedController &lt; DerivedController</span>.) The Semgrep team gave me a tip about using a metavariable regex to filter for classes ending in “Controller” which worked for this situation and added no false positives. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My final custom rule for Semgrep follows:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>rules</span>:
<span>-</span> <span>id</span>: controller<span>-</span>without<span>-</span>authn
  <span>patterns</span>:
  <span>-</span> <span>pattern</span>: <span>|</span>
      <span>class</span> <span>$CLASS</span>
        <span>...</span>
      <span>end</span>
  <span>-</span> pattern<span>-</span><span>not</span>: <span>|</span>
      <span>class</span> <span>$CLASS</span>
        <span>...</span>
        before_action <span>...</span>, <span>:login_required</span>, <span>...</span>

<p>
I ran the rule using the following command: <span>semgrep --config=../../../semgrep/ | grep "does not use"</span>
</p>
<p>
The final grep is necessary because Semgrep will print the matched patterns which, in this case, were the entire classes. There’s currently no option in Semgrep to show only a list of matching files without the actual matched patterns themselves. That made it difficult to see the list of affected controllers, so I used grep on the output to filter the patterns out. This rule resulted in 47 identified controllers. Creating this rule originally took about two hours including going through the tutorial and debugging the issues I ran into but now that the issues are fixed I expect it would take less time in future iterations.
</p>
<p>
Overall I think the rule is pretty self-explanatory -- it finds all files that define a class then excludes the ones that have a <span>login_required</span> before filter. Check out the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank">semgrep tutorial lessons</a> if you’re unsure.
</p>
<p>
Brakeman
</p>
<p>
Brakeman has a <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/wiki/Creating-Custom-Brakeman-Rules" target="_blank">wiki page which describes custom rule building</a>, but it doesn't have a lot of detail about what functionality is available to you. It gives examples of finding particular method calls and whether user input finds their ways into these calls. There's no example of finding controllers.
</p>
<p>
The page didn't give any more about what I wanted to do so I headed off to Brakeman's <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/tree/main/lib/brakeman/checks" target="_blank">folder of built-in rules</a> in GitHub to see if there are any examples of something similar there. There is a <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/blob/main/lib/brakeman/checks/check_skip_before_filter.rb" target="_blank">CheckSkipBeforeFilter</a> rule which is very similar to what I want -- it checks whether the <span>login_required</span> callback is skipped with <span>skip_before_filter</span>. As mentioned, the app isn't implemented that way, but it showed me how to iterate controllers and check before filters.
</p>
<p>
This got me most of the way there but I also needed to skip API controllers for this particular app’s architecture. After about an hour of tinkering and looking through <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/blob/main/lib/brakeman/tracker/controller.rb" target="_blank">Brakeman controller tracker code</a> I had the following rule:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>require</span> <span>'brakeman/checks/base_check'</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Brakeman</span><span>::</span><span>CheckControllerWithoutAuthn</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>Brakeman</span><span>::</span><span>BaseCheck</span>
  <span>Brakeman</span><span>::</span><span>Checks</span><span>.</span>add <span>self</span>

  <span>@description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Checks for a controller without authN"</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>run_check</span>
  controllers <span>=</span> tracker<span>.</span>controllers<span>.</span>select <span>do</span> <span>|</span>_name, controller<span>|</span>
      <span>not</span> check_filters controller
  <span>end</span>
  <span>Hash</span><span>[</span>controllers<span>].</span>each <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>name</span>, controller<span>|</span>
    <span>warn</span>  <span>:controller</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>name</span>,
          <span>:warning_type</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"No authN"</span>,
          <span>:warning_code</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>:basic_auth_password</span>,
          <span>:message</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"No authentication for controller"</span>,
          <span>:confidence</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>:high</span>,
          <span>:file</span> <span>=&gt;</span> controller<span>.</span>file
  <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>

<span># Check whether a non-api controller has a :login_required before_filter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>check_filters</span> controller
  <span>return</span> <span>true</span> <span>if</span> controller<span>.</span>parent<span>.</span>to_s<span>.</span>include? <span>"ApiController"</span>
  controller<span>.</span>before_filters<span>.</span>each <span>do</span> <span>|</span>filter<span>|</span>
      <span>next</span> <span>unless</span> call? filter
      <span>next</span> <span>unless</span> filter<span>.</span>first_arg<span>.</span>value <span>==</span> <span>:login_required</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>true</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Running it with <span>brakeman --add-checks-path ../brakeman --enable ControllerWithoutAuthn -t ControllerWithoutAuthn</span> resulted in 43 controllers without authentication -- 4 fewer than Semgrep flagged.
</p>
<p>
Taking a close look at the controllers that Semgrep flagged and Brakeman did not, I realized the app is importing shared functionality from another module, which included a <span>login_required</span> filter. Therefore, Semgrep had 4 false positives that Brakeman did not flag. Since Semgrep works on individual files I don’t believe there’s an easy way to prevent those ones from being flagged.
</p>
<p>
Second custom rule: Verification of correct and complete authorization across functionality
</p>
<p>
The next case I wanted assurance on was vertical authorization at the API layer. <span>ApiControllers</span> in the webapp have a method <span>authorization_permissions()</span> which is called at the top of each derived class with a hash table of function_name/permission pairs. This function saves the passed hash table into an instance variable. <span>ApiControllers</span> have a before filter that, when any method is invoked, will look up the permission associated with the called method in the hash table and ensure that the user has the correct permission before proceeding. 
</p>
<p>
Manual review was required to determine whether any methods had incorrect privileges, as analysis tools can’t understand business logic, but they can find methods entirely lacking authorization control -- that was my …</p></div></div>

    <h3>Urwhat?</h3>
    <p>
    Given the events of the first few weeks of 2021 and the ensuing discourse
    regarding online communities, decentralized platforms have become something
    of a hot topic. None of these are mainstream in any sense outside of the
    privacy/FOSS/developer community, but some of the more popular ones include
    <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a>, and <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>. All of these have in common
    the fact that they are part of the "fediverse", a community of self-hosted
    platforms that can interact with each other via the ActivityPub protocol.
    Via ActivityPub, you can see PeerTube videos from Mastodon, people on
    different Pleroma servers can follow each other, your self-hosted blog can
    allow comments via Mastodon, etc. I think these are fantastic projects and a
    step forward for the Internet, but a different project caught my eye
    recently - <a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Urbit is one of things that is surrounded with so much
        <label for="sn-aesthetic">mystique</label>
        <span id="sn-aesthetic">
            I mean, just look at that aesthetic on their homepage and blog.
            Minimal, enigmatic, and eyecatching. A+ job to the designer.
        </span>
    and promises so much that it is guaranteed to be either revolutionary or a
    complete scam.  The project aims to be not only a peer-to-peer network but
    also include an operating system, virtual machine, not one but two
    (functional!)  programming languages, and an identity system.  These kinds
    of clean-slate, from-the-ground-up reimaginings of computing rarely leave
    the ground, and when they do they're often pretty <a href="https://templeos.org/">unusable</a>.  I just <strong>had</strong> to
    see for myself.
    </p>

    <h3>Nine Lightyears Away, Just Outside the Kepler Solar System</h3>
    <p>
    Urbit is trying to be what the Internet was supposed to be, according to the
    ideals of the 1980s. In that prehistoric era, people imagined that the
    Internet would be a peer-to-peer network of individuals freely sharing
    information, unhampered by existing centralized systems or physical borders.
    This, as we now know, never came true. The Internet of today is incredibly
    centralized, and looks more like the computing environment of the 1970s -
    individuals hook up terminals (now phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) to giant
    corporate-owned mainframes (now servers run by Google, Amazon, etc.) that
    store and own all of our data and do the actual computing behind the
    applications we use. Part of why Urbit is such a radical project is because
    it realizes that we can't reverse this process of centralization given our
    current computing infrastructure. If you're tech savvy and willing to front
    the costs you can certainly buy a VPS and host your own stuff, but your
    elderly relatives aren't going to swap out Facebook for an EC2 instance
    anytime
        <label for="sn-ec2">soon.
        </label> <span label="sn-ec2">
            Urbit definitely does not solve the necessity for technical
            competency that's endemic to these kinds of alternative platforms, as you'll
            later see.  I suppose the creators left it up to the end-users to build
            comfortable clients.
        </span>
    Instead, Urbit is a truly personal OS built from the ground up that runs in
    a virtual machine on any Unix system.
    </p>
    <p>
    Urbit is not only an OS - it's an identification system.  Each Urbit
    instance exists as a unique member in a hierarchy. In the Urbit universe,
    there are 2^8 galaxies, each galaxy has 2^8 stars, and each star has 2^16
    planets. This gives approximately 4 billion unique IDs, each of which are
    stored as Ethereum tokens. As you might have noticed there's 7 billion
    people in the world at the moment, but only 4 billion IDs for a "personal
    OS" to go around. This is intended in order to create scarcity, making IDs less
    likely to be abused and give users skin in the game when it comes to Urbit
    as a platform. The IDs themselves are all serialized via a pretty quirky
    syllabic naming convention, with rarer entities having shorter names:
    <code>~zod</code> is the name of a galaxy, <code>~taglux</code> is the name
    of a star, and <code>~rovnys-ricfer</code> is the name of a planet.  If you
    don't have an identity yet you can also boot up a free and disposable
    instance called a "comet", which will have a super long 128-bit name like
    <code>~dasres-ragnep-lislyt-ribpyl--mosnyx-bisdem-nidful-marzod</code>. You
    can do so right now after <a href="https://urbit.org/using/install/">installing</a> the Urbit binary and
    running <code>urbit -c comet-name-here</code>. Once you boot up (it'll take
    a while) you should see a prompt appear.

    <h3>Beyond the Horizon of Sanity</h3>
    <p>
    Urbit, in terms of software, is composed of several tightly coupled projects.
    The entire inspiration behind building an entire software stack from the
    ground up, and what makes the OS truly peer-to-peer, is the fact that it's
    built entirely of pure functional code. This allows for interesting stuff
    like totally deterministic behavior, the ability to serialize and then
    deserialize the entire machine state, sending and executing code over the
    wire, and its snappy tagline: "An operating function." The actual core OS of
    Urbit is named <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/arvo/arvo/">Arvo</a>, the
    assembly code of which is called <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/nock/">Nock</a>, which runs on the <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vere/">Vere</a> runtime/interpeter.
    Nock is incredibly low-level but distinct from typical RISC/CISC assembly in
    that it's purely functional so there's no registers, pointer poking, or
    syscalls going on - it's all just S-expressions and operations on
        <label for="sn-lisp">S-expressions.</label>
        <span id="sn-lisp">
        Don't get your hopes up, it's nothing like Lisp. Just similar data
        structures.
        </span>
    I have to say, all of these sleek monosyllabic names get a little tiring
    after a while and do a very poor job of hinting at their purpose for
    newcomers.  Imagine if everything on Unix was named the same way -
    <code>systemd</code>?  Oh, you mean Sarp? <code>libcurl</code>? Yeah, that's
    called Clon now.  At least we're already used to Gimp.
    </p>
    <p>
    Much like how basically everything in Unix is written with C and compiled
    down to assembly, everything on Urbit is written in <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/hoon/">Hoon</a> and then compiled
    down to Nock. Hoon is, as you can probably guess by now, a pure functional
    programming language.  When I read this on the tin I got pretty excited, and
    was looking forward to checking out an entire OS written from the ground up
    in something like Haskell or ML or a Lisp dialect.
    </p>
    <p>This was <strong>not</strong> the case. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.</p>
    <p>
    It's truly like nothing I've seen before, and I'd like to think I've been
    around the block when it comes to programming language design. The primary
    ingredient in Hoon is schizophrenia. It makes Terry Davis look like Brian
    Kernighan. To illustrate, let's take a look at <strong>literally</strong>
    the <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/hoon/hoon-school/list-of-numbers/">first
    example</a> in the docs:
        </p><pre>            <code>
|=  end=@
=/  count=@  1
|-
^-  (list @)
?:  =(end count)
  ~
:-  count
$(count (add 1 count))
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
    What does this do? Oh, isn't it obvious? It takes a number <code>n</code>
    and returns a list from 1 to <code>n</code>. No, none of those symbols are
    comments or decorators; every single character above is semantically
    significant. I can deal with complexity where it's necessary, but a short
    look at the docs requires learning a whole new lexicon. The tutorial jumps
    around from concepts like "gates" to "arms" to "runes" to "molds" in such a
    way that it seems deliberately obscure and frustrating. What could possibly
    be so insufficient or broken about, say, functions (after all, it calls
    itself a functional language) that they had to be reinvented? Also - this is
    a minor nitpick, but somewhat representative of the language in general - in
    Hoon, 0 is true and 1 is false <a href="https://youtu.be/5furYtfVuIk">.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Because I have yet to do more with the language than go through the tutorial
    and its exercises a few times, I probably haven't earned the right to be too
    scathing. Who knows, perhaps Hoon is a joy to work with once you pass the
    event horizon and become one with the bits. There's a couple resources
    besides the official tutorial that I'll likely check out in the future:
    there's the <a href="https://urbit.org/community/hoonschool/">Hoon
    School</a> online course (again, if a language requires a six-week online
    course just to learn the fundamentals that should really tell you something)
    and the community-managed <a href="https://hooniversity.org/">Hooniversity</a> tutorial.  I'll leave it
    at this - it's a real achievement that
        <label for="sn-vanes">so much</label>
        <span id="sn-vanes">
        Arvo kernel modules are called <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vane/">Vanes</a>, and there are
        quite a few. There's modules for an HTTP client (separate from the
        server module?), peer-to-peer networking, a filesystem, a terminal, and
        a build system to name a few. Not sure what the userspace is like,
        though.
        </span>
    has been written in the language so far.
    </p>

    <h3>Astroturfing</h3>
    <p>
    Alright, we've decided we're ready for the future of the Internet and want
    to buy in.  Where do we start?
    </p>
    <p>
    Most people just start out with buying a planet. Stars are fairly expensive
    at around $4,000 when I checked at the time of writing this, and galaxies
    are even more expensive and only available via private sale since most of
    the 256 have been given out to contributors/friends of the project. Stars
    and galaxies also represent quite a responsibility because of their dual
    role as infrastructure in the Urbit network, so if you don't want to make
    any kind of commitment then buying a planet is the way to go. There are a
    few places you can buy one - <a href="https://urbit.live/">urbit.live</a>,
    <a href="https://urbit.me/">urbit.me</a>, and <a href="https://planet.market/">planet.market</a> are the first few Google
    results.
    </p>
    <p>
    I decided to get mine on urbit.live. I just chose the first
        <label for="sn-name">
        name
        </label>
        <span id="sn-name">
            None in particular really caught my eye and seemed to define "me",
            but while writing this I saw someone with the hysterical (and likely

<p>Today is the day I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law">Sturgeon’s law</a>:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Ninety percent of everything is crap.</p><cite>Sturgeon’s law</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I like this for a lot of reasons. But most of all, I like it as a nudge to try harder to enjoy things. </p>



<p>Think you hate poetry? Roller coasters? Banjo music? Thai food? Maybe you haven’t discovered the good 10% yet. Keep looking.</p>



<p>How about work? Think QA engineers are <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/04/dont-flip-the-bozo-bit/">useless</a>? Code review is a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">waste of time</a>? <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">Managers</a> hurt more than they help? Maybe you’ve been stuck with the crap 90% of them. Keep looking.</p>



<p>Then there’s relationships. Think there’s no one out there who can make you <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">happy</a>? Maybe you haven’t climbed out of your 90% of crappy relationships yet. Keep looking.</p>



<p>It reminds me of a <a href="https://ideopunk.com/2020/12/22/100-tips-for-a-better-life/">quote I read </a>recently:</p>



<blockquote><p>Keep your identity small. “I’m not the kind of person who does things like that” is not an explanation, it’s a trap. It prevents nerds from working out and men from dancing.&nbsp;</p><cite>Conor Barnes</cite></blockquote>



<p>Remember: <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/16/strong-opinions-loosely-held-sure-but-why/">strong opinions, loosely held</a>. If you think you hate something, hold that opinion loosely by putting it to the test. Try to prove it false. </p>



<p>Don’t be so quick to accept that something is not for you. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">Keep looking</a>.</p>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    <div id="blogpost">
        <p>It is now widely agreed that <a href="https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/08/31/5-reproducibility/">reproducibility is an important aspect of any scientific endeavor</a>.  With Machine Learning being a scientific discipline, as well as an engineering one, reproducibility is equally important here.</p>

<p>There is widespread fear in the ML community that we are living through a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-confronts-reproducibility-crisis">reproducibility crisis</a>. Efforts like the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020">Papers with Code Reproducibility Challenge</a>, signaled a clear call-to-action for practitioners, after a 2016 Nature survey revealed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">70% of results are non-reproducible</a>.</p>

<p>While a lot of the talk amongst the community has centered on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300933">reproducing machine learning results in research</a>, there has been less focus on the production side of things. Therefore, today letâ€™s focus more on the topic of reproducible ML in production and create a larger conversation around it.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-reproducibility-important">Why is reproducibility important?</h2>

<p>
  â€œIf you canâ€™t repeat it, you canâ€™t trust itâ€� - All Ops Teams
</p>

<p>A good question to start with is why exactly reproducibility is important, for machine learning in particular. Here are list of benefits one gains by ensuring reproducibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increases <strong>trust</strong></li>
  <li>Promotes <strong>explainability</strong> of ML results</li>
  <li>Increases <strong>reliability</strong></li>
  <li>Fulfills <strong>ethical</strong>, <strong>legal</strong>, and <strong>regulatory</strong> requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Concretely, ML models tend to go through a lifecycle of being destroyed, forged anew and re-created as <a href="https://blog.maiot.io/technical_debt/">development evolves from rudimentary notebook snippets to a testable, productionized codebase</a>. Therefore, we better make sure that every time a model is (re-) trained, the results are what we expect them to be.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-big-deal">Whatâ€™s the big deal?</h2>
<p>One would think that reproducibility in production ML should be easy. After all, most machine learning is scripting. How hard can it be to simply execute a bunch of scripts again at a later stage and come to the exact same result, right?</p>

<p><strong>wrong</strong></p>

<p>Reproducibility of machine learning is hard because it spans many different disciplines, from understanding non-deterministic algorithmic behaviors, to software engineering best practices. Leaving aside the fact that most machine learning code quality tends to err towards the low side (due to the experimental nature of the work), there is an inherent complexity to ML which makes things even harder.</p>

<p>E.g. Just training a model on the same data with the same configuration does not mean the same model is produced. Perhaps one could achieve a similar <em>overall</em> accuracy (or whatever other metric), but even a slight change in parameters might skew metrics for slices of your data - leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">sometimes very unpleasant results</a></p>

<p>So, how can we ensure that stuff like does not happen? In my opinion, one can break down reproducibility in the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The code</li>
  <li>The configuration</li>
  <li>The environment</li>
  <li>The data</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s look at each of these in turn.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>Checking code into a version control system like Git ensures a clean trace of how code evolves, and the ability to rollback to any point in history. However, Git alone is not a fix for reproducibility, but only for one aspect of it.</p>

<p>In reality, reproducibility in production is solved by version control, testing of code as well as integrations, and idempotent deployment automation. This is hard to apply in practice. E.g. The main tool for ML is Jupyter notebooks, which are notoriously difficult to check into version control. Even worse, most notebook code is not sequential in its execution, and can have an arbitrary, impossible to reproduce, sequence of execution.</p>

<p>But even if ML practitioners follow a pattern of refactoring their code into separate modules, simply checking modules into source control is still not enough to ensure reproducibility. One needs to link the commit history to model training runs and models. This can be achieved e.g. by enforcing a standard in your team that pins a git sha to experiment runs. That way there is a global unique ID that ties the code and configuration (see below) to the results it produced.</p>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>Software Engineering preaches separation of application code and application configuration to allow for predictable and deterministic software behavior across environments. This actually translates well in a machine learning code: E.g. one can separate the model definition and training loop code, from the associated hyper-parameters which define the configuration.</p>

<p>The first step to unlock reproducibility is to actually separate configuration from code in the first place. For me this means, the code itself should NOT define:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Features</li>
  <li>Labels</li>
  <li>Split parameters (e.g. 80-20 split)</li>
  <li>Preprocessing parameters (e.g. the fact that data was normalized)</li>
  <li>Training hyper-parameters (including pre-processing parameters)</li>
  <li>Evaluation criteria, .e.g, metrics</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally all these are tracked separately in a <a href="https://blog.maiot.io/declarative_configs_for_mlops/">declarative config</a> that is human readable.</p>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>If a ML result is produced on a dev local machine, there is a high chance it is not going to be reproducible. Why? Because developers, especially relatively inexperienced ones, are not super diligent in creating and maintaining proper virtual environments.</p>

<p>The obvious solution for this one is containerizing applications, with lets say, <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a>. However, here is another example of when skills of ML practitioners begin diverging from conventional software engineers. Most data scientists are not trained in these matters, and require proper organizational support to help and encourage them to produce containerized applications.</p>

<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>And finally, we arrive at the data. Data versioning has become one of the most discussed topics in the production machine learning community. Unlike code, you canâ€™t simply check data into version control easily (although tools like <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> are attempting just that).</p>

<p>In the same way as code, achieving basic versioning of data does not necessarily ensure reproducibility. There is a whole bunch of metadata associated with how data is utilized in machine learning development, all of which is necessary to persist to ensure trainings are reproducible.</p>

<p>Here is a simple, but common, example that illustrates this point. If you have ever worked with machine learning, have you ever created a folder/storage bucket somewhere that has random files in varying preprocessing states? Something like, <code>normalized_1.json</code> or perhaps even timestamped <code>12_02_19.csv</code>? Technically, a timestamped file is versioned data, but that does not mean associated runs with it are reproducible: One would have to know how, when and where (i.e. the aforementioned metadata) these versioned files are used to ensure reproducibility.</p>

<h3 id="concrete-example">Concrete Example</h3>
<p>While it may fall outside the scope of this blog, the open-source MLOps framework ZenML showcases a clear example 
of putting these principles in action <a href="https://docs.zenml.io/benefits/ensuring-ml-reproducibility.html">here</a></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reproducibility in machine learning is not trivial, and ensuring it in production is even harder. ML teams need to be fully aware of the precise aspects to track in their processes to unlock reproducibility.</p>

	<div>
		<p><span>As branding strategies evolve, tech companies continue to find ways to use white-labeling to create profitable apps. White-labeling refers to creating a foundational product or service that can be rebranded and further customized by other companies. This model </span><span>provides a way to service many brands with one product that still looks unique to end users. </span><span>In a previous blog post on </span><a href="https://www.inspiringapps.com/blog/mobile-industry/fintech-and-mobile-app-development/"><span>fintech and mobile app development</span></a><span>, we discussed the capacity of white-labeling to improve app integration and deliver data-driven tools. While there are many advantages associated with the decision to white-label a product, it is not without its challenges. We share our insights on the topic below. Learn how to use white-labeling to create profitable apps given the inherent strengths and limitations of the model.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Pros and Cons of White-labeling&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Although the practice of white-labeling apps exists across various industries, the business model for all brands is the same. Suppose you want to create a white-labeled “all resorts” app to service property management companies. This app would need to include features that appeal to virtually all resort managers. For example, the app could include the ability to view specific amenities of a resort upon selection. Property managers could further customize the app each time a resort is added to the product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although creating one product that services multiples resorts is </span>more efficient, this technique has its limitations. A significant con to white-labeling is the appearance of a lack of uniqueness. Using the all resorts app as an example, this product may be less appealing to individual resorts since they don’t want to be listed side-by-side in the same app with their competitors. Resorts would prefer to own their customer relationship and create the impression that they’ve done something unique to serve them.</p>
<p><span>On the other hand, the model benefits property managers because it is more efficient to maintain one app. It also simplifies things for users since they only need one app to access information about multiple resorts. White-labeled products also cut out the time and expense required to build users’ trust. Instead, companies deliver customized products to their existing loyal customer base. A customer who is familiar with a particular property management company is more likely to book a resort from its app. For this reason, white-labeling is especially useful to industries in which trust is paramount. This is why financial and medical institutions rely heavily on white-labeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Considerations for Developing a Profitable White-labeled Product&nbsp;</b></h3>
<h4><b>Limitations on brand-specific features&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>Limitations on brand-specific features substantially impact how producers use white-labeling to create profitable apps. Brands invariably request new features that may only be relevant to them. Offering no brand-specific customization is easiest for white-label providers. The more brand-specific features added to an app, the more difficult it is to maintain the app over time. It is tempting to individualize features in order to appease customers. The temptation is especially strong when a business is starting and revenue is especially critical. However, restricting the number of brand-specific features is key to profitability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The cost to develop a white-labeled product is relatively low at the start. Expenses grow over time as more brands (with more needs) are added to the platform. Ideally developers should strive to flatten out the expense curve so that the cost to add a new brand to the app is small. Setting limits on brand-specific customization is key to reaching this goal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Publishing Requirements&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The adoption of white-labeled products by multiple companies results in the availability of similar looking products that market themselves as being unique to a specific brand. This outcome inevitably presents a challenge to using white-labeling to create profitable digital products.&nbsp; It has also contributed to some pushback from Apple. Initially Apple chose to reject&nbsp; submissions from white-label providers</span><span>. Apple later relaxed its policy to allow white-labeled products to be created so long as each brand creates its own developer account and publishes its rebranded app through that account. This stipulation aims to strike a balance between Apple’s interest in an “app store cleanup” and the growing popularity of white-labeled products.&nbsp; Developers interested in creating profitable white-labeled products need to stay informed of these evolving restrictions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Adequate Specificity&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The design of white-labeled products needs to be general enough to be adopted by multiple brands yet specific enough to capitalize on niche markets and their goals. For example, </span><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-first-white-label-gaming-laptop-now-available-for-2200-will-be-adapted-by-resellers-like-Maingear-Schenker-and-Eluktronics.434609.0.html"><span>Intel used white-labeling to create a gaming laptop</span></a><span> that’s similar to a lot of other laptops but also has qualities that appeal to a specific market. The new product for gaming enthusiasts is conducive to white-labeling due to features including “</span><span>an advanced cooling system, excellent performance, great build quality, a light chassis, and shockingly good battery life.” The same connection between profitability and embodiment of a middle ground between generic and targeted features exists for white-labeled apps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Alignment with Emerging Trends&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The most profitable white-labeled products provide services that are becoming increasingly popular. If relabeled products don’t reflect relevant trends, then they are unlikely to provide a launching point from which multiple brands can service a growing need. White-labeled products that are at the forefront of new trends are also able to acquire data that will become increasingly valuable over time. An example of a timely white-labeled product is<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fintech-junior-focus/cash-cards-for-kids-digital-banks-race-to-capture-the-next-generation-idINKBN27Y0RY"> Greenlight</a>, a debit card for kids that was recently white-labeled by Chase</span><span>. Fintech is now essential to personal banking. Therefore, apps that capitalize on this growing trend will be highly valuable to top brands.&nbsp;</span></p>

<![CDATA[The harmful assumptions we make about tasks]]>

January 20, 2021 | https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Most task managers make two assumptions. Do you make them too?</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A task manager needs to remember all of your tasks</em> <br>(Would you buy a task manager that lost data?)</li>
<li><em>All tasks can use a similar creation workflow</em> <br>(You hit the ‘create issue’ button, and fill in some fields. Simple, obvious, how could it be better?)</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not obvious that they’re wrong—they actually seem <em>useful</em>. But both at work, and at home, making these assumptions will reduce your effectiveness.</p>
<p>And if you have trouble context-switching, procrastinate tasks, or have an ever-growing task backlog that looms over your head, these assumptions have likely caused you unnecessary pain.</p>
<p>Here’s how they hurt us, and how to stop it from happening.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-tasks-cause-fatigue">Permanent tasks cause fatigue</h2>
<p>Before starting Tandem, my manager Tim previously co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/01/yahoo-acquires-to-do-app-astrid/">Astrid</a>, a personal task manager, which he later sold to Yahoo.</p>
<p>At Astrid, Tim tried an interesting re-engagement email. Users who had been inactive for 6 weeks were asked: “want to delete all your tasks and start fresh?”</p>
<p>The hypothesis was that these inactive users had tasks that overwhelmed them. Either the amount, the complexity, or the low importance of backlogged tasks, caused users to put tasks off. So every time these users visited Astrid, they saw tasks they couldn’t do, felt bad, and eventually stopped visiting—procrastination in action. Astrid’s re-engagement email offered the users a chance to start fresh.</p>
<p>It was impressively compelling. Most re-engagement emails get a 1% response rate. This email had about 5%.</p>
<p>I imagine those users had the same feeling you get when you move from one browser to another, or from one task manager to another, and leave your bookmarks, open tabs, backlogged tasks, to start fresh in the name of increased productivity.</p>
<p>But simply deleting the backlog doesn’t end the cycle.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nowadays, Tim uses a simpler task manager—a notebook. He uses a page a day, adds some tasks from JIRA, and when tasks come in during the day, he writes them down and works on them when he’s available. These are mostly small tasks, things that are easy to forget. If he gets a bug (important to track) or a task he can delegate, he puts it in JIRA.</p>
<p>The notebook isn’t meant to store issues forever. The pages get turned, and previous information becomes less accessible. So the next day, if he needs to carry over something that hasn’t been completed, he needs to make the conscious decision to do so.</p>
<p>This solution solves task-management fatigue. And incidentally, it solves another problem:</p>
<h2 id="not-all-tasks-are-created-the-same">Not all tasks are created the same</h2>
<p>There is a gap in task management. When we look at the tools used for tracking tasks and goals, there’s something for every level of the company:</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Goal</th>
<th>Tool</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Company quarter-level</td>
<td>Quarterly Goals</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Org quarter-level</td>
<td>KPIs</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs, JIRA Epics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team sprint-level</td>
<td>Tickets</td>
<td>JIRA Tasks/Bugs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal day-level</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>???</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Except at the personal day-level, where you’re working on tickets, getting requests for feature updates from your PM, bug discoveries from QA, and breaking down your actual tickets into different tasks, which may require subtasks that weren’t anticipated.</p>
<p>One proposal is that you should track all of these tasks, no matter how small, in JIRA. But the teams I see successful at implementing this are those that can afford to work at a slower, more “enterprise” pace. Which isn’t a problem—at least for engineering—but it’s often not an option at smaller startups, when learning cycles must be fast.</p>
<p><em>Even if you work at a larger company, at a slower pace, you may relate when it comes to personal life: tasks come from a variety of directions, at all times. You can’t toss every minor task in a task manager.</em></p>
<p>You can’t fix every task before the next one comes in. If you only use JIRA, you choose between possibly forgetting these small tasks, or breaking your train of thought to search, categorize, and fill out a form every time you get a small task.</p>
<p>On the flip side, quickly writing these down in a temporary place means that <strong>you don’t need to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend mental effort remembering minor tasks,</li>
<li>or take significant time to file minor issues.</li>
<li>Have your task manager filled with minor issues you’ve forgotten to close,</li>
<li>or leave hastily-written issues for later, when you forget what the vaguely titled issue is for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="correcting-for-the-mistakes">Correcting for the mistakes</h2>
<p>The solution is not complicated: use a temporary, personal task manager.</p>
<p>Don’t go out and buy something new. You already have something you can use at home. Tim’s notebook is a good example. I personally message myself on Slack (and iMessage, for personal use).</p>
<details zgotmplz="">

<div>
<h4 id="using-slack-for-daily-personal-tasks">Using Slack for daily personal tasks</h4>
<p>When I’m working, and get a non-urgent task that would otherwise interrupt me, it goes in my Slack DMs. This is what it looks like:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7647.jpg">
</p>
<p>Some days are quiet</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7644.jpg">
</p>
<p>And some are hectic</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the morning, to re-build yesterday’s context, I just look at yesterday’s list. If there are unfinished items, I can carry them over. But it’s a conscious decision. I don’t need to carry over optional, low-priority tasks.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got a bad memory, there’s a huge benefit for team stand-ups. I used to write JQL filters to search JIRA (doesn’t work—and misses tasks), now I just take a look at Slack.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>The important requirements are just that your task manager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requires effort to carry over old tasks.</li>
<li>Makes writing down tasks quick.</li>
<li>Isn’t used for notes <em>(anecdotally, this adds noise, and forces you to parse notes from tasks)</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a task is critical, long term, or requires cooperation, file it in your normal issue tracker. Otherwise, it’s probably a daily, personal task, and you can file it in here.</p>
<p>So take out a notebook, open Slack, pick what works for you. And see if you don’t feel calmer and more in control of your tasks.</p>
<hr>


<p>I think these tools have interesting ideas to help individuals manage tasks.</p>
<h3 id="amna">Amna</h3>
<p>Ravi, my old college roommate and friend since high school, left Microsoft to build <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">Amna</a>, a personal task manager with tight browser integration.</p>
<p>I resonate with the thesis: recently I switched away from Firefox Tree Style Tabs, because I noticed that by organizing my tabs (which were part of tasks), it inadvertently became a de-facto task manager. But it wasn’t built for that!</p>
<p>Amna solves that exact problem: each task you do spawns a browser that keeps all of your relevant tabs.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna1.jpg">
</p>
<p>All the tabs in this browser window are related to the same task, and Amna keeps their state when I close the browser.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna2.jpg">
</p>
<p>After I'm done with a task, I can go back and look at the tabs I had open.</p>
</div>
<p>It helps prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle-memory opening HN, clicking an interesting blog post, and leaving it open “to read later” for several weeks</li>
<li>The pain of trawling through bookmarks and browser history, when you realize you forgot something</li>
<li>The clutter of leaving tabs open to prevent forgetting something</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve forgotten a time when you had less than five tabs open, <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">try using Amna</a>.</p>
<h3 id="jam">Jam</h3>
<p>Two of my ex-Cloudflare friends, Dani and Irtefa, started <a href="https://jam.dev/">Jam</a>. It’s probably the fastest way for PMs/designers to directly make comments on a website. So you get less minor interruptions, and more clarity on the requested change.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/jam2.jpg">
</p>
<p>All you do is type `jam` on the page, click an element, and type the comment</p>
</div>
<p>But I don’t include Jam here just for that. Jam also allows you to <a href="https://words.jam.dev/introducing-jam-wand/">offload the actual copy changes</a> to your PM, which flat-out decreases your minor tasks. If this sounds exciting, get on the waitlist <a href="https://jam.dev/">here</a>.</p>

In this article, I'll be discussing some of the studies that have covered this subject along with some of the solutions to reduce the amount of blue light you're being subjected to.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-cpun"><span>What is Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bj5bp"><span>Sunlight is composed of red, yellow, orange, green, and blue light rays and many shades of each of these colours, depending on the energy and wavelength of the individual rays (otherwise known as <!-- -->electromagnetic radiation<!-- -->). Combined, this spectrum of coloured light rays creates sunlight called “white light”.</span></p><p id="viewer-bc2fl"><span>Without getting into the details, there is an inverse relationship between the wavelength of light rays and the amount of energy they contain.</span></p><p id="viewer-825iu"><span>This means that the rays on the red end of the visible light spectrum have longer wavelengths and, therefore, less energy. On the other hand, rays on the blue end of the spectrum have shorter wavelengths and more energy.</span></p><p id="viewer-15gnj"><span>Not all colours of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost your mood, attention and reaction times, however, studies suggest they're more disruptive at night.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-65vu6"><span>What exposes you to Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bi01v"><span>Although sunlight is the biggest source of Blue Light that you'll be subjected too, here are some of the others:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-cugnd"><p>LED light</p></li><li id="viewer-di5pk"><p>Fluorescent light</p></li><li id="viewer-ads93"><p>Flat-screen LED televisions</p></li><li id="viewer-7b2ak"><p>Computer monitors</p></li><li id="viewer-ep37g"><p>Smartphones and tablet screens</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5valn"><span>Although you receive a lot less Blue Light from these sources than from the sun, it's the fact that we tend to use them more and more before going to bed that is of concern.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-qt2o"><span><strong><span>Suggested Articles:</span></strong></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-apq6a"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a><strong>

During the study, some participants were instructed to wear special glasses that blocked blue light wavelengths whilst the rest didn't. The results showed that the people in the study that wore these glasses produced more melatonin than those who didn’t and hence, had a better night's sleep.</span></p><p id="viewer-8nqqi"><span>These studies do seem pretty conclusive, however since then others have said otherwise.</span></p><p id="viewer-8kim"><span>In 2019, a group of researchers at the University of Manchester in the U.K. <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31368-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>challenged that notion</u></a>. After exposing mice to lights that were different in hue but equal brightness and assessing their subsequent activity, the researchers concluded that yellow light actually seems to disturb sleep more than blue. Warm-toned light, they hypothesized, could trick the body into thinking it’s daytime, while cooler blue light more closely mimics twilight.</span></p><p id="viewer-7o6g0"><span>It is important to note however, that animals studies don't always reflect the entire reality, as they often can't translate directly to human behavior. Furthermore, since rodents are nocturnal, they may respond differently to light than humans do. Finally the lights were also kept very dim, regardless of color, which may not property represent the bright lights of electronics.</span></p><p id="viewer-b6bbs"><span>Because of these conditions, the results of the study can't be taken too seriously, given how many previous ones have concluded that Blue Light has a negative impact on sleep.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-2fn3f"><span>How to minimise the effects </span></h3><p id="viewer-ctu4b"><span>If you're worried that Blue Light might be affecting your sleep, here are a few solutions:</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-fljja"><p>First of all, try and <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/how-can-we-reduce-our-screen-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>cut down on your screen time</u></a>. By doing this you'll be subjecting your eyes to less Blue Light from being on your computer or smartphone. <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/how-can-we-reduce-our-screen-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Here's an article</u></a> I wrote to help reduce screen time and stay active.</p></li><li id="viewer-9htd6"><p>Try not to look at your devices just before bed. Consider turning off your phone a few hours before bed to avoid letting Blue Light affect your sleep.</p></li><li id="viewer-fo8o1"><p>Consider buying Blue Light filtering glasses, they're widely available and can help to reduce Blue Light if you need to use your devices a lot during the day.</p></li><li id="viewer-aps00"><p>Blue Light screen protectors are also available to buy. If you think you'll forget to wear your glasses then blue light screen protectors can be a useful alternative seeing as you only need to apply it once.</p></li><li id="viewer-fnvc5"><p>Use different lights: LED light bulbs in your house can also emit blue light, so instead of using bright white lights, you could try switching to dimmer red lights closer to bedtime so you are exposed to less blue light.</p></li></ol><h3 id="viewer-82ggv"><span>The bottom line</span></h3><p id="viewer-1fhfe"><span>The bottom line is that most studies conclude that too much Blue Light, especially in the evening, can have a negative impact on your sleep. How much it affects us is up for debate, everybody may not notice the same effects but it definitely can't hurt to try and minimise the amount of blue light we're be subjected too, whether it's from generally <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/how-can-we-reduce-our-screen-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>reducing our screen time</u></a> or thanks go a pair of dedicated Blue Light glasses.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-1kir8"><span><strong><span>More from The Detechtor:</span></strong></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-fdnuu"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a><strong>

For the last 2 years I’ve been working on a web browser that now cannot be completed because Google, the creators of the <em>open source</em> browser Chrome, won’t allow DRM in an <em>open source</em> project.</p><p>The browser I’m building, called <a href="https://github.com/samuelmaddock/metastream">Metastream</a>, is an Electron-based (Chromium derived), MIT-licensed browser hosted on GitHub. Its main feature is the ability to playback videos on the web, synchronized with other peers. Each client runs its own instance of the Metastream browser and transmits playback information to keep them in sync—no audio or video content is sent.</p><p>If someone is creating a browser that wants to playback media, they’ll soon discover the requirement of DRM for larger web media services such as Netflix and Hulu. There are a few DRM providers for the web including Widevine, PlayReady, and FairPlay.</p><p>As far as I’m aware, Widevine is the only available DRM for a Chromium-based browser, especially so for Electron. Chromium accounts for roughly <strong>70% market share</strong> of all web browsers, soon to include <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10">Microsoft’s upcoming Edge browser rewrite</a>. Waiting 4 months for a minimal response from a vendor with such a large percentage of the market is unacceptable.</p><p>This isn’t something I’m alone in either, <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12427">several Electron users</a> have waited months for a response. More prominently, the creators of Brave Browser also had <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/10449#issuecomment-323800130">issues waiting for replies from Google Widevine</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“This is a prime example for why free as in beer is not enough. Small share browsers are at the mercy of Google, and Google is stalling us for no communicated-to-us reason.”<br>- Brian Bondy, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Brave</p></blockquote><p>I’m now only left with two options regarding the fate of Metastream: stop development of a desktop browser version, or pivot my project to a browser extension with reduced features. The latter requiring publishing to the Google Chrome Web Store which would further entrench the project into a Google walled garden.</p><p>If you know of any way to help out, <a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/contact">please get in touch</a>.</p><p><strong>April 4th edit:</strong> No response from Google Widevine yet. Because a few folks asked, here is the <a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/widevine/gmail-thread.html">full email exchange I had with Widevine</a>. The initial response was received after getting in contact with another browser vendor to ping a Widevine contact they have.

  </ul>

  <p><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/guides/children.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you read our other blog posts you might already know that around 90% of the people on our planet are breathing dirty air, and that an estimate of 7 million people die every year due to it <span data-cites="world_health_organization_2018">[1]</span>. You might also know that nearly half a million babies died in 2019 due to dirty air <span data-cites="state_of_global_air">[2]</span>.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that dirty air is bad for both children and adults, but all this might be a bit abstract for a parent. This blog post will mainly look at how the air can impact the development of children and how the air quality relates to absenteeism in school, for both children and teachers.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-childrens-cognitive-development">Impact on Children’s Cognitive Development</h2>
<p>There are multiple studies indicating that poor air quality can have an negative impact on a child’s cognitive development.</p>
<p>In a study <span data-cites="wang_2017">[3]</span> carried out in Los Angeles and surrounding counties, it was found that for every increase 2.5µg/m<sup>3</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub> during the pre-teen and teen years, one performance IQ point was lost. Performance IQ is related to ones ability to solve new problems, and it is to a greater extent controlled by brain function, as opposed to something you can learn <span data-cites="boyd-barrett_2018">[4]</span>.</p>
<p>In a report by Unicef <span data-cites="rees_2017">[5]</span> it is mentioned how air pollution can impact memory and verbal and non-verbal IQ. Furthermore, it is mentioned that test scores and average grades (GPA) have been shown to be negatively impacted by air pollution exposure. Also prenatal exposure is discussed. A study they mention showed that prenatal exposure to air pollution resulted in a four-point drop in IQ by the age of 5. In addition to this study, also <span data-cites="monica_2018">[6]</span> shows that exposure during fetal life can have negative consequences on brain development. Air pollution seems to haunt us throughout our whole lives, from foetus to when old (especially if you are male) <span data-cites="un_environment_2018">[7]</span>.</p>
One of the studies referenced in the Unicef report looked at 2,715 children between 7 and 10 years old in schools in Barcelona <span data-cites="sunyer_2015">[8]</span>. The study concludes <q>Children attending schools with higher traffic-related air pollution had a smaller improvement in cognitive development.</q>. However, the editor comments:
<blockquote>
Importantly, these findings do not prove that traffic-related air pollution causes impairment of cognitive development. Rather, they suggest that the developing brain may be vulnerable to traffic-related air pollution well into middle childhood, a conclusion that has implications for the design of air pollution regulations and for the location of new schools. <span data-cites="sunyer_2015">[8]</span>
</blockquote>
<p>In <span data-cites="emily_2018">[9]</span> researchers looked at children when they were 9 months old and then 3 years old. They observed that exposure to high levels of NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with lower verbal ability at the age of 3. They also looked at indoor damp or condensation (which can be a hint for poor ventilation), and observed that it was associated with reduced verbal ability. Furthermore, they looked at exposure to second hand smoking, which perhaps unsurprisingly was also associated with lower verbal ability at the age of 3 years.</p>
<p>Researchers have also looked at the commute to school and found that PM<sub>2.5</sub> and black carbon (BC) exposure was associated with diminished growth of working memory <span data-cites="alvarez_2017">[10]</span>.</p>
<p>The findings seem fairly consistent - dirty air is harmful. We therefore believe it is worth paying attention to the air quality in the environments where our children spend a large portion of their early lives. We can not eliminate air pollution exposure, but at least it can be reduced thorugh awareness and taking actions if needed.</p>
<p>Also IQAir has looked at this topic and written an article <q><a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/lp/blog/new-parents/can-clean-air-increase-child-iq">Can clean air increase child IQ?</a></q>. They found some of the same references as we, but also some others. We recommend you to have a look if you are curious about this topic.</p>
<h2 id="cleaner-air-leads-to-fewer-sick-days">Cleaner Air Leads to Fewer Sick Days</h2>
<p>Perhaps more concrete than air pollution’s impact on cognitive development is how it affect the number of sick days. This can naturally also in turn impact a child’s development, since day care (or school) is supposed to be a place where children both have fun and learn new things.</p>
<p>One study <span data-cites="rosen_1999">[11]</span> found that with air purification non-attendance was decreased by 55% in a preschool. Another experiment, also in a Swedish preschool, showed a reduced sick-leave of at least 22.5% <span data-cites="jagemo_2019">[12]</span>.</p>
<p>A school in Finland also observed reduced sick leave <span data-cites="genano">[13]</span>, as well as improved concentration, after installing air purifiers. However, we couldn’t find any numbers for how much.</p>
<p>In London, following the release of The Mayor’s School Air Quality Audit Programme <span data-cites="london">[14]</span>, a number of schools followed the recommendation to get air purifiers. 56 teachers were surveyed after getting air purifiers, and more than half of them reported having noticed a decrease in sick leave among themselves and children <span data-cites="blueair_2019">[15]</span>.</p>
<p>There is also some support for reduced absenteeism among teachers with better air quality, for instance <span data-cites="ervasti_2012">[16]</span> found such a connection. We will in the future look into absenteeism at workplaces and its relation to air quality. We suspect there will be more research about that than teachers specifically.</p>
<p>The Västra Götaland Regional Council in Sweden has observed large variations in sick leave among preschools and theorize that this might be due to differences in indoor air quality <span data-cites="vg_2017">[17]</span>. This is expanded on <span data-cites="gustafsson_2017">[18]</span> in Läkartidningen, the official Journal of the Swedish medical association. The doctors point out that the indoor air often has more particles than the outdoor air (in Sweden), both because of indoor activities and that small particles from traffic get in. Children are said to be especially vulnerable to air pollution. The doctors theorize that indoor pollution act as an additional burden on children’s immune system, which risks making it less able to cope with viruses.</p>
<p>Important to note is that many of the above references have links to companies with commercial interests. Sadly, it is hard to find studies without any ties to industry. We found at least two double-blind studies <span data-cites="reisman_1990">[19]</span> <span data-cites="weichenthal_2013">[20]</span> supporting health benefits of air pollution reduction through the usage of air purifiers though. Note that also the European Commission did a research project called SINPHONIE looking at improving air quality in schools and kindergartens. See the <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC91160/lbna26738enn.pdf">final report</a> for a deep dive into this topic. They also cover absenteeism, and on top of <span data-cites="rosen_1999">[11]</span>, they reference <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47620251_Association_between_substandard_classroom_ventilation_rates_and_students'_academic_achievement">Association between substandard classroom ventilation rates and students’ academic achievement</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11146405_Indoor_air_microbes_and_respiratory_symptoms_of_children_in_moisture_damaged_and_reference_schools">Indoor air microbes and respiratory symptoms of children in moisture damaged and reference schools</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45200045_The_Impact_of_School_Building_Conditions_on_Student_Absenteeism_in_Upstate_New_York">The Impact of School Building Conditions on Student Absenteeism in Upstate New York</a>. All in support for that there’s a link between air quality and absenteeism.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We believe there’s enough supportive evidence for it being worth to make sure that the indoor air quality is good (below <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health">WHO limits</a>), and if not, take action. We’ll try to write a new post in the future more focused on what one can do, but meanwhile, some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Especially if you are pregnant, have a baby or young child, pay attention to outdoor air pollution and consider an air purifier if pollution is high. It appears that air pollution may be more harmful the younger the child is.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider asking your preschool to get an air purifier if it is located close to heavy traffic or the air quality seems low. Some preschools are already aware of this, for instance <a href="http://eduwingskids.com/air-quality-in-eduwings-kindergarten/">Eduwings</a> have a strategy in place. Sadly it appears that mainly private expensive preschools are using air purifiers, at least in China <span data-cites="dandan_2016">[21]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce indoor activities that can lead to increased air pollution. For instance high temperature cooking, usage of candles or other indoor combustion. A well maintained kitchen hood and ventilation system can mitigate air pollution build-up. But you can also just open your window when cooking with high temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefer walking in the forest or through a park rather than along roads with high traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>Install an app, such as <a href="https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-app">IQAir’s Air Visual</a>. It can help you to know when air pollution is high, so that you can reduce air pollution exposure. For instance by staying indoors the worst days, preferably in a room with an air purifier. Or at least avoiding heavy outdoor exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize second hand smoking, especially if you are pregnant, have a baby or young children.</p></li>
</ul>

January 20, 2021 | https://materialize.com/a-simple-and-efficient-real-time-application-powered-by-materializes-tail-command/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.com/a-simple-and-efficient-real-time-application-powered-by-materializes-tail-command/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Within the web development community, there has been a clear shift towards frameworks that implement incremental view maintenance and for good reason. When state is updated incrementally, applications perform better and require fewer resources. Using Materialize, developers and data analysts can adopt the same, event driven techniques in their data processing pipelines, leveraging existing SQL know-how. In this blog post, we will build an application to demonstrate how developers can create real-time, event-driven experiences for their users, powered by Materialize.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:<br>
This post is the fulfillment of the goals that I had when writing <a href="https://materialize.com/streaming-tail-to-the-browser-a-one-day-project/">Streaming TAIL to the Browser</a>. That post is not required to understand this post but familiarizing yourself with the <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/tail/#main">TAIL command</a> is recommended.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Demonstration of What We Will Be Building</h3>
<p>In this post, we are going to use the demo from our documentation’s <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/">Get Started tutorial</a> as the basis for building a minimal web application. The application allows users to see the total number of edits made to Wikipedia, as well as a bar chart of the top 10 editors. Here is an animation that shows the final result:</p>
<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201766%201296%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10-live-1.gif" alt="" width="1766" height="1296"></p>
<hr>
<p>Want to run this demo yourself? Awesome! Clone our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize">repository</a> and follow the instructions for <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/ea5a6f0603875b752745838eb1228a90fc7e8476/play/wikirecent#running-it-yourself">Running it Yourself</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Desired Properties of the Solution</h3>
<p>Before jumping into how to build this, let’s outline the desired properties for our solution. The final solution should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Push-Based</strong> – Instead of having the client poll for updates, updates should be initiated by the server and only when the client state is outdated.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong> – Clients should present both a consistent and complete view of the data, regardless of when the application is loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Unbuffered</strong> – Clients should receive updates as soon as changes are made to the underlying datasets, without arbitrary delays in the data pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Economic</strong> – Size of updates should be a function of the difference between the current state and the desired state. Additionally, clients should not be required to replay state from the start of history.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong> – Applications modifying the source data (writers) should not need to know anything about the applications consuming the data (readers).</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is possible for other applications to meet several of these properties, I hope that this application will demonstrate why the solution presented is ideal for this scenario. A discussion of why this application meets the above properties, and why other solutions likely do not, is presented further down in this post.</p>
<h3>Overall Architecture</h3>
<p>For those unfamiliar with our getting started demo, here is the flow of data in our pipeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wikirecent-Dataflow-e1611101124886.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wikirecent-Dataflow-e1611101124886.png" alt="" width="1404" height="1872"></p>
<p>Looking at the system diagram below, we see that the entire data pipeline is contained within a single materialized instance:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-sheets-page-17.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-sheets-page-17.png" alt="" width="1404" height="1872"></p>
<p>Let’s discuss the role of each service in the diagram above.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you started the application, you can run <code>mzcompose ps</code> to see the containers started.</p>
<hr>
<h4>curl — wikirecent_stream_1</h4>
<p>This container runs <code>curl</code> to stream Wikimedia’s recent changelog to a file called <code>recentchanges</code> within a Docker volume shared with our materialized instance.</p>
<h4>materialized — wikirecent_materialized_1</h4>
<p>This container runs an instance of <code>materialized</code>, configured to tail the <code>recentchanges</code> file and maintain our two materialized views: <code>counter</code> and <code>top10</code>. The views in this instance are configured exactly as documented in <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/#create-a-real-time-stream%22">Getting Started – Create a real-time Stream</a>.</p>
<h4>Python web server — wikirecent_app_1</h4>
<p>This container runs a Python web server that hosts the code for our JavaScript application and converts the row-oriented results from <code>TAIL</code> to the batch-oriented results expected by our application.</p>
<h2>Building Our Application</h2>
<p>Our example application is an asynchronous Python web server built using two libraries: <a href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/index.html">Tornado</a> and <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/">psycopg3</a>. There are three components to our application that I would like to call out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python code to subscribe to materialized view updates using the <code>TAIL</code> command and&nbsp;convert the row-oriented results into batches.</li>
<li>Python code to broadcast batches to listeners.</li>
<li>JavaScript code to apply batch updates for efficient browser updates.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Materialize uses the word <em>batch</em> to refer to a data structure that expresses the difference between prior state and desired state. You can think of a batch as a “data diff”.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Output for Our JavaScript Code</h3>
<p>To efficiently update our client view state, we wish to present a stream of batches over a websocket to any configured listeners. We define a batch as the following:</p>
<pre><code>batch = {"inserted": [ // array of rows to add to our dataset
],
"deleted": [ // array of rows to remove from our dataset
],
"timestamp": 0 // Materialize-defined timestamp
}
</code></pre>
<p>When a client first connects, we send a compacted view of all batches from the beginning of history:</p>
<pre><code>def add_listener(self, conn):
    """Insert this connection into the list that will be notified on new messages."""
    # Write the most recent view state to catch this listener up to the current state of the world
    conn.write_message(
        {
            "deleted": [],
            "inserted": self.current_rows,
            "timestamp": self.current_timestamp,
        }
    )
    self.listeners.add(conn) # subscribe to the stream of batches
</code></pre>
<p>How can listeners bootstrap their state using a batch object? If there is one property that I find particularly beautiful about this solution, it’s that first batch applied to an empty list <em>is</em> our initial state. This means that initializing and updating are the same operation. This batch object is so useful that D3’s <a href="https://d3js.org/#enter-exit">update</a> and Vega’s <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/#view_change">change</a> APIs expect updates to come in a similar form.</p>
<p>However, results from tail are row-oriented. We need a little bit of code to convert from rows to batches; here is an example of the desired conversion:</p>
<pre><code># We need to convert this stream of rows...
1608081358001 f -1 ['Lockal', '4590']
1608081358001 f 1 ['Epidosis', '4595']
1608081358001 f -1 ['Matlin', '5220']
1608081358001 f 1 ['Matlin', '5221']
1608081359001 t \N ['\\N', '\\N']

# ...to this data structure.
timestamp = 1608081358001
inserted = [('Epidosis', '4595'), ('Matlin', '5221')]
deleted = [('Lockal', '4590'), ('Matlin', '5220')]
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at the code to subscribe to view updates and transform rows into batches.</p>
<h3>Subscribing to TAIL</h3>
<p>To process rows from <code>TAIL</code>, we must first declare a cursor object that will be used to indefinitely iterate over rows. To help with our code know when to broadcast an update, we ask for progress markers in the response:</p>
<pre><code>async def tail_view(self):
    """Spawn a coroutine that sets up a coroutine to process changes from TAIL."""
    async with await self.mzql_connection() as conn:
        async with await conn.cursor() as cursor:
            query = f"DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR TAIL {self.view_name} WITH (PROGRESS)"
            await cursor.execute(query)
            await self.tail_view_inner(cursor)
</code></pre>
<h3>Converting Rows to Batches</h3>
<p>We’ve now created a communication channel which can be used to await results from the tail query. Whenever our view changes, our application will be notified immediately and we can read the rows from our cursor object. <code>tail_view_inner</code> implements the logic to process rows and convert them to batches:</p>
<pre><code>async def tail_view_inner(self, cursor):
    """Read rows from TAIL, converting them to updates and broadcasting them."""
    inserted = []
    deleted = []
    while True:
        # Block until there are new results (FETCH is not buffered)
        await cursor.execute(f"FETCH ALL cur")

        async for (timestamp, progressed, diff, *columns) in cursor:
            # The progressed column serves as a synchronization primitive indicating that all
            # rows for an update have been read. We should publish this update.
            if progressed:
                self.update(deleted, inserted, timestamp)
                inserted = []
                deleted = []
                continue

            # Simplify our implementation by creating "diff" copies of each row instead
            # of tracking counts per row
            if diff &lt; 0: deleted.extend([columns] * abs(diff)) elif diff &gt; 0:
                inserted.extend([columns] * diff)
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Bad data from TAIL: {row}")
</code></pre>
<h3>Updating Internal State and Broadcasting to Listeners</h3>
<p>Now that we have a batch object, we apply this change to our own internal <code>VIEW</code> and broadcast the change to all listeners:</p>
<pre><code>def update(self, deleted, inserted, timestamp):
    """Update our internal view based on this diff."""
    self.current_timestamp = timestamp￼

    # Remove any rows that have been deleted
    for r in deleted:
        self.current_rows.remove(r)

    # And add any rows that have been inserted
    self.current_rows.extend(inserted)

    # If we have listeners configured, broadcast this diff
    if self.listeners:
        payload = {"deleted": deleted, "inserted": inserted, "timestamp": timestamp}
        self.broadcast(payload)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>Design Decision</strong>:<br>
Experienced readers will note that by maintaining an internal copy of the view in our Python web server, we can reduce the number of connections to the materialize instance. This is a strictly optional design decision that I made when writing this code — materialized connections are very light-weight when compared to other databases. We expect that there will be use cases where you will want one or more materialized connection per user. Consider temporary materialized views feeding dashboards personalized to each user, for example.</p>
<p>In the case of this application, I opted to reduce the connections out of habit rather than necessity. It does also enable a larger degree of fan-out, if we wanted to serve millions of clients, for example.</p>

<h3>Updating User Views</h3>
<p>Now that we have looked at the code for broadcasting an update, let’s show how our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/blob/main/play/wikirecent/app/src/templates/index.html">JavaScript code</a> consumes these batches. Our application is showing two things: a <em>total edits counter</em> and a <em>top 10 chart</em>:</p>

            <article>
                <p>In computer programming, Flow-Based Programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm, discovered/invented by <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/index.html">J. Paul Rodker Morrison</a> in the late '60s, that uses a "data processing factory" metaphor for designing and building applications.  FBP defines applications as networks of "black box" processes, which communicate via data chunks (called Information Packets) travelling across predefined connections (think "conveyor belts"), where the connections are specified externally to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is thus naturally component-oriented.</p>
                <p>FBP is a special case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow">dataflow</a> programming characterized by asynchronous, concurrent processes "under the covers", Information Packets with defined lifetimes, named ports, "bounded buffer" connections, and definition of connections external to the components - it has been found to support improved development time and maintainability, reusability, rapid prototyping, simulation, improved performance, and good communication among developers,  maintenance staff, users, systems people, and management - not to mention that FBP naturally takes advantage of multiple cores... without the programmer having to struggle with the intricacies of multitasking!</p>
               <p>FBP exhibits "data coupling", described in the article on coupling as the loosest type of coupling between components. The concept of loose coupling is in turn related to that of service-oriented architectures, and FBP fits a number of the criteria for such an architecture, albeit at a more fine-grained level than most examples of this architecture.</p>
					<p>FBP promotes high-level, functional style of specifications that simplify reasoning about system behavior. An example of this is the distributed data flow model for constructively specifying and analyzing the semantics of distributed multi-party protocols.</p>
                <p><img src="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/bottling_factory.png" alt="Bottling factory" height="400"> </p>
                
                <p>
                    FBP involves a significant "paradigm shift" from conventional programming, as it uses an "assembly line" image of data processing, which really has to be used to experience its advantages.  Not surprisingly given the hold that the so-called "von Neumann" paradigm has over programming technology, over the last 40+ years a number of companies have come out with FBP-like or "FBP-inspired" systems (to borrow a term coined by Joe Witt of Cloudera), which do not involve this paradigm shift, including some of the biggest and most successful companies in the industry, such as IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the New York Times (see <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/links_external.html">FBP External References</a>).  Unfortunately, without the FBP paradigm shift, these systems cannot fully achieve the advantages listed above, although most of them combine a visual notation with some degree of componentry.  We have therefore been forced to use the term "classical FBP" to refer to the FBP architecture described in this web site.  It is hard for someone reading documentation to tell whether a given product calling itself "FBP- like" is "classical" or not,  but, roughly, multiple input ports, "back pressure", and asynchronism, constitute a sort of litmus test to check whether systems should be classed as "classical" FBP systems. While the FBP paradigm shift may cause some trouble at first, given the prevalence of the older programming approaches, in fact it embodies a simple mental model (not "simple" as in easy but "simple" as in elegant, to quote Joe Witt), and has proven over several decades to result in applications that are more understandable and maintainable than those built using the conventional (von Neumann) paradigm.
                </p>
	    <p>If you <i>have</i> come across Flow-Based Programming by way of NoFlo, Flowhub, Node-RED, or similar packages, it is recommended that you read <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/fbp-inspired-vs-real-fbp.html"><i>FBP vs. FBP-inspired Systems</i></a>, which attempts to highlight the differences and similarities between FBP proper, or "classical" FBP, (the subject of this web site) on the one hand, and NoFlo and other similar "FBP-inspired" systems on the other. </p>
                <p>FBP is described in J. Paul Morrison's book, <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/book.html">Flow-Based Programming: A New Approach to Application Development"</a>, now in its 2nd edition, which can be obtained in paperback form from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-2nd-Application-Development/dp/1451542321">Amazon</a>, or in 2 e-book formats: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-J-Paul-Morrison-ebook/dp/B004PLO66O">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/j-paul-morrison/flow-based-programming-2nd-edition/ebook/product-21172063.html">epub</a>.</p>
                <p>Further down on this web page you will find a bunch of useful links, including some videos demonstrating the use of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp/blob/master/README.md">DrawFBP</a>.  During FBP's early days, networks were coded by hand, and initially we used pencil and paper, followed by more sophisticated graphical tools, whether or not they played well with FBP software.  However, with the advent of good graphical support, we now have a powerful graphical tool (<a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp">DrawFBP</a>), and in recent years the emphasis has been shifting to doing the diagramming on-line, and then generating the network code (we can see this progression with other flow tools on the market).  Now that compile and run functions (for Java and C#) have been added to DrawFBP, the developer can do much of the development graphically, and on-line.
                </p>    
                <p>We are in the process of "growing" a <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/fbp-tutorial-filter-file">tutorial</a> which will introduce the reader to the basic concepts of FBP by means of a series of "steps", which use the diagramming tool DrawFBP to progressively expand an application diagram and generate and run code at many of those steps.  </p>            
            <p>There is a Google group on FBP, with almost 800 members, and a Slack channel has recently been set up - here is the invitation link, if you are interested in joining: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/fbphq/shared_invite/enQtOTM4ODkzMTYyODE3LTJiMmNlZjhiMWY1MDY1ODA4Y2YzNDBlNDZlMTBkMDNlMjcwNzg2MGZhZjA2NjJjYTliYTM0OTIyYmM0Yzk0MDQ">Slack invitation</a>.</p>

                <!--<p>We know you are tired of Powerpoint presentations, but <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/FBPnew.ppt">this one</a> (from 2007) gives quite a good overview of FBP - as it was at that time.  There is also a <a href="http://player.vimeo.com/video/79329015">video</a> (not very professional, I'm afraid!), where I present this at a Meetup in Toronto in Sept. 2013 organized by Paul Tarvydas, CEO of Tarvydas-Sanford Controls Inc., and Dann Toliver. It has a few jokes and reminiscences, and may be more accessible than the straight Powerpoint presentation!   The Paul referred to in the video is Paul Tarvydas. Towards the end (at 40:12) there is a brief demo of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="..\graphicsstuff\index.shtml">DrawFBP</a>.</p>-->

                <li>The world is asynchronous - don't try to force the systems we build into a synchronous framework!</li>
                <li>The von Neumann paradigm is only appropriate within a <i>single</i> process!  Duh!</li>
                <li>A process needs to be able to have more than one input port, and needs to be able to choose which one to receive from! </li>
                <li>If a process's upstream connection fills up, the process feeding it will be suspended (unless the connection is marked "DropOldest")  ("back pressure")</li>

We see it everywhere: from how innovation happens, how languages and cultures form, to how markets operate. </p><p>When you look at the world through the lens of evolution, what’s opaque becomes common sense and your vision of the world changes in kind.</p><p>The same, I think, can be said with Nassim Taleb’s <em>Incerto</em>. Yes, I have just compared him with Darwin.</p><p>Time will tell, but I think it’s merited. I’ve re-read Taleb’s work at least four times now, and each time I come out with new realizations. Similar to evolution, his ideas of Black Swans and Antifragility sprout up all around us. It can change everything from how you eat, how you work, how you build friendships, how you invest, how you innovate, and much more.</p><p>I wanted to share the most impactful idea that I got out of it with you. This is my own words, and it is nowhere near enough to capture his work’s complete implication. I hope it gives you an exciting lens and piques your curiosity enough to read Taleb’s books.</p><p>The place to start is with the question: <em>how does the future happen</em>? </p><p>We often think that it’s an unfolding of predictable events. It certainly seems that way when you read history. For example, we learn that World War I was an obvious consequence: countries were arming and had all these pacts, so of course, the war was a foregone conclusion. </p><p>But this is one of the most incredible illusions of all. With World War I, for example, we went from assassination in Austria-Hungary to an all-out war between superpowers in a matter of…<em>one week</em>. </p><p>No one predicted that. It would be analogous to China and America declaring hostilities next Friday. </p><p>This idea would have been hard to swallow before 2019, but I think enough has happened for us to reflect. No one predicted the exact consequences of COVID. No one expected that protesters would storm into the capitol building in January.</p><p>If breathtaking changes can happen in a matter of days, we need to revise our beliefs about how the future unfolds. </p><p>It’s not predictable. Instead, what Taleb calls “Black Swans” drive the future. These are events that are so unlikely that they’re unpredictable and so consequential that they change reality as we know it.</p><p>And that puts us in an uncomfortable situation — in a world dominated by events you can’t predict, how do you live your life?</p><p>Here comes, I think, one of Taleb’s most meaningful insights. You can’t know the future, but you <em>can</em> know how well you could handle it.</p><p>Here’s what I mean. Take anything, and ask yourself: how would this react if something <em>out of the ordinary</em> happened? </p><p>For example, think about a piece of expensive china. Just about anything out of the ordinary would break it. At best, nothing terrible will happen. At worst, it will disintegrate. You could say that this piece of china is <em>fragile</em> towards the unexpected.</p><p>Now let’s look at a kettlebell. Up to a point, just about anything out of the ordinary would do <em>little harm</em> to the kettlebell. In most cases, nothing terrible will happen. It won’t suddenly become any better, but at least it won’t break. We could say that this kettlebell is <em>robust</em> towards the unexpected.</p><p>Now, consider this essay itself. If someone reads it and sees that it’s wrong, that person could let me know, and I would fix it. If they’re furious and make a fuss on the internet, it only gets more people reading it. And of course, if people love it, again more would read it. At <em>worse,</em> this essay will stay the same. In many cases, it will benefit. You could say that this essay is <em>antifragile</em> towards the unexpected <sup>1</sup>. </p><p>Nassim calls this the “triad” — fragile, robust, antifragile — and you can start to identify just about all aspects of life within it.</p><p>Just exploring this triad can fill you with insights. For example, tinkering is antifragile. Banks are fragile. Gold is robust. Dollars are fragile. Individuals are fragile at the expense of the collective, which is antifragile. Why, and what does it mean? Expounding on the consequences would take a series of books… so you can appreciate the beauty and breadth of Nassim’s work. </p><p>For this essay, I’ll focus on just one slice of one thing. What can you do with this triad in your own life? </p><p>Well, you can learn to <em>love</em> the future. If you can organize your life so that you remove your fragility and add antifragility, you can, as Nassim says, <em>“be the fire and wish for the wind.”</em> </p><p>Here’s how. Look over your life, and start to catalogue your exposure. </p><p>Is your work fragile, robust, or antifragile?
Are your finances fragile, robust, or antifragile? 
Are your attachments fragile, robust, or antifragile?</p><p>Now, take all that is fragile, and try to move them towards robust. </p><p>Here’s an example. Say you have most of your net worth invested in stocks. Are your fragile, robust, or antifragile? </p><p>Well, imagine if your portfolio increases by 20%. You’ll be happy for sure. But, imagine if your portfolio <em>decreases</em> by 20%. Likely, you’ll be devastated. You have more to lose than to gain from the unexpected here. This means that you are <em>fragile</em> in your investments. </p><p>How can you move this towards robust? Two ways. </p><p>The first is philosophical. Just write off a large part of your investment mentally. Maybe 50% <sup>2</sup>. Now, even if a 50% downturn happens, you only got what you expected. Arguably, you are robust towards the unexpected. </p><p>The second is practical. Move to more robust investments: stuff like gold, very cheap real estate in a small, resilient country, etc. </p><p>At this point, you may ask — you don’t <em>just</em> want robust. How can you <em>win</em>? </p><p>Well, now it’s time to add antifragility. </p><p>Can you set aside some amount for crazy risks? You can write this portion off completely, so at worst, what happens is what you expected: you lose it all. However, at best, you have upside. </p><p>The key is to choose the kind of activities that have a profound upside. If one win pays for a thousand losses, you are in a good place. How does this look? </p><p>Here’s a basket of ideas: start a company, invest in highly speculative ideas, make a youtube video, write a book, move to a city that excites you, learn to program, tinker, share. If you do that, suddenly, you can’t wait to see what the future holds. </p><p>Nassim calls this the “Barbell Strategy” — change your exposure to 90% robust, 10% antifragile. </p><p>Here’s one more example. Say you have a slight headache. There’s a new medication that could fix it. Should you take it? </p><p>Well, in the best case, your headache is gone. But since it’s slight, this is not such a big deal. At worst, who knows what can happen? Here, you are <em>fragile</em> towards this medication.</p><p>Now, imagine you are about to die, but a new, experimental medication can save you. At worst, you die, which is what you expect to happen. But, in the best case, you survive. Here, you are <em>antifragile</em> to this medication. </p><p>Wow. We've just used the triad as a compass for our life. Note the beauty here: at no point have we talked about specific risk modeling. It’s so simple that you don’t need any math. That’s pretty darn beautiful.</p><p>And with that, we learn one of the most interesting ideas: it’s not about predicting the future; it’s about not having to predict the future. </p><p>You know what books to check out for a much deeper, broader, and sometimes hilarious view. </p><p>Fair warning, though: the biggest complaint with Taleb is that he comes off as arrogant. I honestly think this is a misunderstanding in tone. Imagine whenever you read him that you’re talking with an animated elder, under a sunlit garden in Lebanon, with a good bottle of arak. You’ll see humor where there was arrogance.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Alex Reichert, Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Jacky Wang, Alexey Gurevich, for reviewing drafts of this essay</em> </p></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Even before the World Heath Organization (WHO) assigned Coronavirus pandemic status, people were already coming up with “creative” ways of avoiding infection, some more effective <a href="https://www.gatechecked.com/some-nervous-travelers-are-wearing-water-jugs-to-protect-themselves-against-coronavirus-2440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than others</a>.</p>
<p>Masks and face shields are still selling like hot cakes as hundreds of thousands of cases are recorded daily globally. Some companies have turned to more creative ways of capitalizing on the sudden demand for safety wear. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/biovyzr-venture-out-breathe-easy#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioVYZR</a>, for instance, is developing a consumer grade Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) and plans to introduce it to the market starting at $249. For reference, industrial PAPRs sell for well over $1,500.</p>
<p>For those who may not want to look like they’re suited up for a trip to the International Space Station, another startup company called MicroClimate has also developed their own smaller protective helmet, called the <a href="https://microclimate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AIR by MicroClimate</a>, which honestly looks like something from the dystopian future.</p>

<p>The AIR helmet tries to solve some of the problems faced when wearing masks. For starters, the unit features HEPA-filtered inlets and outlets, and has high-powered fans to keep air moving through the helmet, preventing stale air from collecting and fogging up the glass. According to the website, the battery provides the fans over 4 hours of life, and can be charged via the provided 6 foot long USB-C cable.</p>
<p>The big benefit here is the clear acrylic visor, taking away some of the “annoyances” of wearing traditional masks, like actually being able to see the person’s entire face and not having to struggle understanding what people say through those thicker cloth masks. Finally, the lower section has a washable cushion liner, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods.</p>

<p>With no mention about how sound travels through the device (maybe through the cloth lining at the back), I’m guessing the wearer would have to constantly be on the verge of a shouting match in order to be heard. Even though it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2XF4AsTtuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks relatively easy</a> to take off, I’m sorry for the folks out there who suffer from the regular runny nose.</p>
<p>Opinions about the helmet have been mixed, with some in favor and others out right mocking its design.</p>

January 20, 2021 | https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/20/why-outsource-auth/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/20/why-outsource-auth/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>You’re a software engineering leader, and you’re great at your job. You know that the optimal path for software development lies in figuring out which components of your design to implement from scratch and which have already been implemented by specialists and can be reused.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>You also know that these aren’t decisions that you can only make once – you have to keep reevaluating based on environment changes and the needs of new products.</p>

<p>Authentication is one of those components that you deal with all the time. Auth is a necessary part of any software product, but how you implement auth is not necessarily always the same. Careful consideration is needed, because your decision to outsource will not only impact speed of development, but also long-term product maintenance – you don’t want to slow down time to market because you re-implemented an entire auth system unnecessarily, but you also don’t want to use an auth system that is going to cause problems down the road.</p>

<p>So what are the primary considerations when making your decision?</p>

<h2 id="speed-to-market">Speed to market</h2>

<p>This is the most obvious consideration. Depending on the features you need, it could literally take months to implement auth in-house, whereas it could take less than a day to incorporate an outsourced solution.</p>

<p>You could say “but what if we only need a bare-bones implementation? Some salted hashes in a database and we’re good to go!” That’s a totally valid point, and if you don’t anticipate needing sophisticated auth features then your best bet might be to do a quick in-house implementation and move on.</p>

<p>However, time and time again I’ve seen product developers underestimate the sophistication of features that will be required when their userbases grow. Most of the time development organizations then fall prey to the sunk costs fallacy and double down on augmenting their in-house solution, even when it may be more efficient to abandon the home-grown effort and replace it with an outsourced solution. This will cause huge issues for maintainability, which I’ll talk about further below.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-breach">Consequences of an auth breach</h2>

<p>Planning for the worst possible case can prevent total financial ruin for your company or division. If a breach of security happens and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is leaked from your in-house auth system, it can not only cause your company reputational damage but also significant financial penalties (not to mention potential jail time if you try to cover up the breach).</p>

<p>If you outsource your auth system you can limit your liability, and also protect your reputation – if there is a breach on your auth provider’s side, it’s likely that the breach will extend beyond your company. A breach in an outsourced auth provider that is used by many different companies will be big news, and customers will be more likely to forgive you for making a mistake in your choice of auth provider than for implementing a poor auth system yourself.</p>

<p>A not-insignificant addendum is that I believe your in-house system is much more likely to suffer a breach than an outsourced provider who is an expert in security. I have no studies to support this claim, but I have never seen a major auth provider compromised, and I’ve definitely seen companies suffer breaches due to their own in-house auth implementations – <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/hacked-and-dumped-online-773-million-records-with-plaintext-passwords/">this article discusses a compilation of 21 million plaintext passwords collected from various breaches</a> wherein passwords were not hashed and salted by auth systems.</p>

<p>Properly storing passwords is an incredibly low bar, and yet companies that manage their own auth still do it incorrectly all the time.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-outage">Consequences of an auth outage</h2>

<p>While less damaging than breaches, outages can still cause reputational damage and liability issues if your SLAs make uptime guarantees. Similarly to breaches, if you outsource your auth system it’s likely that any auth outage will extend beyond your company.</p>

<p>As an example, when Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory (AAD) <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-azure-ad-authentication-outage-what-went-wrong/">went down for a good portion of the afternoon late last year</a>, logins for applications across the internet stopped working.</p>

<p>When your competitors’ authorization systems are down at the same time yours are, nobody blames you for it, but when you’re the only company having issues, you suffer reputationally. No matter what your outsourced auth system is (FusionAuth, Cognito, AAD, etc), you can be almost certain that you won’t be alone in the event of an outage.</p>

<h2 id="maintainability">Maintainability</h2>

<p>There are trade-offs here. The benefits to an in-house system include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your engineers can design the exact system to fit your needs, and you’ll have unrestricted ability to add very specific features if requirements change over time.</li>
  <li>If the same engineers who built the system are maintaining it, then they’ll have the context required to anticipate issues as they add features.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the drawbacks can be large:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex new features can take significant time to build. Outsourced auth systems likely have these features already built (things like multi-factor authentication, user management interfaces, analytics and audit logs, and brute force hack detection, among others).</li>
  <li>With an in-house solution, you’ll have to budget time to monitor new security threats and patch your system in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.</li>
  <li>You won’t get the benefits of a dedicated team that are constantly improving your auth system. This is actually a bigger deal than it seems, because if you outsource auth then other companies will also be filing issue reports and feature requests on your behalf, so you reap the benefits of those extra eyes as well.</li>
  <li>In the case of mergers or acquisitions, an in-house solution is likely to be terrible at combining different databases of users and managing things like duplicates or incomplete data. Such enterprise identity unification efforts can founder on internal auth systems. FusionAuth, on the other hand, supports modeling different user bases with tenants.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cost-of-in-house-vs-outsourced-auth">Cost of in-house vs outsourced auth</h2>

<p>When building an in-house auth system your costs are all ostensibly sunk (engineer salaries). However, if building your system in-house delays time to market or prevents creation of other features, the build could cost you a significant amount of real income. There will also be on-going maintenance costs with an in-house solution.</p>

<p>When making cost calculations, you should compare:</p>

<p><strong>Revenue lost by slower time-to-market PLUS engineering cost to implement in-house solution PLUS on-going maintenance costs of in-house solution PLUS increased risk of data breach PLUS increased risk of outage PLUS increased risk during a merger or acquisition</strong></p>

<p>vs</p>

<p><strong>The monthly cost incurred by an outsourced provider PLUS the lack of complete control</strong></p>

<p>When evaluating different auth providers, you’ll also want to consider whether an outsourced provider charges on a sliding scale based on number of users or if the cost is fixed. AWS Cognito, for instance, will continue to charge more as your application gains more users. FusionAuth, in contrast, has options that charge a single rate for unlimited users. If your app is small and you don’t expect it to grow much, a sliding scale may be better for you. If you don’t want a large unexpected bill as you gain more users, a provider that allows for fixed costs may be more appealing.</p>



<p>As a final consideration, you may want to evaluate if your engineers even have the ability to implement a secure in-house auth system without a significant investment in education. This is something that many leaders dismiss, since they have great faith in the intelligence and skill of their people.</p>

<p>However, knowledge and intelligence aren’t the same, and just because your engineers are capable of becoming auth experts doesn’t mean you want them to spend the time to do so.</p>

<p>As an engineering leader, you have a responsibility to ensure that your engineers are spending their time on efforts that will optimally contribute to the long-term success of your organization. Auth is a necessary component, but is it really a differentiator for your application?</p>

<p>Only you have the context to make the best decisions for your company, but I hope this article has helped you think through some of the considerations involved in outsourcing your auth.</p>

  <p>Jan 20, 2021</p>

<p>I moved this website “worldofmatthew.com” away from CloudFlare back in August 2020.</p>
<p>That should have been the end of the relation with CloudFlare for my website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while I was moving the L7 Anti-DDOS protection to path.net (via a reseller), I checked the SSL Transparency and noticed that CloudFlare still had a <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=3006080109&amp;opt=ocsp">vaild SSL certificate for this website</a>.</p>
<p>Even worse, this CloudFlare certificate lasts for a year, meaning they have a SSL certificate for this website, until June 2021.</p>
<h2 id="irrevocable-ssl-certificates-by-cloudflare">Irrevocable SSL Certificates by CloudFlare</h2>
<p>This website currently uses path.net for DDOS migration. Just like CloudFlare, they have their own SSL certificate for this website. As they require it to MITM website requests to block anyone trying to perform an L7 attack.</p>
<p>The difference is that path.net uses Let’s Encrypt, which would allow me to revoke their SSL certificate for this website. All I would have to do is to download the public key and present that with an Acme challenge and then I can revoke it.</p>
<p><strong>You would think that it would be possible to get a CloudFlare SSL certificate revoked?</strong></p>
<p>How about No?</p>

</center>

<p>Well. Unless you want to pay CloudFlare $10 per month to gain access to the “<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/advanced-certificate-manager">Advanced Certificate Manager</a>”.</p>
<p>This would give access to use a custom Let’s Encrypt. This would also allow you to set your SSL certificate validity period to as low as 14 days, rather than a year on the free “Universal SSL”.</p>
<p>Basically, it is a case of pay CloudFlare $10 per month or they get 100% control over your SSL certificate and will deny your requests to revoke.</p>
<p>In fact, the official stance of the SSL team at CloudFlare is that they won’t revoke unless the team has “<a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/revoke-and-prevent-the-issuing-of-certificates/235478/28">determined the private key was compromised</a>.”</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t this sounding pretty corrupt?</strong></p>
<p>Yes….</p>
<p>You blindly trust that CloudFlare will delete the SSL certificate upon leaving. They will provide you zero evidence of them of actually deleting the certificate.</p>
<p>This is from a CDN who has a level of access unmatched by their rivals. CloudFlare are becoming the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/02/25/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/">defualt DNS for browsers</a> and have a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">VPN service</a>.</p>
<p>You have to trust them to never abuse that power.</p>
<p>Even worse, as they forcibly keep a working SSL certificate, they don’t even have to generate a new one. Meaning, SSL transparency <strong>WILL NOT</strong> show anything if CloudFlare ever decide to hijack and MITM traffic to your website.</p>
<p>If someone asks that a SSL certificate is revoked after leaving it, revoke it. The webmaster is no longer giving them permission to have a SSL certificate for their domain.</p>
<p>By not allowing for SSL certificates to be revoked, CloudFlare is in effect holding them hostage. It must not be the job of a Certificate authority to refuse such requests.</p>
<p>Most Certificate authorities would never lock a webmaster out of control of a SSL certificate for their domain.</p>
<p>They also would not tell people to pay of $10/month for get rights to revoke a Certificate.</p>
<p>This comes to a question of whether CloudFlare should even be in SSL chain-of-trust.</p>
<p>I requested for them to revoke, by not revoking Cloudflare are keeping an active SSL Certificate without my permission. I think such behavior should make browsers question if they can keep Cloudflare in their chain-of-trust.</p>

									<p>The German government is “keen to enter into talks” with the new U.S. administration to agree changes to the U.S. policy that prioritizes local coronavirus vaccine supply at U.S. production facilities, according to a document from the German health ministry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a lengthy document published Tuesday that responded to questions from Germany’s Social Democrats, the health ministry sets out why the U.S. was able to secure additional supply of BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines for specific dates, whereas the EU's increase in supply is set to come “in 2021.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The health ministry states that an executive order from the U.S. president meant that production facilities in the country are “encouraged to initially make vaccine available for supply in the USA.” This meant that European production sites of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, as well as the Moderna vaccine, need to supply the rest of the world, in addition to Europe. </p>

<p>“The companies as well as the federal government are keen to enter into talks with the new U.S. administration in order to reach adjustments,” wrote the health ministry.</p>
<p>The document also discussed the bilateral deal Germany has with BioNTech/Pfizer — something that the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-coronavirus-vaccine-side-deal-at-odds-with-legally-binding-eu-pact/">Commission has let Germany off the hook for</a>, even though it appears to go against the bloc’s effort to craft a united vaccine strategy. </p>
<p>At issue, the health ministry explained, is the funding received by BioNTech from Germany’s education and research ministry. This cash meant that BioNTech had to provide a portion of vaccines to Germany. As a result, the health ministry had to issue a pre-contractual letter of intent in the form of a memorandum of understanding on September 8 for 30 million additional doses of the vaccine, wrote the health ministry.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>There’s no better time than now to dedicate effort to reliable software</em>.</p><p>If it wasn’t apparent before, this past year has made it more evident than ever: People expect their software tools to work every time, all the time.
The shift in the way end-users think about software was as inevitable as our daily applications entered our lives, almost like water and electricity entered our homes. A global pandemic accelerated that expectation as our livelihoods adjusted to be dominantly online for entertainment, saying hello to loved ones, and doing our jobs.</p><h2>Customers want reliable software.</h2><p>If you’re reading this, there’s a great chance an outage disrupted your life in one way or another. It could be the hours-long Slack, Gmail, or Zoom outages. Or it could be trying to watch a show on Disney+ or Hulu. Or when market volume skyrocketed, sending several brokerages down like TDAmeritrade and Robinhood.</p><p>Website blips and outages had a level of empathy associated with them in the internet’s early days. Dial-up connections would be disconnected by someone merely picking up the phone. Servers would get turned off on weekends for government websites. Restarting our computers was a common remedy that was largely tolerated. Those days are behind us, and ahead is a new expectation from people using our services: they expect them to be reliable.</p><p>The software industry is wising up to the fact that incident response already has precedents. Google’s incident response is based mainly on the United States FEMA disaster recovery processes. Remediation runbooks to restart servers take cues from the airline industry with quick actions that operators can perform. Software teams perform incident retrospectives and publicize their findings to their customers and the world, much like how the investigation of airline disasters has happened for years.</p><p>Customer trust is sacred, and poor reliability is one of the top ways to erode that trust.</p><h2>Operators want reliable software.</h2><p>I’ve never been paged in my career and been excited to open my laptop at a restaurant, even though I have several times. Reliable software means that software engineers can stay focused on company initiatives such as shipping new products or improving internal development processes. When reliability becomes an afterthought of software, it has wide-reaching implications. For example, software engineers can easily fall into the trap of happy-path only development, ignoring the possibility of failure entirely.</p><p>Over time, disruptions caused by a lack of reliable software causes an engineering team to enter into a brutal interrupt-driven development phase. Interrupt driven development is also the easiest way to burn out an entire engineering team. When you have burned out engineers that suddenly depart, it can cause an organization to overhire to cover ground. Hiring at a breakneck pace can also cause a cultural shift in the company, potentially generating more employees to leave. It’s a vicious cycle.</p><p>If you write software or manage a team that writes software, try performing proactive reviews of software that is planning on being deployed. Ask questions like “how can this potentially break?” and “what is a potential side effect of this change?“. Ask engineers to add it to their pull requests, design docs, and release notes. Incident retrospectives are a lagging indicator of how people thought the system would behave when a few questions can often reveal problems before they’re problems.</p><h2>How do we achieve reliable reliability?</h2><p>Reliability is an infinite game. There’s no agreed-upon rules, no time limit, no teams to play against. Reliability is what you want it to be, and it’s up to your team and leadership to decide the level of reliability you want to achieve. There’s no panacea to software reliability; it’s what you do every day, week, and month that creates reliability. It’s the simple consistency of caring drives reliability.</p><p>With that said, here are a few ways to put a team into first gear towards destination site reliability.</p><h3>Leverage your incident retrospectives and put your learnings into action</h3><p>As a starting point, you can start by analyzing and learning from incidents through retrospectives (p.s. drop the term “postmortem,” no one died). Take the time to understand what everyone was doing to resolve the incident, why they were doing it, and under no circumstances blame anyone for an outage. Primarily, you’re trying to understand how an incident came to be. By identifying multiple contributing factors, no singular root cause, you can spend time in each of the identified areas and plan actions accordingly.</p><p>While retrospectives are a great way to understand why something failed, it’s almost more important to know why things work at all. If our SLAs designate we’re available 99.99% of the time, why are we spending time looking at 0.01% of the time for ways to be more reliable? Read the paper on  <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/signuptosafety/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2015/10/safety-1-safety-2-whte-papr.pdf">Safety-II</a>  for more information on this idea. I also loved being in the audience for  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-2jMlsPqc8&amp;feature=emb_title">this talk</a>  by Ryan Kitchens.</p><h3>Push the limits with Chaos engineering</h3><p>Trying to “break things on purpose,”  <a href="https://gremlin.com/">a Gremlin mantra</a> , is a great way to build resilience and reliability. The vaccine of outages is causing them intentionally so your team can react and build better software. Chaos engineering is one of my favorite ways to engineer better systems.</p><p>I also believe chaos engineering practices apply to more than just breaking software; it should include breaking processes, too.
Watch  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2sf2lb2-4I">Incident Ready: How to Chaos Engineering Your Incident Response Process</a>  to see what I mean.</p><h3>Enable your teams to quickly turn things on and off with release &amp; feature flags</h3><p>Feature flags aren’t a new idea, but there are more reasons than ever to start using them in your software stack. Complex systems and deploys sometimes need a light switch to make something go dark in the event of a failure. I suspect this is why LaunchDarkly chose the name they did. FireHydrant uses  <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>  extensively in nearly every new feature we build to roll them out to our customers slowly.</p><p>I’ll give you an example of a real-life feature flag: airplane spar valves. If an engine shutdown fails, pilots will shut a spar valve completely, cutting off fuel to the engine, allowing it to starve and shutdown. I imagine we’ll start seeing feature flags and release flags used more frequently for circuit breakers in complex applications in the same way pilots use spar valves for turning off engines in dire situations.</p><h3>Know what’s in your complex system by cataloging your service</h3><p>In any sufficiently complex system, the number of running applications will surpass an individual’s cognitive ability to keep track of them all. The inner workings of dozens, hundreds, and thousands of microservices exceed our brainpower. It’s essential to have an “address book” of all of the services you rely on. YellowPages (remember those?), if you will, so we know where the service is, who to call when it degrades, and its purpose. It would be best if you documented what is out there, what the service does, who owns it, and who knows the most about it (hint: these are commonly not the same people).</p><p> <a href="https://firerescuemagazine.firefighternation.com/2013/07/14/understanding-the-dispatcher-s-job/">Dispatchers are a critical part</a>  of the response process for getting the right fire station to the emergency as fast as possible. Dispatchers have a catalog of battalions, fire stations, and the neighborhoods they serve. Without knowing who is where and where emergencies are, dispatching emergency services would be significantly less efficient.</p><h3>Have a plan and a central knowledge base with simple runbooks</h3><p>I’ve seen nearly every company I’ve worked for have an alert fire when a database starts to approach its max disk capacity. After some time, the alert inevitably fires, and then a collective “ok, what now?” face trades between everyone. Simple runbooks are an excellent way for a team to develop the beginnings of shared knowledge, breaking down the tribal knowledge that likely exists, which is only revealed in crisis.</p><p>Runbooks are nothing more than a checklist, which Atul Gawande’s book  <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-checklist-manifesto-how-to-get-things-right/9780312430009">The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</a>  covers extensively. With simple checklists, ICU units in Michigan saw a reduction of 66% in infection rates. Within 18 months, the simple checklists saved an estimated 1500 lives.</p><p>These simple lists work, and we can achieve even more reliable software with them.</p><h2>SLOs</h2><p>Reliability is hard to measure, but implementing service level objectives is a great way to start. My recommendation here is to create SLOs that don’t measure CPU or Memory usage but instead measure customer happiness. I fear most on-call engineers have been paged in the past for benign problems such as “memory is at 80%“.  <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/alerting-on-slos">By alerting on SLOs</a> that measure customer experience, not computer vitals, we’re targeting a better sense of what reliability in our system truly means.</p><p>As for a book recommendation on implementing practical service level objectives, I highly recommend  <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/implementing-service-level-objectives-a-practical-guide-to-slis-slos-and-error-budgets/9781492076810">Implementing Service Level Objectives</a>  by Alex Hidalgo.</p><h2>Every day is a chance to be more reliable.</h2><p>When striving for reliable systems, I urge you to remember that shavings make a pile. There’s no singular action you can take to build reliable software. Reliability is a habit that everyone must buy into and practice every day.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><em>This post talks about <a href="https://www.eduflow.com/">Eduflow</a> and <a href="https://www.peergrade.io/">Peergrade</a> – our two main products.</em></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at two fairly similar scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m signing up for some service and my card is declined</li>
  <li>I’m signing up for some service and I fail the 3DSecure check</li>
</ul>

<p>As a programmer – I know what you’re saying – under the hood these two are of course very different.</p>

<p>But from the user’s perspective, they were trying to pay and they failed to do so: potato, <em>potato3DSecure</em>. Unfortunately, if you’re using Stripe, the outcome of these two failures are very different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I’m creating a subscription in Stripe and I get a normal card decline, nothing happens. The user goes back to square one. No subscription, no nothing – as expected.</li>
  <li>If I’m creating a subscription in Stripe and I fail the 3DSecure verification – maybe I figured out that I didn’t want to buy anyways, once I saw that scary verification screen [1]. In this case, Stripe will have created the subscription and is basically expecting the user to pay for it within the next 23 hours. Basically, there’s a bunch of state, that both the user and the developer would expect to only have been created once the payment succeeded. (<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle">Stripe docs</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, that’s a leaky abstraction if I ever saw one.</p>

<p>In the olden days (for us that was Stripe Checkout Legacy along with Stripe Billing), the payment flow between a web app and Stripe would be this:</p>

<p>Web app → Stripe → Web app</p>

<p>Principally, this is still possible if you use the new Stripe Checkout. But if you have anything but the most vanilla of setups – that will not work for you: tiered pricing, per-seat pricing, and metered billing are not available in Stripe Checkout as of Jan 14th 2021. Like many other SAAS businesses, we use tiered per-seat pricing in Eduflow.</p>

<p>So we need to use Stripe Elements, build our own form, and write a ton of Javascript boilerplate that is probably 90-95% identical to what other users of Stripe Elements are writing.</p>

<p>The flow now looks roughly like this:</p>

<p>Web app → Stripe → Web app → Stripe → Web app</p>

<p>Bear in mind that this is the flow in the frontend. There has always been a bit of backend setup, but the amount of code and complexity there has roughly stayed the same when comparing with the old setup.</p>

<p>The extra added round-trip to Stripe here is related to 3DSecure. The idea is – if you after the first round-trip have a PaymentIntent with <code>status == "requires_action"</code> it means 3DSecure is required for the payment. You should then call <code>stripe.confirmCardSetup()</code> in the frontend which initiates the second round-trip to Stripe.</p>

<p>As far as I can see from <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-action">the Stripe documentation</a> there is no other option than <code>stripe.confirmCardSetup()</code> when this happens, so why do I even have the choice to initiate it? If Stripe just called <code>stripe.confirmCardSetup()</code> itself we’d be back to good old happy-path:</p>

<p>Web app → Stripe → Web app (but still with a lot of extra boilerplate)</p>

<p>Yes, initiating 3DSecure myself allows me to warn the user about it first. But as a European I’m getting 3DSecure everywhere these days (probably because we’ve just entered 2021) – with no warning beforehand – so I think it would make more sense for Stripe to allow developers to stay on the happy-path instead of defaulting to a more complicated special-case with no opt-out.</p>

<p>That was the original value proposition of Stripe. The frontend code we have in Peergrade is these <strong>23 lines of code</strong> and it does tiered, per-seat pricing:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>StripeCheckout</span>
  <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Peergrade"</span>
  <span>description</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>plan</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span>
  <span>amount</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>billedNow</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>}</span> <span>// amount is in cents</span>
  <span>email</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>email</span><span>}</span>
  <span>stripeKey</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>publicKey</span><span>}</span>
  <span>billingAddress</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>true</span><span>}</span>
  <span>zipCode</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>true</span><span>}</span>
  <span>token</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>({</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>email</span> <span>})</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>createSubscription</span><span>({</span>
      <span>stripeToken</span><span>:</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>stripeEmail</span><span>:</span> <span>email</span><span>,</span>
      <span>planType</span><span>:</span> <span>plan</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>quantity</span><span>,</span>
    <span>})</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>input</span>
    <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"hidden"</span>
    <span>ref</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>_input</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span>
    <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  <span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>StripeCheckout</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Granted, this uses <code>react-stripe-checkout</code>, but that’s just a very thin wrapper around <code>https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js</code>.</p>

<p>In Eduflow, because we’re forced to use Stripe Elements and it’s interweaved throughout our subscriptions page, with <code>&lt;CardNumberElement&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;CardExpiryElement&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;CardCvcElement&gt;</code>
and calls to <code>stripe.createPaymentMethod()</code> and <code>stripe.confirmCardPayment()</code>.</p>

<p>Technically we should do that in Peergrade as well due to PSD2, but for now we will just let those payments fail and ask the customers to switch to Eduflow. It’s too much hassle.</p>

<p>That old script – <code>checkout.js</code> – is really a one-line payment integration. Just include the script and you get the payment button! What happened Stripe?</p>

<p>I know what you’re gonna say – PSD2/SCA/3DSecure happened. Yes, it did. But Stripe already needed to ask the bank whether to allow the transaction (going through VISA/Mastercard and a bunch of other steps behind the scenes). Now Stripe also needs to ask the customer as well through something like 3DSecure. <code>checkout.js</code> already shows a modal with a form for inputting name, address and credit card, so they can just reuse that modal to let the user input the 3DSecure verification as well.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if you’re not creating a new subscription but rather upgrading an existing one you can use “<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates">Pending updates</a>” to not have the subscription update until the transaction is fully confirmed with 3DSecure and everything. Why isn’t that the default, and why isn’t it available when the subscription is initially created?</p>

<p>[1] Everybody, <a href="https://stripe.com/en-gb-dk/guides/strong-customer-authentication">including Stripe</a>, expects 3DSecure to lower conversion rates, both because the extra step increases friction, but also because it will be unfamiliar and scary to some users. On a personal note, the first time I was asked to do 3DSecure probably 10 years ago or more, I declined. I never saw a 3DSecure prompt again until about 6 months ago. It just wasn’t something I had heard about, and so it seemed scary that I need to receive a text message in order to do a credit card purchase. Over time, I expect customers will get used to it and conversion rates will normalize.</p>

<!--
Card declines were already expected to be async in Stripe. The recommendation was to only provisioning whatever the user was paying for once your webhook was hit.

~~So here's my suggestion: The customer inputs their personal details and card details, and the web app sends that off to Stripe. Stripe checks with the bank whether the transaction is good to go. If the bank or some other security system replies "You need to do 3DSecure" – just do that – show the customer a spinner until the transaction (including 3DSecure) is finished. As a store/service/paid web app, I don't need to know about all that – it's part of the transaction.~~
-->

<p>For the last two years, Mala Jadwani, a 31-year-old teacher, has received daily messages from her 60-year-old <em>chachi</em>. On their family WhatsApp group, her aunt, who started using a smartphone a few years ago, posts classic older-relative content: garden-variety motivational quotes, prayer emojis, home remedies for body aches, and “good morning,” “good afternoon,” and “good evening” greetings accompanied by pictures of babies and roses. On days when her chachi’s messages were particularly prolific, Jadwani’s phone would freeze, forcing her to disable WhatsApp’s automatic photo download setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But last week, her chachi’s<em> </em>WhatsApp messages suddenly stopped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worried, Jadwani called her aunt. It turned out that she had read a chain of viral messages on WhatsApp, which falsely said the platform’s messaging system was no longer private. She was one of millions of users who received a push notification from WhatsApp earlier this month, explaining that the company was updating its privacy policy, mostly in superficial ways. After February 8, 2021, “you’ll need to accept these changes to continue using WhatsApp,” <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/whatsapp_new_privacy_policy_facebook-news-47077.php">the update read</a>. The thought of her WhatsApp messages being exposed frightened Jadwani’s aunt so much, she said, that she stopped sending messages on WhatsApp altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India is WhatsApp’s largest consumer market by many measures, but backlash against the recent privacy policy change is now threatening its future in the country. Many people have debated the update with their friends and family, and it’s also been featured in nightly news shows and on the front page of local newspapers. Last week, Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, took <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90593913/whatsapp-facebook-privacy-outrage-newspaper-ads">out full-page advertisements</a> and plugged interviews <a href="https://twitter.com/digbijaymishra1/status/1349562056429641735?s=20">with the heads of WhatsApp</a> in newspapers, in an effort to mitigate the fallout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The change isn’t actually a departure from how WhatsApp has treated user data for years. The platform has shared metadata — phone numbers, how often the app is opened, and operating system information —&nbsp;with Facebook since <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/whatsapp-privacy-facebook/">2016</a>. The pop-up notification millions of users received on January 8 sought explicit permission to continue these existing practices. But unlike four years ago, “there was no opt-out option to refuse sharing information with Facebook companies,” said Apar Gupta, executive director of the nonprofit Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF).</p>



<p>The new changes are related to how businesses communicate with WhatsApp users. The update made it clearer that commercial activity on the messaging platform has the potential to spill over into other Facebook apps: “a handbag you browse on WhatsApp could pop up later in your Instagram app,” as <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/whatsapp-data.html">explained</a>. Over <a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660772483104769?s=20">175 million</a> people already message companies on WhatsApp, and the updated terms of service would make it “easier to chat with businesses who may use Facebook business products,” <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/about-new-business-features-and-whatsapps-privacy-policy-update">reads a blog post</a> from WhatsApp’s communications team. The post claims that the update would enable customer service features like purchase receipts.</p>



<p>The confusing change triggered a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/signals-downloads-skyrocketed-4200-after-whatsapp-announced-it-would-force-users-to-share-personal-data-with-facebook/articleshow/80232029.cms">mass exodus</a> of WhatsApp users, who moved to other messaging platforms like Signal and <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/terror-on-telegram/">Telegram</a>. After the disastrous rollout, Facebook later announced it was delaying updating its privacy policy by three months, but for loyal WhatsApp users, the damage has already been done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook’s privacy practices and <a href="https://thewire.in/business/facebook-is-misleading-indians-with-its-full-page-ads-about-free-basics">policy decisions</a> in India have long been criticized. What’s different this time are the demographics of the people who are outraged: uncles and aunties. For the first time, India’s most loyal and engaged users are questioning the intentions of an app that has grown to encompass nearly every aspect of their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WhatsApp groups are an indispensable part of South Asian families: they’re a forum for gossip, dodgy forwarded messages, boisterous political debates, and generally the primary way for relatives to stay in touch. Many of these WhatsApp family groups — including my own — erupted with anger and confusion in the days after the platform sent the pop-up message announcing its new policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sheshadri Narayanane, a friend from high school, is a part of two family groups. He said his 70-year-old aunt falsely believed WhatsApp had been granted access to her bank accounts. <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/whatsapp-pay-enters-india/">WhatsApp recently launched payments</a> in India, allowing users to send and receive money by connecting their bank accounts to the messaging app. The privacy update came shortly after WhatsApp Pay was launched, which might have caused some of the confusion. “Bad timing is my theory,” Narayanane speculated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On prime-time talk shows, news hosts likened the update to <em>digital dadagiri</em>, or “digital bullying,” by WhatsApp. “They want to sell your chats — your data from WhatsApp private chats — to business enterprises,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0F5T1Q0z5Y">declared</a> one news anchor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The debates often took on a political tone. Some TV hosts asked questions about the government’s ability to protect India’s sovereignty. Gaurav Bhatia, the national spokesperson of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hTa_Bhd_o">weighed in</a>, saying his party would go to any lengths necessary to protect the privacy of its citizens. On January 19, the Ministry of Electronics and Communication Technology (MeitY) sent a request to Facebook to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/govt-tells-whatsapp-to-respect-privacy-of-indians-withdraw-new-policy/articleshow/80344964.cms?from=mdr">withdraw the new changes made to its privacy policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why is it that these social media giants, who need the India market, are having two different policies for different countries?” Bhatia said on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hTa_Bhd_o">nightly news show,</a> referencing the fact that WhatsApp’s policy update <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/why-whatsapp-s-privacy-rules-sparked-moves-to-rivals-quicktake">does not apply to the European Union</a>. Some accused WhatsApp of treating Indians as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18of5M6g2M&amp;t=1625s">second-rate citizens</a>.” Local technology entrepreneurs who compete with Big Tech companies like Facebook soon <a href="https://twitter.com/vijayshekhar/status/1349186007007023104?s=20">piled on</a>.</p>



<p>Facebook has repeatedly emphasized that WhatsApp can’t see the content of end-to-end encrypted messages, which can be viewed by only the sender and receiver. Alternatives like <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2021/01/11/whatsapp-telegram-signal-privacy-security-comparison/">Telegram don’t necessarily offer</a> the same protections as WhatsApp. Digital liberties activists and advocacy groups like IFF <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152?s=20">recommend</a> using Signal instead for sensitive communications, and the app quickly became the number one downloaded app in India earlier this month. Signal commemorated its victory on Twitter. “Look at what you’ve done,” read a <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1347693761044701186?s=20">tweet</a> from the app’s official account, accompanied by an emoji of the Indian flag.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though users are downloading Signal and other encrypted alternatives in high numbers, switching might not be as simple for aunties and uncles who spent years becoming proficient in using WhatsApp. Vivek K, a 28-year-old tech entrepreneur, tried making the case to his mother that she should switch over to Signal and was met with an unenthusiastic response: “She said, ‘Now, you’re making me learn one more app? I can’t do it; I’m too old for this<em>,</em>’” explained Vivek.</p>



<p>For now, with the privacy update postponed until at least May, WhatsApp is working to mitigate the backlash. But people like Jadwani’s chachi are still staying away from the messaging app. Jadwani said she hasn’t missed the lack of daily greetings. “No wonder my phone hasn’t had issues,” she said with a laugh.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><blockquote><p>This is an in-depth review of how Synyx GmbH &amp; Co building is using Turing Pi board in combination with GitLab CI and Ansible for their CI/CD needs</p><cite>Author: Karl-Ludwig Reinhard</cite></blockquote></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>In my previous&nbsp;article,&nbsp;I explained some cloudy statements about Ansible and Gitlab CI and that we’re going to work with a Turing Pi for that purpose. I already talked about the capabilities of this amazing board and the first steps it takes to get it up and running. Today I’ll go a little bit into details on what benefits we are having when running Ansible scripts in a CI environment and most important where the Turing Pi helps us.</p><h3>What we’re going to build with it?</h3><p>In our project, we have a lot of Raspis and configure them all with Ansible. From time to time we are adding new features and fixing bugs in our Ansible scripts and that makes them more complex. We are using GitLab to review our code, but what is missing is a validation of the syntax and that the code will actually work on production’s hardware. Considering that our team continues to grow, this adds more complexity. So we put 4 Raspberry Pis into a rack and integrated them as a deploy target for our merge requests.</p><h4>When a user opens a merge request, we reboot the machine and run the OS via the network. With that, we can flash the SD card with a fresh Raspbian. After a reboot, we can start our Ansible scripts to test if the merge request is sane.</h4><figure><img src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><p>With just running an Ansible Playbook for setting up hosts from 0 to 100 we get the following benefits:</p><ol><li>Check if the syntax is correct</li><li>Ensure that all needed files are committed</li><li>Can different configuration flavors still be applied?</li></ol><h2>Why do we need netboot at all?</h2><p>Our goal is to run our Ansible script against a freshly installed Raspbian. We cannot be sure, that the last tested merge request was flawless. The idea is to reboot the node into an NFS based root file system. From there we can flash a Raspbian and reboot into a clean OS. After that, we can apply &amp; test our Ansible scripts. Following this process guarantees, that every merge request gets a clean system without any leftovers from a previous run.</p><h2>Setting up Gitlab CI/runner</h2><p>To be honest&nbsp; – we’re currently stuck with a shell runner. We weren’t able to find a proper working docker image with ansible that doesn’t lack some tooling/libs that are currently required. Building a custom docker image would be possible but for the sake of simplicity, we use a simple shell runner.</p><p>First of all, we need to set up one node as a DHCP/TFTP boot server. Here is a good <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tutorial</a> on how to do this. We recommend to run one of the Turing Pi nodes as a DHCP/TFTP boot server – it’s more reliable than a server placed outside of the board.</p><p>One thing to note: The DHCP server is located behind a NAT router so it does not interfere with DHCP servers in our company network.</p><p>When the server is up and running, we need to set up the Gitlab runner.</p><ol><li>Due to the fact we rely on a shell runner Ansible has to be installed by hand. This can be done with your package manger. Also, install all dependencies that are needed for a successful Ansible run.</li><li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Install</a> GitLab CI runner. When asked which kind of runner, choose shell runner.</li><li>Add a custom inventory.<br>You can use your regular inventory and add there your ci host. Then you have to limit your Ansible run with <code><mark>–limit</mark></code> option. If omitted you’ll most probably deploy your prod system with every merge request 🙂</li><li>Add or change <code><mark>.gitlab-ci.yml</mark></code> accordingly:</li></ol><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">stages:
  - test-on-pis
  
test-on-turing-pi:
  stage: test-on-pis 
  script:
    - export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
    - mkdir $HOME/.ssh || true 
    - echo -e "Host 192.168.2.*\nStrictHostKeyChecking no\nUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" &gt; $HOME/.ssh/config
    - ansible-playbook reflash.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=Bai9iZaetheeSee5"
    - ansible-playbook initial.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=raspberry"
    - ansible-playbook site.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=Bai9iZaetheeSee5" -e "http_proxy="
  except:
    - master</pre><p>We do some „dirty“ SSH tricks at the beginning. This ensures that Ansible can connect to the systems even when the host keys have changed. That will happen with our setup after we reflashed the system. We tried to do this during an ansible run but weren’t successful.</p><p>Reflashing your Pi is really straightforward when the PXE server is setup. Let’s have a look at some excerpt:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">--
- name: Check if already pxe boot

  register: root_mnt

  when: root_mnt.stdout_lines[0] != "nfs"

  when: root_mnt.stdout_lines[0] != "nfs"
....

    port: 22
    host: '{{ (ansible_ssh_host}}'
    search_regex: OpenSSH
    delay: 60
    timeout: 120
  connection: local</pre><ul><li>• First of all, we check if the current system is already running on an NFS root filesystem. If so we can skip the next two steps. If not we destroy the current boot partition – just write some rubbish on the raw device.</li><li>• Next, we reboot the system.</li><li>• Then we flash the sd card/eMMC with the help of Zcat. We compress our images to save some HD space and be able to transfer them via a wan connection(if needed). The performance impact is negligible. One reboot later and that’s it. We have a freshly installed Raspbian and can apply our Ansible scripts to a fresh system.</li></ul><h3>Two things to note:</h3><ul><li>• We ignore errors when flashing. When the image is missing or similar, we just continue and reboot the system. In most cases, the system will be still accessible</li><li>• I couldn’t get the reboot module working properly. I think the newly flashed system does not have the same remote user and password as when we started the role. With this ugly part, it’s working 🙂</li></ul><p>Be aware that the above script is an excerpt from the main.yml of the corresponding role and is not complete!</p><h3>What we also do</h3><p>After a successful run, we apply some smoke tests. One flavor of our RPis is kiosk systems that start X11 and opens a chromium browser in fullscreen mode. With some „technical creativity“(aka mocking) we ensure that the browser is running. When this is not going to happen, the build fails. Another flavor is used for controlling an industrial actor and its basic functionality is also tested at the end. We do not test every aspect, it’s more of a kind of smoke tests or checks if certain TCP ports are open.</p><p>What we also want to know how our Ansible scripts affect a running system that is not flattened or rebooted on every run. We deploy two node continuously when a merge to master happens. With that, we can also monitor the memory usage on these systems and can identify possible memory leaks or stability issues when running a system longer time. It has served us well as an additional safety net.</p><h2>Why the Turing Pi is ideal for us</h2><p>Compared to our old setup we gained speed and stability of our builds. In the past, we had problems when booting multiple pis in parallel from the network. PIs were stuck in the boot process and didn’t get their kernel via TFTP or couldn’t mount the NFS root reliably. To this day, I’m not sure where I went wrong – I fixed it by throttling the reboots so that the Pis are booted one by one. That slowed down the „build“ significantly.</p><h4>With the Turing Pi we did not encounter any problems booting pis in parallel from the network at the same time. So after testing it a bit I removed the throttle and reduced the build time significantly</h4><p>Another thing we see a lot less stuck Ansible jobs because the network connection is flaky. I got the impression, that working with the network on the PCB is a lot more reliant. We use Turing Pi for two weeks as a replacement for our old „test cluster“ – can’t remember that I had to reset the cluster manually caused by a frozen job.</p><p>Currently, we work most of the time from home –&nbsp; Covid19 case numbers are rising in Germany and it looks like we’ll stay at home for some time. With some VPN and network magic, we can use some nodes as test devices from the remote. In the past, everybody got his „personal“ test pi, had to ensure proper network connection, flash the sd card manually, etc. Yes, you can use Raspbian X86 but some things like accessing Bluetooth or GPIOs cannot properly be tested in a virtual environment.</p><h2>What we’ve learned as a team?</h2><p>In our last review and retro, we talked also about our CI setup. We’ve agreed, that it helps us a lot in our day-to-day business and adds to the quality of our merge requests. For me personally, it is a very good incentive to use more merge requests so the CI pipeline is triggered and I am forced to work more in a clean way. But it takes time to set it up, stabilize some (ugly) parts – but after all the time investment is worth it. Additional tests and reviews improve the quality even in the context of configuring an OS and reduces the number of errors.</p><h2>What we miss with Turing Pi</h2><p>Not much to be honest. Two things would be really awesome:</p><ol><li>Switching the HDMI output from the first node to a different node via i2c</li><li>For flashing EMMc the first slot only can be used. It would be great if you could also use the other slots for flashing as well.</li></ol><p>I think achieving these two points isn’t easy and for us not really pain points 🙂</p><h2>Where we (maybe) want to go</h2><p>Currently, we are deploying our prod systems still from our workstations. Continuos delivery will be a topic for us. But something like „merge on master“ and deploy the prod system instantly is too risky for us. Our Pis are an integral part of our customers. And that’s not the definition for CD(for me :)). Our pis are not easily …</p></div></div>

<p>Kubernetes is a great platform to deploy our microservices and applications to. One of the excellent features is that pods are restarted or removed from a service when they don’t work correctly. Kubernetes needs our help to understand if a pod is working or not. This is configured via Container Probes.</p>

<p>Any application can be in an unhealthy state due to bugs, missing dependencies on external resources, and so on. To make sure our traffic flows correctly, we need to make sure probes are configured.</p>

<h2 id="probes"><a href="#probes">#</a>Probes</h2>

<p>Probes are kubelet’s answer to the health checks, there are three handlers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#execaction-v1-core">ExecAction</a></strong>: Command execution check, if the command’s exit status is 0, it is considered a success.</li>
<li><strong>TCPSocketAction</strong>: TCP check to determine if the port is open, if open, it is considered a success.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPGetAction</strong>: HTTP check to determine if the status code is equal to or above 200 and below 400.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each type of probe has common configurable fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>initialDelaySeconds</strong>: Probes start running after <code>initialDelaySeconds</code> after container is started (default: 0)</li>
<li><strong>periodSeconds</strong>: How often probe should run (default: 10)</li>
<li><strong>timeoutSeconds</strong>: Probe timeout (default: 1)</li>
<li><strong>successThreshold</strong>: Required number of successful probes to mark container healthy/ready (default: 1)</li>
<li><strong>failureThreshold</strong>: When a probe fails, it will try <code>failureThreshold</code> times before deeming unhealthy/not ready (default: 3)</li>
</ul>

<p>These parameters need to be configured per your application’s spec.</p>

<h3 id="exec-probe"><a href="#exec-probe">#</a>Exec Probe</h3>

<p>Exec action has only one field, and that is <code>command.</code> Exit status of the command is checked, and the status of zero (0) means it is healthy, and other value means it is unhealthy.</p>

<pre><code>        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 5
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          exec:

<h3 id="tcp-probe"><a href="#tcp-probe">#</a>TCP Probe</h3>

<p>We need to define <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> parameters, <code>host</code> parameter defaults to the cluster-internal pod IP.</p>

<pre><code>        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 5
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          tcpSocket:
            host:
            port: 80
</code></pre>

<h3 id="http-probe"><a href="#http-probe">#</a>HTTP Probe</h3>

<p>HTTP Probe has additional options to configure.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>host</strong>: Host/IP to connect to (default: pod IP)</li>
<li><strong>scheme</strong>: Scheme to use when making the request (default: HTTP)</li>
<li><strong>path</strong>: Path</li>
<li><strong>httpHeaders</strong>: An array of headers defined as header/value map</li>
<li><strong>port</strong>: Port to connect to</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: If you need to set the Host header of the HTTP, please do so on httpHeaders, instead of the host parameter.</p>

<pre><code>        readinessProbe:

<h2 id="readiness-probes-in-kubernetes"><a href="#readiness-probes-in-kubernetes">#</a>Readiness Probes in Kubernetes</h2>

<p>Kubernetes runs readiness probes to understand when it can send traffic to a pod, i.e., to transition the pod to <code>Ready</code> state. For example, if a pod is used as a backend endpoint for a service, a readiness probe will determine if the pod will receive traffic or not. The readiness probe is executed throughout the pod’s lifetime; this means that readiness probes continue to be executed after reaching the <code>Ready</code> state. Also, our application can make itself unavailable for maintenance or for some background tasks as well by responding with different values to the probe.</p>

<p>A pod transitions the following states:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PodScheduled</strong>: Pod is scheduled on an available node</li>
<li><strong>ContainersReady</strong>: All containers in <code>Ready</code> state</li>
<li><strong>Initialized</strong>: All init containers are started</li>
<li><strong>Ready</strong>: Pod is ready to receive traffic (readiness probe)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="common-pitfalls-for-readiness-probes"><a href="#common-pitfalls-for-readiness-probes">#</a>Common Pitfalls for Readiness Probes</h2>

<p>Readiness probes check the configured action for the duration of the container’s lifetime; therefore, any disruption or delay in answering can cause service disruption. Sometimes the application needs to read a large amount of data experiencing latency issues or make an expensive calculation, which might prevent such an answer from being delivered. This behavior should be considered when configuring readiness probes. Testing thoroughly before going live with a readiness probe is highly recommended.</p>

<h3 id="cascading-failures"><a href="#cascading-failures">#</a>Cascading Failures</h3>

<p>Consider this, we have configured a readiness probe with HTTPGet, and our application checks the database connection before answering the probe. Let’s suggest there is a database problem; in this case, all pods will be unreachable unless the database is back. Do we want this behavior? Certainly no, we could feed the database error to the front end and notify the user of the unavailability; even if we increase <code>failureThreshold</code> we might not be able to avoid a cascading failure. Avoiding external dependencies on readiness probe answers is what I would recommend in any case.</p>

<h3 id="external-dependencies"><a href="#external-dependencies">#</a>External Dependencies</h3>

<p>Let’s assume that you have a key/value store used for caching, and your readiness probe endpoint checks this connection as well. The application is capable of running without the key/value store as it will only slow down but it will run a full database query every time it needs to access data. In this case, if the readiness probe fails because of the key/value store not being available, your whole application will be down for some time -until you fix the key/value store which is certainly not desirable.</p>

<p>You need to clearly design your probes considering how your application behaves and how the application responds when there is a failure. You might want to restart the pod (via liveness checks) or remove it from service with a readiness probe.</p>

<h2 id="example-sample-nginx-deployment"><a href="#example-sample-nginx-deployment">#</a>Example: Sample Nginx Deployment</h2>

<p>To see readiness probes in action, we can configure a sample app, a simple NGINX web server in this case. Here we have defined a simple deployment configuration:</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: k8s-probes
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 2
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          httpGet:
            host:
            scheme: HTTP
            path: /
            httpHeaders:
            - name: Host
              value: myapplication1.com
            port: 80
</code></pre>

<p>Save this configuration to a file called k8s-probes-deployment.yaml and apply it with <code>kubectl apply -f k8s-probes-deployment.yaml</code>.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
  - name: nginx-http-port
    port: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: NodePort
</code></pre>

<p>Save this configuration to a file called k8s-probes-svc.yaml and apply it with <code>kubectl apply -f k8s-probes-svc.yaml</code>.</p>

<p>There is no separate endpoint for readiness probes, but we can access events using the <code>kubectl describe pods &lt;POD_NAME&gt;</code> command, for example, to get the current status.</p>

<p>Use <code>kubectl get pods</code> command to see the pods’ status.</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get pods
</code></pre>

<p>Pods and their status and ready states will be displayed, our pod is running as expected.</p>

<pre><code>NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
k8s-probes-7d57f897dd-td2q2   1/1     Running   0          1m23s
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>kubectl describe pod &lt;POD_NAME&gt;</code></p>

<pre><code>kubectl describe pod k8s-probes-755b4bf57c-jgcqw
</code></pre>

<p>At the bottom of the output <code>Events</code> will be displayed:</p>

<pre><code>Events:
  Type    Reason     Age   From               Message
  ----    ------     ----  ----               -------
  Normal  Scheduled  15m   default-scheduler  Successfully assigned default/k8s-probes-755b4bf57c-jgcqw to k8s-probes
  Normal  Pulling    15m   kubelet            Pulling image "nginx"
  Normal  Pulled     15m   kubelet            Successfully pulled image "nginx" in 1.418647753s
  Normal  Created    15m   kubelet            Created container nginx
  Normal  Started    15m   kubelet            Started container nginx
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s look at the endpoints with <code>kubectl get endpoints</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get endpoints
</code></pre>

<p>We can see Nginx service has an endpoint.</p>

<pre><code>NAME         ENDPOINTS           AGE
kubernetes   10.132.0.42:16443   8h
nginx        10.1.85.203:80      6m11s
</code></pre>

<p>To see more detail we can use <code>kubectl describe endpoints nginx</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>Name:         nginx
Namespace:    default
Labels:       app=nginx
Annotations:  endpoints.kubernetes.io/last-change-trigger-time: 2020-11-13T20:34:13Z
Subsets:
  Addresses:          10.1.85.203
  NotReadyAddresses:  &lt;none&gt;
  Ports:
    Name             Port  Protocol
    ----             ----  --------
    nginx-http-port  80    TCP
</code></pre>

<p>Configure the readiness probe’s <code>port</code> parameter to 81 and apply the configuration.</p>

<p>Again let’s check the pods status</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get pods
</code></pre>

<p>As we have updated our deployment by default, a new pod is created, and as you can see, it is not in the ready state.</p>

<pre><code>NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
k8s-probes-755b4bf57c-jgcqw   1/1     Running   0          13m
k8s-probes-7d57f897dd-td2q2   0/1     Running   0          2m49s
</code></pre>

<p>Here status is running however <code>READY</code> state determines our pod is not ready yet. Let’s explore the status and events with <code>kubectl describe pods &lt;POD_NAME&gt;</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>kubectl describe pod k8s-probes-7d57f897dd-td2q2
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that the readiness probe failed due to the connection being refused therefore pod will not receive any traffic.</p>

<pre><code>Events:
  Type     Reason     Age                From               Message
  ----     ------     ----               ----               -------
  Normal   Scheduled  58s         …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Once or twice a year I’ll go through a phase of extreme delegation to cope with the demands of startup life. I make long lists of my worries </span><b><i>—</i></b><span> responsibilities, systems, activities, even relationships </span><b><i>—</i></b><span> and ruthlessly brainstorm how to hand them off to someone else. Channeling Marie Kondo, I insist that I don’t have to do anything that doesn’t bring me joy. Unfortunately, that’s not how life works, and my master plan of delegation fails.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Still, delegation is crucial to </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/10/to-be-a-great-leader-you-have-to-learn-how-to-delegate-well"><span>managing well</span></a><span>. If I can’t get off of the hamster wheel of doing, I may miss the big picture. Here are the mistakes I’m trying not to repeat.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Delaying delegation too long</strong></h5>
<p><span>My responsibility purge is usually triggered by </span><a href="https://blog.prialto.com/i-know-i-should-be-delegating-to-save-me-time-but-i-am-just-too-busy-to-figure-it-out"><span>extreme overwhelm</span></a><span>. If I’m not careful, I will listen to the overwhelm telling me that delegating will be more work than doing the work myself. That may initially be true, but it will also mean that I can never get out from under my own task list to see better ways to do something or to grow. To determine whether a task may be a good handoff candidate, I’m asking the following:</span><i></i></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Does the task consume a disproportionate amount of energy</span></i><span>? Every Thursday, I need to duplicate and distribute a team presentation. It seems too insignificant to put on my to-do list every week, so I rely on myself to remember it unprompted each Thursday afternoon. I could put a calendar reminder for it, but then someone will schedule a meeting during that time, and I’ll miss the reminder. I clearly spend too much energy thinking about this and need to hand it off.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Do I actively dread the task? </span></i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/12/ill-do-it-later/578173/"><span>Laundry is my nemesis</span></a><span>, and I will strategically plan outfits to avoid doing it for as long as possible. It wasn’t until Dan suggested having someone else do it that I first glimpsed freedom. In fact, that someone else may even do a better job and get joy from it. I waited so long to consider delegating this one that I almost forgot that escape is possible.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Does the task specifically require my voice, face, writing, or knowledge? </span></i><span>Some days at an early stage company can feel like everything is waiting on me. Truthfully, very few tasks probably do, but that’s not what my ego wants to hear. Vacation days are a great reminder that the company </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> survive without me. When I start to dread a day off, I know that I’m handling too much.</span></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Handing off the wrong tasks</strong></h5>
<p><span>In a typical week, I check out five or so books from the library. When I first hired an assistant, I created an elaborate system for them to log into my accounts, pull books from my reading list, and send them to my Kindle or local library branch. My goal was an endless stream of interesting reading. The result was far from that.</span></p>
<p><span>I became overwhelmed by the pressure to read and unhappy with the mix of books being selected (even though they were pre-selected by me!). Reading became a chore rather than a relaxing pastime. I realized that I craved books related to the events of the week, and I missed perusing the shelves myself. I had handed off something I loved for the sake of creating more time to do the things I love.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Startups pull us in multiple directions, and it can be hard to remember what we love about our jobs. Be clear about why you’re delegating and </span><a href="https://marissabracke.com/dont-delegate-what-you-love-doing-delegate-what-supports-you-doing-it"><span>hold on to the activities that bring you joy</span></a><span>. A shorter to-do list is only wonderful if the remaining items don’t make you want to quit your job.</span></p>

<h5><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/04/30/delegate-outcomes-not-activities/"><span><strong>Dictating process rather than outcome</strong></span></a></h5>
<p><span>Another hard concept for my ego to grasp: my way isn’t the only way. So I let my assistant set up appointments for me however she deemed fit. When I looked back through my sent mail, I noticed that she had started each of her emails with “Good day to you.” Not what I would have said, but she still achieved the outcome.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://swipesapp.com/blog/delegation-and-trust-team-productivity"><span>Delegation requires trust</span></a><span>, and trust is earned. Start off with small outcomes and work towards higher stake assignments. You’ve made hires for a reason, so use their brainpower and past experience to figure out the “how” for themselves. Letting someone else think through a process and execute on it means the method may be different from mine, and we both end up learning something.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Put in the time to delegate the right tasks to the right people before you become overwhelmed. Then they can write articles like this for you. (Or so says my delegation fantasy.)</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><p>nginx + cgit + gitolite = $5/month</p><p> published:&nbsp; <time datetime="2021-01-12T00:00:00+00:00"> 12 January 2021 </time></p></header><p>I've been on a <em>"own my online presence"</em> kick for more than a year now. So for this (overly protracted) essay, I thought I'd publish my notes on how I created my own Git server.</p><p>There are many open source projects like <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">GitTea</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> to make hosting your own git projects effortless; however I wanted a much more simple (read: old school) setup. I ended up with something that uses many of the same projects that the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux Organization</a> uses to publish the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/">Linux Kernel</a></p><p>The server (as of this writing) uses <a href="http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu's 20.04.1 LTS (Focal Fossa)</a> running on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean's</a> hardware (<a href="https://m.do.co/c/b0f6f650ad4e">referral-link</a>). I wholeheartedly support and recommend you chose a different setup. Diversity in people and in tech stack is always and will always be a great thing.</p><p>What lies below can be broken into 3 main topics:</p><ol><li><a href="#the-start">The Start</a> prepares a newly minted server for git hosting duties. Creating a new admin user, locking down the OpenSSH daemon, and installing fail2ban.</li><li><a href="#gitolite">Gitolite</a> installs and configures the server to allow us (and colleagues) to have more fine-grained control over who has access to <code>git push|fetch</code> on the server.</li><li>And <a href="#cgit">Cgit</a>, <a href="#fastcgi-wrapper">fcgiwrap</a>, and <a href="#nginx">Nginx</a> to create a web-server to view our published projects.</li></ol><div><p>In the end, you'll have a server much like <a href="https://git.bryanbrattlof.com/">this one</a>.</p><p><em>Enjoy!</em></p></div><div id="the-start"><h2>The Start</h2><p>I often find security <em>"best practices"</em> are a lot like driving down the highway. Some people speeding past you are <em>"obviously"</em> just moments away from a major data breach, while the others you're passing are <em>"clearly"</em> so worried about the entire data-center burning down, they couldn't possibly get anything else done. Everyone thinks everyone else has lost their marbles.</p><p>So with that in mind, here are a few steps I took to secure my newly minted server. Please feel free to use only the <em>"best practices"</em> you deem appropriate for your mission.</p><p>Or just <a href="#gitolite">skip to the "installing Gitolite"</a> part directly.</p><div id="admin-user"><h3>Admin User</h3><p>For whatever reason, be it for security or protecting the server from my stupidity, one of the first things I do when creating a new server is add a new user for my general admin tasks.</p><p>Adding a new user is remarkably easy to do on a Ubuntu system:</p><p>You'll be prompted to answer a few questions, including creating a new UNIX password. This will be the password you'll need to <code>sudo -i</code> and gain <code>root</code> permissions, so make it a good one, or use tools like <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">Pass</a>, or <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> to help you remember.</p><p>Then give our new <code>limb</code> user <code>sudo</code> permissions:</p><p>I've also largely eliminated all password based authentication when signing into servers, relying on open source smart cards like <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/">NitroKey</a> for authentication. If interested, this requires we setup <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> for our <code>limb</code> user:</p><p>Just replace <code>key</code> with your public ssh key:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ mkdir /home/limb/.ssh
$ echo "key" &gt; /home/limb/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre></div><p>Next, set the <code>.ssh</code> directory's file permissions so the <code>ssh</code> daemon can read the files:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ chown -R limb:limb /home/limb/.ssh
$ chmod 700 /home/limb/.ssh
$ chmod 644 /home/limb/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre></div><p>If everything worked, after you restart the <code>ssh</code> daemon (<code>service sshd restart</code>) you will now be able to login as the administrator user:</p></div><div id="openssh"><h3>OpenSSH</h3><p>Git and Gitolite (<a href="#gitolite">installed in the next sections</a>) will need us to keep port 22 open, allowing us to <code>git push</code> from anywhere on the internet. This open port will eventually attract <em>"a lot"</em> of attention from bots who endlessly scour the internet looking for vulnerable servers, mindlessly stuffing passwords, hoping one password will eventually let them in.</p><p>We can eliminate all worry about weak or compromised passwords by disabling all password based authentication, relying solely on <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/">asymmetric cryptography</a>, or <em>"ssh keys"</em>. Just use your favorite text editor to open <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and ensure these lines exist somewhere in it:</p><div><pre><span></span>PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
</pre></div><p>While we're here, a large majority <a href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> of these bots are interested in logging in as the <code>root</code> user. If you created a new admin account in <a href="#admin-user">the previous section</a> and ensured you can login using your public key, you can also disable <code>root</code> logins entirely with this line in the config:</p><table id="id2"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><a href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>Some simple <em>"bash-fu"</em> on my <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> shows ~93.58% of the roughly 15,000 login attempts since I started this server, tried to login as <code>root</code> Second place was the user <code>git</code> (including legitimate logins) at ~1.82%.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you uploaded your public key to your VPS provider, most of these changes should have already been configured for you. But in the off chance you had to make some changes, restart the <code>ssh</code> service to load the new config changes in:</p></div><div id="uncomplicated-firewall"><h3>Uncomplicated FireWall</h3><p>Depending on your VPS provider, they may also have a firewall system built into their admin panel allowing you to apply rules simply by adding tags to a server. However, I enjoy keeping all my firewall rules inside each box, if only for the same reason I <em>keep all my socks on the left hand drawer,</em> so everything stays organized and in the same place.</p><p>You can install <code>ufw</code> using the Advanced Packaging Tool:</p><p>Right now, the only thing we have enabled is <code>ssh</code> which uses port 22. To allow port 22 through <code>ufw</code> just use the following command:</p><p>and then turn the firewall on:</p><p>and <strong>viola!</strong> You have a firewall.</p></div><div id="fail2ban"><h3>fail2ban</h3><p>Even though we've turned off password based authentication <a href="#openssh">in a previous section</a>, we will still receive a significant amount of bots wasting our compute cycles trying to login. And while the likelihood of this being successful is <em>zero</em> when rounded to any order of magnitude, the bots will nevertheless continue to pilfer a non-zero amount of CPU if given the opportunity.</p><p>To stop the most brazen of these bots, tools like <a href="https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban">Fail2Ban</a>, which creates temporary firewall rules to block IP address who repeatedly fail to authenticate with <code>ssh</code>, are a great compromise between usefulness and annoyance.</p><p>The Advanced Packaging Tool can again help us install <code>fail2ban</code>.</p><p>Once installed, the <code>ssh</code> "jail" will come pre-enabled for you. If you wish to make any changes, you will need to make a copy of the <code>fail2ban</code> config file:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
</pre></div><p>Then add your changes to <code>jail.local</code> so they will persist after an upgrade.</p><p><code>fail2ban</code> does a great job documenting what each option does in the config file. Some of the changes I made are:</p><ul><li>because I use <code>ufw</code> to manage my firewall, I changed <code>banaction = ufw</code>.</li><li>enabled <code>bantime.increment</code> to increase the duration of a ban based on how many times the IP address has been banned previously.</li><li>enabled <code>bantime.rndtime</code> to <em>"randomize"</em> the length of a ban, preventing bots from knowing exactly when they can resume their assault.</li><li>enabled <code>bantime.maxtime</code> so I won't need to unban IP addresses (if you're unfortunate enough to share an IP with a bot).</li><li>lowered <code>bantime</code>, <code>findtime</code> and <code>maxretry</code> allowing me to issue small bans that increase in severity as the IP address continues to antagonize.</li></ul><p>Once you're satisfied with your changes, start <code>fail2ban</code> using <code>systemd</code>.</p><div><pre><span></span>$ systemctl enable fail2ban
$ systemctl start fail2ban
</pre></div><p>And <strong>Done!</strong></p><p>Depending on how <em>"popular"</em> you are on the internet, you should start to see <code>NOTICE</code> lines in <code>/var/log/fail2ban.log</code> of misbehaving bots and the equivalent firewall rules in <code>ufw</code>.</p><div><pre><span></span>$ cat /var/log/fail2ban.log | grep 'NOTICE' | tail -1

Once installed, Gitolite will give us more fine-grained-control over who has <code>git push|fetch</code> permissions to each repository. I encourage you to checkout <a href="https://gitolite.com/gitolite/basic-admin.html">Gitolite's amazing documentation</a> if only to see how capable Gitolite can be.</p><div id="step-1-create-the-git-user"><h3>Step: 1 - Create The Git User</h3><p>Before we install Gitolite, we'll need to create a new user for everyone to log into and to run Gitolite's Perl scripts. I typically use the username <code>git</code> for this, feel free to replace <code>git</code> with the username that you feel is more appropriate.</p><div><pre><span></span>$ adduser --system --group --disabled-password --home /var/lib/git git
</pre></div><p>This creates a new system-user on the server called <code>git</code>. Because this is not a <em>"normal"</em> user, there will be no aging information in <code>/etc/shadow</code>, which is convenient when nobody will be monitoring this account.</p><p>We also used the <code>--home</code> option to set the <code>$HOME</code> variable to <code>/var/lib/git</code>. This is where we will eventually put Gitolite's configuration files and our Git repositories. Feel free to adjust this to where you prefer, I've seen many use <code>/home/git</code>.</p><p>I included the <code>--disabled-password</code> to disable any password based access into our new user. In <a href="#openssh">the previous sections</a>, we've disabled all password based authentication into the server and Gitolite requires ssh keys for authentication, so disabling passwords for our user is a smart move.</p></div><div id="step-2-install-gitolite"><h3>Step: 2 - Install Gitolite</h3><p>Because Gitolite is just a bunch of Perl scripts, I prefer to install Gitolite from <a href="https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite">the source</a>. As we will see, installing Gitolite from source also has the benefit of making upgrades and adding custom patches in the future extremely easy.</p><p>This also means we'll need to install Gitolite's dependencies ourselves:</p><p>When we (or a colleague) signs into the server, using the <code>git</code> user, we will automatically run Gitolite's Perl scripts, which means these scripts must be executable by our <code>git</code> user. So, to make managing file permissions easier, we'll use our <code>git</code> user for the rest of the installation process.</p><p>Log into our <code>git</code> user with the "substitute user" command: (assuming you're the <code>root</code> user)</p><p>Then clone Gitolite's source code into the <code>$HOME</code> directory: (this should be <code>/var/lib/git</code> unless <a href="#step-1-create-the-git-user">you changed it</a> when we setup the <code>git</code> user above)</p><div><pre><span></span>$ git clone https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
</pre></div></div><div id="step-3-setup-gitolite"><h3>Step: 3 - Setup …</h3></div></div></div></div>

    </span></p><p>Can marketing be ethical? Or is marketing nothing but a sharp-elbowed race for business growth?</p><p>I truly think it can be. In moral terms, healthy commercial competition needn’t mean a race to the bottom. And I find it sad that I should even have to say that. But I do.</p><p>So I’ve written a manifesto for ethical marketing practices. It started as something I wrote purely for my own benefit, to keep myself honest. But now I’m thinking – why not share it with the world? It’s the kind of manifesto I would have liked to read at the start of my career, and if others find it useful, then great.</p><p>I’m keen to point out that it’s not one of <a href="https://www.kimmok.com/the-manifesto-manifesto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">those manifestos</a>. What I mean is, it’s not style over substance. It’s very much about the substance and values behind today’s marketing practices, and how we can do things better.</p><h3 id="why-do-we-glorify-growth-hacks">Why Do We Glorify Growth Hacks?</h3><p>It’s not so much that growth hacks are a problem per se. There’s nothing wrong with spotting new opportunities that make good use of data or customer behaviour and add a bit of technology to get the best possible outcome.  </p><p>But bad practices lurk in the most honourable of professions, and there’s a world of difference between a legal and ethical growth hack and scraping third-party websites for user data, or otherwise breaking the terms and conditions of those sites to exploit users and strip away their privacy. <a href="https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/airbnb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Airbnb: The Growth Story You Didn’t Know</a> is a case in point here.</p><p>It saddens me to read articles that trumpet the growth of Uber, despite dubious tactics like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">identifying and tagging iPhones even after the owner has deleted the Uber app app and erased the device</a>. Or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">deceiving authorities and blocking officials from the Uber service</a>.</p><p>It’s not just Uber. Marketers continued to praise Facebook’s growth even after revelations that the social media giant used tools like Onavo to pay kids as young as 13 to give them root access to their devices. And then made gross intrusions into their privacy by opening up personal messages, photos, videos, emails, and even Amazon order history, while publicly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onavo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">posing as a privacy-focused app</a>.</p><h3 id="marketing-and-the-social-dilemma">Marketing and The Social Dilemma</h3><p>I watched <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81254224" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Social Dilemma</a>, a fantastic documentary that should be mandatory viewing in schools. And it made me feel genuinely embarrassed for my profession.</p><p>In the film, we see a bunch of people who’ve made a killing by moving around from one unethical corporation to another. Then in the documentary we see their profound discomfort with the damage their features inflict on people who use them.</p><p>We all know about the negative consequences of the Instagram society – living for likes, and worse besides. My problem is, again, that we glorify these tricks because in marketing, growth is gold. The Social Dilemma unpeels the attention economy and reveals the rotten core that is ‘growth at all costs’ thinking. It shows the wilful ignorance at play here, with powerful people actively avoiding information that exposes uncomfortable truths.</p><p>None of these people are evil. But that’s precisely what is so dangerous, because they are actively contributing to a society-wide problem. As Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce once said, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-cigarettes-marc-benioff-salesforce-a9265756.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook “is the new cigarettes for our society”</a>. Some think it made them look cool, but in 20 years it will look quite different. We stand to be judged by future generations.</p><h3 id="dark-patterns-and-sludges">Dark Patterns and Sludges</h3><p>I am deeply concerned about the proliferation of two disturbing trends in user interface design that are actively promoted as growth hacks by marketers:</p><ul><li><strong>Dark patterns:</strong> Features that coerce, steer or deceive users into unintended and potentially harmful actions</li><li><strong>Sludges:</strong> Processes that are made deliberately difficult to encourage users into a pathway that will go against their best interests.</li></ul><p>What is even more dubious than these dark patterns and sludges? Stand up Nir Eyal, and others like him, who, having played a big part in creating the problem, go on to make even more money by selling the solution. Eyal wrote Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products to teach founders how to build addictive products. He followed it up with Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, which teaches consumers how to avoid the addictive design of the products he himself helped to shape.</p><h3 id="the-ethics-of-marketing-agencies">The Ethics of Marketing Agencies</h3><p>No, I’m not about to argue that marketing agencies are evil. But I do think their business model is flawed, and this can have unethical consequences. I’ve worked with agencies both as an employee and a client, and there are a number of reasons why I’ve resisted setting up my own traditional agency:</p><ul><li>The agent/principal problem – Most agencies sell time, and their business model only works if they take a cookie-cutter approach. The more copy and pasting they do, the better their returns. It is simply inefficient to be creative and do a ton of original research for every new client.</li><li>No skin in the game – Nassim Taleb explains this brilliantly in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/0241247470" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Skin in the Game</a> but basically, regardless of the outcome of any project, an agency simply collects the fees and risks nothing. Famously, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/04/23/hertz_accenture_lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hertz had to sue Accenture</a> to recover $32m they paid for a website rebuild which was allegedly incomplete and poor quality. Accenture offered to fix the shortcomings for an extra $10m.</li><li>You might be a world-class marketer, but if you set up an agency and hire people, much of your day-to-day work will shift from marketing to running a business.</li><li>Agencies routinely assign high-skilled marketers to create a pitch, or play a prominent role in the early stages, only to pass the real work down to junior staff or even outsource it. If you’re lucky, you’ll get to see that talented individual again – when your contract comes up for renewal.</li></ul><p>If we widen our lens on the agency, we see that most clients are surprisingly okay with all that. And that’s because for them, hiring an agency is not about the deliverables; it’s about validation and even covering their own backside.</p><p>Here’s what I mean. When one of the Big Four is hired to tackle a complex issue, they are not hired primarily for their skills or capacity to solve that problem. It’s more that in the event of their failure to solve it, the CEO will be able to stand up to the Board and say: “Well, the problem turned out to be so difficult that even the Big Four were stumped.” In other words, the agency relationship is more about blame reduction than business outcomes.</p><p>Do all agencies suffer from these problems? Of course not. In fact, I’m currently working with an amazing agency that is truly ethical and, as far as I can see, always does the right thing for the client, even that eats into their profit margin. But it’s important to be aware of these issues and mitigate the risks.</p><p>Here are some Ethical Marketing Principles I stand by:</p><h4 id="dont-use-dark-patterns">Don’t use dark patterns</h4><p>This one’s pretty self-explanatory. Don’t use any deceptive tactics to trick your users into doing things they don’t want to.</p><h4 id="dont-fall-for-the-texas-sharpshooter-fallacy">Don’t fall for the Texas sharpshooter fallacy</h4><p>Good marketing involves experimentation. When you run an experiment, it will sometimes deliver positive outcomes that were unintended and outside scope. Don’t try to spin them into some sort of tactic you planned all along. Some things just happen for no particular reason.</p><h4 id="dont-fall-for-action-bias">Don’t fall for action bias</h4><p>Don’t fall for the illusion that doing something is always better than doing nothing.</p><h4 id="be-transparent">Be transparent</h4><p>Things can and do go wrong. The minute you notice something wrong on a joint problem, ‘fess up! Then give your full attention to solving the problem.</p><h4 id="be-direct">Be direct</h4><p>Being direct (though not to the point of rudeness) with people you work with is a sign of respect. It means you’re a responsible adult and you’re treating others as such. Focus on delivering the true message and not on repackaging it.</p><h4 id="use-ethically-sourced-data">Use ethically-sourced data</h4><p>Only use consumer data that the user willingly shared or that was captured with full consent in place. For Account-Based Marketing (ABM) campaigns the data can come from third parties, but it will always be data that the consumer shared knowingly.</p><h4 id="protect-your-users-privacy">Protect your users’ privacy</h4><p>Only capture and use data that it is absolutely necessary and wherever possible, avoid Personal Identifiable Information (PII).</p><h4 id="avoid-confirmation-bias">Avoid confirmation bias</h4><p>Don’t actively seek out and assign more weight to evidence that confirms your own hypothesis.</p><h4 id="be-sustainable">Be sustainable</h4><p>Don’t promote products or services that encourage wasteful or unhealthy behaviour.</p><h4 id="work-with-companies-that-add-value-to-society">Work with companies that add value to society</h4><p>Your organisation, its products and services should not exploit anyone. Instead, they should have a positive impact on other people and the world around you.</p><h4 id="dont-lie-with-statistics">Don’t lie with statistics</h4><p>Always present your findings in the most transparent manner. Don’t use flawed correlations, or cherry-pick data that suits your own interests. Share all your results regardless of the outcome; it’s scary how many studies end up unpublished when the results don’t favour the researcher.</p><h4 id="be-open-minded-and-dont-fall-for-reactive-devaluation">Be open-minded and don’t fall for reactive devaluation</h4><p>Evaluate all options and opinions available. Don’t rush to dismiss certain opinions just because they come from a source that you habitually disagree with.</p><h4 id="identify-and-point-out-sunk-cost-fallacies">Identify and point out sunk cost fallacies</h4><p>It’s not uncommon to see projects continuing simply because of the vast amount of money already spent on them, even though the outcomes won’t be those expected. Point out the problem when that happens and work constructively to save the project.</p><h4 id="dont-fall-for-information-bias">Don’t fall for information bias</h4><p>Sometimes you find teams searching for additional information even when it’s not going to affect the decision. Find ways to make the best decisions with the minimum amount of information.</p><h4 id="dont-be-seduced-by-groupthink">Don’t be seduced by groupthink</h4><p>If you truly believe something, then be prepared to stand by for your ideas and push back even if the majority disagrees</p><h4 id="dont-overlook-governance">Don’t overlook governance</h4><p>Work within governance mechanisms, and follow established processes where possible. Where no process is in place, create one.</p><h4 id="be-good">Be good</h4><p>Google famously had a ‘Don’t be …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>I know a number of folks use <strong>The Great Suspender</strong> to automatically suspend
inactive browser tabs in Chrome. Apparently recent versions of this extension
have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleTaylor/comments/jowlt2/open_source_development_the_great_suspender_saga/">taken over by a shady anonymous entity</a> and is now
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/great-suspender-extension-now-flagged-malware-edge-has-built-replacement">flagged by Microsoft as malware</a>. Notably the most recent
version of the extension (v7.1.8) has added integrated analytics that can
track all of your browsing activity across all sites. Yikes.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for users of The Great Suspender (7.1.8):</strong></p>

<h3>Temporary easy fix</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disable analytics tracking by opening the extension options for
The Great Suspender and checking the box
“Automatic deactivation of any kind of tracking”.</li>
<li>Pray that the shady developer doesn’t issue a malicious update to The Great Suspender later.
(There’s no sensible way to disable updates of an individual extension.)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Permanent harder fix <small>(👈 <strong>Recommended!</strong>)</small></h3>

<ul>
<li>Close as many unneeded tabs as you can.</li>
<li>Unsuspend all remaining tabs. ⏳</li>
<li>Uninstall The Great Suspender.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.1.6">latest good version</a> of The Great Suspender (7.1.6) from GitHub,
and move it to some permanent location outside your Downloads folder.
(It should be commit 9730c09.)</li>
<li>Load your downloaded copy as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-you-can-still-download-chrome-extensions-without-us-1826796797">an unpacked extension</a>.
(This copy will not auto-update to future untrusted versions of the extension.)</li>
<li>All done! 🎉</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> My understanding is that installing an unpacked extension in this way
will cause Chrome to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25847171">issue a new kind of security prompt</a> every time it is
launched, which you’ll have to ignore. 😕</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>Other browser extensions for suspending tabs exist, as mentioned in the
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25846504">Hacker New discussion</a> for this article. However I have not conducted my own
security review on any of those other extensions, so buyer beware.</p>

      <article role="main">
        <p>In October, the popular and famous archivist tool <a href="https://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a> was taken down by GitHub due to a DMCA request by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America#Criticism">Recording Industry Association of America</a>. I posted a <a href="https://assassinate-you.net/posts/2020/10/youtube-dl-takedown/">detailed analysis</a> explaining the relation between international, US, EU and German law, and showing why this request was very different from what most people know as the “classic” DMCA takedown request. I felt this was necessary since there were a lot of rumor and wrong claims out on the Internet (not just in forums or on the (anti)social media, but also on media offerings), which did not help the discussion at all. The repository is back now, thanks to the EFF and its team. They <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca">filed a counter-notice</a> on behalf of the youtube-dl maintainers, which allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository.</p>
<h2 id="eff-helps-out-by-writing-a-counter-notice">EFF helps out by writing a counter notice</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, a non-governmental organization based in the U.S. dedicated to defending civil liberties and especially digital rights, helped out the youtube-dl maintainers by filing a very informative <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">counter notice</a> with GitHub. This notice explained why the request itself is an abuse of the DMCA and the takedown was not justified at all. It allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository and, more importantly, all the metadata (for example, issues and pull requests) that was posted on the platform by users, developers and maintainers. Such information is invaluable to a project, and a takedown of the <em>entire</em> repository with all this data can hurt a project very badly.</p>
<p>The takedown was widely regarded as abuse of the DMCA by the RIAA, given that the youtube-dl code repository did not contain any infringing material. The argumentation was made up by claiming that the primary purpose was to infringe copyright of some songs whose artists are apparently represented by the RIAA. They cited some automated unit tests for this, which do not download the entire songs, and would not be seen or executed by regular users. The EFF argues that these are likely a form of “fair use” and thus allowed legally.</p>
<p>The request also cited an obscure German court decision which considered YouTube’s “rolling cipher” an “effective technological measure”, whose bypassing would be prohibited by copyright laws around the world. The EFF explains that the decision was “wrongly decided and is not binding nor even persuasive under U.S. law”.</p>
<p>The EFF further questions the effectivity of the algorithm in general, given that YouTube delivers the code for decryption in a readable form (and also, the code can be executed outside browsers, too). On top of that, the streams are freely accessible once you have the URLs. YouTube only hides the URLs, but not in an effective way. Therefore, this algorithm cannot be considered a “technological measure”, and thus, the RIAA request is baseless.</p>
<p>In the context of this debate, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS">DeCSS controversy</a> was mentioned a lot, as there’s been some similarities with how copyright holders reacted to the existence of software to bypass their (arguably not very secure) CSS protection. Their first actions focused on software hosting sites, pressurizing them to take down the software by threatening them with legal steps. This led to a mirroring campaign, due to what we call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> nowadays.
There’s been some litigation in the early 2000s, where judges ruled in favor of the copyright holders.
However, this has little relevance to the case of youtube-dl, as the EFF explains. Reverse-engineering YouTube’s code doesn’t enable users to save copies of the material, they already can do so in many other ways. Also, youtube-dl doesn’t bypass DRM technologies like Google’s Widevine. Also, there’s many resources under free licenses on the video platform, which users are explicitly allowed to download and share. And in the U.S., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress">Library of Congress</a> may even <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2018/10/new-exemptions-dmca-section-1201-are-welcome-dont-go-far-enough">issue exemptions of Section 1201</a> of the DMCA, under which bypassing anti-circumvention is fine legally.</p>
<p>EFF’s notice summarizes the situation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, youtube-dl does not violate either the Copyright Act or the DMCA. EFF  and  the  youtube-dl  maintainers  thank  GitHub  for  standing  up  for  the  rights  of developers whose projects it hosts. We hope this explanation will allow you to restore the youtube-dl repository so that GitHub can continue to be the home for development of this popular and important tool.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">EFF letter to GitHub on youtube-dl takedown</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, EFF! You did not just helped a tool that is crucial to journalists, activists, lawyers and so many other people. You also destroyed the RIAA’s wrong claims, which will hopefully prevent similar attacks on other tools in the future.</p>
<h2 id="githubs-reactions">GitHub’s reactions</h2>
<p>Regarding GitHub, it is sad that they took down the repository at all. It’s a well-known pattern: platforms rather comply with such requests than risking litigation, requiring projects to invest time and money to fund lawyers themselves (or hope for an association such as the EFF to pick up their case). The moment they published the request and took down the repositories, many experts immediately raised concerns that the request itself is illegal. It remains questionable why GitHub’s legal team didn’t recognize this. They likely were not prepared well enough for such a situation. GitHub did not stand up for the community that made them the most popular hosting platform for software in the world.</p>
<p>Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, later apparently reached out to the youtube-dl team personally, expressing his sympathy, and offering some support. However, the damage was already done then. The team lost its primary communication channel to their users and each other, as well as the entire history.</p>
<p>It seems more likely that their PR department recognized they are criticised heavily for taking down the project in the first place, putting their (actually pretty good) relation to the open-source community at risk, and thus creating a serious threat to their business.</p>
<p>At least this case prompted them to rethink their strategy on future lawsuits. They posted a <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">blog article</a>, excusing their takedown with compliance, as expected. They promised changes for the benefit of projects threatened by similar requests in the future at least, such as donating to a “developer defense fund” dedicated to helping out projects threatened by such anti-circumvention takedown requests.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they recognized that there is a strong need for maintainers to access the issues and pull requests. They promised to ensure that developers can export those after a takedown (even if requests are valid). The real question however is why they wouldn’t just keep showing them, and just hide the code repository. Introducing such an option globally for every repository would be an even bigger improvement, allowing developers to always create backups of those data.</p>
<p>As GitHub state themselves, among all DMCA takedown requests, these circumvention ones are quite rare. We will have to see whether it is going to have a lot of effect. It would be better if they just donated money to defend developers of projects for which they receive <em>any</em> kind of unwarranted takedown request, rather than limiting it to this edge case.</p>
<p>By the way: in the end, it’s up to the people to request better copyright laws from the politics. They tend to get worse, not better. Make sure your voice is heard. Call your representatives (that’s better than sending a mail, as a phone call can hardly be ignored). Go on the streets and protest against changes and for improvements <em>for you as a user</em>. Support campaigns of civil rights organizations trying to change the laws.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>Maintainers who host their projects on large proprietary platforms like GitHub or GitLab’s cloud offering should always have a strategy for such situations. They should set up mirrors of the code proactively. Backing up metadata is significantly harder (especially if platforms don’t provide import/export tools, which most of the big ones do not). Some people use the project import features in tools like <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a>, but as those are one-off features, one would have to repeat the process every now and then. For the issues, there is an experimental tool called <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug">git-bug</a>, which allows offline backups and migrations, and comes with bridges to import and export to a variety of tools (and is <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug#help-needed">looking for contributors</a> to add new bridges and extend the functionality).</p>
<p>It looks like the free software community should prepare themselves better in the future. We should develop better tools to back up our metadata, also allowing us to move between platforms more easily.
If GitHub wants to remain the most popular hosting platform, they should consider adding such functionality out of the box (ideally in a standardized format). Offering such functionality doesn’t mean that projects would just leave for other platforms automatically. It would rather show that GitHub is really committed to the idea of open-source software, whose development can take place everywhere. After all, we are the ones who helped GitHub become the number one platform for software development in the world.</p>
<p>There is one thing that has been and is always going to be counterproductive, especially in such situations: blind actionism. Many people flooded the Internet (read: forums, Reddit, bug trackers of projects), inciting panic and suggesting to move to some other “free” hosted platform. This is clearly not a solution. Any hosting platform will sooner or later have to comply with such a request. It can become very expensive if you end up in court. The true solution, as we have seen in this situation, is to stay calm, analyze the situation, assess the threat to your own project and remove code and text that could be abused to justify such a request (e.g., if you are developing a similar project and also use such songs in a unit test, you can change your test to content under free licenses). Moving to another platform does not solve the root issue, and …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust has taken the programming language world by storm. Since its 1.0 release in 2015, it has been one of the most loved programming languages with a loyal following of developers and contributors.</p><p>To learn why this language is favored so much between developers, we have started a new series on Rust in production. In it, we’ll interview people that have used Rust for significant projects: apps, services, startup MVPs, and others.</p><p>For the first installment of the series, we interview Michael Fey, VP of Engineering at <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. Read further to find out why they chose Rust for their product, the benefits of Rust for security-centered applications, and what cool libraries you should look into if you’re developing something similar in Rust.</p><h3 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</h3><p>1Password is a password manager trusted by millions of people and 70,000 businesses to secure their sensitive data. It remembers all your passwords so you don’t have to, and comes with apps for all major browsers, plus desktop and mobile.</p><p>I am the VP of Engineering for Client Apps here at 1Password. If you have ever had the pleasure to use 1Password on your Mac, Windows PC, iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or tablet, or in your browser, then you’ve been lucky enough to use something my team has built. We’ve been around since 2004, and we take a lot of pride in building a well-crafted experience and keeping people safe online.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/xa/xarnasmy.111_(5).jpg" alt="Michael Fey" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="can-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-1password%3F-how-big-a-part-of-your-codebase-is-written-in-rust%3F">Can you talk about the stack of 1Password? How big a part of your codebase is written in Rust?</h3><p>We’ve been using Rust in production at 1Password for a few years now. Our Windows team was the frontrunner on this effort to the point where about 70% of 1Password 7 for Windows is written in Rust. We also ported the 1Password Brain – the engine that powers our browser filling logic – from Go to Rust at the end of 2019 so that we could take advantage of the speed and performance of deploying Rust to WebAssembly in our browser extension.</p><p>These have been in production for the last few years and we’ve seen great success. So much so that we’re now in the midst of a complete rewrite of nearly our entire product lineup, and Rust is a major part of that story. We are using Rust to create a headless 1Password app that encompasses all of the business logic, cryptography, database access, server communication, and more wrapped in a thin UI layer that is native to the system on which we’re deploying.</p><h3 id="did-any-of-rust%E2%80%99s-advantages-like-speed-or-type%2Fmemory-safety-influence-the-choice-of-using-rust-for-1password%3F">Did any of Rust’s advantages like speed or type/memory-safety influence the choice of using Rust for 1Password?</h3><p>One of the main things that drew us to Rust initially was the memory safety; it definitely excites us knowing that Rust helps us maximize our confidence in the safety of our customers’ secrets. Beyond memory safety, though, there’s so much more we love about the Rust ecosystem. There is a significant performance benefit to the lack of a traditional runtime; we don’t have to worry about the overhead of a garbage collector, for instance. Rust offers a form of “program correctness” and many guarantees against undefined behaviour at runtime. The strong type system enforces these rules at compile-time. Carefully aligning application logic with Rust’s strong type rules makes APIs difficult to use incorrectly and results in simpler code that’s free from runtime checking of constraints and invariants; the compiler can guarantee there are no invalid runtime code paths that will lead your program astray before it executes. Having to perform less runtime state validation leads to cleaner, more efficient, more focused, and higher quality code. Rust requires very little runtime debugging compared to other languages. If it compiles, you can be fairly sure it won’t exhibit unexpected behaviour. It may not be what you <em>want</em> but it will be “correct”. 🙂</p><p>Another very powerful (and often overlooked) feature of Rust is its procedural macro system, which has allowed us to write a tool that automatically shares types defined in Rust with our client-side languages (Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript). The output from this tool handles the serialization/deserialization process automatically, meaning our client-side devs can continue to work in their language of choice while interacting with the Rust library and can be free from the concerns of JSON parsing over the foreign function interface (FFI). We get all of this while enjoying the benefits of compile-time type checking in every one of our target languages. We’ve integrated this tool into our continuous integration server as well, meaning that changes to the Rust models can result in compilation failures in the client applications that are caught during our review process.</p><p>This tool has been an integral component in our development process, allowing us to move much more quickly than ever before. Once our types are defined in Rust, we are able to immediately generate equivalent types in our client-side languages. This allows our devs to focus on solving problems without having to hand-roll boilerplate code to communicate over the FFI.</p><h3 id="how-good-is-rust%E2%80%99s-support-(library-and-otherwise)-for-developing-security-centric-applications-like-1password%3F">How good is Rust’s support (library and otherwise) for developing security-centric applications like 1Password?</h3><p>There is more than enough to build a majority of the base that security-centered applications require. There are two large, prominent cryptography platforms (<em><a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring">ring</a></em> and the <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">Rust Crypto</a> group) that together provide a wealth of functionality. As I mentioned above, writing with Rust itself gives you much greater confidence in your memory usage and makes it much harder to accidentally introduce a memory-related exploit into your application. There is also a wonderful system in place for keeping track of vulnerabilities that do show up from time to time in Rust crates: the <a href="https://rustsec.org/">RustSec</a> database, which is community-sourced by other Rust developers and is updated frequently with new information that can be consumed in CI audit scans. The batteries-included test framework that Rust and Cargo also include mean that you always have an easy way to write unit-test suites for correct behavior in critical code, like any cryptographic functions that you write.</p><p>While safe native Rust libraries for everything are the dream (and they will come in time), there is always the option to dip down and easily consume something in C or from native platform libraries. We use this to great effect in our Rust code for things like calling out to the native implementations of biometric unlock (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) and platform-specific settings implementations like NSUserDefaults on Apple platforms.</p><h3 id="any-particular-rust-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Any particular Rust libraries that you want to feature?</h3><p>Absolutely. Tokio, Hyper/Reqwest, Ring, and Neon all have a home in 1Password and are fundamental in allowing us to tackle this ambitious project at all. You should also check out our <a href="https://crates.io/crates/password-rules-parser">password-rules-parser</a> on <a href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, which is based on a spec primarily being backed by Apple. Their tools and docs can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/">here</a>.</p><h3 id="where-is-rust-great-to-use%2C-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Rust great to use, and where does it fall short in your stack?</h3><p>Rust has fulfilled 90% of what we were hoping for when we started this project. We’ve been able to deploy it to nearly every one of our target platforms in some way shape or form (with the exception of Apple Watch). The language itself has been designed with modern sensibilities and is improving with every release. It has great documentation and an active community.</p><p>Although there are countless crates available for use, we did have to roll our own logging and tracing tools to ensure that they were safe to use in 1Password. Additionally, we constructed a substantial localization implementation to meet the requirements of our products.</p><p>It did fall short for us in one key area: We were hoping WebAssembly would take us further in the browser and our browser extension than it has. WebAssembly has been great as a function library, but attempting to stand up an entire runtime in WASM has been a challenge. Many of the issues we ran into, however, were not limitations of Rust but of WebAssembly as a deployment platform.</p><h3 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-while-developing-1password-with-rust%3F">What was the biggest challenge while developing 1Password with Rust?</h3><p>Many of the folks on our team were new to Rust, and they experienced the typical learning curve that comes with its memory management and ownership model. We are also finding the compile times to be pretty beefy; our CPUs and fans are definitely getting a workout. 😄</p><h3 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h3><p>Absolutely.</p><p>If you’re new to Rust, start small and build on top of that. We ran a large number of experiments when we were getting started to try and find the edges of what a Rust-based solution could provide. When your experiments pan out, try to reimagine the ways you used to work with other languages and see if your code can benefit from Rust’s philosophy.</p><p>If you’re new to 1Password, you can <a href="https://start.1password.com/sign-up/plan?c=1PCORE2021">sign up today with this link</a> and save 50% off your first year for family and individual accounts.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When the call came</strong> to say my mother had died, I was working on a jigsaw of Joan MirÃ³â€™s painting <em>The Tilled Field</em> (1923-24). Like many others, I turned to jigsaws at the start of the pandemic as a way to manage stress, and symbolically reimpose order on a chaotic world. We take our consolations where we can and, as I continued with the puzzle in the days after mumâ€™s death, its tactile qualities, the spicy smell of ink and card, and the small satisfactions of placing each piece where it belonged, grounded me when the world was in bits â€“ both outside and within.</p>
<p><em>The Tilled Field</em> is an elementally life-affirming painting. A view of MirÃ³â€™s family farm in Mont-roig del Camp in Catalonia, it conjures a surreal collection of human, animal and vegetable forms, deconstructed and stylised, and heavily symbolic. Drawing on references from medieval Spanish tapestry to Catalan ceramics and cave paintings, the image is earthy, visceral and definitively a rural scene. Still, thereâ€™s something disquieting about the painting, as if it had emerged from a dream or the recesses of an unquiet mind. A tree grows a human ear and an eye; a cloud formation is also a weathervane; a piebald mare swishes her tail as her foal suckles at her teat. At its heart sits a tumbledown farmhouse straight from a dark folk tale. The smoke from its chimney suggests occupation, but the plaster walls are cracked and crumbling back to earth.</p>
<p>Since her diagnosis of dementia <span>15 years</span> ago, my mother, too, had been disintegrating, as it were, piece by piece. At each of my fortnightly visits, some further part of her seemed to have newly dropped away, leaving gaps so raw and cruel that I sometimes had to remind myself to focus on what remained. <span>COVID-19</span> put a stop to my visiting the nursing home where she spent the final decade of her life. We tried FaceTime â€˜get togethersâ€™ but my mother was blind as well as in <span>late-stage</span> dementia, so these felt like <span>one-way</span> affairs â€“ mumâ€™s eyes <span>half-closed,</span> her face unresponsive, her body giving every impression of lifelessness. At the time of her death, I hadnâ€™t seen her for four months, and her image had begun to fade in my mind.</p>
<p>Having a meaningful exchange with my mother involved delving into our shared narrative archive even as it shrank. In this way, we relived and remade the story of our life. We dipped toffee apples for bonfire night, rode donkeys on Llandudno beach, searched for the screech owl in the forest near my childhood home. Sometimes, my mother added to these memories as if they were lucid dreams she could shape at will. Meeting her where she was meant I had to map out the changing landscape of her dementia. Only there could we truly be together.</p>
<p><span>Three-year-olds</span> work by trial and error, but <span>four-year-olds</span> use the information in the picture to help them complete the puzzle</p>
<p>If maps are representations of a larger reality, then jigsaws are maps too. Indeed, they began life this way, as â€˜dissected mapsâ€™. Invented by the British cartographer John Spilsbury in the 1760s, the earliest puzzles were designed to make geography lessons more fun for schoolchildren and, no doubt, inculcate them early into the cult of empire. They remained classroom aids until <span>the 1800s,</span> when their manufacture was made cheaper by lithographic printing techniques, the invention of plywood and the treadle jigsaw. Over the <span>19th century,</span> what began as hand-coloured maps became printed images of monarchs and biblical illustrations, and by the <em>fin de siÃ¨cle</em>, when the ideas of Freud, Darwin, Nietzsche and the â€˜New Womanâ€™ threatened to fragment the old reality entirely, jigsaws had become popular family entertainments.</p>
<p>Like childhood itself, the early dissected maps arrived without any paper picture to act as a guide. The puzzle historian Anne Williams notes that, in 1908, Parker Bros changed the game by adding a print of the complete image to the box. With uncertainty about the destination reduced, the path grew more enticing. By the early 1930s, with the Great Depression beginning to bite, sales of jigsaws in the United States topped <span>10 million</span> a week. Enthusiasts queued at newsagents for new deliveries, much as modern lockdown puzzlers scoured the internet and traded in secondhand puzzles.</p>
<p>While there is <a href="https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-017-2151-9" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">evidence</a> to suggest that jigsaws help older people retain visuospatial memory, a recent <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13391" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> led by the psychologist Martin Doherty at the University of East Anglia in the UK is the first to investigate how children use their understanding of pictures to complete jigsaw puzzles. The study found that three-year-olds work by trial and error, but four-year-olds use the information in the picture to help them complete the puzzle. Such an understanding of the language of pictorial representation is the foundation of the uniquely human ability to draw and create art.</p>
<p><strong>Itâ€™s often said that</strong> old age is a second childhood. The similarity of the two states â€“ the child immersed in their magic kingdom, the old person in their memory palace â€“ isnâ€™t lost on artists, scientists and thinkers. As the child emerges from the void, accumulating experience, making connections between things and people, so the old person divests themselves, or has taken from them, those same connections, before they return to the emptiness of nonexistence.</p>
<p>When cracks first began to appear in my motherâ€™s memory, she frantically touched them up in a colour that never quite matched. Once <span>touch-ups</span> became insufficient, she began a programme of wholesale renovation in the form of confabulated memories, extending and reworking experiences that, had they been real, wouldnâ€™t have passed building regulations. Though by now immobile, sheâ€™d insist that she had taken a long walk by the seaside, or run across my brother in a pear orchard, or just returned from holiday. The further her disease advanced, the less robust her attempts at repair became, as the supply of materials with which to build them dwindled. She once told me that her mind was falling to bits, which is what happens to everything and everyone eventually. We live with entropy. Yet how hard we resist it. Much of the human project is taken up with holding together things that will, eventually and inevitably, fall apart. Witnessing my mother labouring to put her brain back together was intensely moving. Her courage and resistance were flags planted in the territory of the living, and they deepened my love for her as she grew more frail. The lesson I learned is that itâ€™s not memory that makes us human but meaning-making. Thatâ€™s where the beauty and poignancy of human life is played out.</p>
<p>Slotting a familiar piece into its rightful place can feel almost as rewarding as returning a lost child to her mother</p>
<p>Art is a system of meaning-making too and, in the months since mumâ€™s death, I have deepened my understanding of how it operates by â€˜dissectingâ€™ the map that is <em>The Tilled Field</em>. To complete the jigsaw of an artwork is to observe the artistâ€™s work in a way thatâ€™s almost impossible to do in a gallery. You get to know it intimately, becoming familiar with every turn of the brush, each minute gradation of colour and tone. You develop an eye for certain patterns. Particularly â€˜helpfulâ€™ or intriguing jigsaw pieces, that are vital sources of information, data points along the route to completion, take on the character of old friends. Slotting a familiar piece into its rightful place can feel almost as rewarding as returning a lost child to her mother. Over the weeks it takes me to complete <em>The Tilled Field</em>, its elements and some essence of the artist take up residence inside me, becoming, as the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein might have said, introjected internal objects.</p>
<p>This kind of dynamic encounter of projection and introjection with the world of people and objects is how Klein imagines the way an infant struggles to construct an integrated ego. If weâ€™re lucky, Klein suggests, we develop from fragments of desire and need, frustrated or met, into coherent selves able to meet our own desires and needs. Whispering seductively in our ears all the while is Thanatos, the death instinct, willing us back towards the comforting psychic disintegration of <span>not-feeling</span> and unbeing. For Klein, coming into being is an existential battle. For some of us the drama returns, as it did for my mother, in the long, slow process of leaving life behind.</p>
<p>Kleinâ€™s one-time disciple Donald Winnicott had something interesting to say about becoming that seems important to me, standing as I am in the shadow of my motherâ€™s death. For him, the mother is at the heart of everything â€“ her willingness to hold, handle and â€˜present objectsâ€™ to her baby, to lend him her ego for his own use, enabling him to see himself as a coherent being, separate from her (and thus able support a relationship with her). Only through her can he become whole and real. In the language of jigsaws, good-enough mothering is the guide-image that the infant requires to allow him to build an integrated self from the bits and pieces of his needs, his developing internal world and his body.</p>
<p>When, later, bereavement leaves us once more in pieces, when the mother who birthed us is no longer here, how do we put ourselves back together again? Where is the guide-picture to help us map loss when the world itself seems to be coming apart, exposing the insufficiency of the old rubrics for living?</p>
<p>The attachment theorist John Bowlby described mourning as a form of separation anxiety, akin to that felt by a child lost in a crowd. There is panic, disorientation, a shattering of reality. Freud thought that, in order to grieve healthily, we must sever our bonds with the dead, and establish new ones with the living. But even if that were desirable, cutting ties with the mother through whom one becomes a self seems to ask the impossible. Dennis Klass, an expert on bereavement, <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Continuing-Bonds-New-Understandings-of-Grief/Klass-Silverman-Nickman/p/book/9781560323396" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">suggests</a> a more compassionate model. In his view, thereâ€™s no …</p></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="soul-a-new-language-now-in-v10-makes-audio-coding-vastly-more-accessible">SOUL, a new language now in V1.0, makes audio coding vastly more accessible</h3>

<h5 id="january-20-2021">January 20, 2021</h5>

<p>London — Today’s release of SOUL, the new universal language for audio applications, will dramatically lower barriers and expand access for developers creating any apps that depend on audio, as well as providing a more efficient architecture for audio processing.</p>

<p>SOUL has reached version 1.0 status with its language, compiler, and “SOUL patch” format all stable, tested, and ready to use in a wide variety of audio-related projects.. The team, led by JUCE and Tracktion creator Julian Storer, is already at work on an array of other SOUL tools including a visual editor and a developer portal.</p>

<p>“SOUL will revolutionize audio app development, eliminating challenges that have impeded developers for too long,” said Julian Storer, Head of Software Architecture at ROLI. “The need for a radical rethink of how audio apps are made has only become more urgent since I started the SOUL project in 2016. I’m tremendously excited about the V1.0 released today and the additional tools to come.”</p>

<p>Both a programming language and a platform for creating audio plugins and apps, SOUL will solve four fundamental problems facing audio developers today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Easy to learn and use: C++, the standard language for audio app coding, is extremely difficult to learn. The SOUL language is much simpler and more intuitive. Browser-based tools and fast live testing make it even easier to use and master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More secure: Sandboxing untrusted third-party code adds performance overheads that are a particular problem for audio coding. SOUL uses an intermediate assembly language called HEART that is safe to run without sandboxing, making SOUL code far more secure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimized for power and performance: CPU-intensive power consumption is a constant problem for developers. The SOUL language is far more efficient. It is specifically designed for performance, with its JIT engine matching an equivalent program written in native C++.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Achieves lowest latency: Latency in audio apps is another deep-rooted issue that to date is solved by running audio on dedicated audio hardware. SOUL unlocks ultra-low latency on devices without the need for embedded CPUs and DSPs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since debuting SOUL at ADC 2018, the team has continuously welcomed feedback through the open-source repository at https://soul.dev. This feedback has helped SOUL reach its V1.0 state today.</p>

<p>The SOUL team encourages developers to explore the language on soul.dev, read the documentation on the SOUL repository on Github, and give more feedback as the SOUL toolset continues to grow this year.</p>

  <section>
    <p>One of the advantages of QWidgets when building a Qt application is
the ability to build in a simple way custom widgets with the QPainter
API. This gives the Qt developer almost total freedom to implement
complex geometries for their widgets.</p>
<p>On the other hands, QML contains by default only rectangles. These
rectangles can change the radius to create circles and rounded rectangles, but more
complex shapes are more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-custom-geometry-in-qtquick">The current state of custom geometry in QtQuick</h2>
<p>Fortunally, the Qt API provides multiple ways to implement custom shapes,
that depending on the needs might be enough.</p>
<p>There is the Canvas API using the same API as the <code>canvas</code> API on the web but
in QML. It’s easy to use but very slow and I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
<p>Instead of the Canvas API, from the QML side, there is the
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-shapes-shape.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QtQuick Shapes module</a>.
This module allows creating more complex shapes directly from the QML
with a straightforward declarative API. In many cases, this is good enough
for the application developer but this module doesn’t offer a public C++
API.</p>
<p>If you need more controls, using C++ will be required to implement custom
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickitem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QQuickItem</a>. Unfortunately drawing
on the GPU using QQuickItem is more
complex than the QPainter API. You can’t just use commands like <code>drawRect</code>,
but will need to convert all your shapes in triangles first. This involves
a lot of maths like it can be seen in the example from the
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-scenegraph-customgeometry-example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official documentation</a> or from
<a href="https://www.kdab.com/efficient-custom-shapes-in-qt-quick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the KDAB tutorial (Efficient custom shapes in Qt Quick)</a>.</p>
<p>A QPainer way is also available with <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickpainteditem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QQuickPaintedItem</a>,
but it is slow because it renders your shape in a textured rectangle in the
Scene Graph.</p>
<h2 id="the-rusty-way">The Rusty way</h2>
<p>What if we could transform arbitrary shapes into triangles? We would get a
high level API but still get great performance. This process is called tessellation
and there are a few libraries that implement it. For example in C++, we
have Skia and CGAL. Unfortunatelly, both aren’t easy to use, so I decided to look
at the Rust library ecosystem and in particular at <a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyon</a>,
which was designed with performance and compliance to the SVG standard in mind
since the goal is to use it in Servo in the future.</p>
<p>Lyon doesn’t have any C++ bindings but I got inspired by the recent
<a href="https://jbbgameich.github.io/misc/2020/12/21/rust-in-a-kde-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post from Jonah</a>
and I need to say the experience of writing bindings was a breeze.</p>
<p>The first step was creating wrapper <code>struct</code>s around the
Lyon primitives. <code>LyonPoint</code>, <code>LyonGeometry</code> and <code>LyonBuilder</code> will
later be directly usable from the C++ side.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      SymQEMU: Compilation-based symbolic execution for binaries
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the Network and Distributed System Symposium (NDSS 2021),
    San Diego, CA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software analysis and bug
      detection. Compilation-based symbolic execution is a recently proposed
      flavor that has been shown to improve the performance of symbolic
      execution significantly when source code is available. We demonstrate a
      novel technique to enable compilation-based symbolic execution of binaries
      (i.e., without the need for source code). Our system, SymQEMU, builds on
      top of QEMU, modifying the intermediate representation of the target
      program before translating it to the host architecture. This enables
      SymQEMU to compile symbolic-execution capabilities into binaries and reap
      the associated performance benefits while maintaining architecture
      independence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We present our approach and implementation, and we show that it
      outperforms the state-of-the-art binary symbolic executors S2E and QSYM
      with statistical significance; on some benchmarks, it even achieves better
      performance than the source-based SymCC. Moreover, our tool has found a
      previously unknown vulnerability in the well-tested libarchive library,
      demonstrating its utility in testing real-world software.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is a fast symbolic execution engine for binaries. On this page, we
    provide its source code, the raw results of the experiments described in the
    paper, and instructions how you can replicate those experiments yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symqemu">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe three sets of experiments: we first benchmark
    SymQEMU with Google FuzzBench, then we run it on real-world software, and
    finally we perform a benchmark comparison during concolic execution of fixed
    paths. This section describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides
    links to our results.

      <p>
        FuzzBench (see the <a href="http://s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/2020-05-24-symqemu.zip">report</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        We will share our integration scripts shortly; they're being cleaned up
        to obtain SymQEMU and its dependencies from the new public repository.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Real-world software</p>

      <p>
        For the analysis of real-world software we used the same setup as in the
        <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/symcc.html">evaluation of SymCC</a>. The binaries for SymQEMU,
        QSYM and S2E were plain builds without any instrumentation. SymQEMU was
        run via SymCC's fuzzing helper by prefixing the target command
        with <tt>/path/to/symqemu-x86_64</tt>. For the S2E analysis, we created
        a default project, then enabled the <tt>FunctionModels</tt> plugin and
        activated the option <tt>generateOnStateFork</tt> in
        the <tt>TestCaseGenerator</tt> plugin; coverage was evaluated
        with <tt>afl-showmap</tt> at the end of the analysis, using the same
        AFL-instrumented binaries as with the hybrid fuzzers.

      <p>
        After the analysis of real-world software described above, we randomly
        collected 1,000 generated test cases per open-source target. We ran
        SymQEMU, QSYM and SymCC on each of those inputs, recording the time
        spent in execution and SMT solving, respectively, as per the logging
        output from the QSYM backend.

        <p>Of all the projects I’ve made, I receive the most questions about the <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/ink">Ink programming language</a>. Most questions fall into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did you make a programming language?</li>
<li>I want to make my own programming language – any advice?</li>
<li>Why does Ink work the way it does?</li>
</ol>
<p>This post aims to answer questions (1) and (2) and provide some resources for you to get started on your own language. I think (3) is best left for its own, more technical post.</p>
<p>This post is organized into a few sections.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#why">Why should you?</a></li>
<li><a href="#design">Design</a></li>
<li><a href="#impl">Implementation</a></li>
<li><a href="#other">Other considerations</a></li>
<li><a href="#start">Start small, get creative, ask questions</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-should-you">Why should you?</h2>
<p>Making an interpreter for a new programming language is the most technically rewarding project I’ve worked on. It pushed my understanding of fundamental software concepts and helped me comprehend how a computer works at a deeper level.</p>
<p>Programming languages and compilers / interpreters can be black boxes for programmers starting out. They’re tools taken for granted, and you can write good software without necessarily worrying about how the languages and primitive tools you’re using work under the hood. But writing a programming language involves understanding the most meaty parts of the computing stack, from the CPU and memory up through the operating system, in-memory data structures, processes, threads, the stack, all the way up to libraries and applications. It’s the floodgate to the most interesting mathematics in computing – category theory and type systems, algebras, lots of applications of graph theory, complexity analysis, and more. <strong>Writing and studying programming languages, I found myself getting more familiar with both the mathematics and the mechanical underpinnings of how computers work.</strong></p>
<p>The project made me a better developer as a result, even if my day-to-day work rarely concerns programming language tooling or compiler writing.</p>
<p>A programming language also has lots of room for expansions, optimizations, and extra creativity even after the project’s version one is “finished”. If you design the initial implementation carefully, you can add new keywords, new features, optimizations, and tools to your language and interpreter / compiler incrementally over time. It’s easy to turn a language into a long-term project and creative outlet, and I’ve enjoyed expanding on my initial implementation while studying other languages after my version-one was complete.</p>
<h3 id="the-pl-world-is-broad-and-deep-pick-your-battles">The PL world is broad and deep; pick your battles</h3>
<p>Unlike some other areas of software that follow hype cycles, the programming language field has grown and deepened steadily and constantly for a long time in both academia and industry. There’s a <em>lot</em> of literature, research, prior art, and practical advice in the wild about a million different concepts that can be combined into a new language, and a million different variations on how to implement them.</p>
<p>Especially for a personal-project language, I think the most fruitful approach is to <strong>pick one or two interesting ideas from the archaeology of computing, and build a programming language that examines and expands on those ideas deeply</strong>, rather than try to build the One True Language that’s best at everything and combines the best features of all the languages. Not only is it impossible to make such a language for all use cases, I think that kind of mindset also slows down development, adds unnecessary work, and doesn’t give you the mental space to learn as much about a few interesting topics you might be interested in.</p>
<p>For example, you might be interested in functional programming and immutable data structures. You could try to build a language that’s designed around storing all state in immutable data structures, and study how such data structures can be optimized and manipulated efficiently in a compiler. Or maybe you’re interested in low-level C programming and systems languages, in which case you might try to build a scripting language whose primary goals include elegant interoperability with C APIs and binary interfaces.</p>
<p>Where you start also determines the challenges and tradeoffs you’ll contend with. You might have an easier time writing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> interpreter due to its simpler syntax, because it’s easy to parse compared to, say, a more complex syntax for a language with a static type system. However, Lisps tend to have semantics that are further-removed from the low-level machine code that runs, like closures. So you may trade off the ease of parsing with execution complexity.</p>
<p>Pick your battles carefully, and stick to a few core ideas that you want to study deeply.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Before you write either an interpreter or a compiler, you need to <em>design</em> a language. You can spend time studying category theory and type systems and programming paradigms, but the best thing you can do for yourself at this stage is to study ideas from a wide breadth of programming languages. Don’t just limit yourself to “modern” languages like Rust and Python; reach back into computing history. There’s rich ideas to be reinvented and combined in interesting ways reaching back at least a century into computing and mathematics.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the mental model of popular modern OOP-like languages (Python, Ruby, Swift, C++) and spend the most time in this phase designing <em>syntax</em>. But designing the <em>semantics</em> of the language is where you should spend the most of your time, because it’s where the language gets its “feel” and where you’ll learn the most. Semantics are also more difficult to change after the fact than syntax. Some questions to ask yourself, to start thinking about language semantics and ergonomics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types does your language have? Is it checked at compile-time? Does it automatically convert between types as necessary?</li>
<li>What’s the top-level organizing unit of programs in your language? Languages commonly call this modules, packages, or libraries, but some languages may invent their own concept, like Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/crates.html">Crates</a>.</li>
<li>How does the language deal with exceptional conditions, like a missing file, a network access error, or a divide-by-zero error? Do you treat errors like exceptions that bubble up through the call stack, or are errors treated like values, as in C and Go?</li>
<li>Does your language perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail recursion optimization</a>? Or do you provide native control-flow tools for looping, like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops?</li>
<li>How much utility do you want to build into the language, as opposed to a standard library? C, for example, doesn’t know about strings – string semantics are provided by the C standard library. Maps and lists are fundamental language constructs in most high-languages, and not so in most low-level ones.</li>
<li>How does your language think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management">allocating memory</a>? Is memory automatically allocated as needed? Does the developer need to write code to do so? Is it garbage-collected?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these questions, I think it’s most helpful to just get a taste of a variety of languages in the wild. Here’s a small starter set that I recommend you take a look at, and what ideas I personally found intriguing from each language or language family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lua</strong>: a data structure called <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html">tables</a>, Lua <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/9.1.html">couroutines</a>, using strings as byte slices, interoperability with C</li>
<li><strong>Scheme / Clojure</strong>: Metaprogramming with macros, homoiconicity, closures, control flow with recursion. Die-hard Common-Lispers may disagree, but Scheme and Clojure are the easiest languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> family of languages for me to learn. You should study at least one kind of Lisp.</li>
<li><strong>Go</strong>: structural typing with <a href="https://tour.golang.org/methods/9">interfaces</a>, concurrency with blocking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a></li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: callback-style concurrency and asynchronous programming, first-class functions, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop">event loop</a>, Promises</li>
<li><strong>Awk</strong>: Awk is a great example of a small, simple language optimized for one use case: manipulating text files and textual data. It’s very well designed for that workflow, and a inspiration for how effective a small, domain-specific language with simple semantics can be.</li>
<li><strong>APL</strong> / <strong>J</strong>: APL and J are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming#Array_languages">array languages</a>, which is a fascinating family of languages well known for its brevity</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong>: syntax. Ruby’s well known for its super-flexible syntax, because it lends itself easily to DSLs based on Ruby, like ActiveRecord.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: I like C mostly for its simplicity and minimalism, and an uncompromising commitment to compatibility</li>
<li><strong>Haskell</strong>: the type system and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric polymorphism</a>, variant types, partial application and function type syntax. Once you wrap your mind around it, Haskell is also a good place to start diving deeper into the kinds of elegant programs possible with functional programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Once you have a design for how a language should work and feel, you should first “test-drive” it to see how programs written in the language feel to use.</p>
<h3 id="test-drive">Test-drive</h3>
<p>In this phase, I usually keep a text document where I experiment with syntax by writing small programs in the new as-yet-nonexistent language. I write notes and questions for myself in comments in the code, and try to implement small algorithms and data structures like recursive mathematical functions, sorting algorithms, and small web servers. I usually hold myself to this stage until most of my questions about syntax and semantics are answered. I also use this phase to test my hypotheses about the core ideas behind the language design. If I designed a language around functional programming and asynchronous, event-driven concurrency, for example, I’d write some sample code in this phase to validate that those ideas combine well together, and lends itself to programs that I’d enjoy writing. If I’m proven wrong, I’ll update my assumptions or play around with the language design to reflect what I’ve learned.</p>

<div id="introduction">
<h2><a href="#id8">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Back in 2018, we compared empirically the performance overheads of Go
and C++ with regards to the low-level calling convention: to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">pass
arguments</a>,
to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">return multiple values</a>, and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">when propagating exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>Those results were obtained with Go 1.10 and Clang 6.0. Since then,
compilers have evolved and we are now running with Go 1.15 and Clang
11.0. Have the findings changed since&nbsp;then?</p>
<p>The question of interest&nbsp;was:</p>
<blockquote>
What is cheaper: handling exceptions via <code>panic</code> / <code>recover</code>, or
passing and testing error results with <code>if err := <span>...;</span> err != nil {
return err }</code>?</blockquote>
<p>In fact, as we will see below, the conclusions are stronger today than
they were two years&nbsp;ago.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology">
<h2><a href="#id9">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>The reader is first invited to familiarize themselves with the
discussion of Go’s low-level calling convention as compared with C++’s
in the previous chapters of this series: <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64.html">as of 2018</a> and <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64-2020.html">as of 2020</a>. The 2018
analysis is still largely valid in 2020—the C++ calling convention did
not change, and Go introduced a few optimizations on the
implementation of <code>defer</code>.</p>
<p>There were three analyses&nbsp;previously:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to measure argument passing and returning multiple values, we will
use exactly the same methodology as the previous two analyses <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a> and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>These analyses contain their benchmark source code, which is also
provided at <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2018-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a>. The
derivation of plots was entirely automated via <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>,
which we can thus&nbsp;re-run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>for the <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">third analysis</a>,
which measures and compares the cost of error returns with that of
throwing and catching exceptions, we are going to reuse the same
methodology, but a diffence source code for the benchmark. The new
source code has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2020-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a> as
well. This difference is motivated&nbsp;below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also use an upgraded benchmark system, configured as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>CPU</span>: <span>AMD</span> Ryzen 7 3950X 3700.07MHz Family=0x17 Model=0x71&nbsp;Stepping=0</li>
<li><span>OS</span>: FreeBSD 13.0-<span>CURRENT</span>&nbsp;r366805</li>
<li>go version 1.15.5&nbsp;freebsd/amd64</li>
<li>C++ FreeBSD clang version 11.0.0&nbsp;(llvmorg-11.0.0-0-g176249bd673)</li>
</ul>

<div id="experimental-results">
<h2><a href="#id10">Experimental&nbsp;results</a></h2>
<p>All the generated data files and Jupyter notebooks <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/notebook.zip">can be downloaded
here</a>.</p>
<div id="findings-for-argument-passing-and-returning-multiple-values">
<h3><a href="#id11">Findings for argument passing and returning multiple&nbsp;values</a></h3>
<p>Here the findings are largely unchanged from 2018: for the selected
benchmark code, the code generation by our selected compilers has not
changed&nbsp;significantly.</p>
<p>Only the new hardware <span>CPU</span> influences the measurements: the new <span>CPU</span> has
a higher clock frequency than previously, so for an equivalent
mix of instructions we expect and observe a 10-40% raw performance
improvement. Additionally, the Ryzen 7 3950X architecture has a
somewhat more powerful superscalar execution unit than the 1800X, and
is able to detect inter-instruction dependencies across more memory
accesses. This causes more measurements artifacts when the workload is
extremely small, and erases the performance differences between 1 and
5 function arguments or return&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>The main conclusions thus remain&nbsp;unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go uses memory to pass function arguments and return values. This
makes Go code perform about twice slower than equivalent C++ code on
function calls, where C++ compilers use register-based calling
conventions&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>The particular <span>CPU</span> we used this year uses a micro-architecture able
to more aggressively optimize memory-heavy code, and so the Go
performance overhead relative to C++ is erased for very small
functions; unfortunately, these optimizations become ineffective with
more realistic, wider function&nbsp;bodies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Go, memory is used for return values even when there is just one
or two words worth of data. In these cases, a C++ compiler also
typically uses registers. This choice in the Go compiler is
unfortunate, as it mandates copying the return values through memory
at every call level when functions return each other’s value in a
cascade. This cost thus multiplies the overhead of the memory-based
return by the call depth, in a way that does not occur, or much
less, with a typical C++ code&nbsp;generator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As previously, we can discuss what is the proportion of function
calls relative to other types of code. Arguably, in
computation-heavy algorithms, functions often get inlined so that calls
disappear. In that case, it is possible for the Go compiler,
assisted by the <span>CPU</span> micro-architecture, to reach similar instruction
throughputs as the equivalent C++&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>However, we can also point out that Go still promotes the use of
dynamic dispatch (via interface methods) as an idiomatic approach to
software design. For example, string composition via
<code>bytes.Buffer</code> interfaces with the <code>fmt</code> packages using
interface calls (<code>io.Writer</code>), and the proportion of
cross-interface calls is relatively high in that case compared to
the computation&nbsp;load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reader is invited to review the more detailed summaries from the
previous analyses, where the situation is presented in more&nbsp;detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="measuring-errors-vs-panics-reminder-and-code-tweak">
<h3><a href="#id12">Measuring errors vs panics: reminder and code&nbsp;tweak</a></h3>
<p>This analysis calls for a benchmark which performs a “unit of work” in
a loop, with the size of the loop configurable as&nbsp;“workload”.</p>
<p>We are modeling the extremely common case where any error inside a
unit of work aborts the entire workload: the error may or may not be
generated inside the unit of work, but needs only be detected once for
the entire outer workload&nbsp;loop.</p>
<p>In Go, we originally used the following code as&nbsp;benchmark:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In this code, <code>leafErr</code> represents the “unit of work”, where errors
can originate. The <code>workErr</code> represents the main work computation,
where <code>leafErr</code> is called&nbsp;repeatedly.</p>
<p>(The <code>go:noinline</code> annotation is explained in more detail in the previous&nbsp;analysis.)</p>
<p>In the case where the <code>error</code> return is used, we need to check the
<code>err</code> return on every iteration of the loop. If we used exception
instead, we could factor the exception check out of the&nbsp;loop:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Exception check factored out of the loop:</span>
  <span>defer</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>recover</span><span>();</span> <span>r</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}()</span>
  <span>// Main workload follows:</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>leafExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafExc</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>panic</span><span>(</span><span>errObj</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(The accompanying C++ code is implemented similarly, using
<code><span>std::tuple</span></code> for error returns and <code>try/catch/throw</code> for&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>Just looking at the shape of the source code, we can already suspect
the findings that follow: there is less work inside the workload loop
when using exceptions. So as the workload increases, the cost of
setting up the “catch” logic gets&nbsp;amortized.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is exactly what was observed in 2018. (<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html#summary-and-conclusions">Summary and
conclusions
here.</a>)</p>
<p>However, when running the same experiment in 2020 on our new test
machine, with Go 1.15, the measurements are all over the place, the
results appear chaotic, and the difference we observed last time is
nearly entirely erased. What&nbsp;happened?</p>
<p>It turns out that the new <span>CPU</span> used to run the benchmark really has a
much better micro-architecture. It is able to peek through the call
from the <code>work</code> function to the <code>leaf</code> function, analyze
inter-instruction dependencies across the call, and fully pipeline the
processing of the <code>leaf</code> function across multiple iterations of the
<code>work</code> loop. This effectively invalidates the model we used: in a
realistic application, there is enough complexity in the code inside
the “workload”, when it contains function calls, that the <span>CPU</span> cannot
pipeline loop&nbsp;iterations.</p>
<p>To restore a valid model, we should thus tweak the benchmark program
by adding just enough additional complexity in the “unit of
work”. Here, we achieve that by adding just one extra level of
intermediate&nbsp;call:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>intermediateErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>intermediateErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(Likewise for the benchmark using&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>This program, at least on the <span>CPU</span> considered, is “complex” enough to
stop the superscalar unit from peeking across the function call. The
resulting code then behaves regularly in&nbsp;measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="findings-for-error-returns-vs-exceptions">
<h3><a href="#id13">Findings for error returns vs&nbsp;exceptions</a></h3>
<p>The Jupiter notebook for this experiment contains the data processing steps
and the logic to generate comparison plots, with some detailed analysis
of the intermediate&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>The key result is the&nbsp;following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/err-comparison.png"></p><p>What we see&nbsp;here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For an equivalent workload (e.g. 1000 “units of work”), the Go code
is 40% slower than the equivalent C++ code. This is generally
expected as Go is much more memory-heavy than&nbsp;C++.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regardless of the language considered, the cost of setting up an
exception “catch” can be reliably amortized across an entire
workload: the performance of code using exception-based error
reporting asymptotically converges to become the same as code using
no error handling&nbsp;whatsoever.</p>
<p>In comparison, code that propagates errors as return values is
systematically slower as the workload increases; between 1-3% for
C++, up to 4-10% for&nbsp;Go.</p>
<p>This is one of the two main&nbsp;results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The cost of setting up an exception “catch” is not entirely
negligible. Back in 2018, the mandatory fixed cost of the <code>defer</code>
setup and testing <code>recover()</code> in the <code>work</code> function was 50ns;
such that it took about 500 nanoseconds worth of “workload” to fully
offset this one-time&nbsp;cost.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span># create a oneshot job to authenticate to Tailscale</span>

panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>
    <span>trustedInterfaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"tailscale0"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow the Tailscale UDP port through the firewall</span>
    <span>allowedUDPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>port</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow you to SSH in over the public internet</span>
    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft
options</a>
expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>minecraft-server</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/why-endbasic.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/why-endbasic.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>If you have been following this blog or my social profiles for the last year, you are probably aware that <a href="https://jmmv.dev/tags/endbasic">I have been working on something called EndBASIC</a>. You also probably know that this is a retro-looking BASIC interpreter written in Rust that <a href="https://endbasic.jmmv.dev/">happens to run on the web</a>. And if you know those two things, you are probably wondering, like some of my friends do: why am I <em>wasting</em> time developing such a useless project? <strong>Because.</strong></p>
<p>No, seriously, because. It is obvious that the EndBASIC language and environment will not gain massive traction, and I do not have any interest in inventing a perfect new language (because, let’s face it, we already have one and it’s called Rust 😉).</p>
<p>So, then, why do I spend any of my scarce free time on this project? If you must know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a fun thing to do.</strong> Just like some people enjoy watching TV shows, playing video games, or crafting wood, I enjoy programming. It feels like a game. And EndBASIC <em>itself</em> could be seen as a game at this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a form of art.</strong> Developing a personal project is a different experience than developing a work project. I can spend all the time in the world polishing the same turd over and over again, playing with different ideas until things look best.</p>
<p>If you have ever considered that programming may be art, then this kind of side project is where you crank your craft up a notch. As just one example, working on EndBASIC’s tests made me come up with the idea of <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html">using the builder pattern for tests</a> and it seemed to have been well-received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a learning experience.</strong> In writing EndBASIC, I’m playing with Rust. I strongly believe that Rust is one of the languages of the future and it’s the language that makes me say “aha, I agree” at every corner I turn. Yet, I haven’t mastered it. Working on Rust projects lets me learn a bunch of stuff about the language that will be helpful in future endeavors. And it’s not only about Rust per se: <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html">learning the idioms</a> used in this language can <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-protect-the-data.html">help write better code</a> in any other.</p>
<p>Another example is that I also got to learn about WASM, targeting the browser from a “native” app and making it work on various different devices. This led me down the path of async programming and how to interact with Javascript in that context—which was <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html">a painful but eventually-gratifying obstacle</a> to overcome.</p>
<p>And yet another example is that I also got to set up continuous <em>deployment</em>, first via Travis CI and then via the new GitHub Actions coolness. This, in turn, gave me ammo to write up more <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/github-actions-code-health.html">interesting</a> <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/do-not-submit.html">stuff</a> in this blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copying an “old technology” is irrelevant.</strong> Yes, BASIC is not the language of the future (although… VB.NET users may disagree with you because it supports, I don’t know, thousands of businesses?). But that doesn’t matter. Only 5,000 lines of the codebase (about 30% of the total) are devoted to parsing the language, and most of those lines are unit tests anyway. If I wanted to change the language per se to offer a more “modern” experience with things like first-order functions, objects, etc. it’d be <em>trivial</em> to do so.</p>
<p>To be clear, I have no interest in building my own language as mentioned in the opening, but having worked on the <em>building blocks</em> of a real language is enlightening, and having those building blocks around will surely come in handy in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what happened to the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html">original goal</a> of teaching programming to my kids via this project? Well… uhh… let’s say I’ve gotten distracted having fun by myself rather than actually getting them in front of this. I should get back to that goal after all the recent improvements to make the environment more usable and seeing if they care at all.</p>
<p>But yes. For the most part, EndBASIC is a crazy/useless language. Although… ~50 other people currently disagree with the thought of this being useless if <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/endbasic/">GitHub stars</a> mean anything at all 😉 If you are one of those ~50, thank you! And if you are not, join me in the craze?</p>

			<p>The world is becoming more and more aware of privacy and concerns around it. We are trying to limit sharing our personal information online, but how often are we protecting one of our most private information: <strong>our legal address</strong>?</p>

<h3 id="your-address-is-private">Your address is Private</h3>
<p>Think about it, how often do you share your legal address in the world?</p>

<p>From online shopping, to delivery like food, grocery or selling second hand goods in marketplace… how many entities did you share your address with in the last one year? My bad, one year is too long. How about last one month?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your address information is personally identifiable information (Private Information), and shouldn’t be accessible by entities who don’t really need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.pointaddress.com/assets/images/private-address/private-property.jpg">
<em>Your legal address is Private information.</em>
</center>


<p>From group chats, to online portals; from free signups to lucky draws; from resumes to job applications; from facebook marketplace to craigslist we keep sharing our address with strangers on untrusted platforms.</p>

<p>We consistently hear news about data leaks from poorly coded applications that exposed your address to malicious actors. Many online applications sell your legal address information to third parties for profit, or worse knowingly for the purpose of spam, phishing or hijacking your identity online or in the real world.</p>

<p>Despite this, we never we ask ourselves, why are we sharing the most private information with everyone?</p>

<p>Well, the reason is simple: there hasn’t been a platform until now which allowed users to <strong>“create addresses”</strong>. This is a new concept that most of us never thought of, but subconsciously have always wished it existed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The concept of “creating a personal address” is something most of us have never thought of, but subconsciously wished it existed.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Point addresses are not legal addresses. They are mapping to a Point in the world named by you. You can create as many Point Addresses as you may want instantly.</p>

<p>You can call the location where you want deliveries as <strong>·happy-home-us·</strong> or <strong>·delivery2me-us·</strong> or anything else of your choice, and Point it precisely to the location in the real world with description and photos if you wish to add.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.pointaddress.com/assets/images/private-address/deliver2me.jpg">
<em><b><a href="https://pnt.is/delivery2me-us" target="_blank">·delivery2me-us·</a></b> Point Address I just created</em>
</center>


<p>When you create a Point Address, you have complete control over it. From updating the Point itself such as changing its name, updating Point’s location, to its visibility (Public or Private), you have full control over your Point Address.</p>

<h3 id="private-protected-and-public-points">Private, Protected and Public Points</h3>
<p>With Point, you can mark your addresses one of the three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Private</strong>: The Point Address is only available to you, and nobody else.</li>
  <li><strong>Protected</strong>: Only those people who know the Point Address, either via link, or by name can search for it in Point Search.</li>
  <li><strong>Public</strong>: Points that are Public show on Explore and can be found by anyone looking for Points in that area. Good example of the Public points are to allow Business and Service Providers to share their location with people looking for the services.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="point-is-available-everywhere">Point is available everywhere</h3>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re in US, Japan or India. You can use Point Address anywhere, anytime for anyone.</p>

<p>It is our endeavor to democratize addresses, and give the control of their location to the users themselves.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jack Ma resurfaced for the first time since Chinaâ€™s government began clamping down on his business empire nearly three months ago, appearing in a live-streamed video that sent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.â€™s stock soaring but left plenty of unanswered questions about the billionaireâ€™s fate.</p>

<p>Ma spoke briefly on Wednesday during an annual event he hosts to recognize rural teachers. In one video of the event circulated online, Chinaâ€™s most famous entrepreneur can be seen touring a primary school in his hometown of Hangzhou. Ma, who had stayed out of public view since regulators suspended the initial public offering of his fintech company Ant Group Co., told the teachers heâ€™ll spend more time on philanthropy. He didnâ€™t mention his run-ins with Beijing.</p>

<p>Ant confirmed the authenticity of the video, first posted on an online blog, but declined to comment further. Shares of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant co-founded by Ma that owns about a third of Ant, jumped 8.5 per cent in Hong Kong and were up almost the same level in pre-market U.S. trade.</p>

<p>Speculation about Maâ€™s whereabouts and his standing with President Xi Jinpingâ€™s government had reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, after regulators ordered Ant to overhaul its business and began an antitrust investigation of Alibaba. Beijingâ€™s crackdown followed an October speech by Ma in which he infamously rebuked â€œpawn shopâ€� Chinese lenders, regulators who donâ€™t get the internet, and the â€œold menâ€� of the global banking community.</p>

<p>Maâ€™s comments on Wednesday struck a much different tone, echoing themes espoused by the ruling Communist Party. A former English schoolteacher, he spoke about the importance of reviving Chinaâ€™s countryside and narrowing income disparities by encouraging the return of younger talent to rural areas.</p>

<p>â€œRecently, my colleagues and I have been studying and thinking. We made a firmer resolution to devote ourselves to education philanthropy,â€� Ma said during the event. â€œWorking hard for rural revitalization and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.â€�</p>

<p>While Maâ€™s exact whereabouts remain unclear, his emergence in a public forum may help quell some of the more dire rumors about his fate in a country where media coverage is often tightly choreographed. Among the earliest outlets to report on his video address was an online news outlet backed by the Zhejiang provincial government.</p>

<p>Ma had kept out of public view since regulators in November scuttled Antâ€™s US$35 billion IPO, tightened fintech regulations and launched a separate probe into Alibaba -- all in a span of weeks.</p>

<p>â€œJack Maâ€™s unexpected re-emergence -- just as sudden as his earlier disappearance -- is likely a sign that his relationship with Beijingâ€™s regulatory authorities has stabilized,â€� said Brock Silvers, a managing director at private equity fund Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>But Ma probably isnâ€™t out of the woods, Silvers added. â€œA path acceptable to all parties may have been identified, but Ant Group still looks likely to be dis-aggregated and regulatory restrictions will almost surely take a significant bite out of Antâ€™s former valuation.â€�</p>

<p>Jack Ma addressing teachers via livestream at an annual event Ma hosts to recognize rural educators, Jan. 20.</p>

<p>The clampdown on Maâ€™s empire is part of a broader campaign to rein in a generation of Chinese tech giants that Beijing views as wielding too much control over the worldâ€™s second-largest economy.</p>

<p>The government has increasingly sought to exert influence over the extent to which companies from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to ByteDance Ltd. amass data and direct commerce and media. The same month Antâ€™s IPO was scuttled, the nationâ€™s top antitrust watchdog published new guidelines warning tech giants against monopolistic practices from forced exclusive arrangements to collusion on data. While Ant and Alibaba have borne the brunt of that assault since November, investors have since sold off peers from Tencent to Meituan. Both stocks rallied more than 3 per cent on Wednesday.</p>

<p>While Alibabaâ€™s surge added about US$58 billion to the companyâ€™s market value, Maâ€™s standing with Beijing remains unclear. As of early December, the man most closely identified with the meteoric rise of China Inc. was advised by the government to stay in the country, a person familiar with the matter has said. Debate about his whereabouts arose because Beijing has in the past quietly detained billionaires that have run afoul of the law, without immediate trial.</p>

<p><strong>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</strong></p>

<p>Jack Maâ€™s live-streamed appearance with rural teachers after keeping out of public view for more than two months may boost market sentiment on Alibaba and alleviate worst-case investor concerns. However, the monopoly probe launched in December by Chinaâ€™s State Administration for Market Regulation is yet to be resolved and may continue to weigh on the companyâ€™s future acquisitions and broader business practices.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many discussions around edge computing and its adoption scenarios. One of the key ingredients that could accelerate edge transformation is the ability to use an existing software stack for continuous deployment to the edge. We believe that a new type of hardware that can organically coexist with the cloud ecosystem could be a solution to address the challenge. For example, Turing Pi designed to be an edge computer with cloud-native hardware architecture.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of processing data closer to the source isn’t new. Though, the opportunities that Kubernetes as well as machine learning open to it sound more promising than ever.&nbsp;</p><h4><em>It is doubtful that edge computing is going to replace the cloud. More likely, the edge is going to be an extension. That’s why the synergy of these two paradigms is empirical.&nbsp;</em></h4><p>Cloud computing has spawned many cloud-native solutions. Technologies like containers, serverless, Kubernetes changed the way developers build, deliver, and scale software. What all these technologies have in common is that they designed for distributed computing. The idea behind Turing Pi is a cluster of computers interconnected with Ethernet but all in one compact device. This architecture allows deploying and scaling software to the edge in the same way as in the cloud.&nbsp;</p><h4><em>The concept of a cluster board is similar to a PC motherboard but with an Ethernet network instead of a PCI bus. Rather than using just one processor, the cluster board can combine multiple processors and multiple types of processors. As an example, general-purpose compute modules can work in combination with machine learning modules. This heterogeneous approach could open a wider adaptation of machine learning applications at the edge.&nbsp;</em></h4><p>In other words, Turing Pi is a compact, energy-efficient, out of the box RACK system. These characteristics allow placing clusters in various locations, hard to reach places, and build things like mobile data centers. <a href="https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/edge-computing-at-chick-fil-a-7d67242675e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A striking example of cluster computing</a> adoption is the Chick-Fil-A restaurant chain. The company placed local Kubernetes clusters in more than two thousand restaurants. That helped Chick-Fil-A to build a resilient, highly available, internet-independent system. As a result, the company automated critical business processes and reduced public cloud load by processing data locally. The possibility of using cloud-native technologies at the edge helped Chick-Fil-A to accelerate innovations and get the code running in production as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Turing Pi V1 model is mostly aimed at developers, Devops and researchers. It is an amazing platform for learning and experimentation. The cluster board currently supports Raspberry Pi compute modules, which are intended for industrial applications. Raspberry Pi, by far, is the most popular single-board computer, and its colossal software ecosystem should help to lower entry points for new developers.&nbsp;Bare metal cluster using Raspberry Pis and running on Linux is not only affordable compared to what it can do, but can also be a great tool when dealing with resource-intensive tasks like compiling, continuous data parsing, or learning how to manage a cluster using real hardware instead of virtual machines. Also, it is very useful to have a personal Kubernetes cluster to explore concepts of distributed systems, create proof of concept prototypes, and deploy self-hosted services on-premises or at the edge with almost zero recurring costs.</p><p>Yes, we believe that compact clusters and edge computing is a great fit. Compact clusters could be great building blocks for edge infrastructure. It’s easy to scale within one mini cluster and within the whole fleet of clusters. Different cluster nodes intended for different type of applications, which is a more reliable and efficient way to run services. At the same time container orchestration tools like Kubernetes makes it easy to monitor, maintain and deliver software.</p></div></div>]]>

The company will retain its Canadian headquarters.</p>  <p>"This is the most important day in the history of the company and an incredible milestone," said Allen Lau, one of Wattpad's co-founders, in an interview.</p>  <p>"It is the beginning of a new chapter and using TV show terminology, this is episode one of season two, so I'm absolutely looking forward to this."</p>    <p>Lau and Ivan Yuen, who will continue to lead Wattpad following the sale, started the self-publishing platform after the pair dreamed up the idea on a napkin while waiting for a flight at the Vancouver airport food court in 2006.</p>  <p>Wattpad quickly became home to stories from dozens of genres because it allows anyone to share their writing for free and is accessible on phones and tablets.</p>  <p>It became a household name around 2013 when Anna Todd, a Texas woman, started writing <em>After</em>,&nbsp;a fanfiction series on the platform about One Direction singer Harry Styles.</p>  <p>Her stories were eventually made into books and a film series, which encouraged Wattpad to start book publishing and studio entertainment divisions.</p>  <p>However, Lau admitted a sale wasn't always his plan.</p>  <p>"We weren't actively looking for sellers, but we have been talking to investors along the way …&nbsp;to accelerate our growth," he said.</p>  <p>"We knew Naver for quite some time and we realized after some conversations we have a shared vision."</p>  <h2>Opportunity to grow, get into animation, co-founder says</h2>  <p>Naver, which bills itself as "South Korea's largest web search engine," was an ideal partner because it owns digital comics platform Webtoon, he said.</p>  <p>Webtoon is behind some of the biggest names in webcomics, including <em>Lore Olympus</em>,&nbsp;and has worked with the Jim Henson Company and producers behind hit films like <em>The Lego Movie</em>, the <em>It&nbsp;</em>franchise and <em>Snowpiercer</em>.</p>  <p>Lau said Naver will offer Wattpad a chance to get into animation and to grow beyond the 90 million users — including more than five million writers — that Wattpad has. Webtoon said it has more than 72 million monthly active users.</p>  <p>"Wattpad's vision to entertain and connect the world through stories fits perfectly with our vision for Webtoon and Naver's content brand and we're thrilled to have them join the Naver family," Seong-sook Han, chief executive, said in a statement.</p>    <p>The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of Wattpad's fiscal year and is subject to regulatory approvals.</p>  <p>It is the latest in a string of sales that have seen once-promising Canadian tech companies snatched up by foreign owners during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>Element AI, a Montreal-based firm that creates artificial intelligence solutions for large organizations, signed a deal in November to be purchased by ServiceNow, a Santa Clara, Calif., company that offers a cloud-based workflow technology.</p>  <p>San Francisco-based "buy now, pay later" company Affirm reached a deal to buy Toronto rival PayBright for $340 million in early December.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post started as a few simple sentences for my brother; tips on how to lose fat and manage blood sugar better. I decided to write them down as a reminder to myself, or anyone, especially those in middle age, as I’m starting the year with a health drive.</p>

<p>The golden triad is simple: <em>optimise your sleep, diet and activeness.</em></p>

<p>Consider this as 10 years of research simplified into a blog post. If knowledge was the answer we’d all be millionaires with six pack abs – lifestyle change is the only way.</p>

<p>Setting up for success: I recommend a few links throughout this, before reading I’d start with: <a href="https://youtu.be/qHUFgFYdJck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behaviour/Environment Design</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Your diet is not only what you eat.</p>

  <p>It is what you watch, what you listen to, what you read, the people you hang around.</p>

  <p>Be mindful of the things you put into your body emotionally, spiritually and physically.”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This one is fairly obvious, simply put, sleep restores body and mind, so try to improve your quality of sleep.</p>

<p>Also, sometimes we think we’re hungry when were really tired.</p>

<p>The book: Why We Sleep by Mathew Walker  <br>
The hack:  Try and sleep 8 hours every night, ideally at the same time, even on weekends. Don’t drink caffeine after midday. Avoid alcohol? <a href="https://youtu.be/EOaSWPROOxw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Five tips</a></p>


<p>I’ve always had success shedding a few pounds following the Slow Carb Diet; evolved or created by Tim Ferriss in The Four Hour Body. This is my go-to approach, as a bonus I also truly feel it’s <em>anti-inflammatory</em> effects.</p>

<p><em>I like it because at it’s core it’s about simplicity, no white food (bread/rice/pasta), no processed food (i.e. no sugar), so it really encourages you to eat home cooked <strong>whole foods</strong>.</em></p>

<p>There is a tonne of information online about what is involved:</p>

<p>A detailed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bb1EWGiOuNjnUCDYHzih0NlBRwYzpf6fqaHkFMDJg3k/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">real-user intro</a> or a <a href="http://www.williamhertling.com/2011/02/4-hour-body-fat-loss-cheat-sheet_27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheat sheet</a> or an <a href="http://www.fitnessinfographics.com/diets-4-hour-body-slow-carb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">infograhic</a>.</p>

<p>I also believe in the health benefits of Time Restricted Feeding; due to a book called The Circadian Code, here’s an excellent intro/overview by the author: <a href="https://youtu.be/t0NI0jELuF4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Satchin Panda - Daily Rythms</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Lifestyle is what, WHEN and how much we Eat, Sleep, and Move on a daily basis.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My preference is to exercise/workout, or go for a walk, in the morning, before eating. I will drink water or black coffee, then tend to start eating around midday, I try not to eat at night (after 9:30). Meaning a 9-10 hour feeding window, giving my digestion a break. If an option, I would also swim and sauna in the evening.</p>

<p>I think calorie density/food satiety (feeling full) can play there parts (for example, eating enough so as not to snack, or starting meals with soups or veggies/salads): <a href="https://youtu.be/0CdwWliv7Hg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calorie Density: How To Eat More, Weigh Less and Live Longer</a></p>

<p>The hack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>whenever you break fast, start with a slow carb/high protein meal.</li>
  <li>Hydrate (2 litres water per day), don’t drink calories and have a day off (cheat day).</li>
  <li>Take pictures on your phone of everything you put in your mouth (for a week).</li>
  <li>Or log everything in myfitnesspal. (what gets measured gets managed).</li>
</ul>


<p>A complex and debatable topic, as there are many variables; types of exercise, what we can sustain/enjoy, our age, our ability to recover, etc.</p>

<p><em>For this goal, the idea is simple, do activities that keep our metabolism in fat burning mode</em>.</p>

<p>I believe we’re burning fat when in a calorie deficit (consuming less calories than we use). Muscle is denser/heavier than fat, building muscle means we use more calories to move, which means burning fat (our goal). Also, as we age we suffer from muscle atrophy (loss), so if we don’t build new muscle, we’re getting slowly weaker. “Use it or lose it, baby!”</p>

<p>As the saying goes, you can’t outrun a bad diet. Whilst running/swimming/cycling/yoga/pilates are great exercise for our health/heart/cardio, it isn’t the optimum way to burn fat, as they don’t build as much muscle.</p>

<p>Lifting weights, which also stimulates the heart and builds muscle, includes lifting our own bodyweight, so we can start with simple push-up/pull-ups, air squats, then perhaps progress to kettlebells/dumbbells. High Intensity Interval Training is an excellent way to kickstart the metabolism and continue fat burning for a few hours (some call it the afterburn effect), but this is probably true of many exercises.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a quick/light HIIT circuit/session using weights (time-lapse, 45 sec each exercise, 15 sec rest, x3 rounds): <a href="https://youtu.be/jdV_td3OJg4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIIT session</a></p>

<p>Also, walking is an excellent recovery tool, great to keep the fire going and burn calories…</p>

<p>Ideally, in time, we would combine compound strength training (e.g. squats/deadlifts, to stop muscle atrophy) with some weighted HIIT classes (2-3 x per week), then some other general recovery exercises throughout the week (like walking/swimming).</p>

<p>N.B. An important point to remember is to fuel our body correctly, to optimise the benefits of whatever type of training protocol we follow. I try to balance this a slow carb (25%), medium fat(40%), high protein(35%), if possible.</p>

<p>The hack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>do as many wall push-ups, pull-ups (start on a chair), air squats, just before and 90 mins after meals, as you can (consider <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?&amp;q=negative+pull+ups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressions</a>)</li>
  <li>Replace car journeys with walking or cycling (great for the bank balance too)</li>
</ul>


<p>Putting on fat doesn’t happen overnight, neither does fat loss, or composition changes. Consistency over the long term is the key.  If you crack and have a tasty treat, or a day off exercise, make sure to enjoy it and start over the next day. James Clear has an excellent mindset/approach “I try to never miss two in a row”.</p>

<p>It’s not all about what you put in your mouth, keep active, and sleep well. Remember, losing anything from 1-2 pounds of fat per week really is winning.</p>

<p>The book(s): The Slight Edge/Atomic Habits  <br>
The hack: Simple, small and satisfying daily positive choices that move you in the right direction. Picture yourself winning, try to track how often you are choosing to take that action/behaviour, and enjoy all the small wins.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein is reputed to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>And I’m still a fat b*st*rd</em>…</p>
