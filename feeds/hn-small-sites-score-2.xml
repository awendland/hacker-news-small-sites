<p>I decided that I was spending too much time writing instructions in random Google docs, vi’ed files, and GitHub repos. I wanted to have a single location that I could use as a way to publicly document all the things that I tinker with:</p>



<ul><li>Kubernetes</li><li>Docker (who doesn’t?)</li><li>Splunk</li><li>Raspberry Pi</li><li>Random tech integrations (this list could go on forever)</li></ul>



<p>With all of that, I felt that it was time to put it all into a blog. As I travel through life building these random things, I intend to document them here and link to any files, repos, or websites that I have created myself or used along the way.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>How often do you check your phone? Every 30 minutes? Every 5 minutes? Every 30 seconds?</p><p>Smartphones can be incredibly addictive. Tap, tap, tap and you’re playing a game, tap tap and you’re replying to a friend.&nbsp;<em>Ping!</em>&nbsp;and woooooh, someone liked your photo!</p><p>And so it goes, minutes pass. Then hours. And then you look up, and you still haven’t studied for the exam or worked on that proposal. Time has passed and you have nothing to show for it.</p><p>We know this problem well. We’ve faced it and overcome it. Here are some practical suggestions that helped us cut down from an average of hours on the phone to about 30 minutes.</p><p>Let’s start with the most obvious.</p><h2>Step #1: Turn notifications off</h2><p>Notifications are fun. Did someone message me? How many people liked my post? Who mentioned me?...</p><p>Social media and other apps that rely on notifications want to draw us in. They feed on our insecurity and want us to return to their product and tap away. That’s the purpose of notifications.</p><p><strong>Turn them off.</strong></p><p>We used to have them on too. Those likes sure felt nice. Seeing them come in, one by one. But you know what didn’t feel nice? Lack of focus. Inability to work. Feeling bad at the end of the day, knowing you didn’t do your best.</p><p><strong>We recommend that you turn off all notifications with the possible exception of direct messages from friends (if you don’t get too many of those).</strong></p><h2>Step #2: Delete unnecessary apps</h2><p>You probably don’t need Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or YouTube on your phone. Seriously.</p><p>They make it too easy to waste your own time.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/remove_apps.png" alt="Remove unnecessary apps" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>I (co-founder Vita) used to have all of those apps on my phone. Every time I was bored, I reached for my phone and tap, Twitter, scroll and scroll and scroll…</p><p>It’s too easy. Too easy to waste hours every day, tens of hours every week, hundreds of hours every month. For what? Internet points?</p><p>Those hours could be better spent writing your thesis, working on your presentation, or building your business. Since I deleted the most distracting apps from my phone, I’ve used my time better and have been much happier with myself.</p><p>You can always check Twitter or Facebook on your computer, where you can better control the environment - use a site-blocker like ours to limit how much time you can waste.</p><p>With the possible exception of Instagram and Snapchat, you can get everything you need from the website version of the product, if you need to.</p><p>Remove games from your phone too. They eat up time faster than a sped-up Pacman and only leave you with guilt at the end of the day. They’re too much fun. You might install them thinking “I’ll play for 5-15 minutes at the end of the day,” but before you know it, you’re playing an addictive game at 10AM instead of doing what you need to do.</p><p><strong>Remove the most time-sucking apps from your phone.</strong></p><h2>Step #3: Make your phone less visually appealing</h2><p>We’re visual creatures. If you reach for your phone, unlock it, and see a familiar icon with a red dot in the corner, you’re going to tap it. It’s one of the easiest and worst habits to get into.</p><p>So, here are 3 tips to make your phone screen less enticing.</p><ul><li><p><strong>No non-productive apps on your first screen.</strong><br>Put every app that has the potential to distract you on your second screen. No social media, no video apps, no messaging apps. If you have them on the first screen you see, you will tap them and destroy your productivity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Group distracting apps in folders.</strong><br>You can also make distracting apps less appealing by putting them into folders. E.g. Messenger, Slack, and email into&nbsp;<em>Communication.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Grayscale your phone.</strong><br>Ever notice that games are super colorful and bright? It’s that way for a simple reason - we biologically wired to like bright and rich colors. It’s fun to look at and fun to interact with colorful and animated screens.</p><p>So, make it less fun by turning everything gray.&nbsp;For iPhones go to&nbsp;<em>Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display Accommodations &gt; Color Filters</em>&nbsp;and then tap on Grayscale.</p><p>For Android phones, google “How to enable grayscale mode on android” - the process is more complicated.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Make your phone less visually appealing and you’ll be less tempted to use it too often.</strong></p><p>That’s it for once-and-done steps, now time for habits.</p><h2>Habit #1: Use the Rule of 3 senses - keep your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing</h2><h3>Sight: Keep your phone out of sight</h3><p>Imagine your desk looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/table_phone.png" alt="Phone on the table is a distraction" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>Normal, no?</p><p>There’s a catch. Our brain sees this:</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/table_phone_brain_bg.png" alt="Our brain is wired to notice a phone on your desk" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>If you have your phone in your field of vision, it’s a constant reminder that you could be doing something fun (dopamine!) instead of doing something that feels like work (but is productive).</p><p><strong>When you want to work, hide your phone from sight.</strong></p><h3>Touch: Have your phone out of reach</h3><p>Even if you don’t see your phone, if you have it within easy reach, it’s easy to succumb. All you need to do is extend your hand and an hour is gone and you still haven’t done anything productive.</p><p>Put your phone out of your reach. Ideally, have it in a different room entirely.</p><p>If you’re not home or at work, you can put it in your backpack or purse and put it out of easy reach.</p><p>You can assign your phone a dedicated spot. A spot in your bookshelf, a cupboard, or a drawer. Anywhere far away from where you want to work is good.</p><p><strong>Have your phone out of reach.</strong></p><h3>Hearing: Put your phone on silent (Do Not Disturb on)</h3><p>A funny video, a question about your weekend, a photo from a trip… they aren’t that urgent. You’re much better off not seeing those notifications and definitely not hearing a loud&nbsp;<em>ping!</em>&nbsp;when you’re just starting to get focused.</p><p>You can check all the notifications and replies once you got a solid piece of your work done or wrote a page of a paper you have due.</p><p>You don’t need to see every like or post as they happen. That might make engineers at Twitter or Facebook happy, but definitely not you in the long-term.</p><p>You can check everything when you take a 5 min break&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;doing something productive.</p><p><strong>When you want to focus and be productive, put your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing (on silent).</strong></p><h2>Habit #2: No phone first thing in the morning</h2><p>If you use your phone as your alarm clock, you might want to consider buying an analog one.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Here’s frequent scenario for many:</p><p><em>Dingdingdingding!!!!</em><br><em>rolls over, grabs phone and presses Stop</em><br><em>Oh, look at these messages. And an email from a co-worker. And someone mentioned me in their Insta story….</em><br><em>an hour passes</em></p><p>This is hardly a good, positive, or active way to start the day.</p><p>Almost any kind of morning routine is better than getting snared in a time-sucking black hole of checking&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p><p><strong>Solution: buy an analog alarm clock.</strong></p><p>They don’t have notifications. You can then leave your phone in a different room.</p><p><strong>Alternative solution: put your phone in airplane mode when sleeping.</strong></p><p>This way, you wake up without a full screen of things to respond to.</p><h2>Habit #3: Embrace boredom (instead of checking the phone)</h2><p><em>Waiting in a line? Check phone.</em></p><p><em>Friend went to the bathroom? Check phone.</em></p><p><em>Want to focus? Check phone.</em></p><p>Wait, scratch the last one!</p><p>Every time you check your phone, you reinforce the habit. Since it’s often within reach, in your pocket or on the table, it’s easy to do again and again, looking for a bit of something&nbsp;<em>new.</em></p><p>This habit can quickly get out of control. You start opening the same apps, over and over again, even though there’s nothing new there. It becomes a behavior tic to escape any kind of boredom.</p><p>But boredom isn’t bad. In fact, it can be helpful. When you’re bored, your mind starts to wonder. Vast networks of neurons activate in your brain and that often leads to interesting insights and ideas. Those ideas can lead you to naturally make progress with whatever you were procrastinating on.</p><p>Many people become de facto zombies, only looking for&nbsp;<em>NEW!!!</em>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<em>brainzzz</em>.</p><p><strong>Embrace boredom. Let your mind wander.</strong></p><h2>Pick a step or a habit to apply to your life</h2><p><strong>3 steps to being less distracted by your phone:</strong></p><ul><li>Turn off notifications</li><li>Delete unnecessary apps (and games)</li><li>Make your phone less appealing</li><ul><li>Remove distracting apps from your first screen</li><li>Put distracting apps into folders</li><li>Grayscale your phone</li></ul></ul><p><strong>3 habits to become more focused:</strong></p><ul><li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Rule of 3 Senses</strong>:&nbsp;keep your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing</li><li>Use an analog alarm clock or put your phone into airplane mode.</li><li>Embrace boredom.</li></ul><p>If you do these things, you will start spending less and less time on your phone and become more and more productive.&nbsp;<em>If</em>&nbsp;you do them.</p><p><strong>Take action today. Pick 1 app to remove from your phone, turn off notifications for Instagram or Twitter, or buy an analog alarm clock. Reclaim your attention.</strong></p></article></div>]]>

<p>Photo taken on July 17, 2020 shows an office of online marketplace Pinduoduo in east China's Shanghai. Photo: Xinhua</p><p>A 22-year-old employee who worked at Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo died suddenly after finishing work late at night and fainting on the way home. The news has caused a strong response on the internet. The exact cause of her sudden death requires authoritative medical conclusions, but public resistance and condemnation of excessive overtime has become the mainstream attitude on the internet.</p><p>Hopefully, all companies and institutions will attach great importance to this attitude of the public, take necessary measures to protect the employees' legitimate rights and interests and do not regard employees' excessive overtime as the basis of the companies' achievement. The Labour Law should also be more strictly enforced.</p><p>The excessive overtime of internet company employees is well known. Two years ago, there was a condemnation of the "996" culture - working from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm six days a week - but the problem has not really been alleviated because of the fierce competition among internet companies. People's competition in jobs is also fierce. The two kinds of competition have seriously squeezed the room for workers to defend their rights of not working overtime. Many public discussions have shifted to the so-called principle of fairness that employees who work overtime must be properly paid.</p><p>Objectively speaking, frequent overtime is not just a matter for internet companies. There are many other such industries in China. It is also very common for policemen to work overtime, as well as some other civil servants. They usually have no overtime pay, or only a very small amount of overtime pay. Some local and department leaders take this for granted and some managers even proudly tell others how their departments work seven days a week or work from day to night.&nbsp;</p><p>In Chinese society, there is a traditional value that regards working overtime as an honor. Many descriptions of good people will include the content of how he or she works overtime for a long time, or works late at night. From government departments to enterprises, leaders and managers often appreciate employees who take the initiative to work overtime. Such value is deeply rooted in Chinese society.</p><p>When China was backward and shaking off poverty was the No.1 task, the abovementioned values were naturally formed. But when a huge middle class has been formed in urban China, the choice is subtly changing. People are putting more emphasis on their right to time off. There is heavy criticism online against the "996" working model, which is a clear sign of such a change.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, people have diversified pursuits. There are still people willing to improve their lives by working exhaustively. But such a working style as a collective value has been shaken. More and more young people wish to strike a balance between working hard and playing hard. They want to keep moving ahead, but also take it easy.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a broad trend. The more China grows further, achieving higher GDP per capita, such a value choice will attract more people. In addition, international society is scrutinizing China on labor protection, which is a term often mentioned when China conducts deep economic cooperation with foreign countries. Chinese society needs to adjust the concept of working overtime.</p><p>China's economic and social development cannot rely too much on people's long-time work as a driving force. We should improve labor efficiency and reduce formalism and useless work. People hope for more rest hours, and from this we need to find positive elements that promote development. We should try our best to unify development and the protection of people's rights.</p><p>Chinese people who often travel abroad will find that in a developed society, it is very difficult to hire drivers and translators who are willing to work overtime, not even if they're paid more. This cannot be simply regarded as "lazy."</p><p>Our economic and social development needs to be explored toward the gradually reduced cost of all citizens. Of course, this cannot be achieved overnight. After all, China is still not a rich country, and the low-income group is still large. Overtime work in some positions is inevitable. The spirit of enduring hardship cannot be absent in our society. In particular, we must not give up the encouragement of dedication. In some key sectors, it is very important to let such spirit continue to flourish. We need to constantly adjust to the progress of society and achieve a new balance.</p><p>Chinese society needs to rethink the internet sentiment opposing the "996" work model and the strong reaction to the Pinduoduo employee's sudden death. We should let such thinking rationally penetrate into the rhythm of social progress.</p><p><em>The author is a commentator with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn</em></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="45d72c63-4641-3f9f-f271-8df897413c12"><p>Today the consumer market is moving towards Omni-channel experience, and the developer and UX designers need to focus more on web and mobile-friendly user experience than ever before. The developer and designer work more closely to provide a better user experience for the website or app they develop. Technical errors on the software are the critical reason for the app deletion.&nbsp;</p><p>Over 90% of the downloaded apps are erased after one use due to poor user experience. Similarly, according to expert's studies, 80% of users never return to a low user experience website. This is why UX design is a crucial factor in software or application development. The user expects extraordinary experience on apps, websites they use every day. They never provide 2nd change on the software. In this article, let's look in detail at why developers want to learn UI/UX design.</p><p>‍</p><p>The 15 reasons I've highlighted here for you:</p><p>‍</p><ol role="list"><li>Interface vs. Experience</li><li>How User Experience Shapes Software Development</li><li>Excellent Ux Design Encourages to Develop of a More User-Centric Product</li><li>Make the Product More Popular With Ux Design.&nbsp;</li><li>Reduce Flaws and Development Cost</li><li>Ux Plays a Vital Role in Software Architecture</li><li>Limited Resource</li><li>Designing in the Browser</li><li>Front End Development &amp; Ux Design</li><li>&nbsp;Ux Can Make You a Better Developer</li><li>Gets Higher Return on Investment (ROI)</li><li>&nbsp;Learn Skills That Complement Your Existing Talents</li><li>Gain Skills That Can’t Be Automated</li><li>Execute Your Code Towards the User Experience</li><li>User Empathy Will Help You Stand Out in the Business Market</li></ol><h2>1. Interface vs. Experience</h2><p>Before we get down to detail, let's understand the difference between the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>User Interface is anything that the user interacts with the website or app. In another term, UI is the point where the user interacts with the digital product or service. They come in three categories Graphical user interfaces( GUIs), Voice-controlled interface (VUIs), and Gesture-based interfaces.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Graphical user interfaces:</strong> Users interact with electronic devices through graphic icons. The best example is the computer's desktop.</p><p><strong>Voice-controlled interface: </strong>Users interact with the application through their voices. E.g., Siri, Alexa, etc.</p><p><strong>Gesture-based interface: </strong>Users engage with 3D design spaces through real movements, e.g., Virtual reality (VR) games.</p><p>In contrast, User Experience is the complete look and feel of the website or application. UX is the final impression of the user about the product or service.</p><h2>2. How User Experience Shapes Software Development</h2><p>UX and UI design are essential for any application development. Five significant reasons show you need to focus more on the design during product development. Research says that the product's experience influences 97% of customer decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Usability</strong></p><p>When software or application works great but is not user-friendly, people will not prefer to use it. The software has to attract and retain the user. User interface and experience are upfront on the development.</p><p><strong>2. Lower development costs</strong></p><p>Identifying the roadblocks and issues in the client experience before development with save you time on modifying code.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3</strong>. <strong>Faster development time</strong></p><p>Great UX and UI configuration save time in the development cycle.</p><p><strong>4. Increase revenue</strong></p><p>People prefer to download or ready to pay for the application that suits their needs and easy to use. If you develop a product with useful UI and UX will increase the app's purchase or downloading.</p><p><strong>5. Better Client retention</strong></p><p>User-friendly apps will keep people returning. The application will become an integral part of their everyday life. If developing a poor UX will leave a lasting impression. The developer has to identify the design problems before deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Excellent Ux Design Encourages to Develop of a More User-Centric Product</h2><p>UX design offers insights about what your users want from the product that you are developing. It is the core point for product design. User research and usability testing at each step of the development prove how the user-friendly product evolved.</p><div><p>Before product development, conduct user research and speak with the end-users and understand their needs. The study will help to develop the best user experience application or software.</p><p>In the end the builders (in this case developers) need to have an understanding of the outcome of what they’re building.</p></div><h2>4. Make the Product More Popular With Ux Design.&nbsp;</h2><p>According to statistics, nearly 67% of consumers are more likely to purchase the product if they are happy with their user experience.</p><p>Creating a straightforward user journey or planning the best end-user experience makes client retention and retains the existing customers. This boost in product purchase.</p><p><a href="https://bugreporting.co/">BugReporting</a> is a user feedback tool for websites and apps. It allows users to record full-length video feedback. The application also captures the data to replicate any errors that users face. A BugReporting software is an automatic tool that helps developers and designers view the exact bugs that are user-facing on the UI/UX.</p><h2>5. Reduce Flaws and Development Cost</h2><p>When you combine user's demands in your application's development process, it will considerably decrease UX problems in the later stage of the product journey.</p><p>A basic understanding of UX design will help understand which will not work for the user before product development. Mockups and prototypes will reduce user-related bugs' chances, and it will minimize the development cycle time. The developers can make a clear decision on software development with prototyping.</p><h2>6. Ux Plays a Vital Role in Software Architecture</h2><p>High performance and software stability can only be achieved by the developers. These two are the unsung heroes of user experience design.</p><p>For example, Website visitors will leave the page if they face low page loading. Unnecessary redirects, server delays, heavy images, heavy CSS, HTML, JavaScript files, fancy animated effects or page widgets, etc., may cause inadequate loading speed. The developer needs to fix these defects to improve the user experience. Suppose there is a lag in site loading due to server delay. In that case, the coder needs to find suitable hosting for their website. In this way, the developer will enhance the user experience, product accessibility, and usability.</p><h2>7. Limited Resource</h2><p>In many startups or small businesses, there won't be any dedicated resource for design. Developers out there want to tackle projects entirely on their own, who can't afford to hire a designer (or require to spend the money elsewhere). They will be able to learn to design for their products until they identify the valuable resource.</p><p>Another main reason developers need to learn design is to work more effectively with designers. If the developer understands the basic design, it will help create stunning UI and create a better user experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Learning about design improves the relationship between designer and developer. The developer can easily understand the user interface correction that is provided by the designer. Learning makes the developer view the design on the designer's view for the application development.&nbsp;</p><h2>8. Designing in the Browser</h2><p>Many designers hesitate to perform designing on the browser because they need to know the necessary CSS and HTML programming or codes to create on the browser. That is the specific reason behind why it's an excellent fit for engineers getting into designing.</p><p>There are many tools and browser plugins available today, which assist you in designing the browser. Which makes the developer and designer's life easy. Here are some useful tools for coder and UI/UX designers includes Sketch, Axure, InVision Studio, Craft, Proto.io, Adobe XD, Webflow, Figma, and more&nbsp;</p><h2>9. Front End Development &amp; Ux Design</h2><p>Not all designers need to know to write coding in contrast to the front-end developer, which doesn't mean it is necessary to know UX. But both the UX design and Front end development work more excellently together. If a front-end developer has both, the knowledge will help in creating significant and usable applications. Learning will bridge the gap between the designer and developer and can complete the quality-assured application.</p><h2>10.&nbsp;Ux Can Make You a Better Developer</h2><p>The demand for programming engineers is developing by 22% consistently until 2029. Among all the developers with a special in user experiences are ahead of the job compilation. Users are the priority of any app or web app development, so many recruits look for candidates who have sound knowledge of software development, and UX design is considered more. As a developer, expand your career horizons by continuous learning. A basic understanding of UX design will increase the chance of landing your dream job.</p><h2>11.

</a>

by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/index.html">Luke Smith</a>

<p>
<i>A parable on the Logical Postivist "interpretation" of scientific models.
<!-- Granted, I use the term "logical positivist" in a somewhat expanded but specific sense, -->
<!-- loosely the idea that "science is good models" or what was called in the past "instrumentalism." -->
</i>
</p>

<h2>The Parable</h2>

<p>
Suppose an alien race comes to Earth and wants to observe our games.
They are very interested in chess, despite the fact that they have eyes with properties that make it impossible to make out what actually happens on a chess board.
(The whites and blacks and squares all blur together.)
</p>

<p>
They can still learn about chess experimentally, they know they can sit two players (a so-called "white" and "black" player) down to play it, and they can tell behaviorally who at the end wins.
</p>

<p>
After extensive experimentation, they realize this: 50% of the time, the white player wins and 50% of the time, the black player wins (we'll ignore draws and any first-move advantage for the example).
</p>

<h3>The "best" model</h3>

<p>
A logical positivist alien thus creates the ultimate, long-term model of chess as an iterated game:
Chess amounts to just a drawn-out coin flip.
Half of the time white wins, half of the time black wins, just as if they were tossing a quarter.
</p>

<p>
The aliens then decide to model chess as a coin flip, as a 50-50 game with no underlying principles.
While this statistical technique might not be useful for predicting a single game, over the long run and over iterated games, <em>it is the most efficient and parsimonious possible model</em>.
</p>

<h3>"Inferior" models</h3>

<p>
Suppose, however that a "crank" scientist of the alien race posits that "God doesn't play dice" and that chess is a more complicated game, despite the fact that the aliens cannot observe it.
Suppose even he asks around and determines from humans that there are actually pieces on the board with functions, and he even devises a machine that allows his alien eyes to see the first move of the game of chess.
</p>

<p>
Seeing this move allows him to create a new theory and model of the game,
one that takes into account the first move made and he tries to generate a new set of probabilities of victory based on that move.
The model he makes, is of course highly arbitrary, stipulated and <em>ad hoc</em>.
In fact,
this model is inferior on many inevitable accounts.
For example:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>It is less predictive over iterated games than the coin flip model.</li>
    <li>It is not as parsimonious/minimal as the coin flip model.</li>
    <li>It adds new variables to the theory (pieces) that are suspect.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Which model is "right?"</h2>

<h3>Which model is closer to truth?</h3>

<p>
Since we, unlike the aliens, are not prevented by defect from observing chess, we know that the second, "inferior" theory of chess is truer.
Its theoretical categories, if apparently arbitrary in the eyes of the aliens, are getting at the actual underlying mechanics of chess.
Even if the model is less effective, it is certainly <em>righter</em>.
</p>

<h3>Which will cause fruitful scientific inquiry?</h3>

<p>
The coin flip model is a scientific dead-end.
Firstly, the coin flip model is constructed statistically, which presents the underlying mechanism to be randomness, and thus unworth of inquiry.
This isn't statistics hoisted above random variation we know to exist, instead, it's utterly blind statistics that covers over whatever principles underlie it.
</p>

<p>
Secondly and more importantly, in order to actually improve that model, it has to <em>lose</em> empirical solvency:
embracing the abstractions of pieces means introducing mess and
deviating in some way from the empircal generalization that half of all chess games are won by white and half by black.
</p>

<h3>This is not an abnormal circumstance.</h3>

<p>
The parable here, really an <em>example</em> is not abnormal.
In most affairs in science, whether that be physics or neuroscience or economics or chemistry, we are exactly like the partially-blind aliens.
</p>

<h3>"But science isn't about truth!"</h3>

<p>
Yeah, it is dude.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are pretending that science is about "models" or fitting equations and the like, again, the well-fit model is impossible to perfect, while the flawed, yet more true to reality model does have a potential over the long-term to be a superior one.
After exhaustive inquiry, an alien race might not only discover the pieces and the full set of rules behind chess, they might be able to predict what moves are good or bad and predict individual chess games.
Even on the standards of mere instrumentalism, the mindless positivistic theory is still actually inferior.
</p>

<h2>Local maxima</h2>

<img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/pix/maximum.gif" alt="Local maximum">

<h3>The plot</h3>

<p>
One of the ways I visualize science and models is that each model is really like an n-dimensional optimization plot.
"Truth," or if you deny truth as metaphysics, "accuracy in data" or "well-fit equations" are upwards and the goal of science is to get further that way.
</p>

<p>
At the point you're at, you can tell which direction you can go to move upward, or, which little changes you can make to improve your model.
That is what incremental science is, after all: don't change assumptions and just fine-tune your equations.
The endless fine-tuning is sometimes thought of as "progress."
Of course I don't think that this is <em>bad</em>, but it is a very minor and scientifically less important part of science as a whole.
</p>

<p>
The reality of incremental science is that once you're at a local maximum, once you've fine-tuned your equations about as perfectly as possible,
it's over.
Everything next to you <em>looks</em> like a disimprovement.
It <em>looks</em> just like those inferior theories of alien chess that posit the existence of pieces.
From that, you might erroneously conclude that you have found the <em>global</em> maximum, which
due to the nature of the complexity of the universe and the multiplicity of
possible answers and theories, you flatly haven't.
</p>

<p>
Logical positivism is kind of theoretical lobotomy that implicitly tells scientists that they should never, ever, ever change foundational assumptions:
tweaking equations like an oblivious autist is Science®️ and everything else is "philosophy" or "metaphysics" or "pseudoscience."
This amounts to keeping each scientific field on whatever local maximum is closest, utterly unable to extricate themselves from it even when they see on the horizon abberant data.
<strong>If you want to understand the stagnation of science or any other specific field, this is where it comes from.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Purposefully "bad" science</h3>

<p>
In <i><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/notrelated/S02E01_-_Against_Method_and_For_Pseudoscience.ogg">Against Method</a></i>, Paul Feyerabend, in what an unreflective mind might misinterpret as a "troll," says that it is important for science that people have biases, financial interests, interfering religious and political doctrines and the like in science.
Looking at the plot, you might now see why.
When we are stuck on a local maximum, every new data keeps our already-optimized model where it is no matter how low that maximum actually is.
What you need to shake it up is an external shock that totally moves our theoretical position somewhere new on the plot where we can try to optimize at another point, and then compare.
</p>

<h3>Basic assumptions</h3>

<p>
A prudent person should be able to question, "Am I even on the right track or am I playing with some model that has a fundamental flaw?"
I can guarantee you, optimizing for data and fitting math and equations is easy.
<strong>All theoretical programs are wrong because they make incorrect core assumptions.</strong>
This is very hard for the ego of scientists because it means:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Possibly illiterate dilettantes on the internet might see and bring to attention legitimate theoretical flaws.</li>
    <li>All the years you spend in graduate school counting angels on pinheads in your respective theoretical framework is mostly a waste of time.</li>
    <li>The borders of science are borders more of a sociological club than being the border of raw rigor.</li>
    <li>Most of the scientific work is not meaningful outside of the theoretical framework that gave rise to it.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I guess this is the first blog post of the new year, even though I’m not someone who is keen on celebrating a new year, I sincerely hope every one would have a very bright 2021.</em></p>
<p>Most of you are enjoying unlimited internet at your homes, but sadly <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/28/sri-lanka-need-unlimited-internet-connections/">I’m coming from a part of the world that charges according to the data I use. </a></p>
<p>I basically pay for my data and I have monthly cap, and if I exceed that data limit I will have to buy an expensive data add-on. So data is something precious to me.</p>
<p>In the month of December, may be due to a technical error by the ISP my data add-on finished and I made a tweet criticizing them.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Scammed again by <a href="https://twitter.com/SriLankaTelecom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SriLankaTelecom</a> you should be ashamed of your practices </p><p>Bought a zoom package and data add-on today because I need zoom to work</p><p>But then suddenly by noon the internet got slower.

<p>The ISP was kind enough to reach out to me and I received an email detailing the data use of my internet connection.</p>
<p>It is a table with the websites/protocols I used, the data transmitted to that website/protocol in bytes.</p>
<p>One thing that immediately caught my eye was what’s at number 2, it was <strong>Pinterest</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>There has been 17 connections to Pinterest and Pinterest has sent me more than 1.2GB of data.</strong></p>
<p>Even the 2000+ requests to Facebook has only downloaded roughly 300MB of data.</p>
<p>Why Pinterest is sending so much data in just 17 requests? What do they contain?</p>
<p>Maybe they are preloading or caching images for better user experience. But still 1.28GB of images is likely to have more than 1000 images.</p>
<p>Another explanation can that the ISP is trying to give me an explanation why my data vanished. But both explanations doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>Since data is valuable to me I will try to block requests to Pinterest, and see if that will make a difference to my data usage.</p>
<p>I’ll request another report at the end of the month to see my data usage for the month of January to compare before and after blocking Pinterest.</p>
<p>Has anyone had a similar experience in Pinterest or is it just me?</p>

		<p>Splitting headache at 10am. Not a fine way to start the day.</p>
<p>For the last 10+ years, I’ve consumed 2-5 cups of coffee every day. I was hooked to coffee is an understatement. It had gotten so bad that if I didn’t get coffee by 9am, I’d get a debilitating migraine for the rest of the day. I also had restless sleep, bordering on insomnia, where I wouldn’t sleep at all for a couple nights a month.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2021.01.04/coffee.jpg" alt="Coffee"></p><figcaption>Sleep killer, headache giver, kick in the butt</figcaption>
</div>
<p>In February 2020, I got the worst flu in years (don’t think it was COVID). The first three days were extra painful with withdrawal headaches.
I decided a change was in order. My last coffee was January 31st, 2020.
The rest of the process was not predetermined. I tried to follow my body needs and didn’t push to quit with a definite date in mind.</p>
<p>After I recovered from the flu, I switched to black tea for the next several months.
I felt physically sluggish and mentally slower.</p>
<p>Black tea was followed by green tea for about two months. My sleep dramatically improved, however still felt lethargic. After green tea, I still didn’t feel ready to stop all together.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2021.01.04/tea.jpg" alt="Jasmine Pearl Tea"></p><figcaption>Savior, kinda</figcaption>
</div>
<p>Enter <u><a href="https://amzn.to/3pwj3Cc">jasmine pearl tea</a></u>. It’s rolled up into a ball and each ball has 1-3 tea leaves. I started using three tea balls for my morning tea. Over the course of three months, I’m down to <i>one tea ball every other day</i>. It’s been a useful tool for measuring caffeine intake. Final quitting day is February 1st, 2021.</p>
<p>The few things I’ve learned along the way:</p>
<h5 id="a-dont-plan-for-every-eventuality">A. Don’t plan for every eventuality</h5>
<p>It was tempting to outline every possible aspect of this challenge – what to drink, when to drink it, how often, when to decrease dosage, what to do in case of a backslide etc. I consciously avoided this for two reasons. One, making a full blown plan feels so satisfying that the actual challenge doesn’t feel compelling anymore, leading me to underperform or give up. And two, I might give up if I backslide so badly that my plan doesn’t account for it. That’s pretty demoralizing.</p>
<h5 id="b-celebrate-positive-consequences">B. Celebrate positive consequences</h5>
<p>I still have headaches if I miss my “caffeine window”. But they are far less painful and much more manageable. That’s a win! I sleep so much better now too.</p>
<h5 id="c-take-your-time">C. Take your time</h5>
<p>It took 10 years to get to this level of caffeine dependence. Spending one year to unwind this addiction is relatively fast! I felt a lot slower mentally in the first 6 months and still do as I continue to reduce my caffeine. I expect that once I no longer depend on caffeine, my body will pick up the slack.</p>
<p>All in all, This has been another step in discipline and a healthier me.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information). These prior data serves as the constrains to the probability distribution.</p>



<p>Given the second law of thermodynamics (principle of increase of entropy), isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy, maximum entropy distributions become the most natural distributions under certain constrains. In this blog post, I would like to discuss entropy maximization and a couple of maximum entropy distributions.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="gaussian-integral">Gaussian Integral</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>I will skip the proof here, since the proof from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral">Wikipedia</a> is not that difficult to understand.</p>

<h4 id="useful-integrals">Useful Integrals</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} d(-x^2) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x d (e^{-x^2}) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( x e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \Big) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( 0 - \sqrt{\pi} \Big) \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\

<h3 id="entropy-maximization">Entropy Maximization</h3>

<h4 id="discrete-probability-distribution">Discrete Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Suppose $P$ is a discrete probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further have some constrains on $P$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two constrains are trivial given $P$ is a probability distribution. The third constrain is optional and it indicates a constrain on the entire system. Notice that there could be more than one constrain if $m &gt; 1$.</p>



<p>We would like to maximize the entropy.</p><p>

\[\max_{P} H(P) = \max_{P} \Big( - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \Big)\]

</p><p>Letâ€™s try to solve this optimization problem. We would use Lagrange multiplier for the constrains.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) + \lambda_0 \Big(\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \sum_{x \in X}^{} \Big(P(x) r_i(x) - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) &amp;= \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)}\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="continuous-probability-distribution">Continuous Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Similarly, suppose $P$ is a continuous probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With the following constrains</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) dx = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, to maximize the entropy, we maximize the Lagrangian for the continuous case.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx + \lambda_0 \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$. We will also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a> to compute the derivative, which is slightly more complicated. Without going into all the details, we have the following derivatives.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \int_{X}^{} \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \big( P(x) \log P(x) \big)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } dx \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="maximum-entropy-distribution-examples">Maximum Entropy Distribution Examples</h3>

<h4 id="roll-dice">Roll Dice</h4>

<p>A conventional dice has 6 faces. $X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So, the maximum entropy probability distribution of getting each face of the dice is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{0} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 6 } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="uniform-distribution">Uniform Distribution</h4>

<p>The only constrain we put on a distribution is $X = [a, b]$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So the maximum entropy probability distribution is actually uniform distribution.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \int_{a}^{b} e^{0} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ b - a } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="gaussian-distribution">Gaussian Distribution</h4>

<p>We could also derive Gaussian Distribution using entropy maximization. The constrains for the maximum entropy distribution are</p>

<ul>
  <li>$X = (-\infty, \infty)$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x P(x) dx = \mu$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2 = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mu^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 P(x) dx - \mu^2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul>

<p>which translates to</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m = 2$</li>
  <li>$r_1(x) = x$, $\alpha_1 = \mu$</li>
  <li>$r_2(x) = x^2$, $\alpha_2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \big( \lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2 \big) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \Big[ \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2^2} \Big] \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2} \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Here we assume $\lambda_2 &lt; 0$, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) d \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>To make it more clear, we set</p><p>

\[y = \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)\]

</p><p>So using Gaussian integral, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - …</p></div></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A few years ago, while using the Line app, I noticed a feature called "People nearby." The feature lets you connect with other Line users within the same area. The feature would give you the exact distance from you to the other users. If someone spoofs their latitude, longitude, they can triangulate a user and find their location. I reported an issue in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://line.me/en/" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Line app</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and They paid me $1000 for it.

I tried to see if I can unmask other users' locations, and I found they have the same issue I discovered in the Line app a few years ago. I reported the problem to Telegram security, and they said it's not an issue.&nbsp;<strong>If you enable the feature of making yourself visible on the map, you're publishing your home address online. </strong><span>Lot of users don't know this when they enable that feature.

They’re structured as <strong>event-driven systems. </strong>That basically mean they react to “events” that can occur at any time.  That’s physical event sources like button presses, battery alerts, and sensors inputs, but also to incoming Bluetooth communications from an App. In our experience, even top-tier chip vendors like Nordic Semiconductors provide subpar guidance on how to best orchestrate this system of events and reactions. An unsuspecting developer may feel they’re using a lean approach, linking event sources in code to their corresponding reactions in a piecemeal fashion. The complexity of this patch network soon grows exponentially and starts feeling like a firmware savant is required just to make sense of it all.   As the project grows, the <strong>event-reaction mappings grow in quantity </strong>and<strong> </strong>likely require being dynamically re-mapped in different modes of operation. If left untreated, the affliction can get the best of you, spreading faster than you add features. If you’re anything like us, there’s an inevitable face-the-music moment where this event-driven <strong>spaghetti code </strong>can no longer be tolerated. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579741448937_7867"><div>

It’s the kind that<em> </em>compiles into bytes and bites to deal with. If you’re not aware of spaghetti code and its nauseating effects, then let’s briefly recap.  “Spaghetti code” is a slang term for code with convoluted structure, so much that it’s difficult to debug and and maintain it.</p><p><strong>What problems are caused by event-driven spaghetti code?</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Bugs: the worst kind of bugs.</strong> It’s the ugly should-have-been-avoidable bugs that crop up and continue to crop up when you lose a handle on the structure of your application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Code duplication.</strong> The completely unnecessary there-must-be-a-better-way kind of duplication. When the system for handling events is poorly structured, developers struggle to repurpose code across similar events and states of operation. For example, a “battery charging” and “charge complete” state should be able to elegantly share a lot of charging-related functionality. </p></li><li><p> <strong>Loneliness</strong>, also known as staffing problems due to your unmaintainable codebase.<strong> </strong> No one likes to work alone, so restructure your application in a way that your coworkers and future coworkers cherish. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579801278944_6416"><div><h2><strong>Fret Not</strong></h2><p>I want to recommend a system that’s worked for me — two steps for developers like us to immunize against the spaghetti affliction right from the start. </p><p><strong>Overview of the Steps to Avoid Spaghetti Code:</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Use an atomic <strong>event queue</strong>. Rather than reacting to events all over your different interrupt execution contexts, an event queue allows you to consolidate those portions of your code into one place. It’s your conduit for “deferring” the handling of events from many contexts (like interrupts) into one main context. It additionally solves the issue of thread/interrupt safety, by avoiding concurrent access of shared resources across different contexts..  For example, you don’t want a SPI peripheral used in two contexts that can interrupt one another. Instead, both contexts can queue events for the main function to perform the SPI operations sequentially. </p></li><li><p>Use a <strong>hierarchical state machine (HSM)</strong>, and a framework to implement one. An HSM is the  knockout punch for our spaghetti foe. It provides an intuitive and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton">deterministic</a> scheme to define how events should be handled throughout various modes of operation. HSMs are “hierarchical” in the sense that each state can be configured to inherit behaviors from a “superstate”, a more general state that encapsulates it and potentially other states. The hierarchical aspect of HSMs make them far more practical for real-world firmware applications than a textbook flat state machine. A “battery charging” and “charging complete” state could both inherit and share a bulk of their code from an “charger attached” state. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579801278944_14942"><div><h2><strong>Immunization Step 1 of 2: <br>Take a queue from your vendor</strong></h2><p><strong>An event queue is the essence of event-driven architecture</strong>.

In the case of some dead-simple events, you might get away handling them right there in the interrupt; But, generally that’s bad practice.

Many developers would be hard-pressed to develop complex applications without it. You use the queue to take all your events and  funnel them into a single context where they’re processed one at a time. Right off the bat, that gains you cozy-warm assurances of thread/interrupt safety because event handling isn’t strewn across all sorts of overlapping execution contexts.</p><p>Courteous silicon vendors usually provide developers with some form of an atomic queue. <strong>Nordic </strong>provides <strong>nRF52</strong> developers with <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/sdk_nrf5_v16.0.0/lib_scheduler.html?cp=7_1_3_39">their “app scheduler”</a><em>. </em><strong>Texas Instruments</strong><em> </em>provides <strong>CC2640</strong> developers with <a href="http://dev.ti.com/tirex/content/simplelink_cc2640r2_sdk_2_40_00_32/docs/blestack/ble_user_guide/html/ble-stack-tirtos/queues.html">their queue module</a> accompanying their TI-RTOS.

  <article>
    

    <p><strong>Monday, January  4, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>If you're building an application that needs to scale—and we all tell ourselves that we are—then at some point you have to figure out if it <em>does</em> or not. This is where load testing comes in: if you want to see whether or not your application can handle scale, just <em>generate</em> scale and see if it can handle it! It sounds straightforward enough.</p>
<p>Then you try to actually generate load. This is straightforward if your application is dead simple, because you can use something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_JMeter">Apache JMeter</a> to generate repeated requests. If you can do this, I envy you: every system I've worked on is more complicated and requires a more intricate testing plan.</p>
<p>Your application gets slightly more complicated, so you then turn to tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_(software)">Gatling</a>. These let you simulate virtual users going through scenarios, which is a lot more helpful than just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_(software)">besieging</a>&nbsp;one or a handful of URLs. Even this isn't sufficient if you're writing an application that uses both WebSockets <em>and</em> HTTP calls, over a long-lived session, and requires certain actions repeated on a timer. Unless I severely missed something in the documentation, I cannot see a way to, say, setup a heartbeat that runs ever 30 seconds, do certain actions upon response to a WebSocket message, and also do some other HTTP actions, all with the same HTTP session. I haven't found a way to do that in <em>any</em> load testing tool (which is why I wrote my own at work, which I hope to open source if I can make the time to clean it up and separate out proprietary bits).</p>
<p>But let's suppose you <em>do</em> have a tool that works, out of the box, like Gatling or Locust, and it fits your needs. Great! Now let's write that test. In my experience, this is the hardest bit yet, because you have to first figure out what realistic load looks like — welcome to a day or three of dredging through logs and taking notes while you peer at the network tools in your browser as you click around in your web application. And then after you know what realistic load looks like, you get to write what boils down to a subset of your application to pretend to be a user, hit the API, and do the things your user would do.</p>
<p>And we're not done yet! This is fine, we have our load test written and it's realistic. But this is a moving target, because updates keep going out. So now you have the maintenance problem, too: as your application changes, how do you keep your load test up to date? There isn't great tooling to do this, there is little out there to help you. You have to make this part of your process and hope you don't miss things. This is not a satisfying answer, and that's why this is also one of the hardest parts of load testing an application.</p>
<p>We'll just skip the whole "running it" part, because honestly, if you've gotten this far through a load test, then running it shouldn't be the hardest part.</p>

<p>So basically, here's where we are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most load testing tools support simplistic workloads, and even the complex ones don't let you do everything that's realistically needed to simulate <em>real</em> usage of a web application.</li>
<li>Writing the test with a simulation of real usage is the hardest part, even if the tools do support what you need.</li>
<li>Maintaining the test is the second hardest part, and the tooling here does not help you in the slightest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at these in detail and see how much complexity we can pare away.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-users-do-we-have-to">Simulating users. Do we have to?</h2>
<p>I'm a "yes" here, although it might depend on your application. And for these purposes, we're talking about the user <em>of a service</em>; if you have a monolith, this is your users as a whole, but if you have microservices the "user" might be another one of your services! For the applications I've worked on, I have had minor success with targeted tests of specific endpoints. But these end up requiring such complicated setup that you aren't better off than you were with the load test itself! And while it may yield some results and improvements, it doesn't get to everything (you may have endpoints that interact) and you don't get a realistic workload.</p>
<p>"When do you <em>not</em> need to simulate users?" is probably a better question. Seems to me like this is when you <em>know</em> that your endpoints are all independent in performance, you don't have any stateful requests, and the ordering of requests does not impact performance. These are big things to assume and it's hard to have confidence in them without testing their independence, at which point, we're back to writing that whole dang test.</p>
<p>The best you can do here is probably at the API and system design time, not at your test time. If you design a simpler API, you're going to have far less surface area to test. If you design a system with more certainly independent pieces (distinct databases per service, for example) then it's easier to test them in isolation than in a monolith. Doing this also lets you use a tool that is simpler, so you get two wins!</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-tests-is-hard-so-is-maintenance">Writing the tests is <em>hard.</em> So is maintenance.</h2>
<p>Creating a load test is hard because you have to do a few things: you have to understand what the flow through <em>usage</em> of your API is, and you have to write a simulation of that usage. Understanding that flow means understanding other systems than the one under test and since your system is presumably not the focus of their documentation, there is not going to be a super clear diagram of when and how it's called; this often looks like sifting logs until you figure out what the representative usage is. And then writing that simulation is certainly not trivial, because you need to manage the state for a large number of actors representing users of your API!</p>
<p>Oh, and you get to write integration tests for this now, too.</p>
<p>There's some research out there on how to make some of these tasks easier. You can figure out what you need for the initial test, and detect regressions (missing new workloads) from automated analysis of the logs, for example. But as far as I can tell, there is no software on GitHub, let alone a product I can buy, that's going to do that for me. So it doesn't seem like it has much of any traction in industry. It would be a big project to implement it on your own, which might be why it has languished (or is done at big companies, and is not spoken of).</p>

<p>There's a lot of complexity in load tests, and there is not a lot of tooling to help you with it. So maybe the answer is: write fewer of these types of tests, and don't expect them to give you all the answers to how your system performs.</p>
<p>You have a few options for getting a great picture of how your system performs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good old analysis.</strong> Sit down with a notebook, a pen, an understanding of your systems as a whole, and an afternoon to spare, and you can figure out with some napkin math what the general parameters and bounds of scaling on your system are. When you find the bottleneck, or you have some unknowns (how many transactions per second <em>can</em> our database support? how many do we generate?) then you can go test those specifically!</li>
<li><strong>Feature rollouts.</strong> If you can roll out features slowly across your users, then you don't necessarily have to do any load testing at all! You can measure performance experimentally and see if it's good enough. Good? Roll forward. Bad? Roll back.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic replay.</strong> This doesn't help at all with new features (see feature rollouts ten words ago for that) but it does help with understanding your system breaking points for existing features without as much development. You can take the traffic you saw before and replay it (multiple times over, even, by combining multiple different periods' traffic) and see how the system performs! (Side note: I would <em>love</em> tooling to help with this, and with amplifying traffic when doing this, so if anyone has a recommendation... hit me up.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have some silver bullet I've missed, or a fantastic research paper in this area you'd recommend reading, or a story of terrible times with scaling that you want to share with me, please email them to <a href="mailto:me@ntietz.com">me@ntietz.com</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>For the past while, I’ve had the goal of learning a functional programming language in the back of my mind but never acted on it for various reasons. However, during a recent weekend afternoon of winter COVID-lockdown web browsing, I stumbled across the terrific <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/" target="_blank">F# for fun and profit</a> which piqued my interest and convinced me to take the plunge and learn FP in 2021. I believe that learning different programming paradigms helps you become stronger in all languages, and with C# incorporating more and more features from F# (records among other things for example) learning functional programming would be a benefit in a few different ways.</p>

<p>In addition, as I’ve been spending quite a bit of time working with C# and .NET 5 recently, F# felt like a natural fit due to the interoperability with the rest of the .NET ecosystem. In addition, F# has support for OO and so you can use a hybrid model in situations where pure FP may not be possible.</p>

<h2 id="initial-thoughts">Initial Thoughts</h2>

<p>As a small learning project, I created a simple program which asks the user for a username and password and prints a message if the user enters the correct combination (if they get the combination wrong the function is called recursively and asks them for their credentials again). Figuring out the implementation details proved to be a bit more challenging than if I were to code the solution in C# as you don’t want to use statements such as if and while in functional programming which would normally be my go-tos in a case like this. After much trial and error, I found my solution to be quite elegant:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>type</span> <span>LoginModel</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span> <span>Password</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>}</span>

<span>// By making Admins a Set.OfList we can use .Contains later.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>Admins</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"MJ"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"M"</span><span>};</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"Joe"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"C"</span><span>}]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>.</span><span>ofList</span>

<span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>// The LoginRoutine() is a recursive function we call until the user enters the correct credentials.</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> 
        <span>printfn</span> <span>"Welcome to VMS Version V!"</span>
        <span>printf</span> <span>"Enter your username to continue: "</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>usernameAttempt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>()</span>
        <span>printf</span> <span>"Enter your password to continue: "</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>passwordAttempt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>()</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>usernameAttempt</span><span>;</span> <span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>passwordAttempt</span><span>}</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>Admins</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>with</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>true</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>printfn</span> <span>"You are logged in"</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>false</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>
    
    <span>let</span> <span>login</span> <span>=</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>

    <span>0</span> <span>// Terminate program</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In comparison to C#, we see several big differences in the code. Aside from the lack of brackets and semicolons, the program uses a match expression rather than an if statement to evaluate the user’s credentials. Pattern matches are powerful expressions and from what I’ve seen can allow for complex branching.</p>

<p>Also note the creation of the Admins list:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>Admins</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"MJ"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"M"</span><span>};</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"Joe"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"C"</span><span>}]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>.</span><span>ofList</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>During the binding, we never specifed the actual type! F#’s powerful type inference means that I can skip a lot of boilerplate that I would normally use in C# while still having all the benefits of a strongly typed language.</p>

<p>We also make use of the pipe forward operator |&gt; in order to take the admins list and turn it into a set. Converting the list to a set allows us to use .Contains on our admins list in the match expression later on in the code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        <span>match</span> <span>Admins</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>with</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>true</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>printfn</span> <span>"You are logged in"</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>false</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the LoginRountine function has been marked with the rec (recursive) keyword, it will continue to call itself until the match returns true. This eliminates the need for using a while loop while keeping our method immutable.</p>

<p>In addition, its important to note that F# executes code from the top down which I find makes following program flow much easier. Despite this, I did run into a few compiler errors until I got the hang of the execution flow and making sure to put functions in the proper order.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>So far, my biggest issue hasn’t been with the language itself, but rather the lack of learning resources compared with other, more popular languages. <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp" target="_blank">Get Programming with F#</a> has been a terrific book for learning, but the paradigm shift that functional programming requires can be quite significant and I find myself constantly Googling certain issues and being able to count the number of (usually not very related) Stack Exchange topics on one hand. I did however find a great small but active <a href="https://discord.gg/vs4U6HQhAG" target="_blank">F# Discord community</a> which has been great at answering smaller one-off questions that I’ve had regarding the language.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>My next steps are to think about a project that I’d like to undertake in F# to help me continue my learning. I find I tend to learn best when I have a project and write a build log documenting the process, and I’m hoping that I’ll be able to combine an F# project with my <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-12-09-back-to-school/" target="_blank">cloud computing program</a> that I’ll be attending at the end of January. I also plan to write a few more articles exploring the language a bit more in-depth in the coming months, so stay tuned!</p>

The delivery driver who brought his groceries from Vons mentioned that drivers across the state are getting fired by Vons, Pavilions, and other California stores owned by Albertsons Companies in late February. Stores will instead turn to a third-party delivery service using independent contractors.</p><p id="d033">â€œI was disturbed and disappointed that Vons would eliminate these jobs. I felt like they were the only remaining company that treated delivery drivers ethically but no longer,â€� said Dylan.</p><p id="1f42">After publication, an Albertsons representative sent the following statement: â€œWe will transition that portion of our eCommerce operations to third-party logistics providers.â€� She added â€œWhile we know that this move will help us create a more efficient operation, it wasnâ€™t a decision we made lightly or without a great deal of consideration.â€�</p><p id="10d5">Drivers under the Albertsons Companies umbrella are employees, while Ralphs delivery is operated by Instacart and Target uses Shipt, a similar app. At Bay Area stores, drivers are unionized, and will not be affected by the layoffs. For southern California shoppers, this move leaves them without a grocery delivery option that treats drivers as employees.</p><p id="baaa">Unions are vowing to fight the change, says Jim Araby, Director of Strategic Campaigns at UCFW5. â€œThe only drivers that kept their jobs were the unionized drivers in the Bay Area. All the other drivers in California were laid off because they were non-union. We represent those drivers and they will keep their job.â€�</p><p id="4b12">These layoffs are unsurprising after the passage of Proposition 22, which gutted worker protections while making it easier for companies to shift financial burdens onto newly-designated â€œindependent contractors.â€� In a <a rel="noopener" href="https://knock-la.com/the-case-for-voting-no-on-ca-prop-22-a64d25b2828d">piece for KNOCK</a> last year, Keith F. Eberl predicted this exact outcome in the opening paragraph:</p><blockquote><p id="95b6">â€œContrary to the companiesâ€™ deceptive ad campaign and intimidating messages to their workers, Prop 22 does not preserve driver flexibility or save drivers from politicians. What Prop 22 does do is change current law so the companies can shift their costs to the driver and diminish or remove driversâ€™ rights, protections, and benefits. Prop 22 will also block driversâ€™ ability to organize so they canâ€™t collectively bargain a contract. In addition, this proposition will block local governments from writing or enforcing protections for drivers.â€�</p></blockquote><p id="a03f">The only surprise is the speed at which Albertsons reversed course on its commitments to workers. This move comes after nearly a year of celebrating grocery store workers for feeding communities. <a href="https://www.vons.com/steps-we-are-taking-at-your-grocery-store.html" rel="noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Albertsons Companies President &amp; CEO Vivek Sankaran said the company was â€œtaking care of our team.â€� Albertsons Companies â€œare workingâ€¦ to ensure that every member of our team who faces a crisis can have peace of mind that we will help them get through it.â€�</p><p id="c5d5">Albertsons was happy to reap public goodwill during the pandemic. But once Prop 22 gave the company the option of replacing workers with lower-paid contractors, they jumped at the opportunity. Employees received notice during the holidays that their employment would end one month into the new year.</p><p id="66cc">Early in the pandemic, union members demanded hazard pay, additional medical leave, and employee protections during the pandemic. In March, Safeway and Northern California grocery workers <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Coronavirus-Safeway-reaches-new-agreement-for-15150811.php" rel="noopener">reached an agreement</a> providing these additional benefits.</p><p id="452b">Labor and management were able to cooperate in April, requesting that grocery workers be designated as first responders. In an April j<a href="https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/helping-you-through-covid-19/albertsons-companies-ucfw-launch-joint-effort.html" rel="noopener">oint statement</a>, Sankaran and United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) President Marc Perrone wrote:</p><blockquote><p id="c86a">â€œThis joint action is an example of how all Americans must work together to protect everyone working on the frontlines. This includesâ€¦ associates at our nationâ€™s grocery stores who are providing communities with the essential food and supplies needed to weather this public health crisis.â€�</p></blockquote><p id="0a33">Negotiations in October <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/08/grocery-warehouse-workers-truck-drivers-give-notice-of-potential-strike/" rel="noopener">turned contentious</a>, as members of the Teamsters issued a notice of potential strike due to rising healthcare costs. Lou Villavazo, who chairs the bargaining effort, told the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/08/grocery-warehouse-workers-truck-drivers-give-notice-of-potential-strike/" rel="noopener">Orange County Register</a> that â€œemployers have been bargaining in bad faith. Weâ€™ve had over 18 bargaining sessions with them and we provided our economic proposal â€¦ but no response.â€�</p><p id="e2db">Organized labor made the difference for drivers in the Bay Area, who will remain as employees for now. But without the power of a union, southern California drivers lack an organizational structure through which to fight back.</p><p id="b343">Many, myself included, turned to Vons and Albertsons stores for their groceries, knowing that drivers were employed with benefits. Unionized drivers offered a clear alternative to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-24/no-holiday-cheer-for-gig-workers-hunting-your-last-minute-gifts" rel="noopener">hellscape of gig-economy apps</a> like Instacart.</p><p id="a579">In a <a href="https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/newsroom/appreciation-pay-for-front-line-associates.html" rel="noopener">March 2020 statement</a>, Sankaran said â€œthese times are unprecedented in the grocery industryâ€¦ [a] simple â€˜thank youâ€™ doesnâ€™t seem like quite enough.â€� He was right. Delivery drivers deserve healthcare, job protections, and fair wages. Workers won those fights this year because they fought as a union. With DoorDash taking over in February, that united front will be gone.</p><p id="26c2">You can contact Albertsons Companies and let them know what you think of this move:</p><p id="2910">Vons Retail Store/Corporate Phone Number: 877â€“723â€“3929</p><p id="2f7e">Albertsons Retail Store/Corporate Phone Number: 877â€“723â€“3929</p><p id="2b59"><em>EDITORâ€™S NOTE: After publication, Albertsonâ€™s responded to KNOCKâ€™s request for comment. This piece has since been edited to clarify that union drivers will not be laid off and that workers facing layoffs in Southern California are non-union, as well as to include statements from both Albertsons and UCFW5. The scheduled date of the layoffs was also corrected.</em></p></div></div></section></div>]]>

I'm completely transparent about how this website makes money as well as the methods and limitations of my product selection methodology. Every affiliate link on this site is properly disclosed and wrapped in a "rel sponsored" tag. I take the time to read scientific and medical research as it relates to the topics that I cover, and when I find a product that is potentially harmful (like weighted eye masks), I share my findings with every major publisher who has written positive things about that product. I use my expertise to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johndefeo_if-you-support-a-charity-via-amazonsmile-activity-6737737229449379840-vc6I/">support charity</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johndefeo_to-my-friends-in-journalism-be-cautious-activity-6733095426775404544-FbxR/">to teach colleagues about scams</a>.

These media mentions drove hundreds of thousands of visits. Nevertheless, if someone who was referred to this website two years ago is looking for a cheap portable generator today, he or she is much more likely to Google "cheap portable generator" than to come to my homepage.</p><p>It's understandable. Alas, without search visibility, this site in invisible.</p><h2><strong>Can a Domain Be Cursed?</strong></h2><p>I did my due diligence before I registered goodcheapandfast.com. It had no backlink history and it had only existed previously as a parked domain in 2013. There are no obvious skeletons in this domain's closet, yet strange things have been afoot, almost since day one.</p><p>For example, Bing didn't even index this website's homepage a month after <em>Good, Cheap and Fast</em> was linked to from websites like Esquire and Slate. I contacted bingwb@microsoft.com with my concerns and received this response:</p><blockquote><p>Good day and thank you for your patience while we investigated the issue.</p><p>Firstly, I am happy to provide you information that our product review group succeeded in removing the block of the site. After submitting your site to be reviewed the team has decided to lift the  block. Please allow up to 2-3 weeks for your site to be crawled indexed and serving again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am unable to provide you the specifics of the block as our product review team does not share details of the block.</p></blockquote><p>The mystery didn't end there. Two years later, this website has received fewer than 100 total referrals from Bing. That's not normal and neither is this: Since 2019, pages on this website started dropping in-and-out of Google's results. An article that ranked #1 would disappear entirely, then reappear, then disappear, then reappear. These were like mini strokes. Sometimes the traffic bounced back in full; other times it gradually faded away.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607704925648_28921"><div>

The best that I've gotten in return was a <a href="https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/1327323523828703232">superficial acknowledgement</a> that resulted in a dead end.</p><p>I get it.

It dragged on for two years.)</p></blockquote><p>There's an old proverb, "Who knows what is good and what is bad." </p><p>Maybe my own plight, which admittedly doesn't even register as a drop in the sea of 2020 misery, is part of something good that has yet to reveal itself. </p><p>I'm doing the best that I can to stay positive, but it isn't easy.</p><p>———</p><p><strong>Update, 12/15</strong> - My traffic has settled into a 90% loss.

            I am no stranger to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling">Doom Scrolling</a>. 
            I am guilty of scrolling through r/coronavirus (I don't even want to link it) on Reddit. 
            This was a great source of stress for me: I was counting every number, looking at infection 
            rates across populations, observing hospital capacities, and to put it candidly, watching 
            people die. I decided to cut back on coronavirus news, and found that my days were generally 
            happier. At a certain point, though, I cut the news out all together. Why?
        </p>
        <h2>I Already Know What I Need To Do</h2>
        <p>
            I have come to realize that no coronavirus news will (or should) change my behavior. 
            I should wear my mask and I should socially distance. What else do I need to know?
            If you've felt the stress of reading about coronavirus news, I personally recommend 
            you try cutting it out. Seriously, you're not going to miss much.

<article>
  <p>
    Sometimes, when we make seamless patterns out of several objects,
    we need to deal with the situations where the objects are on the borders.
    Usually we create copies of the objects and place them
    at proper positions to make the tiling work with no seams.
  </p>
  <!--more-->

  

  <p>
    In CSS, there's a possible way to do it without creating
    copies manually or doing any calculations to the positions,
    by utilizing the CSS <code>background</code> property.
  </p>

  <p>
    Background in CSS is repeatable by default,
    if we create objects using <code>background</code> or <code>background-image</code>,
    they can be tiled automatically regardless of their positions.
  </p>

   <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

  <span>/* default */</span>
  <span>background-size</span><span>:</span> <span>100%</span> <span>100%</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-repeat</span><span>:</span> <span>repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
    
  </div>

  <h2>Pattern fragment</h2>

  <p>
    We start with specifying the size of the fragment which is being used for tiling,
    This is an essential step since it determines the repeatable space of the pattern.
  </p>

<div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
  </div>

  <p>
    Create a circle object using <code>radial-gradient</code> in the background.
  </p>

 <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
    
  </div>

  <p>
    The circle is being tiled properly even though you can't see the edges.
    Move it to somewhere else using <code>background-position</code>.
    No need to worry about getting over the edges,
    the browser has taken care of it for us.
  </p>


 <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>background-position</span><span>:</span> <span>-110px</span> <span>-20px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
    
  </div>

  <p>
    We can add more objects by adding more background images.
  </p>


<div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>20%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>10%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>background-position</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-110px</span> <span>-20px</span><span>,</span>
    <span>-20px</span> <span>-75px</span><span>,</span>
    <span>20px</span> <span>40px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

    
    
  </div>


<p>
  This element can be used to make a seamless
  pattern by tiling.

  The only problem is that the element itself cannot be tiled as easily as background images.
  We need to create many identical elements and place them in the grid.

  Although taking a screenshot of the element and saving it in PNG format is a quick solution.
</p>

<h2>Using css-doodle</h2>

<p>
  One of the exciting features <a href="https://css-doodle.com/">css-doodle</a> provides is the ability to generate background
  image from another css-doodle element with the <code>@doodle</code> function.
  If we create the pattern fragment in css-doodle, it can be used for background image.
  Which means the pattern fragment can be tiled.
</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* container size */</span>
<span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>100%</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>

<span>/* pattern dimension */</span>
<span>background-size</span><span>:</span> <span>180</span><span>px</span> <span>180</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>

<span>/* pattern fragment */</span>

  <span>@</span><span>grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>100%</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155</span><span>a6</span> <span>30</span><span>%,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155</span><span>a6</span> <span>20</span><span>%,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155</span><span>a6</span> <span>5</span><span>%,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>background-position</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-110px</span> <span>-20px</span><span>,</span>
    <span>-20px</span> <span>-75px</span><span>,</span>
    <span>20</span><span>px</span> <span>40</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 100% 180px;
      border: 1px solid #6155a6;
      background-size: 180px 180px;
      background-image: @doodle(
        @grid: 1 / 100%;
        background-image:
          radial-gradient(#6155a6 30%, transparent 0),
          radial-gradient(#6155a6 20%, transparent 0),
          radial-gradient(#6155a6 5%, transparent 0);
        background-position:
          -110px -20px,
          -20px -75px,
          20px 40px;
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </p>

  <p>
    Using gradients to create shapes is rather limited.
    Fortunately, the <code>@doodle</code> function can be nested.
    For example, we can replace one of the circle objects created from <code>radial-gradient</code> with
    another css-doodle element, inside which is a heart shape with rotation by <code>30</code> degree.

  <h2>Do it again</h2>

  <p>
    I know it's a bit confusing at first. So let's take another example from this <a href="https://codepen.io/yuanchuan/pen/xxEXwZw">demo</a> on CodePen,
    and recreate the <i>pattern #11</i> step by step.
  </p>

  <p>
    We still start from the pattern fragment,
    add its background color, setup its width and height both to <code>200px</code>.
    Note again that putting the objects inside background image is an important step. So here's the skeleton.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>200px</span><span>;</span>

<span>background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>#005874</span><span>;</span>
<span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
  <span>/* objects */</span><span>;</span>
<span>background-position</span><span>:</span>
  <span>/* positions */</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 200px;
      background: #005874;
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <h3>Add objects</h3>

  <p>
    We're going to create a new shape for the elements in this pattern.
    The <code>@shape()</code> function returns a generated string of <code>polygon()</code> used by <code>clip-path</code>.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>50</span><span>;</span>
  <span>scale</span><span>:</span> <span>.</span><span>3</span><span>;</span>
  <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
  <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 200px 150px;
      :after {
        content: '';
        @size: 100px;
        background: #ffbe00;
        margin-left: -20px;
        clip-path: @shape(
          split: 50;
          scale: .3;
          x: cos(t) + cos(2t) * 2;
          y: sin(2t) + sin(t) * 2;
        );
      }
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p>
    Place the shape to the <code>background-image</code> with <code>@doodle</code> function.
    It's the first object we added to the pattern.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>200px</span><span>;</span>

  <span>);</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>/* position */</span>
<span>background-position</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
    <p>
      <css-doodle seed="1608724650251">
        @grid: 1 / 200px;
        background-color: #005874;
        background-image: @doodle(
          @grid: 1 / 50px;
          background: @p(#65d6ce,#1c819e,#e6e6d4,#ffbe00);
          clip-path: @shape(

        );
        background-position: 0 0;
      </css-doodle>
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Once we have a good understanding of how this works, add more objects and place each of them with <code>background-position</code>.
    Setting random background colors and transfomations will make them look better.

<h2>How to use it in production</h2>

<p>
  I'd suggest to to create pattern fragments with design tools like PS and AI,
  but it's still interesting to create something directly from the code.
  So here are two ways to apply it to your websites:
</p>

<ul>

<p>The strangest hobby I’ve ever had is collecting credit cards. This was back about six years ago, when I loved “gaming” the system. How would I maximize my cashback, points and benefits without paying a single cent? </p>



<p>I mastered the credit card market and all its technicalities: the best cards for discounts and premium airport lounges, hacks to avoid paying fees, and I even paid off my <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/how-i-paid-off-my-58k-education-loan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">student loan</a> using credit cards.</p>



<p>Additionally, the coolest thing about <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/optimize-your-credit-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit cards</a> like Visa Infinites and World Mastercards is they portray status — you’ve gotta reach a certain level of income to have ’em.</p>



<p>It was an insecure guy’s wet dream, and I was hooked.</p>



<p>While I started aiming for money and status, thankfully those haven’t been the only things I’ve been maximizing for. (I can imagine that would make me pretty obnoxious.) Instead, I figured out pretty early money isn’t a good measure for a great life. Money is more like a pre-requisite: necessary, but once you have <a href="https://www.sloww.co/how-much-money-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enough</a> — more isn’t gonna make a big difference.</p>



<p>So I started maximizing for other things. In fact, if there’s one big theme that connects everything in my blog, it’s this: getting the most out of life — whether it’s in the areas of money, career or relationships.</p>



<div><p>Thus far, it’s served me well. But in recent times, I’ve started to wonder if maximizing is really that great. For someone who’s spent years trying to extract maximum value from their life, is there a better way?</p></div>



<h2>Maximizers vs Satisficers</h2>



<p>In his popular book “<a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Paradox-Choice-Barry-Schwartz/9780062449924?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1601188274112&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Paradox of Choice</a>,” the psychologist Dr. Barry Schwartz broadly describes two kinds of people: maximizers (like me) and satisficers.</p>



<p>The stereotypical maximizer is someone who spends tons of time evaluating options before they make a <em>best</em> decision: like your geeky friend who draws up cost-benefit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/downside-everything/" target="_blank">analysis</a> spreadsheets for months before buying a new phone (which annoyingly tends to be the phone you recommended him in the first place).</p>



<p>Satisficers on the other hand, tend to settle for the first thing that meets their requirements: like your elderly aunt who’s thrilled with her 2019 Xiaomi.</p>



<p>I imagine most people who’re good at personal finance or pros in fields like accounting and law are maximizers. There are proven benefits to maximizing: maximizers make better decisions. They also make more money.</p>



<p>But guess who’s happier?</p>



<p>Right, research shows satisficers tend to be <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/science-choice/201506/satisficing-vs-maximizing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">happier</a>.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say one is better than the other. Don’t worry whether you’re a maximizer or a satisficer — I don’t think people can easily switch. Just understand there’s things to learn from the other side.</p>



<div><p>As for the maximizer in me, I’ve grown to become more easily satisfied. This is what I’ve learned along the way.</p></div>



<h2>Struggling Between Growth and Satisfaction</h2>



<p>Something I’ve written about extensively is how I’ve always felt I was an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/journey-finding-satisfaction-life/" target="_blank">underdog</a>. Like I constantly needed to prove my worth. When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with becoming an all-rounder. </p>



<p>I was pretty good at exams, but wanted to prove I could do other stuff. Hence trying to be good at sports and being popular with the girls. No, I didn’t want to be a geek. I wanted to be a jock; but a smart one. I wanted to be amazing in every area. To win. And thus, my lifelong obsession with self-improvement.</p>



<p>I don’t know if feeling <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/how-overcome-jealousy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insecure</a> pushed me towards becoming a maximizer. Or if maximizers tend to feel insecure (are they secretly compensating for something?). What I do know is there’s a spectrum between satisfaction and growth. And there’s an art to balancing both.</p>



<p>I say art because you don’t wanna fall into any of the extremes. Constantly keeping score and trying to win is exhausting because even if you’re #1, you lose sometimes. Besides, everyone eventually gets old. On the other hand you don’t want to be easily satisfied with everything — that just ensures you get complacent; eventually extinct. </p>



<p>Surely there’s a sweet spot. </p>



<div><p>I like to call that sweet spot “good enough.”</p></div>



<h2>What If 90% Is All You Need?</h2>



<p>We’ve been very philosophical so far, so it’s time for examples. I was reminded of what’s “good enough” in personal finance, by Morgan Housel on Twitter recently:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>– Live below your means. </p><p>– Invest, diversified, with a 10+ year horizon. </p><p>– Expect and accept volatility. </p><p>That's 90% of finance. </p><p>90%.</p></div>— Morgan Housel (@morganhousel) <a href="https://twitter.com/morganhousel/status/1285324455699337217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Sure, personal finance is a lot more complex than three sentences. But if a young person today ignored everything else and just followed that advice for the rest of their life, would they do okay? </p>



<p>I think so. I think the 90% is good enough for most people. Heck, the 90% will probably make you do <em>better</em> than most people.</p>



<div><p>What are some other examples of the “Good Enough” principle?</p></div>



<h3>“Good Enough” Examples</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Health:</strong> Eat a balanced diet to keep your weight in the healthy range. Exercise 3x a week. Get &gt;7 hours of sleep every night.</li><li><strong>Investing:</strong> Buy low-cost, passive index funds or ETFs. <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/how-invest-own-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Invest</a> for retirement, decades away. Don’t interrupt the compounding effect of your retirement fund (e.g. EPF) by making early withdrawals.</li><li><strong>Career:</strong> Work with good people who you respect. Never stop learning, whether it’s technical or soft skills. Be reliable and over-communicate, so your bosses and colleagues understand your work.</li><li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Treat people with respect and empathy. Set healthy boundaries, especially with negative people. When you have issues, discuss them honestly.</li><li><strong>Writing:</strong> Use the simplest words you can without losing your message. Make your point quickly and get out of the way. Edit ruthlessly — good <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/lessons-5-years-writing-how-start-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a> is a bad first draft polished many times.</li></ul>



<p>BTW this isn’t about life hacks. Fuck hacks. This is about fundamentals. Hacks are short-term easy things, whereas fundamentals are the (usually) harder, boring principles which will bring you long-term success.</p>



<p>How much pain would we save if we could just lean back, accept good enough for most things, and trust everything will work out in the long term?</p>



<p>I say good enough for most things. Because then, you’ll still have the time and energy to focus on a <em>few</em> things that <em>really</em> matter. In a funny way, the concept of good enough can fit in with maximalization. I like to call it Aaron’s Law of Life Optimization:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>Focus your life on just a few critical things. For everything else, just get to good enough.</p></div></blockquote>



<h2>Applying “Good Enough” to My Own Life</h2>



<p>What is it that you really want in life?</p>



<p>When I was in my twenties, I wanted to have everything: money, power, career and fame. But today, my life is very different from the dream state I once imagined.</p>



<p>It’s practical. I work hard at my day job as a salaried employee, not a rich Internet solopreneur with 100,000 USD passive income. I occasionally have heated discussions with my wife over trivial matters, instead of baller living with four girlfriends who call me Master. In my middle-class condo parking lot, I have an old <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/cheap-second-hand-car/" target="_blank">second-hand MyVi</a> instead of the Ferrari I once dreamed about. </p>



<p>Maybe the insecure younger me would have looked at my life today and laughed: “Is this all there is to life? When did you give up on your dreams to conquer the world and settle?”</p>



<p>And the older, wiser me would reply: “One day you’ll realize there are just a few <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/only-4-things-care-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">important things</a> in life, and everything else is secondary. As long as you have those covered, nothing else really matters.”</p>



<p>It would be tough for the younger me to understand. But I hope he would listen and think about it seriously. And no matter how many months or years it’d take him to explore and eventually realize these truths, I hope he’d come back to me someday and say: </p>



<div><p>“Actually, that sounds okay. It sounds good enough.”</p></div>

<p><em>Rapid climbs to stardom are normally reserved for pop stars and, on rare occasions, for politicians. But it is virtually unheard of for scientists. On Nov. 9, 2020, though, Özlem Türeci and Uğur Şahin were catapulted onto the world stage essentially overnight. That's the day, BioNTech, the medical research company the couple founded, reported the first global breakthrough in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic: The company's vaccine candidate BNT162b2, developed in Mainz, Germany, demonstrated more than 90 percent efficacy in clinical studies. Almost every test subject who received the vaccine was protected from contracting COVID-19.</em></p>


<p><em>It was a sensation. And a glimmer of hope. In 2021, fully 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine are to be administered worldwide, making an end to the pandemic more than just a distant hope. Şahin and Türeci have been the focus of global attention since then, with press outlets around the world showing a soft spot for the German couple with Turkish roots. She, a chief physician; he, the CEO of BioNTech – married for the last 18 years. Thus far, Şahin has taken the lead in conducting interviews, but this is the first, extensive joint interview given by the couple. It was conducted via Zoom from their Mainz apartment. The two seemed so relaxed that it was easy to forget all that was going on around them.</em></p>

<div>
<p><em>The BioNTech couple has been well known in the medical community for some time, particularly among cancer experts. They are both oncologists specialized in immunotherapy. Şahin, 55, was awarded the German Cancer Prize in 2019. Türeci, 53, is head of the research cluster of the German Ministry of Education, Science and Culture.</em></p><p><em>BioNTech is the second company the couple has founded, but they primarily see themselves as scientific researchers. They view entrepreneurship as a means to an end: Because "science doesn't always reach the hospital bed," as Türeci says – because research doesn't always produce concrete treatments, or does so only slowly. As such, the record speed with which their company developed the COVID-19 vaccine is a message: Look how fast we can move if we all join forces.</em></p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Ms. Türeci, Mr. Şahin, as we speak, millions of doses of the vaccine you developed are being shipped on planes and trucks to hospitals and vaccination centers around the world. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden was inoculated live on television with the BioNTech vaccine. Your research is currently the greatest hope for billions of people. Have you been able to find a minute to reflect on all of that?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> If you are speaking literally about a single minute, then yes. The entire year was more or less unrelenting. But every now and then, we have had brief moments to reflect and absorb events, such as when colleagues sent us photos from the first vaccinations. To see people finally benefitting from our work is really moving.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The vaccine achieved an efficacy of 95 percent in the clinical study. Most experts would have been happy with a result exceeding 70 percent. Were you confident from the beginning that your vaccine would be so potent?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> We were confident that the immunological reaction would be close to perfect. We started with 20 vaccine candidates, which we tested until only the best remained. It helped that we have over two decades of experience in immune engineering, triggering immune responses in the body. But we didn't know if the virus was at all susceptible to a vaccine.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> We could have found ourselves in a situation in which no vaccine could help?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> Yes, there are other viruses in this class against which it has not been possible to develop a vaccine. But we are able to produce an immune response to this coronavirus. That isn't just shown by the 95 percent efficacy, but also by the breadth and strength of the antibody and T-cell response. This multifaceted nature of the immunological response is vital when the virus mutates further. Think of it like this: The triggered immune response recognizes the so-called virus antigens at many different locations. Through a mutation, the virus can make some of these locations unrecognizable, but it can't change itself so fundamentally that it becomes invisible to the immune system.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> That means that you aren't worried about the much more contagious variant discovered in England?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> Not when it comes to the efficacy of the vaccine. Even if there are several mutations, the actual structure of the virus antigen is changed by less than 1 percent. We are performing tests to determine if our vaccine can also neutralize theses variations and will soon know more. What concerns me is that the mutation apparently arose in a patient with a suppressed immune system. The virus had complete freedom and months of time to optimize. That could mean that there will always be biotopes within which the virus can improve itself. We have to consider this problem in the medium term.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Would you be able to rapidly adapt your vaccine if the virus undergoes a significant mutation?</p>
</div>

<section data-area="contentbox">

</section>
<div>
<p><strong>Türeci:</strong> From a purely technological perspective, yes. We could simply replace the genetic information for the current virus antigen with the new, mutated version. Doing so would go quite quickly, it would take perhaps six weeks. The question is what the regulatory authorities would say. Would they accept that we fundamentally proved the efficacy and safety of our vaccine initially such that we could then use it against additional virus mutations?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> And what if they don't?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> Then we would have to undertake a new clinical study with tens of thousands of test subjects. But the authorities have significant experience with such adjustments, such as with the seasonal flu vaccine, for example, which is produced each year to neutralize new virus variations.</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> We have begun discussing the issue with the authorities.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Your study with 44,000 test subjects showed that the vaccine can prevent the development of COVID-19. But when will we know if it also prevents the transmission of the virus? That would stem the pandemic much more rapidly.</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> We will have relevant data by around the end of January – indirect data, at least. What we are able to investigate pretty well is the prevention of asymptomatic infections.</p>
</div>
<section>

</section>
<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> In other words, whether people are infectious even if they have no symptoms.</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> We can determine that indirectly via antibody tests. The data we have gathered thus far is encouraging, indicating that the vaccine can be effective here too.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Just as effective as it is against the outbreak of the illness?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> We'll see if it is 50, 60 or 70 percent. But you shouldn't forget that simply preventing an outbreak of the illness has an effect on the further development of the pandemic, because people who develop symptoms through an outbreak of the illness are contagious for longer.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> It also hasn't yet been determined for how long immunity lasts, whether after an infection or after receiving the vaccine. In a worst-case scenario, will we have to get vaccinated three times a year?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> First of all, we expect the immunity from the vaccine to last at least as long as natural immunity triggered by an infection. And we know that we increase the body's immune response with the second dose. That means that an even greater effect could be achieved with a third injection, perhaps one year later. Ultimately, this is all hardcore science. The data will show us what must be done.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Thus far, the vaccine has to be kept at a temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius during storage and transportation. It became apparent from the very beginning of the vaccination campaign that this can create problems. Will it be possible to adjust the serum in the near future such that it can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> The situation will remain unchanged for the next three months, but then we will likely be able to improve the specifications for transportation and storage. Our refined vaccine generation, which will be stable at much higher temperatures, could be available by late summer.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The best vaccine isn't particularly helpful if it isn't available in sufficient quantities. How many doses will you be able to deliver to Europe in the first half of the year?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> The precise numbers aren't intended for publication. We ask for your understanding.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The U.S. appears to be much better supplied. According to President-elect Joe Biden, up to 100 million Americans are to be vaccinated by April.</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> The Americans didn't just buy our vaccine, but also those from other companies, like Moderna.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The U.S. reserved 600 million doses from BioNTech way back in July.

January 4, 2021 | https://aonemd.me/posts/ruby-how-can-something-so-beautiful-become-so-ugly/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aonemd.me/posts/ruby-how-can-something-so-beautiful-become-so-ugly/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en">
          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: this is a rant.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Ruby since 2013 and for most of my study and career, Ruby was
may main, go-to programming language for almost everything.</p>
<p>Ruby’s syntax decisions make so much sense than most other languages. Although,
it’s often argued against making programming languages like natural languages,
Ruby programs flow like natural English.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>10</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>number</span><span>|</span>
  <span>print</span> <span>number</span> <span>*</span> <span>number</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Ruby is also very well suited to be a tool for teaching programming as well as
a very good pseudo-code language. I know Python has the lead in that role,
however; I do not think Python syntax would make much sense to beginners; it
would just raise so many unnecessary questions. Ruby on the other hand, does
not have that problem. It has other kinds of problems.</p>
<p>Although I have wanted to write about this for sometime, the main motivation
behind writing this post, finally, is the latest Ruby 3.0 release which was on
the 25th December, 2020. This release is considered the most important release
of Ruby so far and it’s been looked forward to for a long time. However, to me,
it is the most disappointing.</p>
<p>Well, my biggest pet peeve with Ruby is that it is bloated and is getting even
more bloated with every release by the addition of useless functions and
operators to match Rails' ActiveSupport utilities ¯\_( ͠° ͟ʖ ͠°)_/¯.</p>
<p>The straw that broke the camel’s back was when types were introduced in the 3.0
release. This feature is the one I personally was most looking forward to.
Adding static type analysis to the language is a great step to help find and
mitigate type related errors in Ruby programs.</p>
<p>However, unlike <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php" target="blank">PHP</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" target="blank">Python</a>
(Ruby’s most famous contenders) where types are built into the language
directly via type annotations, types in Ruby were added in the form of a new
language called <code>RBS</code>, meaning; one would have to maintain separate <code>.rbs</code>
files for type definitions. And now instead of writing the structure of a
program once, it has to be written twice!</p>
<p>Here’s a small example of how it looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span># messenger.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Messenger</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>medium</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@medium</span> <span>=</span> <span>medium</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>deliver</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>)</span>
    <span>"You have a new message: "</span> <span>+</span> <span>msg</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># messenger.rbs</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Messenger</span>
  <span>@medium</span><span>:</span> <span>Symbol</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>Symbol</span> <span>medium</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>void</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>deliver</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>msg</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Maintaining the same structure twice is not an easy task in large software
specially that static analysis is not enforced nor required by the language;
thus, making writing types an annoying afterthought. The issue is, I don’t see
why this is the chosen solution except that maybe to avoid rewriting Rails and
instead, add new files for type definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25535455" target="blank">Some
have already voiced their opinions on this matter</a>, however; I find it weird
that the Ruby community is not talking about this.</p>
<p>I know that no language is perfect and that each language has its use cases,
however; I see that Ruby is tiptoeing around Rails; thus, it is cornered in the
Rails web development area.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: here are parts of a comment I made replying to the backward
compatibility point and other points made:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I see the backward compatibility point of view and it’s valid and actually an
easy solution now. But my concern is maintaining software on the long run and
having to keep track of two points of truth.
</p><p>

And the talk about using IDEs
doesn’t make sense to me. I don’t need to use a specific tool to use the
language.
</p><p>

I write C more than Ruby nowadays and I use header files but in this case, this
is the best we’ve got, otherwise let’s use Go or Rust or whatever newer xD.
</p><p>

My point in the end is that Ruby deserves better tooling and more sane
choices.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to end this with a quote by /u/mashatg on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is not only about this particular decision but disconcerted development
and language’s direction in general. Incapability to learn from past mistakes
and get inspired from more successful.
</p><p>

It is so sad to watch how an original and elegant design with lot of
progressive ideas got butchered and ended up in current diffuse mess. It does
not look like an attitude to fight back declining relevance. It looks like
towel thrown into a ring and waiting referee to notice.</p></div>

B.1.1.7 was <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>first identified</span></a> in the UK in September and has recently accounted for more than half of new cases in the country.

Both show signs of being significantly more transmissible than non-variant Covid-19, and B.1.1.7 has already been identified in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>dozens of countries</span></a> around the world, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgz4z7/what-is-new-covid-strain-colorado-california"><span>including the U.S.</span></a> While scientists are relatively certain neither is more deadly, higher transmissibility could spell big trouble.</p>

<p>This week, The Factual looked at 24 articles from 21 sources to clarify just how potentially dangerous these new Covid variants are.</p>

<h4><strong>What We Think We Know</strong></h4>
<p>The importance of clarity and consistency in messaging was made clear early on in the pandemic, and many articles about these new variants seem to be forthright about the details of these new strains without engaging in fear-mongering or clickbait headlines. Here’s what we know reasonably well.</p>
<p><strong>Transmissibility: </strong>Both strains seem to demonstrate a greater level of transmissibility, meaning they spread easier from person to person. While the science is still being checked and triple-checked, the B.1.1.7 variant seems to be as much as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/health/coronavirus-uk-variant.html"><span>70% more transmissible</span></a> than the non-variant Covid-19. Less is known about B.1.351, but it seems<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2020/12/24/heres-where-3-new-strains-of-covid-19-have-traveled-so-far/?sh=368ac3f75139"><span> at least as dangerous</span></a> as B.1.1.7.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>This increased transmissibility is a result of the routine genetic mutation that viruses (and, indeed, all lifeforms) undergo during replication or reproduction. For both strains, mutations to the spike protein — the protein that allows the virus to attach to uninfected cells — seem to make the virus <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know"><span>better at infecting</span></a> human cells. Additionally, early evidence also seems to suggest that the new variants result in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-strains-what-scientists-know-about-coronavirus-variants-11609466017"><span>higher viral loads</span></a>, meaning infected individuals are carrying more of the virus.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p><strong>Deadliness: </strong>A clear further risk with new mutations of a virus is that they could become more deadly for those who are infected. Thankfully, for these new Covid-19 variants the increase in transmissibility <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/need-to-know-coronavirus-variant"><span>does not appear</span></a> to be accompanied by an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/14/how-a-new-covid-strain-may-have-spread-virus-in-south-of-england"><span>increase in the severity</span></a> of the disease.</p>
<p>However, the virus itself doesn’t need to cause more severe effects to still result in an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/need-to-know-coronavirus-variant"><span>increase in deaths</span></a>. For example, if the virus is much more transmissible, that can result in an exponential rise in cases and an inability to provide life-saving care to the cases that are severe. With hospitals around the U.S. already reaching maximum capacity, and non-Covid patients being <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-29/l-a-county-hospitals-at-the-breaking-point-turn-away-ambulances"><span>turned away</span></a>, an exponential increase in cases could very well lead to more Covid-related and non-Covid-related deaths.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation: </strong>Scientists are very clear that the nature of the threat from the virus <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/first-us-case-of-uk-sars-cov-2-variant-detected-68312"><span>has not fundamentally changed</span></a> in terms of how the virus spreads and what we can do to stop its spread. The virus is still a respiratory illness that spreads through the air and close contact with other people. This means that the mitigation strategies already in place still apply and, if anything, are more important than ever.</p>
<p>Countries are responding by enacting more stringent applications of measures that were largely already in place. In London and the southeastern UK, where B.1.1.7 really came to the fore, a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>stringent lockdown</span></a> has been enacted to halt the spread of the virus, reversing a decision to loosen restrictions for the holidays. South Africa has enacted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/south-africa-coronavirus-surge/2020/12/28/b4c8e17a-492c-11eb-97b6-4eb9f72ff46b_story.html"><span>strong measures</span></a> as well, including banning public gatherings and the sale of alcohol and making mask wearing in public mandatory. Abroad, many countries have halted flights from the UK and South Africa, reflecting that the danger for contagion is just too great.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Testing: </strong>A plausible risk is that the virus might mutate in such a way that leads positive cases to avoid identification, thereby necessitating new tests. Luckily, the mutations that the virus underwent <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>did not interfere</span></a> with our ability to identify positive cases with current testing technology. Though, for example, the virus did modify the spike protein that current tests look for—also known as the S gene—tests <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206522/coronavirus-test-variant-contagious-uk-gene"><span>look for a number of signals</span></a>, not just one. Scientists are now working to estimate the prevalence of B.1.1.7&nbsp; based on the number of positive tests without the S gene, cases known as S-gene dropouts.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p><strong>Vaccines: </strong>Perhaps the biggest question on everyone’s minds is whether the stream of newly-approved vaccines will retain effecitveness against these new variants. While testing is still underway, there is <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>no evidence</span></a> to suggest that the vaccines will see any significant change in efficacy. Mutations are typically subtle and are unlikely to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-strains-what-scientists-know-about-coronavirus-variants-11609466017"><span>drastically alter</span></a> the biology of the virus in a short period of time, and the vaccines are designed to attack the virus from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/14/how-a-new-covid-strain-may-have-spread-virus-in-south-of-england"><span>several angles</span></a>, meaning that the “broad immune response…that targets several areas of the spike protein” will continue to work.&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4>The Big "Ifs"</h4>
<p>Much of what we know about the variants, beyond the likely increase in transmissibility, is none too alarming on the surface. However, there are some factors that we aren’t totally sure of just yet that could create big problems.</p>
<p><strong>Spread:</strong> These new variants show yet another way pandemic response has fallen short. Understanding the genetic variations in the virus requires routine genetic sequencing to identify new strains, but very few countries have been investing the resources to do so. While the UK invested early on to sequence cases to track the genetic variations, a CDC strain surveillance team in the U.S. was set up <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/31/with-limited-surveillance-of-covid-19-variant-its-deja-vu-all-over-again/"><span>only in November</span></a>, and the CDC had only sequenced 51,000 samples by the end of 2020, out of nearly 20 million cases. This not only means that we have no idea how widespread the B.1.1.7 variant is in the U.S., it means that we may have our own distinct variants <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160743/us-already-covid-variant-wouldnt-know?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=EB_TNR&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1608662430"><span>without even knowing</span></a>.</p>
<p>From the paltry amount of genetic sequencing that we do undertake in the U.S., we know for sure that B.1.1.7 is in California, Florida, and Colorado, but the circumstances of those cases is worrying. All three instances involve <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>no significant travel history</span></a>, meaning that the variant is already in the U.S. and spreading via community transmission. The optimistic interpretation of this is that there may be a few, isolated pockets of this variant in the U.S. The pessimistic view, however, is that the U.S. is on the cusp, and well past the point of return, of a fast-moving outbreak that will dwarf what we’ve seen so far, absent strong response measures. The UK saw the B.1.1.7 variant appear in September but account for more than <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/health/new-covid-strain-in-us/"><span>60% of cases</span></a> in London just months later, accompanied by the worst outbreak yet. The same could be underway in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Susceptibility: </strong>One of the reprieves of Covid-19 has been that children are relatively less susceptible to infection. This has enabled some schooling to proceed under modified protocols, even while workplaces have been shut and public gatherings disbanded. However, the emergence of the new variants has corresponded with increases in rates of infection and severe cases among <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>children and young adults</span></a>. While some of this can likely be explained by schools remaining open and young people being likely to disregard social distancing guidance, for example, this doesn’t seem to be the whole story. Scientific testing continues, but many worry that the B.1.1.7 variant can actually <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-mutant-children-infection-neil-ferguson-b1777211.html"><span>more easily infect</span></a> young people than non-variant Covid-19, which may mean some previously effective Covid mitigation strategies will need to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/30/new-covid-strain-schools/"><span>reconsidered</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Exponential Risk:</strong> Some have pointed out that a significantly more transmissible virus is actually much <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/?utm_term=2020-12-31T18%3A13%3A39&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_source=facebook"><span>more worrisome</span></a> than a virus that just leads to more severe cases. In the latter instance, the virus still only affects the same number of people, though it kills more of them, but with the former, many, many times more people <a href="https://reason.com/2020/12/28/the-more-transmissible-u-k-covid-19-variant-could-make-the-pandemic-a-lot-worse/"><span>may become infected</span></a>—and potentially die.</p>
<p>“Kucharski compares a 50 percent increase in virus lethality to a 50 percent increase in virus transmissibility. Take a virus reproduction rate of about 1.1 and an infection fatality risk of 0.8 percent and imagine 10,000 active infections—a plausible scenario for many European cities, as Kucharski notes. As things stand, with those numbers, we’d expect 129 deaths in a month. If the fatality rate increased by 50 percent, that would lead to 193 deaths. In contrast, a 50 percent increase in transmissibility would lead to a whopping 978 deaths in just one month—assuming, in both scenarios, a six-day infection-generation time.” - Zeynep Tufekci, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/?utm_term=2020-12-31T18%3A13%3A39&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_source=facebook"><span>The Atlantic</span></a></p>
<p>But the risks don’t end there. The problem with an exponential increase in the number of cases, and indeed with the idea of letting the virus run its course through a population in the hopes of achieving herd immunity, is that this creates that many new opportunities for the virus to mutate further. This could lead to further changes in transmissibility, new variants that allow for reinfection, a more deadly combination of both transmissibility and severity, or even variants that, at some point, entirely undermine our vaccine efforts.</p>
<div><p>Any such change could have big positive or negative ramifications for the trajectory of the virus. Epidemics like H1N1 and various strains of Ebola proved to be too deadly to be truly disastrous on a global scale: they tended to kill their carriers at a rate that limits the ability of the virus to spread to new hosts. But those viruses may have been just a mutation away from a much more dangerous, if less lethal, form. Covid-19 may also be just a few mutations away from such a seismic shift, for better or for worse. <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160743/us-already-covid-variant-wouldnt-know?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=EB_TNR&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1608662430"><span>Such mutations</span></a> are a “once-in-a-million event,” but “but one-in-a-million events may become a lot more common when you have a million new cases every four days, as the U.S. now does.”</p></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two years ago, I did something that I’d never done in my career before- I left a job
(at <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>) only a few months after starting it. In this post, I want to explain
what happened and what I learned from the experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<h4 id="the-job-switch">The job switch</h4>

<p>Back in the spring of 2019, I decided to leave <a href="https://www.stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I’d
been a software engineer for about a year and a half. The full details are best left
to a separate post, but at a high level I just wasn’t very happy with my personal situation; the
work I was doing in compute infrastructure had the unfortunate combination of being both
overly stressful and underappreciated. At the same time, I felt like my career prospects
were limited because the upper rungs of Stripe’s engineering individual contributor (IC) ladder put
a lot of emphasis on cross-team coordination and other, managerial-like activities that I didn’t
enjoy and felt I wasn’t very good at.</p>

<p>Given how hot the job market was at the time and the number of other, seemingly more interesting
opportunities available, I figured that I had nothing to lose by interviewing elsewhere.</p>

<p>After a few weekends of furiously-paced <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/master-coding-interviews">Leetcoding</a>, I was ready.
Unlike my previous job searches, there wasn’t any particular company that I was aspiring
to get into; instead, I just went through my <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/six-years-of-emails">backlog of recruiting emails</a>
and wrote back to a bunch that looked interesting. Among the messages I responded to was one
about <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>, an autonomous vehicle startup that was attempting to do driverless
grocery delivery.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, I went through the full recruitment slog, starting with lots of
recruiter phone calls, then following up with technical phone screens for a subset of
those, then doing onsite interviews for a subset of those. In the end, I got offers from seven
places, including Nuro.</p>

<p>During the process, I didn’t fall in love with any of the options. But, there
was something that made me feel more optimistic about Nuro than the other choices. Being a
hardware-oriented, robotics company, it was just really different from all of my previous employers,
and, after years of feeling stuck in my career, maybe different was good.</p>

<p>The company was super secretive about its technology; I wasn’t allowed to tour the office, for
instance, because they had hardware prototypes lying around that only employees were allowed to
see. I also wasn’t invited to ride along in their test cars, which would have been both fun and
informative. The external signs were good, though- they had raised a billion dollars from Softbank
and others, and the employee reviews on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor</a> were gushing.</p>

<p>Aside from being in a somewhat different space than my previous employers, another potential
downside was the commute. Stripe and my three jobs before that were all within a 15 minute walk
of my apartment in San Francisco. Nuro’s office was 40 miles away in Mountain View, which was
more than an hour each way by train. But, I had done longer commutes earlier in my career and figured
that I could handle it.</p>

<p>In the end, I went with my impulses and signed the offer. I had my last day at Stripe, took a short
vacation, and then showed up at the Nuro office, brimming with optimism, for my first day two weeks
later.</p>

<h4 id="realizing-my-mistake">Realizing my mistake</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, that optimism lasted for a grand total of 2 days. By Wednesday of my first week,
as I was riding the train home, I realized that I had made a mistake. My colleagues were
friendly and smart, and the company was doing interesting things, but the job just felt like a
lifestyle downgrade to me.</p>

<p>At Stripe and each of my jobs before that, I had had a short commute to a beautiful office, and
got to experience the instant gratification associated with developing purely software-based
products. Now, I was stuck taking a crowded train to a dark office littered with hardware parts,
working on a product that would take many years to reach mass-market adoption due to pesky little
things like manufacturing and road safety.</p>

<p>I had left Stripe seeking an upgrade, but instead I got a downgrade. And, while minor improvements
were possible, it seemed unlikely that things would completely change for the better in the near
term.</p>

<h4 id="getting-back-on-track">Getting back on track</h4>

<p>At this point, I had three choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quit immediately</li>
  <li>Start exploring new opportunities but don’t quit until something better is lined up</li>
  <li>Stick it out for at least a year</li>
</ol>

<p>My first instinct was to take option 1 and just go back to Stripe. When I reached out to my HR
contact, though, I found out that I’d have to go through team matching again and also get a new
offer; even though I’d left on good terms less than a month before, I couldn’t just revert back to
my previous position and pay. This was disappointing, but after giving it a little more thought,
I figured it was for the best because I had left Stripe for specific reasons; going back
to my old job wouldn’t fix those or make me feel better about them.</p>

<p>Another variant of option 1 would be to quit and take one of the other offers I had gotten
during my search. But, I had already rejected those for what I thought were good reasons,
so this didn’t feel like the best way out.</p>

<p>Option 3 was the one that would look the least bad from a resume perspective, and this seems to be
what a lot of people in tech do when they don’t like a job. But, life is short, I was really feeling
unhappy with the choice I had made, and I figured it wasn’t really fair to my colleagues at Nuro to
stick in a job that my heart wasn’t in.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I decided that option 2 was the best fit for me. I continued at Nuro and did my best
to get up-to-speed and to contribute to my team’s work, but at the same time jumped right back
into the job market. In addition to keeping things open with Stripe, I
<a href="https://yolken.net/blog/triplebyte-review">tried Triplebyte</a>, responded to more recruiter emails, and also
reached out to some former colleagues about the companies they were now at.</p>

<p>I then went through the whole recruitment process with a new set of companies. This time,
though, I was a lot pickier about where I interviewed (nothing in hardware or with long commutes!);
after a few weeks, I had four new choices including an updated offer from Stripe. After
a good amount of due diligence, significantly more than I had done in my previous search, I
decided to go to <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>.</p>

<p>When I put in my notice at Nuro, people were surprised that I was leaving so soon, but ultimately
were understanding. I left, took a short vacation, and then started at Segment. Thankfully,
the new job was a much better fit for me, and I’m much happier now!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<h4 id="do-your-due-diligence">Do your due diligence</h4>

<p>Switching jobs is a big deal, and it shouldn’t be done impulsively. Ideally, your due
diligence before signing a new offer should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Meeting with the team you’ll be working with in a low-stress, non-interview setting</li>
  <li>Touring the office and understanding what your specific workspace will be like</li>
  <li>Trying out the commute for a few days (if it’s significantly different than your current one)</li>
  <li>Trying out any new languages/technologies that you’ll be using on the job</li>
  <li>Getting hands-on demos of the company’s products (if they’re not freely accessible to consumers
  already)</li>
  <li>Seeing a summary of the company’s income and expenses over time (if not public)</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning about these things doesn’t guarantee that you’ll be happy in your new job, but it
at least reduces the risk of any unexpected surprises after you start.</p>

<h4 id="its-ok-to-quit-after-a-few-weeks-just-dont-make-it-a-pattern">It’s ok to quit after a few weeks (just don’t make it a pattern)</h4>

<p>When I started my second job search, I was worried that the short
tenure in the job I was trying to leave would be a turn-off to perspective employers. In reality,
however, it wasn’t a big deal- people asked about it, but seemed satisfied with my 20 second
summary and then moved on to other things.</p>

<p>The sense I get is that you’re allowed to quit a new job once in your career without any
repercussions. If you do it multiple times, however, then recruiters and hiring managers might
have second thoughts about interviewing you without strong internal references or some other signal
that you’ll be a good employee.</p>

<h4 id="switch-teams-before-quitting">Switch teams before quitting</h4>

<p>As I noted in a <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/leaving-a-job">previous post</a>, switching teams is a lot easier than
switching jobs. I didn’t do this before I left Stripe because there weren’t any other teams that I
was super enthusiastic about at the time. But, in retrospect, I probably should have given this a
try before quitting.</p>

<p>Even if the new team hadn’t been a perfect fit, it would have at least bought some time and given
me some additional experience that could help in future work. This is what I did at Google
and Airbnb, and in both cases the “second team” was what really opened up new opportunities for me.</p>

		<p>
		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-sources.png" alt="Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, showing a lot of inlined unreadable scripts">
			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from athe REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can I minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

Widely utilized services like Amazon API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, CloudFormation, Autoscaling, Athena and others were affected.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Our beloved products from Adobe, Roku, Spotify, and Flickr went down together with AWS. Our hearts go out to these companies and their users.</p>
<p>"So many services being impacted simultaneously may be indicative of a large software rollout, or potentially localized underlying hardware or network issues,” said Leon Kuperman, CTO and Co-Founder at CAST AI. “If it’s a software issue, it’s unusual that AWS would have chosen US-East as a canary region. US-East (Virginia) represents the largest AWS region and largest customer footprint, which would put it near last, if not last on the rollout schedule."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public-clouds are a godsend for tech companies. Migration to cloud allows startups and enterprises to skip over unnecessary investments in on-premise data centers and focus on what matters the most: develop products that people love, scale fast, and always be accessible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, public cloud providers like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform are eager to lock in companies to use their services exclusively. When you rely on one vendor, you go down when that vendor fails.</p>
<p>Today, AWS showed the true cost of putting all your eggs in one basket. It amplified the need for companies to have a multi-cloud disaster recovery and fail-over strategy. This strategy would still allow for a possibility of some cloud providers to go down, but it would also ensure that a cloud going down would not mean downtime for your users.</p>
<p>“A cloud failure should not become a disaster. Never again.” said Laurent Gil, CPO and Co-Founder at CAST AI. “You can rest easy knowing that your infrastructure is never down.”</p>
<div><p>Imagine that you show up to your office one day and your office building is gone. That’s what happens when cloud providers like AWS go down. All you are left with is the question “Why?“. With CAST AI you don’t need to wonder. By running your application on multi cloud, CAST AI automatically shifts your resources to Azure or Google Cloud when AWS has troubles.</p><p>Explore <a href="https://cast.ai/" rel="noopener">CAST AI here.</a></p></div></span>

And in November, China introduced regulations that halted what would have been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-offered-parts-ant-group-to-china-2020-12" rel="nofollow">a massive initial public offering for Ant Group</a>, Ma's fintech company.</p><p>
The new rules came weeks after Ma <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-financial-regulations-ant-group-alibaba-2020-10" rel="nofollow">criticized China's financial regulatory system</a> at a conference in Shanghai. Ma reportedly dismissed the global financial regulations used by China as "an old people's club" and said that "we can't use yesterday's methods to regulate the future."</p><p>
Blair Silverberg, the CEO of the debt-financing startup Capital, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-happened-ant-group-ipo-jack-ma-alipay-2020-11" rel="nofollow">told Business Insider's Katie Canales in November</a> that the regulations were introduced "so the government can assert its supremacy over </p><keyword keytype="person" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Jack-Ma" actualkeyword="Jack Ma">Jack Ma</keyword><p>."
</p><p data-pos="12">In November, Ma was replaced as a judge on the African talent show he founded, "Africa's Business Heroes," <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/a91dfeae-da1e-4348-8212-bbfbe94d93bd" rel="nofollow">the Financial Times reported</a>. The talent show did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment, but an Alibaba representative said Ma could no longer be on the judging panel for the show's finale, which was filmed in November but has not yet been released," due to a scheduling conflict."</p><p>
"We do not have anything to add beyond that," the representative said in response to questions about Ma's whereabouts.</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr>
<p data-pos="16">Ma <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-jack-ma-stepping-down-successor-may-face-challenges-2019-9" rel="nofollow">stepped down as Alibaba's chairman</a> in 2019.</p>

Until recently, Ma was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-antitrust-jack-ma-ant-group-beijing-regulators-2020-12" rel="nofollow">China's richest man</a>, with a fortune of more than $60 billion. But Ma's net worth has <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jack-ma-net-worth-rich-list-falls-china-alibaba-ant-2020-12-1029925654" rel="nofollow">taken a $12 billion hit</a> over the past two months as China has tightened the rules for the fintech industry. Ma is now worth $50.6 billion, making him the fourth-richest person in China, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=BLKWHazc" rel="nofollow">according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>.
As speculation about Ma's whereabouts spread, a prediction about Ma from another billionaire Chinese businessman recirculated on social media.</p>
<p data-pos="24">In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cwXifDaCjE&amp;t=702s%3Futm_source%3DOrganic&amp;utm_medium=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=43718_YTEDGE_KA_SMT_RV_W1_TSNAP_RV_W1_TSNAP" rel="nofollow">a video interview in August 2019</a>, Guo Wengui, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/magazine/the-mystery-of-the-exiled-billionaire-whistleblower.html" rel="nofollow">who fled China as a fugitive in 2014</a> and has described himself as a whistleblower exposing corruption in the country, said Ma would likely end up in jail or dead in the next year because China wanted to "take back" Ma's lucrative Ant Group.</p>
<p data-pos="26">Last week, the Chinese government ordered Ant Group, which owns Alipay, China's largest digital-payment platform, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/28/china-orders-alibaba-founder-jack-ma-break-up-fintech-ant" rel="nofollow">to scale back its operations</a> after expressing concerns that its corporate governance was "not sound."</p><p>
A representative for Ant Group did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment for this story.</p>

<blockquote>Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I donâ€™t know which half.</blockquote>

<p>Knowing where your customers come from is one of (if not the most) important drivers for business strategy. To be a successful digital company it's paramount that you get the most bang for your buck when it comes to ad spending. However, even the most strategic businesses are relying entirely on platform level reporting to track the return of their marketing spend. While this is definitely convenient, it may often be inaccurate and lead to a glut of spending in the wrong places. This spending can ruin early level businesses, and even as your business grows, it can have a severe impact on large businesses as well.</p>


<h3>Case Study: Uber's Ad Spending.</h3>

<p>Uber <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nandoodles/status/1345774768746852353">disclosed</a> that they have been defrauded out of <strong>100 Million</strong> or <strong>2/3</strong> of their overall ad spend. Their Head of Acquisition discovered this fraud by de-activating roughly 10% of their total ad budget in 2019. To his surprise, pausing roughly <strong>15 million dollars</strong> of ad spend had <strong>zero</strong> impact on their ridership.</p>

<p>After digging into this phenomenon it became clear that their ad vendors were making up the numbers they had been reporting. For example, one ad network launched "battery saver" style apps in the Google Play Store, which gave them root access to your phone. Whenever you typed "Uber" into Google Play it fired a click event to the ad at the top of the screen to make it appear as though you clicked the advertisement which would give them attribution for the entirely unattributable action.</p>

<blockquote>Uber disclosed that they have been defrauded out of <strong>100 Million</strong> or <strong>2/3</strong> of their overall ad spend.</blockquote>

<p>Uber then continued to deactivate their advertising partners to measure impact. One by one they went through each advertising partner and, in the end, it became clear that <strong>2/3</strong> of their marketing budget was fraudulent. These relationships were terminated resulting in savings of over <strong>100 million dollars</strong> for the tech behemoth.</p>

<h3>So What Can You Do?</h3>

<p>Well it's pretty simple, just don't take their word for it. Not all advertisers are bad, but when you let them grade their own tests, don't be surprised when they all get A's.</p>

<h3>How To Collect Attribution Data Directly From Your Customers</h3>

<p>Ask them using a Zigpoll on-site attribution survey. Click the button below to preview a pre-built <a href="https://www.zigpoll.com/blog/attribution-survey" target="_blank">attribution survey</a> that you can add anywhere on your website and tailor specifically to your site's needs.</p>



<p>Once you have the poll ready to go, you just need to know when to ask your customers. This part of the funnel will vary from business to business, but here are some ideas for a few different types.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>eCommerce</strong>: Ask about attribution as part of your post purchase survey.</li>
  <li><strong>Blogs/Content</strong>: Ask about attribution when the user lands on your page for the first time.</li>
  <li><strong>Software</strong>: Ask about attribution right after a user creates an account on your platform.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Not all advertisers are bad, but when you let them grade their own tests, don't be surprised when they all get A's.</blockquote>

<p>Asking your customers directly at a key point in your conversion funnel will ensure that you know what marketing tools are the most effective as well as which ones are falling short of their promises. You can then use this data to be more strategic about your ad spending to convert more customers and grow your business.</p>

<p>I both love and <a href="https://twitter.com/internetofshit">hate</a> the idea of "smart" devices in my home. It's tough to balance the convenience of being able to turn lights on and off automatically, and adjust thermostats with my phone, with the risk that all of my devices are <a href="https://www.ckd3.com/blog/2019/6/6/attack-of-the-light-bulbs">doing</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-25780908">evil</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)">things</a> to my fellow Internet citizens. But, I think I've landed on a compromise that works.</p>
<p>I've had Internet-connected devices for a long time now. I've even <a href="https://www.uchobby.com/index.php/2007/10/08/arduino-beer-thermostat/">built devices</a> that can go online. At some point a year or two ago, I realized that I could <em>do better</em> than what I had. Here's a loose list of requirements I made up for my own "<abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr>" setup at home:</p>
<ul>
<li>works locally as a primary objective</li>
<li>works when my Internet connection is down or slow</li>
<li>avoids phoning home to the vendor's (or worse: a third party's) API or service</li>
<li>can be fully firewalled off from the actual Internet, ideally through a physical limitation</li>
<li>isn't locked up in a proprietary platform that will either become expensive, limited, or will cease to exist when it's no longer profitable</li>
</ul>
<p>My setup isn't perfect; it doesn't fully meet all of these criteria, but it's close, and it's been working well for me.</p>
<p>At the core of my home IoT network is a device called <a href="https://hubitat.com/">Hubitat Elevation</a>. It works as a bridge between the actual Internet, and my devices which are actually <em>incapable</em> (for the most part) of connecting to the Internet directly. My devices, which range from thermostats, to lights, to motion sensors, to switchable outlets, and more, use either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee">Zigbee</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave">Z-Wave</a> to communicate with each other (they form repeating mesh networks automatically) and with the hub. Again, they don't have a connection to my WiFi or my LAN, except through the hub, because they're physically incapable of connecting to my local network (they don't have ethernet ports, nor do they have WiFi radios). The hub brokers all of these connections and helps me control and automate these devices.</p>
<p>The hub—the Hubitat Elevation—is <a href="https://hubitat.com/products">fairly inexpensive</a>, and is not fully "open" (as I'd like), but has good integration abilities, is well-maintained, is <a href="https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=List_of_Compatible_Devices">compatible with many devices</a> (many of them are devices compatible with the more-proprietary but similar <a href="https://www.smartthings.com/">SmartThings</a> hub), and has an active community of people answering questions, coming up with new ideas, and maintaining add-ons. These add-ons are written in Groovy, which I hadn't really used in earnest before working with the Hubitat, but you can write and modify them to suit your needs.</p>
<p>The hub itself is mostly controlled through a web UI, which I'll admit is <em>clunky</em>, or through a mobile app. The mobile app adds capabilities like geo-fencing, presence, and notifications. The hub can also be connected to other devices; I have mine connected to my Echo, for example, so I can say "Alexa turn off the kitchen lights."</p>
<p>The devices themselves are either mains-powered (such as my Hue lightbulbs, baseboard thermostats, and switching outlets), or are battery powered (such as motion sensors, door contact switches, and buttons). Many of these devices also passively measure things like local temperature, and relay this data, along with battery health to the hub.</p>
<p>I'm going to get into some examples of how I have things set up, here, though not a full getting-started tutorial, but first I wanted to mention a few things that were not immediately obvious to me, and will get you off on the right foot, if you choose to follow a similar path to mine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third-party hub apps are a bit weird in their structure (there are usually parent and child apps), and keeping them up to date can be a pain. Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/dcmeglio/hubitat-packagemanager">Hubitat Package Manager</a> exists, and many add-ons can be maintained through this useful tool.</li>
<li>There's a built-in app called "Maker API" which provides a REST interface to your various devices, which technically goes against one of my loose requirements above, but I have it limited to the LAN, and authenticating, and this feels like a fair trade-off to me for when I want to use this kind of connection.</li>
<li>There's an app that will send measured data to <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>, which is a timeseries database that I have running locally on my SAN (as a Docker container on my Synology DSM), and it works well as a data source for <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> (the graphs in this post come from Grafana). </li>
</ul>
<h3>Programmable Thermostats</h3>
<p>My house is heated primarily through a centralized heat pump (which also provides cooling in the summer), but many rooms have their own baseboard heaters + independent thermostats. Before automation, these thermostats were either completely manual, or had a hard-to-manage on-device scheduling function.</p>
<p>I replaced many of these thermostats with connected versions. My main heat pump's thermostat (low voltage) is the <a href="https://www.honeywellhome.com/us/en/products/air/thermostats/programmable-thermostats/t6-pro-z-wave-thermostat-th6320zw2003-u/">Honeywell T6 Pro Z-Wave</a>, and my baseboard heaters (line voltage) are now controlled with <a href="https://www.sinopetech.com/en/product/smart-thermostat-for-electric-heating-3000-w-zigbee/">Zigbee thermostats from Sinopé</a>.</p>
<p>Managing these through the web app is much better than the very limited UI available on programmable thermostats, directly. The Hubitat has a built-in app called "Thermostat Scheduler." Here's my office, for example (I don't like cold mornings (-: ):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/XFsUuc2l.png"></p>
<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>An often-touted benefit of IoT is lighting automation, and I have several lights I control with my setup. Much of this is through cooperation with the Hue bridge, which I do still have on my network, but I could remove at some point, since the bulbs speak Zigbee. The connected lights that are not Hue bulbs are mostly controlled by Leviton Decora <a href="https://www.leviton.com/en/products/dz6hd-1bz">dimmers</a>, <a href="https://www.leviton.com/en/products/dz15s-1bz">switches</a>, and optional <a href="https://www.leviton.com/en/products/dd00r-dlz">dimmer remotes</a> for 3-way circuits. Most of this is boring/routine stuff such as "turn on the outdoor lighting switch at dusk and off at midnight," configured on the hub with the "Simple Automation Rules" app, but I have a couple more interesting applications.</p>
<h3>Countertop</h3>
<p>My kitchen counter is long down one side—a "galley" style. There's under-cabinet countertop lighting the whole length of the counter, but it's split into two separate switched/dimmed circuits of LED fixtures—one to the left of the sink and one to the right. I have these set to turn on in the morning and off at night. It's kind of annoying that there are two dimmers that work independently, though, and I find it aesthetically displeasing when half of the kitchen is lit up bright and the other half is dim.</p>
<p>Automation to the rescue, though. I found an app called <a href="https://github.com/joelwetzel/Hubitat-Switch-Bindings">Switch Bindings</a> that allows me to gang these two dimmers together. Now, when I adjust the one on the left, the dimmer on the right matches the new brightness, and vice versa. A mild convenience, but it sure is nice to be able to effectively rewire these circuits in software.</p>
<h3>Cellar</h3>
<p>I have an extensive beer cellar that I keep cool and dark most of the time. I found myself sometimes forgetting to turn off the lights next to the bottles, and—as someone who is highly sensitive to mercaptans/thiols (products of lightstuck beers, a "skunky" smell/fault)—I don't want my beer to see any more light than is necessary.</p>
<p>With my setup, I can have the outlet that my shelf lighting is plugged into turn on and off when the door is opened or closed. There's also a useful temperature sensor and moisture sensor on the floor so I can know quickly if the floor drain backs up, or if a bottle somehow breaks/leaks enough for the sensor to notice, via the notification system, and keep track of cellar temperature over time.</p>
<p><img alt="these lights turn on and off when the door is opened and closed, respectively" src="https://files.scoat.es/AiBX0vGS.png"></p>
<p>I also receive an alert on my phone when the door is opened/closed, which is increasingly useful as the kids get older.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/wf4WMVJk.png"></p>
<h3>Foyer</h3>
<p>Our house has an addition built onto the front, and there's an entrance room that is kind of separated off from the rest of the living space. The lighting in here has different needs from elsewhere because of this. Wouldn't it be nice if the lights in here could automatically turn on when they need to?</p>
<p>Thanks to Simple Automation Rules (the built-in app), and a combination of the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/sensors/samsung-smartthings-motion-sensor-2018-gp-u999sjvlbaa/">SmartThings motion sensor</a> and the <a href="https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-darksky-net-weather-driver-no-pws-required/22699">DarkSky Device Driver</a> (which will need to be replaced at some point, but it still works for now), I can have the lights in there—in addition to being manually controllable from the switch panels—turn on when there's motion, but <em>only if</em> it's dark enough outside for this to be needed. The lights will turn themselves off when there's no more motion.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/yrVmcf3t.png"></p>
<h3>Ice Melting</h3>
<p>We have a fence gate that we keep closed most of the time so <a href="https://stanleydog.com/">Stanley</a> can safely hang out in our backyard. We need to use it occasionally, and during the winter this poses a problem because that side of the house has a bit of water runoff that is not normally a big deal, but in the winter, it sometimes gets dammed up by the surrounding snow/ice and freezes, making the gate impossible to open.</p>
<p>In past winters, I've used ice melting chemicals to help free the gate, but it's a pain to keep these on hand, and they corrode the fence posts where the powder coating has chipped off. Plus, it takes time for the melting to <em>work</em> and bags of this stuff are sometimes hard to find (cost aside).</p>
<p>This year, I invested in a <a href="https://kemf.ca/product-category/hotflake/">snow melting mat</a>. Electricity is relatively cheap here in Quebec, thanks to our extensive Hydro-Electric investment, but it's still wasteful to run this thing when it's not needed (arguably still less wasteful than bag after bag of ice melter). I'm still tweaking the settings on this one, but I have the mat turn on when the temperature drops and off when the ambient temperature is warmer. It's working great so far:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/Z2o6v4uM.png"></p>
<h3>Desk foot-warming mat</h3>
<p>My office is in the back corner of our house. The old part. I suspect it's poorly insulated, and the floor gets especially cold. I bought a warming mat on which to rest my feet (similar to <a href="https://www.cozyproducts.com/products/foot-warmer-2">this one</a>). It doesn't need to be on all of the time, but I do like to be able call for heat on demand, and have it turn itself off after a few minutes.</p>
<p>I have the mat plugged into a switchable outlet. In the hub, I have rules set up to turn this mat on when I press a <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/buttons/samsung-smartthings-button-gp-u999sjvleaa/">button</a> on my desk. The mat turns itself off after 15 minutes, thanks to a second rule in the built-in app "Rule Machine". Warm toes!</p>
<p>When I first set this up, I found myself wondering if the mat was …</p></div></div></div>

	<div>
		
<p>These days, in the covid world we live in we have multiple videoconferences every day, with colleagues, family, friends… The average number of people attending has grown, and when I was in a call some time ago, I wondered, what would be the “optimal” way of splitting the videconference application window among the people in the call? What would be the definition of “optimal”? And, in how many ways could the space be split?, as sometimes you might prefer, for instance, one where space is shared equally or one where the current speaker has predominance.</p>



<p>This intrigued me, and I started some research to try to find answers to these questions. I started with the assumption that the videoconference application owns a window on the screen, which is a rectangle (we will call it the bounding rectangle), and we want to divide it in \(N\) different rectangles, being \(N\) the number of people in the call. We can define different criteria for optimizing like, say, dividing equally the window area among the callers. However, for that we need to define mathematically the dividing rectangles, and here is where the first difficulty arises, as the mathematical description changes depending on how you split the window. For instance, two of the ways of dividing the bounding rectangle (let’s call that “rectangulation”) for \(N=3\) are as displayed:</p>



<div><div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/N3.svg" alt="" width="755" height="355"><figcaption>Figure 1 – two possible ways of dividing a rectangle in three</figcaption></figure>




</div></div>



<p>Here we assign a width and a height to each rectangle. Note that optimizing means assigning values to these \(w_i\) and \(h_i\) to fulfill the optimizations criteria, which is like moving the “walls” between rectangles. The height \(h\) and width \(w\) of the bounding rectangle are considered fixed. In each rectangulation, it is possible to expose the implicit restrictions by equations that relate widths and heights of the different rectangles. For the first one in the image, the equations are:</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>w_1 &amp; = &amp; w_3 \\<br>h_1+h_3 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1+h_3 &amp; = &amp; h_2 \\<br> \end{array}$$</p>



<p>For the second one:</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2+w_3 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h_2 \\<br>h_2 &amp; = &amp; h_3<br>\end{array}$$</p>



<p>When we optimize we need to take into account these restrictions, which implies that for each rectangulation we have a different optimization problem with different solutions due to having different restrictions/equations in each case. The conclusion is that we need to solve the optimization problem for all possible rectangulations for a given \(N\), and then compare the different optimal values to select the best one. In summary, the steps we need to follow are</p>



<ol><li>Find all possible rectangulations for \(N\) callers</li><li>Decide an optimization criteria</li><li>Solve the optimization problem for all rectangulations, finding the best sizes for each way of splitting the bounding rectangle</li><li> Choose the best rectangulation by finding out which of them has the optimal solution that fulfills better the optimization criteria</li></ol>



<p>In the following sections we will go through each of these steps. I have developed some python code that implements the algorithms and that includes some unit tests that drive them and will be mentioned in different parts of the article. You can find it in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations" target="_blank">github</a>. If on an Ubuntu system, you can install dependencies and clone the repository from the command line with:</p>



<p><code>$ sudo apt install python3-pip</code><br><code>$ pip3 install numpy matplotlib scipy sympy</code><br><code>$ git clone https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations</code></p>



<p>N.B. In the mathematical expressions we use one-based indexes but, for practical reasons, the code uses zero-based indexes.</p>



<h2>Rectangulating a rectangle</h2>



<p>There is quite a bit of mathematical literature on the topic of rectangulations, motivated by applications like placing elements in integrated circuits. Depending on how you define them there can be more or less ways to “rectangulate” a rectangle. We want to take into account all possible rectangulations, but at the same time we need to be careful to avoid duplications. In our framework, a single rectangulation is one that can represent all rectangle sets that can fulfill a given set of equations as those shown at the beginning. Practically, that means that we can slide segments in the rectangulation (without changing the vertical or horizontal orientation) along the limiting segments, as that will not change the relationship that the equations describe. Each of these rectangulations is a class of equivalence of all possible rectangle sets described by a set of equations, and we need to find each of them and then find the optimal rectangles sizes for them, so we cover all possibilities. It turns out that each of these equivalence classes can be represented by what is called in the literature mosaic floorplans or diagonal rectangulations.</p>



<p>How to obtain these rectangulations? I will follow (mostly) the method explained in <span id="easy-footnote-1-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-558" title="S. Law, N. Reading, The Hopf algebra of diagonal rectangulations, Preprint, 2010. <a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2118&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>arXiv:1011.2118</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span>. First, we create a matrix of size \(N\)x\(N\), which conceptually splits the bounding rectangle in cells. We will call it the rectangulation matrix. We number the rectangles consecutively and put the numbers in the matrix diagonal. Then, we choose a permutation (any can do) for the numbers. This permutation determines how the rectangulation will look like. Finally, we follow the order in the permutation to create the rectangles, one by one. To build each rectangle, the rules are</p>



<ol><li> Start from the free cell as left and bottom as possible that can include the cell with the rectangle number</li><li>Do not include cells with numbers for other rectangles</li><li>Make it as big as possible, with the restriction that it must not surpass the right of the rectangle below it and it must not surpass the top of the rectangle to its left. The bottom and left walls of the bounding rectangle are considered bottom and left rectangles for rectangles touching them. </li></ol>



<p>This defines a map between permutations and diagonal rectangulations that we will call \(\rho\). Figure 2 illustrates this procedure for the rectangulation \(\rho(4,1,3,5,2)\).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="425" height="656" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rectangulation.svg" alt=""><figcaption>Figure 2 – rectangulation for \(\rho(4,1,3,5,2)\)</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is implemented in the <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L48" target="_blank">do_diagonal_rectangulation()</a></code> function. There is a test to create random rectangulations that can be run with</p>



<p><code>$ ./rect_test.py TestRectangles.<a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L183" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">test_diagonal_rectangulation_random</a></code></p>



<p>Figure 3 shows an example of a run, with numbered rectangles. The sizes are as returned by <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L48" target="_blank">do_diagonal_rectangulation()</a></code>, so we can see that all rectangles have part of them in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.</p>

<p>It turns out that this map between permutations and diagonal rectangulations is surjective, so it would be interesting to filter out the permutations that produce duplicated rectangulations to reduce the number of calculations. Fortunately, it has been proved that it is possible to establish a bijection between a subset of permutations, called Baxter permutations, and diagonal rectangulations<span id="easy-footnote-2-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-558" title="E. Ackerman, G. Barequet, R. Pinter, A bijection between permutations and floorplans, and its applications, Discrete Appl.<br>Math. 154 (12) (2006) 1674–1684."><sup>2</sup></a></span>.</p>



<h3>Baxter permutations</h3>



<p>Baxter permutations can be defined by using the generalized pattern avoidance framework<span id="easy-footnote-3-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-558" title="E. Babson, E. Steingrímsson, Generalized permutation patterns and a classification of the Mahonian statistics, Sém. Lothar.<br>Combin. 44 (2000) Art. B44b, 18 pp. (electronic)."><sup>3</sup></a></span>. The way it works is that a sequence is Baxter if there is no subsequence of 4 elements that you can find in it that matches one of the generalized patterns 3-14-2 and 2-41-3. This is an interesting topic but I do not want to digress too much: I have based my implementation on the definition of section 2 of <span id="easy-footnote-4-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-558" title="N. Reading,Generic rectangulations.European J. Combin.33(2012) 610–623 <a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3093&quot;>arXiv:1105.3093</a>."><sup>4</sup></a></span>. The function <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L337" target="_blank">is_baxter_permutation()</a></code> checks whether a sequence is Baxter or not by generating all possible subsequences of 4 elements and checking if they avoid the mentioned patterns. An example using it can be run with</p>



<p><code>$ ./rect_test.py TestRectangles.<a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L234" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">test_baxter_permutation</a></code></p>



<p>Using Baxter permutations to filter out permutations can save lots of time for bigger \(N\). For instance, for \(N=10\), only around 10% of the permutations are Baxter. There is a closed form formula for the number of Baxter permutations as a function of \(N\)<span id="easy-footnote-5-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-558" title="F.R.K. Chung, R.L. Graham, V.E. Hoggatt Jr., M. Kleiman, The number of Baxter permutations, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 24<br>(3) (1978) 382–394."><sup>5</sup></a></span>, so we can compare easily with the total number of permutations, \(N!\).</p>



<h3>Rectangle equations</h3>



<p>Once we have a rectangulation, we need to extract the equations that define the relations between widths and heights across the rectangles. To do this, we can loop through the rectangulation matrix and detect the limits between rectangles, which define horizontal and vertical segments. When found, we will create an equation that defines that the sum of the widths/heights of the rectangles at each side of the segment must be equal. There will be also two equations for the  bounding rectangle that make the sum of width/height of rectangles at the side be equal to the total width/height. Note that these are 2 and not 4 equations, as 2 of the 4 we can extract would be linearly dependent on the full set of equations (this can be seen because if we take the equation on one side and follow the parallel segments equations while moving to the opposite side we can deduce the rectangles that touch the bounding rectangle at the opposite limit). Example of the equation sets that would be extracted are those we have already seen for the rectangulations in figure 1. In the slightly more complex case of figure 2, the equations would be</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>w_2 &amp; = &amp; w_3+w_5 \\<br>w_1+w_3 &amp; = &amp; w_4 \\<br>h_1+h_4 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h_2+h_3 \\<br>h_3+h_4 &amp; = &amp; h_5<br>\end{array}$$</p>



<p>The function that implements this algorithm is <code><a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L93" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build_rectangulation_equations()</a></code>. It returns a matrix with the equation coefficients that will be used when optimizing the rectangulations.</p>



<p>The final number of linearly independent equations we will get will be always \(N+1\). This is a corollary of Lemma 2.3 from <span id="easy-footnote-6-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-558" title="E. Ackerman, G. Barequet, R. Pinter, On the number of rectangulations of a planar point set, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 113 (6) (2006) 1072–1091."><sup>6</sup></a></span>. This lemma defines two operations, “Flip” and “Rotate”, that allow transforming any rectangulation on another one by a finite number of these operations. These operations do not modify the number of segments in the rectangulation. Therefore, we could transform any rectangulation in one having only, say, vertical segments. This rectangulation …</p></div></article></div>

  This is an excuse to have a blog post on the economics of Bitcoin to refer people to. <br> <b>Intended Audience:</b> Laypersons interested or confused about Bitcoin. <br> <b>Reading Time:</b> 15min
</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a> (MSTR) had a spare $400M of cash which it decided to shift to Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>When a company has a pile of spare money it doesn’t know what to do with, it’ll normally do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase">buybacks</a> or start paying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend">dividends</a>. That gives the money back to the shareholders, and from an economic perspective the money can get better invested in other more promising companies<a href="#footnote-1-1230" id="note-1-1230" rel="footnote">1</a>. If you have a huge pile of of cash, you probably should be doing other things than leave it in a bank account to gather dust<a href="#footnote-2-1230" id="note-2-1230" rel="footnote">2</a>.</p>
<p>However, this statement from MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor exists to make it clear he’s buying into BTC for all the wrong reasons<a href="#footnote-3-1230" id="note-3-1230" rel="footnote">3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is not a speculation, nor is it a hedge. This was a deliberate corporate strategy to adopt a bitcoin standard.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s unpack it and jump into the economics Bitcoin:</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Or rather BTC doesn’t act as money and there’s no serious future path for BTC to become a form of money. Let’s go back to basics. There are 3 main economic problems money solves:</p>
<p><strong>1. Medium of Exchange.</strong> Before money we had to barter, which led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants">double coincidence of wants</a> problem. When everyone accepts the same money you can buy something from someone even if they don’t like the stuff you own.</p>
<p>As a medium of exchange, BTC is not good. There are significant transaction fees and transaction waiting times built-in to BTC and these worsen the more popular BTC get.</p>
<p>You can test BTC’s usefulness as a medium of exchange for yourself right now: try to order a pizza or to buy a random item with BTC. How many additional hurdles do you have to go through? How many fewer options do you have than if you used a regular currency? How much overhead (time, fees) is there?</p>
<p><strong>2. Unit of Account.</strong> A unit of account is what you compare the value of objects against. We denominate BTC in terms of how many USD they’re worth, so BTC is not a unit of account presently. We can say it’s because of lack of adoption, but really it’s also because the market value of BTC is so volatile.</p>
<p>If I buy a $1000 table today or in 2017, it’s roughly a $1000 table. We can’t say that a 0.4BTC table was a 0.4BTC table in 2017. We’ll expand on this in the next point:</p>
<p><strong>3. Store of Value.</strong> When you create economic value, you don’t want to be forced to use up the value you created right away.</p>
<p>For instance, if I fix your washing machine and you pay me in avocados, I’d be annoyed. I’d have to consume my payment before it becomes brown, squishy and disgusting<a href="#footnote-4-1230" id="note-4-1230" rel="footnote">4</a>. Avocado fruit is not good money because avocados loses value very fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand, well-run currencies like the USD, GBP, CAD, EUR, etc. all lose their value at a <strong>low</strong> and most importantly <strong>fairly predictible</strong> rate<a href="#footnote-5-1230" id="note-5-1230" rel="footnote">5</a>. Let’s look at the chart of the USD against BTC:</p>

<p>While the dollar loses value at a predictible rate, BTC is all over the place, which is bad.</p>
<p>One important use money is to write loan contracts. Loans are great. They let people spend now against their future potential earnings, so they can buy houses or start businesses without first saving up for a decade. Loans are good for the economy.</p>
<p>If you want to sign something that says <em>“I owe you this much for that much time”</em> then you need to be able to roughly predict the value of the debt in at the point in time where it’s due.</p>
<p>Otherwise you’ll have a hard time pricing the risk of the loan effectively. This means that you need to charge higher interests. The risk of making a loan in BTC needs to be priced into the interest of a BTC-denominated loan, which means much higher interest rates. High interests on loans are bad, because buying houses and starting businesses are good things.</p>

<p>Some people think that going back to a standard where our money was denominated by a stock of gold (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard">Gold Standard</a>) would solve economic problems. This is nonsense.</p>
<p>Having control over supply of your currency is a good thing, as long as it’s well run.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=660%2C480&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="480" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?w=1056&amp;ssl=1 1056w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=1024%2C745&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=768%2C559&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Remember that what is desirable is low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">variance</a> in the value, not the value itself. When there are wild fluctuations in value, it’s hard for money to do its job well.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, the USD has been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money">fiat money</a> with no intrinsic value. This means we control the supply of money.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a classic poorly drawn econ101 graph:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=660%2C495&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="495" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The market price for USD is where supply meets demand. The problem with a currency based on an item whose supply is fixed is that the price will necessarily fluctuate in response to changes in demand.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, that a pandemic strikes and that the demand for currency takes a sharp drop. The US imports less, people don’t buy anything anymore, etc. If you can’t print money, you get deflation, which is worsens everything <a href="#footnote-6-1230" id="note-6-1230" rel="footnote">6</a>. On the other hand, if you can make the <a href="https://brrr.money/">money printers go brrrr</a> you can stabilize the price:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=660%2C242&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="242" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?w=928&amp;ssl=1 928w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=300%2C110&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=768%2C281&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Having your currency be based on a fixed supply isn’t just bad because in/deflation is hard to control <a href="#footnote-7-1230" id="note-7-1230" rel="footnote">7</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also a national security risk…</p>
<p><strong>The story of the guy who crashed gold prices in North Africa</strong></p>
<p>In the 1200s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansa_Musa">Mansa Munsa</a>, the emperor of the Mali, was rich and a devout Muslim and wanted everyone to know it. So he embarked on a pilgrimage to make it rain all the way to Mecca.</p>
<p>He in fact made it rain so hard he increased the overall supply of gold and unintentionally <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Mansa_Musa_I/">crashed gold prices in Cairo by 20%</a>, wreaking an economic havoc in North Africa that lasted a decade.</p>
<p>This story is fun, the larger point that having your inflation be at the mercy of foreign nations is an undesirable attribute in any currency. The US likes to call some countries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_manipulator">currency manipulators</a>, but this problem would be serious under a gold standard.</p>

<p>Since the USD is based on nothing except the US government’s word<a href="#footnote-8-1230" id="note-8-1230" rel="footnote">8</a>, how can we trust USD not to be mismanaged?</p>
<p>The answer is that you can probably trust the fed until political stooges get put in place. Currently, the US’s central bank managing the USD, the Federal Reserve (the Fed for friends &amp; family), has administrative authority. The fed can say <strong>“no”</strong> to dumb requests from the president.</p>
<p>People who have no idea what the fed does like to chant “audit the fed”, but the fed is already one of the best audited US federal entities. The transcripts of <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">all their meetings</a> are out in the open. As is their <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm">balance sheet</a>, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm">what they plan to do and why</a>. If the US should audit anything it’s the Department of Defense which operates without <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/11/accounting-fraud-and-waste-routine-pentagon/355233/"><em>any accounting at all</em>.</a></p>
<p>It’s easy to see when a central bank will go rogue: it’s when political yes-men are elected to the board.</p>
<p>For example, before printing themselves into hyperinflation, the Venezuelan president appointed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy-idUSKBN0UL27820160107">sociologist who publicly stated “Inflation does not exist in real life”</a> and instead is a made up capitalist lie. Note what happened mere months after his gaining control over the Venezuelan currency:</p>

<p>This is a key policy. One paper I really like, <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sargent1984.pdf">Sargent (1984) “The end of 4 big inflations”</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The essential measures that ended hyperinflation in each of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Poland were, first, the creation of an independent central bank that was legally committed to refuse the government’s demand or additional unsecured credit and, second, a simultaneous alteration in the fiscal policy regime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In english: <em>hyperinflation stops when the central bank can say “no” to the government.”</em></p>
<p>The US Fed, like other well good central banks, is run by a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm">bunch of nerds</a><a href="#footnote-9-1230" id="note-9-1230" rel="footnote">9</a>. When it prints money, even as aggressively as it has it does so for good reasons. You can see why they started printing on March 15th as the COVID lockdowns started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In english: <em>We’re going to keep printing and lowering rates until jobs are back and inflation is under control. If we print until the sun is blotted out, we’ll print in the shade.</em></p>

<p>Gold is a good asset for doomsday-preppers. If society crashes, gold will still have value.</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<p>Gold has held value throughout multiple historic catastrophes over thousands of years. It had value before and after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse">Bronze Age Collapse</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire">Fall of the Western Roman Empire</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_and_conquests">Gengis Khan being Gengis Khan</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you erased humanity and started over, the new humans would still find gold to be economically valuable. When Europeans d̶i̶s̶c̶o̶v̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ c̶o̶n̶q̶u̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ g̶e̶n̶o̶c̶i̶d̶e̶d̶ went to America, they found gold to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muisca_mythology">an important item over there too</a>. This is about equivalent to finding humans on Alpha-Centauri and learning that they think gold is a good store of value as well.</p>
<p>Some people are puzzled at this: we don’t even use gold for much! But it has great properties:</p>
<p>First, gold is hard to fake and impossible to manufacture. This makes it good to ascertain payment.</p>
<p>Second, gold doesnt react to oxygen, so it doesn’t rust or tarnish. So it keeps value over time unlike most other materials.</p>
<p>Last, gold is <strong>pretty</strong>. This might sound frivolous, and you may not like it, but jewelry has actual value to humans.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence if you look at a list of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_families">wealthiest families</a>, a large number of them trade in luxury goods.</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_the_Leisure_Class">Veblen</a> humans have a profound desire to signal social status, for the same reason peacocks have unwieldy tails. Gold is a great way to achieve that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, BTC lacks all these attributes. Its value is largely based on common perception of value. There are a few fundamental drivers of demand:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Means of Exchange:</strong> if people seriously start using BTC to buy pizzas, then this creates a real demand for the currency to accomplish the short-term exchanges. As we saw previously, I’m not personally sold on this one and it’s currently a negligible fraction of overall demand.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Criminal uses:</strong> Probably the largest inbuilt …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

		<p><b>TL;DR:</b> GNNs can provide wins over simpler embedding methods, but we’re at a point where other research directions matter more
</p>
<p>I’m only lukewarm on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). There, I said it.</p>
<p>It might sound crazy GNNs are one of the hottest fields in machine learning right now. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00982.pdf">There</a> were at least <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11867.pdf">four</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf">review</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00687.pdf">papers</a> just in the last few months. I think some progress can come of this research, but we’re also focusing on some incorrect places.</p>
<p>But first, let’s take a step back and go over the basics.</p>

<p>We say graphs are a “non-euclidean” data type, but that’s not really true. A regular graph <a href="#footnote-1-1311" id="note-1-1311" rel="footnote">1</a> is just another way to think about a particular flavor of square matrix called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">adjacency matrix</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdjacencyMatrices_1002.gif?resize=412%2C271&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="412" height="271" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>It’s weird, we look at run-of-the-mill matrix full of real numbers and decide to call it “non-euclidean”.</p>
<p>This is for practical reasons. Most graphs are fairly sparse, so the matrix is full of zeros. At this point, <em>where the non-zero numbers are</em> matters most, which makes the problem closer to (computationally hard) discrete math rather than (easy) continuous, gradient-friendly math.</p>
<p><strong>If you had the full matrix, life would be easy</strong></p>
<p>If we step out of the pesky realm of physics for a minute, and assume carrying the full adjacency matrix around isn’t a problem, we solve a bunch of problems.</p>
<p>First, network node embeddings <a href="#footnote-2-1311" id="note-2-1311" rel="footnote">2</a> aren’t a thing anymore. A node is a just row in the matrix, so it’s already a vector of numbers.</p>
<p>Second, all network prediction problems are solved. A powerful enough and well-tuned model <a href="#footnote-3-1311" id="note-3-1311" rel="footnote">3</a> will simply extract all information between the network and whichever target variable we’re attaching to nodes.</p>
<p><strong>NLP is also just fancy matrix compression</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take a tangent away from graphs to NLP. Most NLP we do can be <a href="https://thegradient.pub/transformers-are-graph-neural-networks/">thought of in terms of graphs</a> as we’ll see, so it’s not a big digression.</p>
<p>First, note that Ye Olde word embedding models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">Word2Vec</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf">GloVe</a> are <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2014/file/feab05aa91085b7a8012516bc3533958-Paper.pdf">just matrix factorization</a>.</p>
<p>The GloVe algorithm works on a variation of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model">bag of words</a> matrix. It goes through the sentences and creates a (implicit) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence">co-occurence</a> graph where nodes are words and the edges are weighed by how often the words appear together in a sentence.</p>
<p>Glove then does matrix factorization <a href="#footnote-4-1311" id="note-4-1311" rel="footnote">4</a> on the matrix representation of that co-occurence graph, Word2Vec is mathematically equivalent<a href="#footnote-5-1311" id="note-5-1311" rel="footnote">5</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more on this in my <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2020/02/16/embeddings-from-the-ground-up/">post on embeddings</a> and the one (with code) on <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2019/01/27/word-embeddings-from-the-ground-up/">word embeddings</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Even language models are also just matrix compression</strong></p>
<p>Language models are all the rage. They dominate most of the <a href="https://nlpprogress.com/">state of the art</a> in NLP.</p>
<p>Let’s take BERT as our main example<a href="#footnote-6-1311" id="note-6-1311" rel="footnote">6</a>. BERT predicts a word given the context of the rest of the sentence:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=660%2C208&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="208" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=768%2C242&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This grows the matrix we’re factoring from flat co-occurences on pairs of words to co-occurences conditional on the sentence’s context<a href="#footnote-7-1311" id="note-7-1311" rel="footnote">7</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=660%2C291&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="291" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=300%2C132&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=768%2C339&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>We’re growing the “ideal matrix” we’re factoring combinatorially <a href="#footnote-8-1311" id="note-8-1311" rel="footnote">8</a>. As noted by <a href="http://socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/papers/hahn2019estimating.pdf">Hanh &amp; Futrell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] human language—and language modelling—has infinite statistical complexity but that it can be approximated well at lower levels. This observation has two implications: 1) We can obtain good results with comparatively small models; and 2) there is a lot of potential for scaling up our models. Language models tackle such a large problem space that they probably approximate a compression of the entire language in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov Complexity</a> sense. It’s also possible that huge language models just <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/12/20/lmmem/">memorize a lot of it</a> rather than compress the information, for what it’s worth.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Can we upsample any graph like language models do?</h3>
<p>We’re already doing it.</p>
<p>Let’s call a <strong>first-order</strong> embedding of a graph a method that works by directly factoring the graph’s adjacency matrix or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">Laplacian matrix</a>. If you embed a graph using <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=1F03130B02DC485C78BF364266B6F0CA?doi=10.1.1.19.8100&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Laplacian Eigenmaps</a> or by taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal components</a> of the Laplacian, that’s first order. Similarly, GloVe is a first-order method on the graph of word co-occurences. One of my favorites first order methods for graphs is <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/0594.pdf">ProNE</a>, which works as well as most methods while being two orders of magnitude faster.</p>
<p>A <strong>higher-order</strong> method embeds the original matrix plus connections of neighbours-of-neighbours (2nd degree) and deeper k-step connections. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2806416.2806512">GraRep</a>, shows you can always generate higher-order representations from first order methods by augmenting the graph matrix <a href="#footnote-9-1311" id="note-9-1311" rel="footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>Higher order method are the “upsampling” we do on graphs. GNNs that sample on large neighborhoods and random-walk based methods like node2vec are doing higher-order embeddings.</p>

<p>Most GNN papers in the last 5 years present empirical numbers that are useless for practitioners to decide on what to use.</p>
<p>As noted in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00687.pdf">OpenGraphsBenchmark</a> (OGB) paper, GNN papers do their empirical section on a handful of tiny graphs (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) with 2000-20,000 nodes. These datasets can’t seriously differentiate between methods.</p>
<p>Recent efforts are directly fixing this, but the reasons why researchers focused on tiny, useless datasets for so long are worth discussing.</p>
<p><strong>Performance matters by task</strong></p>
<p>One fact that surprises a lot of people is that even though language models have the best performance in a lot of NLP tasks, if all you’re doing is cram sentence embeddings into a downstream model, there <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyK00v5xx">isn’t much gained</a> from language models embeddings over simple methods like summing the individual Word2Vec word embeddings <a href="#footnote-10-1311" id="note-10-1311" rel="footnote">10</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors/blob/master/examples/link%20prediction.ipynb">I find</a> that for many graphs <strong>simple first-order methods perform just as well on graph clustering and node label prediction tasks than higher-order embedding methods</strong>. In fact higher-order methods are massively computationally wasteful for these usecases <a href="#footnote-11-1311" id="note-11-1311" rel="footnote">11</a></p>
<p>Recommended first order embedding methods are ProNE and my <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors">GGVec with order=1</a> <a href="#footnote-12-1311" id="note-12-1311" rel="footnote">12</a>.</p>
<p>Higher order methods normally perform better on the link prediction tasks<a href="#footnote-13-1311" id="note-13-1311" rel="footnote">13</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the gap in link prediction performance is inexistant for artificially created graphs. This suggests higher order methods do learn some of the structure intrinsic to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.2636.pdf">real world graphs</a>.</p>
<p>For visualization, first order methods are better. Visualizations of higher order methods tend to have artifacts of their sampling. For instance, Node2Vec visualizations tend to have elongated/filament-like structures which come from the embeddings coming from long single strand random walks. See the following visualizations by <a href="http://byowen.com/">Owen Cornec</a> <a href="#footnote-14-1311" id="note-14-1311" rel="footnote">14</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=660%2C253&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="253" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?w=994&amp;ssl=1 994w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=300%2C115&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=768%2C294&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Lastly, sometimes simple methods soundly beat higher order methods (there’s an instance of it in the OGB paper).</p>
<p>The problem here is that <strong>we don’t know when any method is better than another</strong> and <strong>we definitely don’t know the reason</strong>.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a reason different graph types respond better/worse to being represented by various methods. This is currently an open question.</p>
<p>A big part of why is that the research space is inundated under useless new algorithms because…</p>

<p>Here’s the cynic’s view of how machine learning papers are made:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take an existing algorithm</li>
<li>Add some new layer/hyperparameter, make a cute mathematical story for why it matters</li>
<li>Gridsearch your hyperparameters until you beat baselines from the original paper you aped</li>
<li>Absolutely don’t gridsearch stuff you’re comparing against in your results section</li>
<li>Make a cute ACRONYM for your new method, put impossible to use python 2 code on github <a href="#footnote-15-1311" id="note-15-1311" rel="footnote">15</a> and bask in the citations</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03341.pdf">not</a> the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kee4ch3miVA">only one</a> with these views on the state reproducible research. At least it’s gotten slightly better in the last 2 years.</p>
<h3>Sidebar: I hate Node2Vec</h3>
<p>A side project of mine is a <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors">node embedding library</a> and the most popular method in it is by far Node2Vec. Don’t use Node2Vec.</p>
<p><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/node2vec-kdd16.pdf">Node2Vec</a> with <code>p=1; q=1</code> is the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652.pdf">Deepwalk</a> algorithm. Deepwalk is an actual innovation.</p>
<p>The Node2Vec authors closely followed the steps 1-5 including bonus points on step 5 by getting word2vec name recognition.</p>
<p>This is not academic fraud — the hyperparameters <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11726.pdf">do help a tiny bit</a> if you gridsearch really hard. But it’s the presentable-to-your-parents sister of where you make the ML community worse off to progress your academic career. And certainly Node2Vec doesn’t deserve 7500 citations.</p>

<p>We’ve known how to train neural networks for well over 40 years. Yet they only exploded in popularity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a> in 2012. This is because implementations and hardware came to a point where deep learning was <strong>practical</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, we’ve known about factoring word co-occurence matrices into Word embeddings for at least 20 years.</p>
<p>But word embeddings only exploded in 2013 with Word2Vec. The breakthrough here was that the minibatch-based methods let you train a Wikipedia-scale embedding model on commodity hardware<a href="#footnote-16-1311" id="note-16-1311" rel="footnote">16</a>.</p>
<p>It’s hard for methods in a field to make progress if training on a small amount of data takes days or weeks. You’re disincentivized to explore new methods. If you want progress, your stuff has to run in reasonable time on commodity hardware. Even Google’s original search algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_data_centers#Original_hardware">initially ran on commodity hardware</a> <a href="#footnote-17-1311" id="note-17-1311" rel="footnote">17</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency is paramount to progress</strong></p>
<p>The reason deep learning research took off the way it did is because of improvements in <a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-efficiency/">efficiency</a> as well as much better libraries and hardware support<a href="#footnote-18-1311" id="note-18-1311" rel="footnote">18</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Academic code is terrible</strong></p>
<p>Any amount of time you spend gridsearching Node2Vec on <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> is all put to better use gridsearching Deepwalk itself <a href="#footnote-19-1311" id="note-19-1311" rel="footnote">19</a>. The problem is that people don’t gridsearch over deepwalk because implementations are all terrible.</p>
<p>I wrote the <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2019/08/01/700x-faster-node2vec-models-fastest-random-walks-on-a-graph/">Nodevectors library</a> to have a fast deepwalk implementation because it took <strong>32 hours</strong> to embed a graph with a measly 150,000 nodes using the reference Node2Vec implementation (the same takes 3min with Nodevectors). It’s no wonder people don’t gridsearch on Deepwalk a gridsearch would take weeks with the terrible reference implementations.</p>
<p>To give an example, in the original paper of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf">GraphSAGE</a> they their algorithm to DeepWalk with walk lengths of 5 <a href="#footnote-20-1311" id="note-20-1311" rel="footnote">20</a>. From their paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did observe DeepWalk’s performance could improve with further training, and in some cases it could become competitive with the unsupervised GraphSAGE approaches (but not the supervised approaches) if we let it run for &gt;1000× …</p></blockquote></div></article></div>

<p><a href="https://drone.kaijucode.com/matt/dug" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://drone.kaijucode.com/api/badges/matt/dug/status.svg" alt="Build Status"></a></p>
<p>The <strong>real</strong> repository is located <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>The GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/unfrl/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a> is used for issues and stars <span aria-label="glowing star">🌟</span></p>
<p>A powerful global DNS progagation checker that can output in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>The goal of dug is to make it easy to check the propagation of DNS records. It is also capable of providing templated output that can be used in scripts for things like monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Until theres a wiki for this, the easiest way to explore dug is through the help.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dug help</code> -&gt; Get top level help explaining the different verbs</li>
<li><code>dug help run</code> or <code>dug run --help</code> -&gt; Get details about a specific verb (run, which is the default)</li>
<li><code>dug help update</code> or <code>dug update --help</code> -&gt; Get details about the update verb</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest way to get started is to just run a query against the domain whose DNS records you’re updating.
For example: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif1.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif1.gif" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You can also do complicated things like ask for specific record types, get the output as json, and pipe it into other applications: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com -q A --output-format JSON --output-template Ipaddress,city,value,responsetime | jq</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" alt=""></a></p>

<p>At the time of this post, I have lived in Alexandria City for 22 years, but I was not born here. </p>



<p>Many of the posts I’ve written here are to do with places and events related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Roads">Hampton Roads</a> area, where I grew up. <a href="https://nostalgicvirginian.com/2015/07/remembering-coliseum-mall/">One such post</a> shares my memories and experiences connected to Coliseum Mall that once was, in the City of Hampton in southern Virginia. (I spent a quite a bit of time there, as a youth.) </p>



<p>My wife, on the other hand, <em>was</em> born here. Well, not here in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia">Alexandria</a> where we currently reside, but just a couple of miles west in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annandale,_Virginia">Annandale</a>. The Strathmeade neighborhood in which she lived as a youth is located in the northwest portion of Annandale, putting it close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysons,_Virginia">Tysons Corner area</a> in McLean / Vienna, which is home to not one but two of the most famous malls in America, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysons_Corner_Center">Tysons Corner Center</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysons_Galleria">Tysons Galleria</a>. In her youth, she and her crew of friends would walk a few blocks, jump on a bus (for only a quarter), and hang out at Tysons on many of those wide-open summer days. But, for any real structured shopping missions, it was another nearby mall she and her family patronized: Landmark Shopping Center.</p>

<p>Landmark Shopping Center, originally an outdoor mall located at the far western edge of Alexandria City at 5801 Duke Street, immediately off of Interstate 395 at exit 3, officially opened it doors in October of 1965 with 32 stores including anchors The Hecht Co., Sears and Roebuck, and Woodward and Lothrop. As originally opened, Landmark was a 675,000-square-foot center with a 4,000-space parking lot, the largest in the city.</p>



<p>In 1990, Landmark underwent a massive re-development during which it was converted from a single-story outdoor complex to a fully-enclosed three-story mall. </p>



<p>During the process of buying the house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Historic_District">Old Town Alexandria</a> that my then-fiancée and I would move into in the summer of 1998, I made several trips up to the area from Charlottesville to meet with our realtor. Northern Virginia was still quite alien to me at that time, and the first notable part of Alexandria that I spotted on every trip as I exited the Interstate was Landmark Mall. </p>



<p>My wife and I did much of our shopping at Landmark for the next 15 years. (We didn’t even log into Amazon at all until 2000/01.) I remember frequenting their nicely varied food court on the third floor, Barnie’s coffee shop just inside the front entrance, a video game store where I bought more than a few titles over the years, the arcade, Waldenbooks, FYE, Sears, Macy’s, and a variety of other shops over the years. I even got my hair cut their regularly, at Bubbles. A list of all stores within the mall as it existed in October 2004 is shown below, taken from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041023162139/http://www.landmarkmall.com/html/storedirectory.asp">an archive</a> of the Landmark website.</p>

<p>When our daughter was a toddler we started taking her to <a href="https://nostalgicvirginian.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/carousel2.jpg">the open play area</a> in the center of the bottom floor. For a while there was  a train for kids that ran the perimeter of the lower floors. I recall squeezing myself on board a few times to take the ride with my daughter. There was even a traveling carnival that would take up camp in the front parking lot for a while, most summers. Those were good times and they formed very pleasant memories. </p>

<p>As the years wore on, though, the place started to dry up. Shops started closing one by one and with 2010 a few years behind us it was becoming a rather desolate space. At the time, the Howard Hughes Corporation had <a href="http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2013/jun/27/winds-change-landmark/">plans to revitalize the mall into a booming urban town</a>, but these never came to fruition. (An archived Howard Hugues <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317220321/http://thenewlandmark.com/">development page</a> gives a glimpse of what “The New Landmark” might have been.) More and more shops closed, with Macy’s shuttering on January 4, 2017 (it was later turned into a homeless shelter). Tenants were told to vacate the space by January 31 of that same year, and that was basically the end of Landmark Mall. </p>



<p>I consider the ’80s to be the golden time of my youth. I am a <em>massive</em> fan of all-things-’80s — to the extreme — as my daughter could painfully tell you. This being the case, I was quite intrigued to hear that the derelict mall was being made up as a set for a portion of the in-development movie <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_1984">Wonder Woman 1984</a></em> (which, as a film I must say, is not exactly my cup of tea). To facilitate this, all three floors of the central core of the mall were made into a visage of what the fully-enclosed mall may have looked like in the mid-’80s, had it then existed as such (as opposed to the outdoor center designed in the ’60s that it was). I was anxious to see the result, and a few months ago a teaser trailer for the movie was released that showed just that (and the movie has since been released). It <em>is</em> pretty glorious, in that glowing, neon ’80s way. </p>

<p>A desire to share a few glimpses of Landmark Mall “from the ’80s” is what prompted me to put this post together, sharing my own memories of this place, in the doing. Landmark making its way to the silver screen, even though “in costume,” seems a nice last hoorah for this now-dead mall.</p>

<p>The final chapter in this story is <a href="https://alexandrialivingmagazine.com/news/the-leftover-acres-inova-alexandria-development-landmark-mall-retail-housing/">the news that landed in just the past few weeks</a>. The Landmark Mall complex will be converted to an Inova medical campus and community area. (Inova is a leading hospital network in the region.) The land will be put to good use, but after all these years, the mall is no more.</p>

      <p>Growing a newsletter is the hardest part about running a successful newsletter. No matter if you're just starting out or if your newsletter has 10k+ subscribers. It doesn't get easier, but there are many ways to that can facilitate growth.</p><p>Growth by organic ways like word of mouth is possible but only works if you already people talking about your newsletter. It isn't the most viable solution in the beginning.</p><p>To reach a wider audience you'll have to go where your audience dwells, you can start with Twitter, Reddit, Quora, &nbsp;IndieHackers, or communties on Slack and Discord. These channels have a diversified audience but is only one of the many tools a newsletter creator has in their tool chest of growth. One of the best solutions is to list your newsletter in newsletter directories. It's very similar to the classifieds we see on newspapers but focused towards newsletters.</p><h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2><p>Submitting your newsletter to directories have multi-fold benefits. Below are all of the benefits you'll receive when you submit your newsletter to a directory.</p><h3 id="seo">SEO</h3><p>SEO is one of the most sought after growth avenues for newsletters. When you submit your newsletter to a directory you'll receive SEO in the form of a backlink to your newsletter.</p><p>What does that mean? When someone searches for anything on Google or any search engine, they usually place sites with the most backlinks at the top. It takes months and years to build up sufficient backlinks to rank for popular search phrases that your newsletter wants to compete for.</p><p>SEO is the long game and submitting your newsletter to all 21+ newsletter directories gives your newsletter a backlink boost.</p><p>The main goal of a newsletter directory is to help others discover amazing newsletters to read. This usually means that they want to spread the word as far as possible. Most newsletter directories have multiple social media accounts and will usually share to their audience any new newsletter that's submitted. It's nothing crazy in terms of growth, but it does give a little boost.</p><p>Most newsletter directories provide ways for visitors to share your newsletter to their audience as well, adding to the compounding effect.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

<p>Before starting to form the content of this page, I decided to check how the events related to Covid-19 – lockdowns, no commutes, no travels – impacted our reading habits.</p>



<p>What I found wasn’t that surprising. Some news sites reported that <a aria-label="reading books has surged (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/15/research-reading-books-surged-lockdown-thrillers-crime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reading books has surged</a> during lockdowns others pointed out <a aria-label="completely the opposite (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theconversation.com/how-reading-habits-have-changed-during-the-covid-19-lockdown-146894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">completely the opposite</a> – that a lot of folks were unable to concentrate and their progress with books was snail-like slow.</p>



<p>Why some people were able to read more while others struggled? Well, based on my findings, I can say that people who had difficulties concentrating all had one thing in common – kids.</p>



<p>Personally, I can familiarize myself more with the second group and categorize my reading habits as spectacularly fragmented. Yes, I’m a victim of domestic dysfunction. My son learned to walk around May of 2020 and what was previously a well-arranged apartment now looks like a little arena full of scattered toys and torn apart children’s books. I’m not saying this to complain, simply to give you perspective.</p>



<p>Fortunately, somehow, I was able to read the number of books I had set as a goal at the beginning of the year – 41 books. And to be honest, I’m quite thrilled about the titles I found in 2020. If you check my <a aria-label="book summaries page (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book summaries page</a> chronologically, you’ll see that I focused more on philosophy and psychology books. And also, you’ll probably see more unfamiliar titles. Yes, I no longer romanticize popular books.</p>



<p>Let me explain…</p>



<p>My initial intention when I started this site was to pick famous books that are categorized as best-sellers. The more I consumed those “celebrities” books, though, the more I realized that they don’t deserve the attention they get. Most of the books sitting on top of the charts are usually there because the marketing around the book is pretty decent. But best-seller books doesn’t mean best-content books. The truly eye-opening books are such that aren’t widely known to the public – I learned this the hard way. That’s why I focused more on finding books that are not that famous but on the other hand, are far superior in terms of quality.</p>



<p>So, without further ado, let me show you the best books I read in 2020. Hopefully, this reading list will help you find your next addition to your library.</p>

<h4 id="3-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>I was quite hesitant to start this book. After all, why would you want to read a whole book – more than 400 pages – on how to read a book? But let me tell you, I’m glad I got the book and read it. This book gives you a unique perspective on how to approach reading and learning in general. If you consider yourself a lifelong learner, if you are interested in making positive improvements in your life, you absolutely need to read this book.</p>



<h4 id="4-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>You improve as a reader when you begin to ask better questions before and while you read. Consuming content printed on paper shouldn’t be considered a one-way type of communication where the author is doing all the talking. You should ask questions all the time and find the answers inside the text by yourself.</p>

<h4 id="8-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>The ability to concentrate in a world full of distractions is an important skill. Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explains what needs to happen in your mind, and life, so you can focus better and get more done. Interestingly, the first thing someone needs to do is not related to blocking distractions. Csikszentmihalyi explains that reaching the <a href="https://durmonski.com/productivity/the-flow-state/" target="_blank" aria-label="flow state (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">flow state</a> happens when what you’re doing, the actual task, is something you truly love doing.</p>



<h4 id="9-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>Deep, wickedly intense concentration is closely related to happiness. When you love what you do, you’ll naturally enter the state of optimal experience. Therefore, your lack of focus comes from a busy life. A life where nothing is prioritized, everything is important. To focus better, and to actually feel better, find one task that is important for you.</p>

<h4 id="13-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>The writing style of Ryan Holiday reminds me of Robert Greene. And I love Greene’s books. Every chapter starts with a history-related story and based on the mentioned facts, a certain conclusion is formed. The Obstacle Is the Way is worth checking if you are currently in a pit. If you feel stuck and nothing seems to matter. The proposed ideas by Holiday inside will give you a new perspective on how to deal with hardship.</p>



<h4 id="14-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>“It’s supposed to be hard.” These simple words are still stuck in my head. I remind myself of this paragraph from the book every time I encounter difficulties and my progress stalls. Life can be portrayed as a <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/overcoming-obstacles/" target="_blank" aria-label="series of obstacles (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of obstacles</a> where things don’t get easier, it’s quite the opposite. Things get harder as you move. But this shouldn’t feel discouraging, it should motivate us to keep moving.</p>

<p>This is not a light read. In fact, you’ll most probably walk around with a couple of dictionaries while advancing through the text. Believe me, though, every minute spent on digesting the text is worth it. Kegan presents a profound evolutionary theory that aims to explain through what stages we go as human beings. Meaning that if you’re feeling currently stuck, thanks to the text, you can spot where you are and what you need to do in order to advance in life.</p>



<h4 id="19-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>You’re constantly changing. Not only physically, but also psychologically. Robert Kegan points out that you can better understand others, and yourself, by understanding where they are (and you are) in the human evolutionary stages. Initially, we’re extremely attached to physical things – <a href="https://durmonski.com/psychology/subject-object-relationship/" target="_blank" aria-label="called subject-object relationship (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">called subject-object relationship</a>. With age, we focus more on communities and relationships.</p>

<p>Susan Cain takes us on a journey to “introvert land.” In Quiet, the author explains the main differences between extroverts and introverts. Why the majority is keen on listening to the loudest person in the room and what you can do, if you’re sworn loner, to express your ideas better. Essentially, this book is something like a how-to-survive-in-a-alpha-dominated-world guide for quiet people.</p>



<h4 id="24-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>People are predisposed to believe people who loudly and clearly express their ideas. What they share can be terribly wrong but the enthusiasm in their voice is a lot of times convincing enough for the general audience.</p>

<p>Talent is not god-given and your abilities are not fixed. The main goal of Carol S. Dweck in the book is to convince us that we’re all capable of success. We only need to realize that the skills you want, but don’t currently possess, are within reach if you’re willing to work for them. Mindset is full of stories of famous people who were able to become popular through hard work, not with their natural talent.</p>



<h4 id="29-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>Success is not a one-time thing. It’s a continuous process. You don’t sweat in the gym to win one gold medal. You exercise daily to become great and <em>stay </em>great. If you want to advance in a field, any field, you first need to change your perspective about what success means. It’s always a process, not a one-off thing.</p>

<p>The text is a dissertation of the famous mimetic theory by René Girard. The author, Wolfgang Palaver, explains how the theory was formed, why it’s true, and what we can do to prepare ourselves for the resulting bad consequences. Or in other words, how to mitigate the negative influence of the outside world and create our own genuine worldview.</p>



<h4 id="34-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>Our desires and ambitions are projections of the desires and the ambitions of the people that are closest to us. This is both good and bad. It’s good if what our friends and family strive for is noble. It’s bad because, usually, what others want is not what we want – and also a lot of times vain and superficial. Therefore, if we choose to follow the outside “wants”, we …</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span>We’ve had an idea for years since we first had to deal with the problem everyone who works with cloud services encountered. We ended up locked into public cloud providers and moving was just too complicated. Our developers were spending a lot of time on managing the cloud infrastructure they could instead dedicate to the innovations they wanted to build.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span><br></span><span>Then it struck us. What if you could just migrate between cloud providers in seconds while achieving the best cost and performance combination? Can you deploy your application to the cloud in one day or maybe even in a few hours? Is it even possible? In theory, yes. But will it work?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It took us some time to answer all these questions, but today we are happy to announce the first multi-cloud platform called CAST AI.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br></span><span>We built CAST AI with a few ideas in mind:&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Developers should have a tool to take advantage of everything that AWS, Azure, and other public cloud vendors offer.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Moving between cloud services should be easy so that developers can always benefit from the best combination of cost and performance.</span></li>
<li><span>Companies should never end up wasting the cloud resources they pay for again.</span></li>
<li><span>We want to save thousands of developer lifetimes and billions of company expenses on cloud computing.&nbsp;<br></span><span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>CAST AI connects AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud into one multi-cloud platform, allowing its users to deploy, manage, and cost-optimize applications in multiple clouds simultaneously. On a single cluster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After months of hard work, we’re finally ready to show it to you. </span><span><p><img src="https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=1200&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg" alt="cast_launch_blog.png-1" width="1200" srcset="https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 600w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=1200&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 1200w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=1800&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 1800w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=2400&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 2400w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=3000&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 3000w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=3600&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 3600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p></span></p>
<h2><span>What can you expect from CAST AI?</span></h2>
<p><strong><span>Multi-cloud capabilities</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We connect the clouds via a secure network mesh so that any cloud services of one provider are available on any other cloud. No more vendor lock-in, no more cloud waste. You can finally take advantage of everything that AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have to offer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Autoscaling</span></strong></p>
<p><span>An autoscaler that follows policies you set for it adjusts compute resources in real time - adding workload replicas when the application needs it. You get an infrastructure that is constantly resized to fit your application’s needs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Opinionated and production-ready</span></strong></p>
<p><span>When creating a Kubernetes cluster in CAST AI, you get a few predetermined configuration choices that take you a step closer to production. We made some choices about logging, metrics, and health checks using our many years of Kubernetes expertise. The networking configuration allows for maximum observability while maintaining excellent performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Auto-healing&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If anything goes wrong or a component is accidentally deleted, you don’t need to worry. CAST AI will bring your cluster back to a healthy state.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Built-in observability</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Your cluster will automatically come with Prometheus for Metrics collection, ElasticSearch and Filebeat for log collection and indexing, and a single sign-on to observability frontends (Kibana for logs and Grafana for metrics).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>You can leave anytime</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Want to stop using CAST AI? No problem, you can leave anytime. Your cluster will stay operational even if you’ve been using our multi-cloud features.</span></p>
<h2><span>Early birds: everyone is welcome to join for Free&nbsp;</span></h2>

We are building CAST AI to make developers' jobs easier, so don’t hesitate to ping us with any suggestions and join our community. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>We’re an open community of cloud users, so feel free to join us and have a chat with our engineers and founders on <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/castai-community/shared_invite/zt-i8fcn2xi-sM_iONKn35NmYR2E3dtfng" rel="noopener">Slack. </a><p>And of course, if you would like to get a demo, you can register <a href="https://cast.ai/get-a-demo" rel="noopener">here.</a></p></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br></span><span>After months of hard work, we're looking for your feedback. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Join us for this journey and fight.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>In this series we’ll create a simulation of <strong>evolution</strong> using <strong>neural network</strong> &amp; <strong>genetic algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m going to introduce you to how a basic neural network and genetic algorithm works, then we’ll implement both in
<strong>Rust</strong> and compile our application to <strong>WebAssembly</strong> to ultimately end up with:</p>

<p>This series is intended for <strong>Rust beginners</strong> - I’m assuming you know a thing or two about Rust and I’ll introduce you
to rest of the concepts (such as neural networks) as we go.</p>
<p>No fancy mathematics or IT background is required.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>This series will be divided into a few posts, roughly:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Introduction to the domain (what are we going to simulate, how does a neural network &amp; genetic algorithm work),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing a neural network,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing a genetic algorithm,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing eyes, brain, and the simulation itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Due diligence: I’ll do my best to explain all the concepts, but if at any point you feel lost, feel free to take a look
at this article’s last section - it contains links to external (mostly popular science) sources that might prove to be
helpful in understanding the domain.</p>
<p>Curious? Hop on the bus, Gus, and onto the first chapter: <a href="#design">Design</a>.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="design"><a href="#design">Design</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s start by clearly defining our objective: what are we going to simulate, actually?</p>
<p>The overall idea is that we have a two-dimensional board representing a <strong>world</strong>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-1.png" alt="design 1">
</p>
</div>
<p>This world consists of <strong>birds</strong> (hence the project’s original code name - <em>Shorelark</em>):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-2.png" alt="design 2">
</p>
</div>
<p>... and <strong>foods</strong> (of an abstract kind, rich in protein &amp; fiber):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-3.png" alt="design 3">
</p>
</div>
<p>Each bird has their own <strong>vision</strong>, allowing them to locate the food:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-4.png" alt="design 4">
</p>
</div>
<p>... and a <strong>brain</strong> that controls bird’s body (i.e. speed and rotation).</p>
<p>Our magic touch will lay in the fact that instead of <em>hard-coding</em> our birds to some specific behavior (e.g. "go to the
nearest food in your eyesight"), we’ll take a more intriguing route:</p>
<p>We’ll make our birds able to <strong>learn</strong> and <strong>evolve</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="brain"><a href="#brain">Brain</a></h2>
<div>
<p>If you squint your eyes hard enough, you’ll see that a brain is nothing but a <strong>function</strong> of some inputs to some outputs,
e.g.:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/brain-1.png" alt="brain 1">
</p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>You’re a precious mathematical formula, remember that.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Since our birds will have only one sensory input, their brains can be then approximated as:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/brain-2.png" alt="brain 2">
</p>
</div>
<p>Mathematically, we can represent this function’s input (i.e. biological <em>eye</em>) as a list of numbers, with each number
(i.e. biological <em>photoreceptor</em>) describing <em>how close</em> the nearest object (i.e. food) is:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/brain-3.png" alt="brain 3">
</p>
</div>
<p><em>(<code>0.0</code> - no object in sight, <code>1.0</code> - object right in front of us.)</em></p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Our birds won’t see color, but that’s just for simplicity - you could use e.g.
<a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">raytracing</a> to make the eyes more realistic.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As for the output, we’ll make our function return a tuple of <code>(Δspeed, Δrotation)</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, a brain telling us <code>(0.1, 45)</code> will mean "body, please increase our speed by <code>0.1</code> units and rotate us
<code>45</code> degrees clockwise", while <code>(0.0, 0)</code> will mean "body, please keep our course steady".</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>It’s important that we use <em>relative</em> values (so <code>delta speed</code> and <code>delta rotation</code>), as our brain won’t be aware of its
own location &amp; rotation respective to the world - passing that information would increase our brain’s complexity for no
real benefit.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Finally, let’s address the elephant in the room: so a brain is basically <code>f(eyes)</code>, right? But how do we find out what
actually <em>follows</em> the equals sign?</p>
<p><code>f(eyes) = what?</code></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="nn-intro"><a href="#nn-intro">Neural network: Introduction</a></h2>
<div>
<p>As a fellow human, you are might be aware that brains are made of neurons connected via synapses:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-1.png" alt="nn 1">
</p>
<p>Figure 2. My attempt at drawing neurons; not to scale</p>
</div>
<p>Synapses carry electric and chemical signals between neurons, while neurons "decide" whether given signal should be
propagated further or stopped; eventually this allows for people to recognize letters, eat brussels sprouts, and write
mean comments on Twitter.</p>
<p>Due to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model">inherent complexity</a>, biological neural networks are
not among the easiest to simulate (one could argue that neurons are thus not
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">Web Scale</a>), which made some smart people invent a class of mathematical
structures called <strong>artificial neural networks</strong>, which allow to approximate - with a pinch of salt - brain-like behavior
using math.</p>
<p>Artificial neural networks (which I’m going to call just neural networks) are prominent at <strong>generalizing</strong> over datasets
(e.g. learning how a cat looks like), so they found their use in face recognition (e.g. for cameras), language
translation (e.g. for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Neural_Machine_Translation">GNMT</a>), and - in our case - to
steer colorful pixels for a handful of reddit karma.</p>
<p>The particular kind of network we’ll be focusing on is called <code>feedforward neural network</code> (FFNN)…​</p>

<p>... and it looks like this:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-2.png" alt="nn 2">
</p>
<p>Figure 3. Example of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), also called FFNN</p>
</div>
<p>This is a layout of an FFNN with <strong>five synapses</strong> and <strong>three neurons</strong>, all organized in <strong>two layers</strong>: the <strong>input layer</strong>
(on the left side) and the <strong>output layer</strong> (on the right side).</p>
<p>There may also exist layers in-between, in which case they are called <strong>hidden layers</strong> - they improve the network’s
ability to understand the input data (think: the bigger the brain, the "more abstraction" it might understand, to a
certain degree).</p>

<p>Contrary to biological neural networks (which piggyback on electric signals), FFNNs work by accepting some <strong>numbers</strong> at
their input and propagating (<em>feedforwarding</em>) those numbers layer-by-layer across the entire network; numbers that
appear at the last layer determine network’s answer.</p>
<p>For instance, if you fed your network with raw pixels of a picture, you might’ve got a response saying:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>0.0</code> - this picture <em>does not</em> contain an orange cat eating lasagna,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0.5</code> - this picture <em>might</em> contain an orange cat eating lasagna,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>1.0</code> - this picture <em>certainly</em> contains an orange cat eating lasagna.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It’s also possible for a network to return <em>many</em> values (the number of output values is equal to the number of neurons
in the output layer):</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>(0.0, 0.5)</code> - this picture <em>does not</em> contain an orange cat, but <em>might</em> contain a lasagna,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>(0.5, 0.0)</code> - this picture <em>might</em> contain an orange cat, but <em>does not</em> contain a lasagna.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The meaning of input and output numbers is up to you - in this case we’ve simply imagined that there exists <em>some</em>
neural network behaving this way, but in reality it’s on you to prepare so-called <strong>training dataset</strong> ("given this
picture, you should return 1.0", "given that picture, you should return 0.0").</p>

<p>Having the general overview of FFNNs in mind, let’s now take the next major step and learn about the magic allowing for
all of this to happen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="nn-deep-dive"><a href="#nn-deep-dive">Neural network: Deep dive</a></h2>
<div>
<p>FFNNs lean on two building blocks: <strong>neurons</strong> and <strong>synapses</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>neuron</strong> (usually represented with a circle) accepts some input values, processes them, and returns some output value;
each neuron has <em>at least</em> one input and <em>at most</em> one output:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-3.png" alt="nn 3">
</p>
<p>Figure 4. A single neuron with three synapses</p>
</div>
<p>Additionally, each neuron has a <strong>bias</strong>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-4.png" alt="nn 4">
</p>
<p>Figure 5. A single neuron with three synapses and annotated bias value</p>
</div>
<p>Bias is like a neuron’s <code>if</code> statement - it allows for a neuron to stay inactive (return an output of zero) <em>unless</em> the
input is strong (high) enough. Formally we’d say that bias allows to regulate neuron’s <strong>activation threshold</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine you’ve got a neuron with three inputs, with each input determining whether it sees a lasagna (<code>1.0</code>) or not
(<code>0.0</code>) - now, if you wanted to create a neuron that’s activated when it sees <em>at least two</em> lasagnas, you’d simply
create a neuron with a bias of <code>-1.0</code>; this way your neuron’s "natural" state would be <code>-1.0</code> (inactive), with one
lasagna - <code>0.0</code> (still inactive), and with two - <code>1.0</code> (active, voilà).</p>

<p>Apart from neurons, we’ve got <strong>synapses</strong> - a synapse is like a wire that connects one neuron’s output to another
neuron’s input; each synapse is of certain <strong>weight</strong>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-5.png" alt="nn 5">
</p>
<p>Figure 6. A single neuron with three synapses with annotated weights</p>
</div>
<p>A weight is a <em>factor</em> (hence the <code>x</code> before each number, to emphasize its multiplicative nature), so a weight of:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>0.0</code> means that a synapse is effectively <em>dead</em> (it doesn’t pass any information from one neuron into the another),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0.3</code> means that if neuron A returns <code>0.7</code>, neuron B will receive <code>0.7 * 0.3 ~= 0.2</code>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>1.0</code> means that a synapse is effectively <em>passthrough</em> - if neuron A returns <code>0.7</code>, neuron B will receive
<code>0.7 * 1.0 = 0.7</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Having all this knowledge in mind, let’s go back to our network and fill-in missing weights &amp; biases with some random
numbers:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-6.png" alt="nn 6">
</p>
</div>
<p>What a beauty, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Let’s see what it thinks of, say, <code>(0.5, 0.8)</code>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-7.png" alt="nn 7">
</p>
</div>
<p>To reiterate, we’re interested in the output value of the rightmost neuron (that’s our output layer) - since it depends
on two previous neurons (the ones from the input layer), we’re going to start with them.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the top-left neuron first - to calculate its output, we start by computing a <strong>weighted sum</strong> of all its
inputs:</p>

<p>... then, we add the bias:</p>

<p>... and <strong>clamp</strong> this value through so-called <strong>activation function</strong>; activation function limits neuron’s output to a
predefined range, simulating the <code>if</code>-like behavior.</p>
<p>The simplest activation function is <strong>rectified linear unit</strong> (<code>ReLU</code>), which is basically
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.f32.html#method.max"><code>f32::max</code></a>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-8.png" alt="nn 8">
</p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Another popular activation function is <code>tanh</code> - its graph looks slightly different (like an <code>s</code>) and it’s got
<a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks">different
properties</a>.</p>
<p>Activation function affects network’s input and output - e.g. <code>tanh</code> forces a network to work on numbers from range
<code>&lt;-1.0, 1.0&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;0.0, +inf&gt;</code>, as compared to <code>ReLU</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As you can see, when our weighted-sum-with-a-bias is lower than zero, the neuron’s output will be <code>0.0</code> - and that’s
exactly what happens to our current output:</p>

<p>Nice; now let’s do the bottom-left one:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="text"><span></span># Weighted sum:
0.8 * 1.0 = 0.8

# Bias:
0.8 + 0.0 = 0.8

# Activation function:
max(0.8, 0.0) = 0.8</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this point we’ve got the input layer completed:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-9.png" alt="nn 9">
</p>
</div>
<p>... which heads us towards the last neuron:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="text"><span></span># Weighted sum:
(0.0 * 0.6) + (0.8 * 0.5) = 0.4

# Bias:
0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6

# Activation function:
max(0.6, 0.0) = 0.6</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>... and the network’s output itself:</p>

<p>Voilà - for the input of <code>(0.5, 0.8)</code>, our network responded <code>0.6</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><h2>Updates</h2><h3>Tuesday, 22nd December 2020</h3></p><div><div><p>Today we are releasing <a href="https://supernotes.app/changelog">Supernotes 1.7</a>, which introduces embeddable note-cards to Supernotes. Like tweets, our note-cards can be embedded anywhere on the web, from Notion documents to your personal blog. But unlike tweets, our note-cards have extended markdown support and no character limit (although we recommend keeping below 1200), giving you a lot greater flexibility. </p>
<p>It's super easy to create an embeddable note-card, just create a share code and copy the embed from within the share dropdown. Here's a quick walkthrough below:</p>
<p><img alt="How to create an embeddable share code on Supenrotes" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e0375139aef29ba1fbb28cc7b584b3958be6f2e3/c9b64/faf17916af9b689168b6a5392b6241e1/embedcodetutorial.gif"></p><h5>Open the share dropdown and then click "Create new code". Make sure 'Publicly Viewable' is turned on and then 'Generate Code'. Finally hit the 'Embed' button to copy the embed code.</h5>
<p>Here are our favourite use cases for embeddable note-cards:</p>
<h2>Reusable Checklists</h2>
<p>Embed interactive checklists; for example read the card below and check the list as you go along. You can refresh the page to return to the card to it's original state. Or if you are the author of the card, log in to Supernotes to make permanent changes!</p>

<h2>Highlight Code Snippets</h2>
<p>Make use of Supernotes' code syntax highlighting feature, and quickly share blocks of code with friends. Like this introduction to <code>if</code> statements on Python below:</p>

<h2>Interactive Study Cards</h2>
<p>Create interactive elements such as using spoilers to hide important information –&nbsp;a great revision technique. Here's a brief card on one of our favourite thinkers from the 20th century. Let's see if you can guess the hidden elements correctly!</p>

<p>Overall 2020 been a great year for us, and Connor and I are very proud of how far Supernotes has come - especially with our awesome community. Keep up to date with our development journey over on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/acnebs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@acnebs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tobiaswhetton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@tobiaswhetton</a>). And please share your favourite uses of embeddable note-cards with us –&nbsp;we'd love to see them! </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><p>While I had some time off over Christmas I decided it would be useful to read up on product validation. Especially after the launch of my first startup, Readercatch, which although launching quite successfully on ProductHunt failed to generate any meaningful conversion.</p><p>I created a site called validationguide.com (using <a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>) to host all this research. Upon researching the topic, I realized something, Almost all product validation methods for successful bootstrapped companies are the same.</p><p>There's the odd sneaky company that uses Ads or just launches a product without validation. But for the most part almost all validated companies do these things:</p><h3>1) Listen To People</h3><p>Whether it's selling <a href="http://justinmares.com/how-i-validated-my-idea-for-kettle-fire/">Bone Broth</a> or <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/">launching the next platform for App deals</a>. <strong>Validating products requires listening to people's problems first</strong>.</p><p>In other words for your product to be validated you need to start talking to people and asking them about their problems, what's taking up their time at work, etc.</p><p>For Kettle &amp; Fire it was Justin's friends talking about how great Bone Broth was and Justin finding out that no business sold Bone Broth online. For App Sumo it was Kagan's last startup, Gambit, where he learned that startups wanted more users over more revenue.</p><h3>2) Sell Sell Sell</h3><p>Nowadays when a startup is launching you see the plain old email signup landing page. That's great if you're the next X in tech and everyone's hyping about you, but for validating your customer's needs an email sign up box sucks.</p><p>Instead try creating a fake (or real) checkout flow for the product that doesn't exist yet. Justin validated Kettle &amp; Fire by creating an Unbounce landing page with a PayPal checkout and knew he was onto something when he received $500 in orders. App Sumo validated it's business model by running Reddit Ads and selling pro Imgur accounts. Drip validated it's problem by emailing a bunch of founders asking about email marketing.</p><p>Being lean doesn't mean building the full product. In fact if you can get someone to pay you based off an idea then you're onto a real winner of a business.</p><h3>3) Find A Way To Easily Reach Customers</h3><p>So you've found a group of customers who have a problem and you want to see if your solution will solve it for them. Here's a few quick ways:</p><ol><li>Cold email/message/call your target customer (How Drip got started)</li><li>Run FB/Google/Bing/Etc Ads (How Kettle &amp; Fire got started)</li><li>Write blog content and share it online about how your product solves X and Y (How Basecamp got started)</li></ol><p><strong>Your target customer should be so relieved that your product exists that they should be willing to pay for it.</strong> Don't make the mistake of building something nice to have.</p></article></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p><em>This post is an excerpt of my YouTube video by the same name. You can watch it now:</em></p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pj57nB1CKHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>Last year I decided it was time to switch jobs. Interviewing is always a hassle, so I decided to keep track of what worked for me. I'm sharing this in the hopes someone else might benefit from what I've learned.</p><h2 id="how-i-prepared-for-the-phone-screens">How I prepared for the phone screens</h2><p>I kept it simple: LeetCode for practice problems. I didn't aim for an arbitrary number of questions to "be ready".</p><p>Practiced each day for a few hours and used space repetition. I'd cover multiple topics each session. That prevented things from getting too boring.</p><h2 id="how-i-prepared-for-the-onsite-interviews">How I prepared for the onsite interviews</h2><p>Since I had practiced a lot of coding for the phone screens, I put coding in the back-burner.</p><p>Instead, I focused on system design and behavioral questions.</p><p>For system design, <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview">Grokking the System Design Interview</a> was pretty useful. To supplement that, &nbsp;I also watched YouTube videos to see how different people approached different problems.</p><hr><p>When it came to behavioral prep, I used <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki </a>flashcards. I went through all of Amazon's leadership principles, researched common behavioral questions, and created the cards with my answers. I also made sure to include any follow ups I could think of to my cards.</p><p>This definitely made me memorize my answers.</p><p>This might sound like cheating, but the truth is you're not gonna be able to come up with a story on the spot. You'll ramble. You'll forget details. You'll get confused. Interviewing is already stressful enough. Preparing the questions and answers beforehand will give you a leg up.</p><h2 id="why-i-did-all-of-my-interviews-in-a-single-week">Why I did all of my interviews in a single week</h2><p>Onsite interviews usually take 5 hours. Three onsites in a week totals 15 hours. I won't lie, it sucked. I was pretty exhausted after that week. But at the same time, it didn't suck.</p><p>Doing all the interviews at once gave me momentum and helped me perform well. It also helped me get it over quickly.</p><p>It also gave me a huge advantage: leverage. You see, when you tell companies you already have other onsites, they pay attention.

<b>On inventions, improvements and stagnation in the software world.</b>
</p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<blockquote>
But 1983 - and the whole decade - came and went without the "new thing".
<br>
<i>-- Alan C. Kay in The Early History of Smalltalk</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
I freely admit it: I'm likely to be the first person to triumphantly 
yell "Exactly!" at any statement claiming that computers were
<a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/ltmag">better before</a>, and that everything is pretty much
<a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/decusab">crap today</a>. Frankly, I'm kind 
of a backwards person: at some point I started enjoying computers more 
because of their rich and interesting history, rather than the magical 
air of futuristic high-tech that first drew me to them.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, I thought I'd agree with a blog post titled 
<a href="https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1475">"The Great Software Stagnation"</a> - written by Jonathan Edwards, 
a former research fellow at MIT, no less!
</p>

<p>
Alas, I did not.
</p>

<p>
For those too lazy to click on links, Edwards roughly states that before 
1996, lots of amazing "software technology" appeared, such as C++, 
Windows, Unix and WWW. Then the Internet boom happened and "programmers 
could get rich quick", which effectively stopped "progress" in the field 
and replaced it with "incremental improvements" that aren't 
"fundamentally new".
</p>

<p>
The problem with this reasoning, in my opinion, is twofold: Firstly, 
1996 is far too late a date to use as a cutoff. Secondly, almost 
anything in any field at any time can, upon close examination, be 
described as derivative of something that appeared earlier. (The 
wonderfully lifelike, masterfully stylistic and cleverly shaded 
paintings in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvet_Cave">Chauvet Cave</a> comes to mind as an example 
within art.) This historical backtracking is especially 
applicable to sufficiently complex technology - <i>but that doesn't
necessarily mean something isn't inventive in its own right</i>.
</p>

<h3>Inventions and improvements</h3>

<p>
Who invented the automobile, for example? Without doubt it's a truly 
revolutionary creation, yet it's also mostly a joining together of 
already existing concepts. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot constructed his steam 
powered "Fardier à vapeur" in 1769, but Ferdinand Verbiest is credited 
with thinking up the concept a hundred years earlier. Of course, Cugnot 
couldn't have built his vehicle without the invention and gradual 
refinement of steam power, with which experiments are recorded as early 
as during biblical times. And, besides - isn't a car really just an 
incremental improvement on the horse and carriage?
</p>

<p>
It wouldn't be controversial to say that the iPhone is a post-1996 
invention with considerable impact on a number of industries. On the 
software side of things, it introduced a new operating system with a new 
paradigm for interacting with a computational device. Of course, neither 
smartphones nor capacitive touchscreens were new in 2007 and Apple 
wasn't even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Prada">first with combining the two</a>. Thus, arguably, the iPhone was simply 
an incremental improvement on decades-old mobile phones -
and yet it was, of course, something  completely new. Anyone not
classifying it as a "radical  breakthrough" is surely rather alone in
that assessment.
</p>

<p>
Truly atomic and easily identifiable inventions are few, far between and 
often date back a very long time. They're also often discoveries as much 
as they are inventions. Some breakthroughs are old ideas that finally 
become reality thanks to other inventions. I'm pretty sure 
self-driving cars have been a childhood dream for many since at the very least 
Knight Rider in 1982 - and da Vinci's (non-working) concepts for flying 
machines from the late 1400:s have become iconic.
</p>

<h3>It's probably been done before</h3>

<p>
Edwards lists a number of pre-1996 technologies that, in the context of 
his text, can only be interpreted as what he considers to be major 
inventions or breakthroughs. On this point, I agree. I'm not writing 
this to discredit these inventions, or to belittle their inventors - I 
spend almost every day standing on the shoulders of these giants.
</p>

<p>
Most of what's mentioned in the list can however still be traced back to 
something similar that predates it. Lisp, for example, is a curiously 
elegant high level language considering it was invented in the 1950:s. 
The truth is of course that Lisp, despite featuring a lot of novel 
concepts, didn't appear in a vacuum. Its elegance derives heavily from 
mathematical notation and, later, lambda calculus. Other key concepts 
can be found in an earlier language called IPL (Garbage collection however,
is as far as I know, all Lisp).
</p>

<p>
The same can be said about Unix, which builds heavily on concepts in 
Multics, which in turn builds on earlier timesharing systems. Windows 
1.0 was pretty much crap compared to its chronological predecessor, 
Apple's Lisa OS. The story of the Lisa itself is no secret, either: 
Steve Jobs went to Xerox PARC in 1979, took a good look at the Alto and 
Smalltalk, and liked what he saw.
</p>

<p>
Xerox are often blamed for not understanding what they had and giving 
away their killer concept to Jobs, but that's not entirely true. They 
launched the Star in 1981, two years before the Lisa. It was the first 
commercial machine with a desktop metaphor. This was derived from the Smalltalk 
GUI, which was inspired by Douglas Engelbart's NLS (as featured in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">The Mother of All Demos</a>),
which was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a>. Smalltalk as a language 
builds in part on Simula, which introduced a lot of the concepts of 
modern object oriented programming. C++ is heavily influenced by Simula and,
of course, C.
</p>

<h3>Actual origins</h3>

<p>
This is where we can start identifying some kind of chronological 
tipping point. Simula, Lisp, Sketchpad and Engelbart's NLS - together 
with Algol, Fortran, Basic, artificial intelligence, 
multitasking/timesharing, networking, full screen text editors, 
relational databases and hypertext - all appear in a seemingly golden 
era between roughly 1955 and 1969.
</p>

<p>
This was the infancy of the digital general purpose computer. The ENIAC, 
being the first (although - of course - drawing heavily on earlier 
machines and research), was constructed in 1945. A decade later, the use 
of such machines had spread to comparably wider circles, which not only 
tickled the imaginations of some very fine visionary minds but also in a 
more hands-on sense called for simpler and quicker software development 
practices.
</p>

<h3>Post-1996 examples</h3>

<p>
The Internet boom irrefutably happened some time during the middle of 
the 1990s, so I agree that its effects began to clearly 
materialize in 1996. It's true that most of the makings of current 
software technology were already in place by then, but they too build on 
earlier inventions and improvements.
</p>

<p>
From his list of "new" things, Edwards omits CSS, 
XML (both from 1996), XMLHttpRequest (introduced in 2000) and JSON 
(conceived sometime shortly thereafter). This quartet forms the basis of 
the modern web and enabled things like single page applications. Of 
course one could quite correctly argue that these are simply incremental 
improvements upon earlier concepts, but that's also true of the web 
itself: Engelbart demonstrated clickable links in 1968, laying the foundation
for several following hypertext systems.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript hardly 
appeared out of thin air, either. It was influenced by a plethora of 
other languages and the concept of embedded scripting was already widely 
spread. Microsoft's VBA, for example, appeared two years earlier.
</p>

<p>
The combination of HTML, JavaScript and the DOM can be seen as a continuation
of PostScript, a Turing complete document formatting and presentation language.
</p>

<h3>Cashing in</h3>

<p>
The notion of programming as a get rich quick scheme was surely helped by 
the dotcom bubble, but seemingly unlikely 
overnight success in computing predates the Internet boom by more than a 
decade. I suggest that it's linked to the home computer revolution rather than 
the Eternal September. Bill Gates (no introduction needed), Ken Williams 
(Sierra On-Line), John Carmack (Doom) and Gary Kildall (CP/M) are all
examples of this, but there are many more success stories from this time.
The computer game Lemmings, for example, was released in 1991 and has since
sold a whopping 20 million copies.
</p>

<p>
I also think Edwards inadvertently stumbles into the trap of survivor 
bias. Just like with early home computer programmers, most web developers 
didn't - and still don't - get rich. For every success story there's also
a massive amount of failures - some of them so spectacular they've become
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo.com">legends in 
their own right</a>.
</p>

<h3>Trickle down inventions</h3>

<p>
Claiming that we're still using a 50 year old OS with 30 year old text 
editors to write code in 25 year old languages can be tempting - but as 
I hope I've demonstrated above, the roots of almost all of those can be 
traced even further back and Edwards' choice of baseline technologies
can just as easily be dismissed as mere incremental improvements.
</p>

<p>
The fact that a contemporary programmer can get work done on a 30 or 
even 50 year old system doesn't mean they necessarily want to: there has 
been significant progress since then, albeit in - yes - increments.
</p>

<p>
Editor-wise, a programmer of today sent back to the early 1990:s would 
probably miss things like multi-language support and integration with
version control and linters. Even simple things like columnar marking, syntax 
highlighting and multiple document interfaces weren't standard editor 
features in 1990 - though the concepts were surely invented earlier. 
Python was released in 1991, but our time travelling coder is likely to 
be rather disappointed: list comprehension, while itself nothing new, 
wasn't introduced in the language until nine years later, in 2000.
</p>

<p>
In fact, most programmers probably didn't even use a multitasking 
operating system in 1990: Some improvements trickle down slower than 
others, in part because of hardware limitations, in part because of the 
curious whims of the software market. From a vantage point at MIT, it might 
seem as if little has changed during the …</p></div></div>

<p><small><em>page updated on December 31, 2020</em></small></p>

<p>The early days of the (public) Internet felt like living in the science
fiction world of a Bruce Sterling or William Gibson, whether finally being able
to download a web browser with image support (Slipknot?) or realizing that you
were logged into a machine in Australia from the middle of farm country USA and
it was responding to your FTP commands.</p>
<p>To everyone who'd learned how to type on an old PS/1 computer running
WordPerfect for DOS—with the little plastic overlay giving you the
keyboard shortcuts for formatting hints—and for whom Alt-F3 "Reveal
Codes" made word processing make sense, HTML was the easiest thing in the world
to learn (even if the best design you could do was center things with
tables).</p>
<p>Your author remembers the first time he came across a web page which
<em>changed</em> when you reloaded it. Some university student had set up the
official homepage for a band and every new page view displayed a different
snippet of lyrics. These web pages weren't simple documents. They were
<em>programs</em>. This was science fiction. This was living in the future.</p>
<p>Then came forms and server side processing and your author graduated from
college and learned Java and scrounged together spare parts at work to build
his own Linux machine and learned that the Internet wasn't magic science
fiction. It was all programs and protocols, and the greatest magic protocol of
them all at that time was HTTP, especially when combined with the new HTML
extensions for form submissions and the Common Gateway Interface that let a web
server launch programs to process form parameters and produce a fresh batch of
HTML.</p>
<p>CGI programs could be anything. You could write them in a shell script on an
HP-UX or Irix box. You could write them in C. Netscape tried to make money
selling server software where you could write them in JavaScript (and oh how
everyone laughed).</p>
<p>Like almost everyone in the late '90s during the Internet boom, your author
learned Perl.</p>
<h2>Why Perl Won</h2>
<p>Perl was already everywhere, at least on the serious machines you wanted
connected to the Internet. (Microsoft was still struggling to understand why
you'd want to connect to the Internet. Then again, in the 2010s, Microsoft
started to wonder why you would want a computer which <em>didn't</em> behave
exactly like a tablet. Legions of gamers cringe as they consider a Halo 5 where
you must tap your TV screen to fight off the Covenant and Prometheans.) Perl
was everywhere because it was a good language for system administration,
bridging the gap between C and shell. Shell was a terrible language, mostly
because it didn't run the same way everywhere and it didn't handle things like
variables or functions very well.</p>
<p>Perl was everywhere, at least in the Unix world. It was good at manipulating
strings. Back in those days, HTTP and HTML were all stringy protocols. You get
a string, you parse it, and you emit a string. It was a mess, but it was a
simple mess and it was a small mess, so you could get away with it—more
importantly, you could get your work done before you figured out where you'd
gone wrong with string handling in C.</p>
<p>Perl was on version 5 of the language, as exemplified by the second edition
of a book called <em>Programming Perl</em>. You could walk into a room full of
techie cubicles and find that book on at least one desk, all dog-eared and full
of Post-its, because in any group of a couple of dozen
engineers/programmers/techies in those days, one of them was running a little
webserver on a Linux box under his or her desk and odds are he or she was using
Perl.</p>
<p>The code wasn't great. A lot of it was copied and pasted and modified and
downloaded and modified again from the kind of technical support forms that
StackOverflow has mostly thankfully (and almost entirely humorlessly)
supplanted.</p>
<p>But it worked.</p>
<p>Perl <em>did</em> have the advantage of momentum and ubiquity and efficacy
in those days. Then it lost. It seems competitive languages have eaten its
lunch. Why?</p>
<h2>Perl Wasn't and Isn't Perfect</h2>

<p>You can make the argument (and you're correct to do so) that people didn't
learn Perl for the sake of learning Perl. You can also make the argument that
people didn't really learn Perl at all—they learned enough to modify
programs that almost worked right to work a little bit righter. You can argue
that, but you're missing the important point: that's what people
<em>always</em> do. It looks different on the web now these days with bigger
frameworks and more choices and Google and StackOverflow replacing internet
relay chat and random web forums, but it's not materially different now than it
was then.</p>
<p>Goodness knows, Perl's core documentation is an updated version of the
venerable Camel book: thousands of pages of instruction on how the language
works and how to use it, at the fingertips of everyone who used it. If you want
a book, you can get one, but it ships with one.</p>
<p>Some people argue that learning Perl is easy, with the right training, such
as O'Reilly's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491954329/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1491954329&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trendshare0c-20">Learning
Perl</a> or <a href="https://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl_2016/">Modern Perl 4e</a>,
but that argument relies on improvements made in the 2010s, after Perl had
started to stop winning.</p>
<p>Perl as a language had its quirks and flaws. It still has some of those
flaws and it definitely has those quirks. Perl's ease of using external
binaries within programs made it great for gluing things together, but there
were multiple documented cases of security holes and unintentional bugs from
people using backticks in <a href="http://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl_2014/01-perl-philosophy.html#Y29udGV4dF9waGlsb3NvcGh5">scalar
or list context</a> and not knowing the difference and exposing sensitive
information.</p>
<p>People writing code by copy and paste and modify didn't learn the nuance of
the Perl philosophy which makes context important in part because people
writing code in that fashion don't learn the philosophy of <em>any</em>
language and in part because no Perl tutorial really explained the philosophy
of the language in an accessible fashion until 2010's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985451947?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=outspeaking-20" rel="nofollow">Modern Perl</a>.</p>
<p>Is learning Perl hard? No. Not learning it is the hard way to learn it, but
Perl is dead easy to learn just enough to be useful.</p>
<h2>Ease of Beginning is Better than Eventual Perfection</h2>
<p>The execution model of CGI programs was simple and awful in its simplicity:
the web server would launch a new separate program and provide all of the data
received by the web browser to that program. It would listen for data produced
by that program and send it to the web browser. That doesn't sound awful, but
if you're reading this, you've probably replaced a couple of smartphones with
many times more memory and processor power than the web servers back in those
days had.</p>
<p>Launching a new program for every page requested was a little bit expensive
once your site became a little bit popular.</p>
<p>Even though that model of operation is conceptually straightforward to
understand (just launch a program), configuring your web server to execute
these programs (written in any language by any user) wasn't as easy as it
sounds. If you had a good system administrator, he or she would have set up the
web server to give every user a specific directory in which to put these CGI
programs where they'd run but not expose the world to security holes. If you
had a Linux box under your desk and you were your own system administrator, you
had to learn about directory structures and permissions and paths and the
details of how your web server was compiled and configured. Again, it was
relatively straightforward, but there was a lot to learn and there were a lot
of ways things could go wrong.</p>
<p>None of this was Perl's fault. It was a consequence of the Unix model
meeting the Internet and a lot of intelligent people figuring out the simplest
way to get something working quickly without necessarily thinking about the
<em>best</em> way to build something which would have to last for 20 years and
counting. (See also DNS, SMTP, FTP, NNTP, IMAP, IMAPS, SSL, TLS, et
cetera.)</p>
<p>Web programs were easier to write in Perl than they were in C because Perl,
as a language, made them easier, but the dominant execution model of Perl
programs was slow and expensive and difficult to configure.</p>
<p>A web server is just a program, however. If you modified the program, you
could make it do anything—including connecting it with a different
programming language. In fact, you could put Perl in the web server so that you
could simplify the configuration of these programs <em>and</em> not pay the
price of loading every program anew for every request.</p>
<p>This is what mod_perl did. Of course, mod_perl was part of making the Apache
httpd web server more configurable by giving it a plugin architecture where you
could write extensions to the web server to customize every part of the web
server request and response cycle, so mod_perl became less a way to make
writing and deploying Perl programs simpler and faster and cheaper and more a
way to write your own extensions to Apache httpd in Perl instead of C (because,
again, Perl was a better language for web programming than C).</p>
<p>This was great, until it wasn't. It addressed part of the problem but it
didn't address other parts of the problem. Installing and configuring mod_perl
wasn't trivially easy. It was downright difficult in some cases. You
<em>could</em> get a speed boost from using it, by trading some memory up front
for less memory used later, but every program attached to mod_perl could
potentially access the memory space of every other program attached to
mod_perl, even if both programs belonged to <em>different</em> users.</p>
<p>mod_php solved this problem. PHP was a terrible language back then, good
mostly for making very simple templates which represented web pages. PHP's
memory model fit mod_php better, though. PHP's deployment model was a lot
simpler, too. No one wanted to write Apache httpd extensions in PHP because it
was a template language, so there was no pressure to make mod_php anything
other than a very simple template processor which happened to be easy to
deploy.</p>
<p>In fact, it was so easy to deploy that people <em>used</em> it. System
administrators set it up because it was so easy to do they couldn't
<em>not</em> do it. People …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is on the rise, the economy is on a decline and businesses are re-structuring themselves around what many consider the new normal. Increasingly more organisations are opening themselves up to the possibility of working remotely beyond just the temporary measure in the fight against COVID-19. Many begin to see remote work as not only a necessary consequence, but rather as a new opportunity to diversify their workforce, increase employee productivity and cut some cost. The biggest cost saving obviously comes from office space, and not just in terms of raw square footage but also in location. When previously companies had to boast huge HQs in expensive areas, now they can spread themselves thinner across more affordable cities. Another big cost saving can come from employee salaries. A more distributed workforce and more work from home opportunities will inevitably mean a bigger talent pool competing for the same open positions, effectively giving employers a bigger choice.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to existing employees' salaries the direction taken by big tech companies couldn't be of starker contrast. Companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-50percent-of-facebook-employees-could-be-working-remotely.html">Facebook or Twitter</a> have made it clear that employees who choose to relocate to more affordable cities can expect big cuts to their existing salary whereas companies like <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/10/27/evolving-reddits-workforce/">Reddit announced that they won't reduce the salary of any of their 600 US workers</a> regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>These recent announcements have revived a <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-employee-compensation/">long standing debate</a> around the topic of <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/equal-pay-for-equal-work-at-a-remote-company/">equal pay for equal work</a>. Before COVID-19 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/28/why-we-pay-local-rates/">GitLab has already sparked a lot of controversy</a> around the concept of "cost of living" adjusted salaries. At GitLab two engineers who perform the exact same work could get vastly differently compensated based on where they live. It doesn't require a lot of imagination to understand that such policies can alienate a lot of good people and further contribute to the perception of an ever growing inequality gap. Personally I find cost of living adjusted salaries very problematic as they deflect from the real market forces which come into play. Those should be a decent minimum living wage and the forces of demand &amp; supply. If someone is a professional in a niche market, a rare specialist in a scientific field or an exceptionally sought after engineer then cost of living should have no say in determining their pay. Those so called knowledge workers are often higher in demand than there is supply. A good indicator for the scarcity of one's profession is when their employer recruits talent from all across the world and advertises unique perks such as relocation bonuses, dental care or exceptional holiday packages. These benefits would not exist if there wasn't a fierce competition for a particular skill.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real economics at play, it still comes down to a good old negotiation where each person has to stand up for their own beliefs and reach an agreement on their pay. If you find yourself in a situation where your current salary might be at risk due to recent relocation then hopefully the following write-up can help you to negotiate equal pay for equal work. It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.</p>
<h2 id="same-duties-same-pay">Same duties, same pay</h2>
<p>If you're reading this blog post then you're most likely not being paid for your time or place of work. You are being paid for your knowledge, your skills, your duties, the challenges which come with your work and most importantly the responsibilities of your role. Your professionalism and your personal commitment which you bring to your every day job will not diminish when you move into a new place. Whether you work remotely or not, you will still contemplate over that tough work problem in your spare time. You will still lose sleep over that big presentation the next day. You will still stay up late to meet an important deadline by the end of the month. You do it because you take pride in your work. You do it because of a sense of personal accountability to your team. It is those qualities which have earned you the trust of your manager over the years. It is those qualities which earned you a pay rise long ago. Changing postcodes doesn't take away your accomplishments from the past. Changing postcodes shouldn't take away the things which you have already earned before.</p>
<h2 id="same-value-same-pay">Same value, same pay</h2>
<p>The value of your contributions hasn't been compromised by moving house. Customers still pay the same price for the products which you have helped to build. Sales figures didn't drop when you went remote. Why should your employer reduce your pay when they are not passing that cost saving onto their customers by cutting their own price? Based on the same principle why your employer won't reduce their prices when downsizing office, you also shouldn't accept a lower salary after moving place. The concept is the same and you shouldn't accept one principle for them, but another for yourself. As you continue to deliver the same value and quality as before, you equally deserve the same compensation in return.</p>
<h2 id="your-savings-their-savings">Your savings, their savings</h2>
<p>Let's be clear, when you transitioned from office to home it's not like you're the only one who benefited from a lower cost of living as a result. Whatever savings you might have made on your rent, your employer does now too. Every person in an office requires an extra desk. Every additional person requires a fraction more of bathroom space. More people mean bigger kitchens, bigger break out areas, more meeting rooms, larger hallways, bigger stairways and more facilities to comply with fire safety regulations. There is more pressure on lifts to avoid bottle necks during peak times. There is more building maintenance work to be done and more frequent cleaning intervals required. A bigger workforce automatically means more individual needs. Extra bicycle storage rooms, canteens, car parks, private offices, outdoor spaces, a bigger selection of refreshments and a larger variety of office perks are just a few to name. Unless your employer is prepared to share their own operational saving directly with you, why should you share your personal operational saving with them? Fundamentally their savings are theirs, and your savings are yours.</p>
<h2 id="their-profit-your-profit">Their profit, your profit</h2>
<p>Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer re-structured themselves to benefit from lower tax? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer opened up a new factory in a less regulated place? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer outsourced a call centre into a country without minimum wage? Probably not, because it was your employer and not you who took the risk. Guess what, when you are courageous enough to relocate to a different country, city or state, then any financial gains from your move are also only yours to claim. This shouldn't be a huge surprise as nothing comes without its own significant risk. Economic security, social safety nets, unemployment benefits, retirement support, access to public health services, cost of qualitative education or medical treatment are often some of the compromises which have to be taken into account. Simple things such as free playgrounds for children, access to public recreational grounds, well maintained parks, a good public transport system funded by tax or basic luxuries such as political stability or the ability to safely park a new car on a public road are many other cost calculations not to be dismissed. Of course this is not always the case, but those considerations are for you to make. Nobody else, particularly not your employer, who has a financial interest of dismissing or downplaying those issues should be making those calculations on your behalf. This is such a basic principle that it's almost offensive to suggest the opposite. Your employer should not decide what sort of lifestyle you deserve.</p>
<h2 id="higher-cost-higher-pay">Higher cost, higher pay</h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, working from home is not cheap. First of all, working permanently from home requires an entire additional room. If your family lived in a three bedroom house before, now you need four.
Thanks to COVID-19 most will agree that working from a sofa is neither practical, nor sustainable or realistic by any means. A proper office desk and a good ergonomic chair are a necessity at the least. Those requirements alone make a legitimate home office significantly more expensive than many would like to admit. Throw in a couple of monitors, a qualitative web cam, microphone, printer, shredder, peripheral devices, a whiteboard, noise cancelling headphones, a mesh router and a backup laptop (assuming you'll get a work laptop provided) then the true cost of a home office begins to reach eye watering levels.</p>
<p>Some employers will try to provide you those supplies, but any seasoned remote worker will tell you to decline such an offer. After all you're still equipping your own personal home. You shouldn't have to pick from a selection of office desks which don't match your walls. You shouldn't have to settle on a chair which doesn't appeal to your eye. You shouldn't have to accept a black bezelled screen when all your other equipment is in space grey. Most importantly though, you want to treat those things as your own. You don't want to change your monitors when you change your job. You don't want to have to go through your employer to make a warranty claim. You don't want to ask for permission to replace a worn out chair. Instead you want to get a pay rise which allows you to set up your home office in the most productive way. If your employer is smart enough then they will not want to manage all of that inventory (which they never get to see) either.</p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, the true cost of working from home does not stop there yet. When working remotely nothing disrupts productivity more than a low bandwidth internet connection. One cannot …</p></div></div>

      <h2>The first two hours of Kakoune in two minutes</h2>

<p>Learning a new editor can be a daunting task, especially when
coming over from a non-modal editor. I personally started with
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, and it took me weeks to be
productive when I started using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. The modal paradigm
is a powerful tool, but picking it up is generally not a painless experience.</p>

<p>When I discovered <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a> a few years ago, it felt
like the jump from Vim to it was even bigger than the one I’d made when
transitioning over from Emacs to Vim. Despite the two being fairly close on
paper, one still needs to unlearn all the muscle memory patiently cultivated
over the years and grow it back up from scratch. If we ignore the fact that
in those days the only (comparatively sparse) documentation was centralised
in the README file of the project, which might have contributed to why the
jump made itself felt so strongly, new comers still have to primarily
focus their efforts towards learning the “modal language”, or flavour,
of Kakoune.</p>

<p>In order to save them some time, whether they’re disembarking off the Emacs
(non-modal) or Vim (modal) boats, I’ve documented in the following article
some common configuration options. They won’t fit anyone’s workflow exactly
right, I trust the user to tweak the settings how they see fit. They will
however allow turning the two hours it would have taken me to figure out
what lines to write down in my user configuration to get a boilerplate setup
going into two minutes — the time it takes to read this introduction and
save the final
<a href="https://lenormf.github.io/community-articles/assets/download/two_hours_two_minutes/kakrc"><code>kakrc</code></a>
onto one’s system.</p>

<p><img src="https://lenormf.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/two_hours_two_minutes/screenshot.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="the-configuration-file">The configuration file</h2>

<p>You’ll find below an inlined, commented configuration file to steal from. You
can also
<a href="https://lenormf.github.io/community-articles/assets/download/two_hours_two_minutes/kakrc">download</a>
it directly, and save it as <code>~/.config/kak/kakrc</code> (or
<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kak/kakrc</code>).</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Set the colour scheme
colorscheme kaleidoscope-dark

# Width of a tab
set-option global tabstop 4

# Indent with 4 spaces

# Always keep one line and three columns displayed around the cursor

# Shortcut to quickly exit the editor
define-command -docstring "save and quit" x "write-all; quit"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="explanations">Explanations</h2>

<p>These explanations expand on the purpose of the lines in the above file,
the salient parts in them, and hopefully give you a bird-eye view of the
various configuration instructions you might recognise in the
<a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=kakrc"><code>kakrc</code></a>
configurations of more advanced users.</p>

<p>The details are intentionally glossed over and might seem fuzzy, feel free
to refer to the list of recommended further readings at the end of this
article if you’re curious.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Set the colour scheme
colorscheme kaleidoscope-dark
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Kaleidoscope colour scheme (also known as theme) is a high-contrast,
colour blind friendly palette of colours that should suit the largest subset
of users, at first. You can go for the dark variant (<code>kaleidoscope-dark</code>)
or the light one (<code>kaleidoscope-light</code>).</p>

<p>If you don’t care either way, comment this line and the default theme will
do just fine.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Width of a tab
set-option global tabstop 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Options are scoped, which means that they can hold different values depending
on the context in which they’re being used. For general configuration
purposes, use the <code>global</code> scope.</p>

<p>The <code>tabstop</code> option holds the amount of space characters that tabulation
characters (stored in a file opened with Kakoune) will be rendered as.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Indent with 4 spaces
set-option global indentwidth 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This option impacts the behaviour of a couple of primitives (a primitive
is a “key”, more details about keys/primitives below) that indent or
de-indent a line, in normal mode.</p>

<p>In non-modal editors, hitting keys results in the letter associated with them
being inserted into the buffer (the “file”) as-is. In modal editors,
this behaviour applies only to the “insert mode”, which can be entered
by hitting <code>i</code> in normal mode — which is the default mode when starting
Kakoune.</p>

<p>The <code>indentwidth</code> option dictates how many space characters are inserted
or removed when using (respectively) the normal mode primitive <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code>.</p>

<p>Note that when editing a file that is recognised by the editor, manual
indentation of lines should not be necessary, as that side-effect will be
handled automatically upon hitting the return key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Always keep one line and three columns displayed around the cursor
set-option global scrolloff 1,3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When scrolling around a large file, the cursor tends to stick to the borders
of the window if more content needs to be displayed. You can have the window
show more context (i.e. lines and characters) when that happens with the
<code>scrolloff</code> option.</p>

<p>The first integer (<code>1</code> above) in the comma separated pair is the amount of
lines to show above/below the cursor when it hits the top/bottom of the
window, and more lines remain to be displayed in the file.</p>

<p>Similarly, the second integer (<code>3</code> above) is the amount of characters
displayed on the left/right when the cursor hits the left/right hand
window border.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Display the status bar on top
set-option global ui_options ncurses_status_on_top=true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Kakoune follows a server/client architecture, and the behaviour of the user
interface (run by the client) can be tweaked via <code>ui_options</code>. It accepts
a list of equal-sign separated key/value pairs, and the above instructs
the NCurses client (default) to display the status bar on top.</p>

<p>Feel free to comment this line if the default behaviour (status bar on the
bottom) suits you.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Display line numbers
add-highlighter global/ number-lines -hlcursor
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Highlighters are decorators for the window or the text it contains. Similarly
to options (c.f. above), they are scoped, but we only care about their
<code>global</code> value. You might have noticed however that the above line uses
<code>global/</code>, and you might be tempted to remove it on account of it being
redundant — don’t, the character is significant.</p>

<p>The <code>number-lines</code> highlighter displays a file’s line numbers on the left
hand side of the screen. The <code>-hlcursor</code> flag allows highlighting the number
of the line that the cursor lies on.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Highlight trailing whitespace
add-highlighter global/ regex \h+$ 0:Error
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This line adds a <code>regex</code> highlighter which decorates trailing whitespace
with the built-in <code>Error</code> face. The number refers to the index of the match
within the regex. For instance, <code>0</code> refers to the text matched by the regex
(but not to the entire line).</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Softwrap long lines
add-highlighter global/ wrap -word -indent
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>wrap</code> highlighter applies “soft wrapping” (e.g. the lines appear
broken up, but no newline characters are inserted into the file itself)
to lines that cannot be fully displayed within the window. The flags passed
to it keep words whole, and the indentation of the lines newly created will
have the same indentation level as their stem.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Clipboard management mappings
map -docstring "yank the selection into the clipboard" global user y "&lt;a-|&gt; xsel -i&lt;ret&gt;"
map -docstring "paste the clipboard" global user p "&lt;a-!&gt; xsel&lt;ret&gt;"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mappings (also known as “key bindings”, or more simply “bindings”)
allow customising the side effect upon hitting a key. Here is a breakdown
of the two lines above:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>map</code>: declare a new mapping</li>
  <li><code>-docstring "…"</code>: document what the side effect of the mapping is —
this is optional, but is quite helpful when the mapping is set in the
<code>user</code> mode (c.f. below)</li>
  <li><code>global</code>: mappings are scoped, just like options and highlighters</li>
  <li><code>user</code>: similar to the insert mode, the user mode is entered by hitting
a key (for instance, <code>,</code>) from normal mode (c.f. below for more information)</li>
  <li><code>&lt;key&gt; "…"</code>: upon hitting <code>key</code>, execute the given list of primitives</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, quite a few concepts have been packed into merely two
instructions.</p>

<p>In terms of functionality, these two mappings copy the current selection
to the clipboard and paste whatever is in it. They’re triggered by hitting
the comma <code>,</code> key followed by respectively <code>y</code> and <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>Read on if you’re not familiar with modal edition, or want to compare
the declaration of mappings in Kakoune with other modal editors.</p>

<p><strong>The user mode</strong><br>
Mappings allow overriding the behaviour of a given key, but since they all
have a specific purpose (c.f. primitives below) by default, one would have
to forego whatever functionality the key being overridden provided with,
in order to instantiate a custom mapping.</p>

<p>The user mode is entered from normal mode upon hitting the comma <code>,</code> key,
and allows “user mappings” to be declared within it. It’s a way to address
the above problem: you don’t have to override default keys/primitives,
you can just place them one keystroke away (“behind” the comma <code>,</code> key)
and be free to pick any key you see fit.</p>

<p><strong>Primitives</strong><br>
The difference between “key” and “primitive” is one of semantic, and both can
commonly be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Keys are referred to as the letter (or symbol, for example the return key)
that is printed on them, on a QWERTY keyboard.</p>

<p>Primitives are triggered by single keys or a combination of them, and can
be invoked from a prompt (interactively) or script (programmatically). They
are referred to using a custom notation that allows combining letters and
modifiers (c.f. below).</p>

<p>When placing those cryptic definitions back into the context of the clipboard
management mappings above, we get:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;a-|&gt;</code>: holding the alt and pipe <code>|</code> keys together to invoke the <code>&lt;a-|&gt;</code>
primitive, which pipes the current selection into a given shell command</li>
  <li><code>&lt;a-!&gt;</code>: holding the alt and <code>!</code> keys together to invoke the <code>&lt;a-!&gt;</code>
primitive, which inserts the output of a given shell command into the file</li>
  <li><code>&lt;ret&gt;</code>: the return key, to …</li></ul></div></div>

  <div><p>In iOS 14.3, Apple added their new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/">app privacy details</a> to App Store listings. App privacy details, which are sometimes compared to the nutritional labels on foodstuff, are details about the data an app collects and the purposes and use of such data. What can we learn by analysing this data?</p>

<p>From the 14<sup>th</sup> of December 2020, all new apps and app updates have to provide information on the data the app collects. This is used to power the app privacy details labelling. On Twitter, videos scrolling through the privacy listing for Facebook circulated immediately after the 14.3 release.</p>

<p>This system is somewhat flawed, because app developers can, at least in theory, lie about the data they collect. Some apps that profess to collect no data, actually turn out to collect a bunch if you read their privacy policy. However, the punishment for being caught lying, removal from the App Store, is a strong deterrent and it’s safe to assume most developers will have been truthful in their accounts.</p>

<p>An interesting side-effect of this, is that Apple has now made available the same data that can be found in terse and hard to parse privacy policies as simple and structured data that can be parsed and analysed. In this post I will do just that i.e. collect and analyse the privacy details for thousands of the most popular apps on the App Store.</p>

<h2 id="collecting-the-data">Collecting the Data</h2>

<p>If you just want to read the juicy details feel free to skip to the <a href="#analysis">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Apple makes the privacy labelling data available for each app on the App Store via an API used by the App Store apps. By reverse engineering the App Store apps I’ve figured out how to make the API divulge this data on a per app basis.</p>

<p>This only gets me the privacy data for a single app, but I want to analyse popular apps. A good source of popular apps are the charts the App Store provides on a per app category basis. An example of this is “Top Free” apps in “Education”. These listings contain up to 200 apps per category and price point(i.e. free or paid).</p>

<p>On the UK store, which is the store I’ve used for all this analysis, there are 24 categories. Each of which have top charts with up to 200 paid and 200 free apps. This means the theoretical total number of apps is 9600. However, because some apps occupy chart positions in multiple categories and because the charts also contain app bundles the actual number is lower.</p>

<p>The full list of categories is:</p>

<h2 id="structure-of-the-data">Structure of the Data</h2>

<p>If you don’t care about the exact details and structure of the data feel free to skip to the <a href="#analysis">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>The structure of the data returned by the App Store API is</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&lt;number&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>

  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>&lt;privacy-details&gt;</code> section of this document is the important bit. It’s an array where each item has the following structure.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"privacyType"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&lt;human-readable-description&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>

<p>The <code>&lt;string-identifier&gt;</code> is one of</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DATA_USED_TO_TRACK_YOU</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><code>DATA_NOT_COLLECTED</code> is used as a marker in which case <code>dataCategories</code> and <code>purposes</code> are both empty and this is the only element in the <code>privacyDetails</code> array.</p>

<p><code>DATA_USED_TO_TRACK_YOU</code> contains details on data used to track you across websites and apps owned by other companies, Apple’s description is <em>The following data may be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies:</em>. For this entry <code>purposes</code> will be empty and <code>dataCategories</code> contain the different data types that are tracked across apps and websites owned by other companies.</p>

<p><code>DATA_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> and <code>DATA_NOT_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> both contain data types with purposes specific granularity. This means that <code>dataCategories</code> will be empty and the different data types are in <code>purposes</code>. Apple’s description for <code>DATA_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> and <code>DATA_NOT_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> are <em>The following data, which may be collected and linked to your identity, may be used for the following purposes:</em> and <em>The following data, which may be collected but is not linked to your identity, may be used for the following purposes:</em> respectively.</p>

<p><code>&lt;data-purposes&gt;</code> is an array of purposes with the following structure:</p>

<p>The different values for <code>&lt;purpose-identifier&gt;</code> are:</p>

<p>These are described by Apple in their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#data-type-usage">documentation</a>, but I’ve added them here for completeness.</p>

<p>Let’s do some analysis of this data</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>The data set I’ve collected contains 9082 combinations of apps and a position in a given category chart. In total there are 9040 unique apps in this data set.</p>

<p>Most charts contain 200 or nearly 200 apps, however <strong>Graphics &amp; Design(Paid)</strong>, <strong>Developer Tools(Paid)</strong>, and <strong>Magazines &amp; Newspapers(Paid)</strong> all have fewer than 90 apps so I’m dropping them from further analysis.</p>

<p>Because the privacy details have only been required for new apps and updates since mid December, not all apps contain information about privacy details. After removing those apps 3164 apps remain in the data set. Breaking this down by chart, several charts have less than 25 apps so I am dropping them from further analysis too. This leaves 3027 apps in the data set.</p>

<p>In total the following charts have been dropped:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Education(Paid)</li>
  <li>Navigation(Paid)</li>
  <li>Sports(Paid)</li>
  <li>Business(Paid)</li>
  <li>Food &amp; Drink(Paid)</li>
  <li>Shopping(Paid)</li>
  <li>Medical(Paid)</li>
  <li>Magazines &amp; Newspapers(Paid)</li>
</ul>

<p>For the analysis there are a few different data points that are interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apps that collect data this is linked to the user and how many such data types they collect.<sup>*</sup></li>
  <li>Apps that collect no data.</li>
  <li>Third Party tracking, i.e. tracking users across apps and websites owned by other companies and the how many(max 32) such data types they collect.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Data that is linked to the user for the purpose of supporting app functionality, that is the <code>APP_FUNCTIONALITY</code> purpose, is legitimate and will be exclude from the following analysis. This leaves 160 data types spread across 5 purposes.</p>

<p>I am excluding data that is collected but not linked to the user, in part to keep down the length of the analysis and in part because it’s the least interesting. I’ll probably do a follow up post on it later.</p>

<p>The questions I’ll be looking at for this analysis are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#free-vs-paid">Do free apps collect more data?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#worst-charts">Which are the worst charts?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#worst-apps">Which apps in the whole data set are the worst?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#oxymorons">Which apps lie subtly about the nature of data they collect?</a></li>
</ol>

<p>But first let’s have a quick look at the data set.</p>

<p><em>Note: The images in this post can be clicked to show larger versions</em></p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of data types collected. The apps that collect zero such data types dominate"></a></p>

<p>As we can see here, most apps collect no data outside of that which supports the app’s functionality. To get a better view of the apps that do collect data, let’s remove the majority of apps that don’t.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of data types collected with zero values removed."></a></p>

<p>Still the amount of data collected is fairly low, but there’s a curious set of outliers somewhere around 120 data types collected. All of those outliers have something in common, see if you can figure it out before I reveal the answer later in the post.</p>

<p>How about third party tracking?</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of third party tracking data types collected. The apps that collect zero such data types dominate"></a></p>

<p>Again most apps don’t collect any data types for third party tracking. Let’s repeat the process from above by removing those that do no tracking.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of third party tracking data types collected with zero values removed."></a></p>

        <p>China Miéville’s novel <em>Embassytown</em> describes a world in which an alien species, the Ariekei, becomes enthralled by a human’s ability to speak their language. What starts out as novelty gives way to obsession, and they become addicted to his voice, their lives falling to pieces, wandering the streets like zombies, tearing the world apart in search of more “god-drug”. Their obsession has nothing to do with the person behind it, but rather the thing he can provide.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve amused myself by operating through the lens that the world is run by ideas, rather than people. We tend to discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">mimetic effects</a> in relation to mass <em>consumption</em> – its distributive effects – but less-frequently discussed is how mimetics affect creators themselves.</p>

<p>I like thinking of people as vessels, which provides a refreshing counterbalance to the well-trodden <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">“great man theory”</a>. Rather than viewing people as agents of change, I think of them as intermediaries, voice boxes for some persistent idea-virus that’s seized upon them and is speaking through their corporeal form. You might think of this as <em>“great prophet theory”</em>.</p>

<p>Ideas ride us into battle like warhorses. We can witness, participate in, and even lead these battles, but their true meaning eludes us. We don’t really know where ideas come from, nor how to control them.</p>

<h2 id="birthing-new-ideas">Birthing new ideas</h2>

<p>Consider the obsessiveness with which creators birth new ideas into the world, which we’ve clinically termed <em>“intrinsic motivation”</em>, but don’t really seem to understand beyond that. We can observe that it is happening, but we don’t know what actually <em>causes</em> someone to drive themselves nearly to death just so they can give an idea a beating heart and a chance at survival in the world. <em>“Because I had to”</em> or <em>“Because I couldn’t stop thinking about it”</em> are symptoms, not causes.</p>

<p><img src="https://nadiaeghbal.com/assets/img/ideas/goodyear.png" alt="goodyear">
<em>One of my favorite recent examples. <a href="https://twitter.com/rivatez/status/1115627936411815937">Via Twitter</a></em></p>

<p>Once ideas find an audience, they’re hard to eradicate. Many a surprised creator has found that they’ve lost control over an idea, watching helplessly as it’s shaped and reinterpreted in ways they didn’t intend.</p>

<p>It is enormously difficult for a successful creator to escape their own idea, because ideas need hosts to survive. Their audience owns them now: creators become like the god-drug to the Ariekei, delivering their goods to a babbling crowd that frantically demands more, more.  The creator must battle their own idea in order to survive, taming it back into submission, or risk being subsumed by its demands.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, I often think about Lil Wayne’s rock album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Lil_Wayne_album)"><em>Rebirth</em></a> here, perhaps because the title is so wistfully aspirational. Lil Wayne tried in vain to “rebirth” himself, but he was widely panned by an audience that wanted him to produce rap, not rock. Because of his prior success, Lil Wayne became a vessel for a certain type of sound that we craved more of. He became “that person” for “that idea”.</p>

<h2 id="the-constraints-of-reputation">The constraints of reputation</h2>

<p>Even after an idea becomes sufficiently popular to survive in the world without a host, it’s still difficult for creators to escape them, because ideas bond to their hosts in the form of <em>reputation</em>, like a virus that lives in one’s body forever. Reputation is the aggregation of ideas that have swarmed your body. Reputation is a list of your chronic afflictions.</p>

<p>It’s strange to think that personal reputation is becoming simultaneously more and less valuable today. Reputation is the currency that powers our social systems – a symbol of your unique value – but at the same time, it’s easier than ever to find substitutes for a particular sound, style, aesthetic, or way of thinking. I think it’s a sign that ideas are winning over people, or perhaps just making their tyranny better known to us, an ominous signal flare shot into the sky.</p>

<p>The way in which we listen to music, for example, has changed. We don’t listen to entire albums as much as we used to. We don’t know as much about artists as we used to. Instead, we combine and recombine until we find precisely the sound we’re looking for, pumping god-drug into our veins, without really caring who’s behind it. Like an artist on an autogenerated Spotify playlist, my “thing” is interchangeable with a lot of other people’s “things” that would give my audience the same fix.</p>

<p>Returning to the Lil Wayne example, if Lil Wayne ever put his foot down and decided to stop making rap, we’d find another artist just like him, someone else who satisfies our desires. Lil Wayne commands an audience when it comes to rap. But his reputation is a devil’s contract: continue to make the same thing, and you’ll be rewarded, but don’t stray too far from the original concept.</p>

<p>Similarly, when an exceptional artist meets an untimely death, we don’t necessarily mourn them because of who they are. After all, we only really know their identity through the lens of the thing they produced for us. We mourn them because their product is scarce, and we can no longer get our fix. When someone says, e.g. <em>“Nobody ever played guitar like Jimi Hendrix”</em>, they’re saying that they crave a sound that feels hard to find elsewhere, not that they miss Jimi Hendrix himself.</p>

<p>Reputation has local value – it’s what distinguishes you within your world – but global demand for most people’s output is fairly elastic. In order to give people what they want, reputation is commoditized, bundled and traded on a global market. Spotify Discover Weekly satisfies the consumer by commodifying the creator. Today, internet creators can build up large audiences without ever becoming truly famous; they may command substantial local power, but their global value is very narrow.</p>

<h2 id="regaining-control">Regaining control</h2>

<p>How do creators preserve optionality? How do they maintain separation between themselves and their ideas, and avoid being consumed by demand?</p>

<p>One approach is to resist definition entirely, which seems like the obvious answer, but is hard to actually pull off well, because it requires engaging in constant battle against the many ideas that will inevitably swarm you. Still, some people find this to be a fun challenge in itself, requiring quite a bit of stealth to swim among the dark ocean depths without being detected.</p>

<p>The more I’ve kept an eye out for this approach, the more examples I’ve noticed among public figures. They’re the ones who always seem to keep coming up with interesting ideas, the generative thinkers that everyone likes to marvel at, but who manage to say a lot and a little at the same time. Kanye West is the canonical example that comes to mind: it’s hard to pin down what exactly he does, or what he thinks about, and yet the things he does seem uniquely “Kanyesque”.</p>

<p>The second approach is to compartmentalize, which is more tedious to manage, but probably easier for most to pull off. We tend to assume that people use pseudonyms or alts for privacy reasons. But alts aren’t always about hiding who you are, but rather keeping your ideas separate from some root identity (ex. one’s legal name), so that you can still remember who you are when the ideas aren’t riding you. [1]</p>

<p>Sex worker Stoya <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/opinion/sunday/can-we-learn-about-privacy-from-porn-stars.html">once likened her choice</a> of an alt to “deciding on a user name for any Internet service or website”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My stage name is less about withholding parts of myself or maintaining privacy than it is a symbol of the idea that I am more than just my job or any other isolated slice of my identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favorite example of this: a friend, who’s a mother of two, recently reflected that her daughter started calling her by her first name, because she wanted to know who she was beyond being her mom. The terms “mom” and “dad” are alts that protect the self, who exists <em>a priori</em> to being a parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://nadiaeghbal.com/assets/img/ideas/multiple-bios.png" alt="multiple bios">
<em>Compartmentalizing: multiple bios for multiple selves. <a href="https://lee94josh.com/About-Me">Via Josh’s website</a></em></p>

<p>Finally, to some extent, I find something sort of satisfying about accepting that ideas have a life of their own. Wielded carefully, they can shield, rather than drain, the creator. For example, actors and directors sometimes talk about making a big box-office hit, so they can do their artsy side project without feeling pressure to pander to an audience. If everyone manages a portfolio of ideas, some will be cash cows, some are risky bets, and others will be just for fun.</p>

<p>Ideas are fascinators that sparkle and dangle in front of the creator, distracting an eager audience from the person behind the curtain. Submitting to the tyranny of ideas gives us the freedom to explore who we are apart from our public reputations. If ideas are living entities that exist separately from our selves, what remains of us?</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>[1] I am skeptical that alts don’t creep into your root identity anyway, but at least you can switch between modes in a more explicit way.</p>

</div>
<p>Emilua is an execution engine for Lua. It fills a role similar to NodeJS for
Javascript. Apart from being an execution engine, the two have leaps and leaps
of differences.</p>
<p>I believe a good first post for this blog would be to clarify the differences
between NodeJS and Emilua. NodeJS is very popular and people try to port its API
to different
languages<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_1" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup><sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_2" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup><sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_3" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>. Even
non-users of Javascript know NodeJS. By describing Emilua in terms of
differences against NodeJS I hope to offer a turbo heads-up. Comparisons also
offer me the opportunity to touch on many other topics that I enjoy.</p>
<p>I’ll also try to make it brief. If needed be, links to some lengthy posts from
other authors that already covered the topic in detail will be included.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_one_color">One color</h2>
<div>
<p>The first difference is Emilua’s commitment to avoid
<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">Bob
Nystrom' two colors problem</a>. The problem has been extensively covered
elsewhere:</p>

<div>
<p>NodeJS redundant interfaces</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript">tls = require('tls');
fs = require('fs');

options = {
    // sync interfaces
    key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem')
};

// async interfaces
server = tls.createServer(options, function(socket) {
    // ...
});</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a nutshell, every function in Emilua has the ability to suspend the caller
function. The runtime will schedule every fiber behind the scenes, and you don’t
need to wrap the function operator call based on the resources the callee will
make use of.</p>
<p>Whereas manuals from some frameworks will instruct you to annotate every call
that might block with <code>await</code>…​</p>
<div>
<p>Pseudocode example on <code>await</code></p>
<div>
<pre><code>n = await read(sock, buf);
await write(sock, buf[:n]);
// ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Emilua won’t force you to do the same. IO scheduling is a transparent
resource. IO scheduling is not part of the function type signature. You don’t
need to break the API just because your function implementation just now
requires IO activity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_is_it_a_coroutine_or_is_it_a_fiber">Is it a coroutine…​ or is it a fiber?</h2>
<div>
<p>The previous point may have been extensively debated, and it was in this debate
that comparisons among the following styles was appropriate:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Events and polling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Callbacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signals &amp; slots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functional patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coroutines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>But Emilua is built around fibers and it is inappropriate to compare fibers and
the previous choices. I’ll now compare fibers and coroutines to make this subtle
point.</p>
<p>Coroutines may be an old concept that suggest language constructs capable to
suspend and resume a function
context<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_4" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup>, but fibers come from attempts to
provide user-space threads, and, as such, will adhere to threads vocabulary. The
presence of threads vocabulary imply a scheduler (i.e. if you call
<code>mutex.lock()</code>, your code doesn’t need to know which fiber to awake next as this
will be taken care of by the scheduler). This difference is noted by authors of
fiber libraries, but rarely stated explicitly, so it’s worth to link one of the
few texts that make explicit the difference:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between a fibers facility and just coroutines is that with
fibers, you have a scheduler as well.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>The difference is important because if you have threads vocabulary, you have not
only vocabulary to express concurrent tasks, but also vocabulary to tame this
very concurrency with mutexes, condition variables, and the like. None of the
previous options of this list — callbacks, promises, coroutines, etc — had such
sync primitives.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
What Ruby calls fibers…​ well, they are nice and all, but I don’t believe
they understood the concept, so ping them about it.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>Here’s a small example, an implementation for the very simple socket-pair
algorithm. First in NodeJS:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript">var net = require('net');

function socket_pair(callback) {
    var result = {}

    var server = net.createServer(function(sock) {
        server.close()
        if (result.err) {
            return
        }
        if (result.sock) {
            callback(null, [ sock, result.sock ])
        } else {
            result.sock = sock
        }
    })

    server.on('error', function(err) {
        if (result.err) {
            return
        }
        result.err = err
        callback(err)
    })

    server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1', function() {
        var sock = new net.Socket()
        sock.connect(server.address().port, '127.0.0.1', function() {
            if (result.err) {
                return
            }
            if (result.sock) {
                callback(null, [ sock, result.sock ])
            } else {
                result.sock = sock
            }
        })
        sock.on('error', function(err) {
            if (result.err) {
                return
            }
            server.close()
            result.err = err
            callback(err)
        })
    });
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Do notice how NodeJS’s lack of sync primitives forces you to write your own
synchronization (the <code>result</code> rendezvous point in the example). Now take a look
at how Emilua will make the task much simpler by enabling you to use the
<code>fiber.join()</code> sync vocabulary:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="lua">local ip = require 'ip'

function socket_pair()
    local acceptor = ip.tcp.acceptor.new()
    local addr = ip.address.loopback_v4()
    acceptor:open(addr)
    acceptor:bind(addr, 0)
    acceptor:listen()

    local f = spawn(function()
        local sock = ip.tcp.socket.new()
        sock:connect(addr, acceptor.local_port)
        return sock
    end)

    local sock = acceptor:accept()
    acceptor:close()
    return sock, f:join()
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And there is a little something else. Preemptiveness isn’t a property exclusive
to OS-provided threads. Runtimes from some languages will manage to deliver just
this property to fibers as well. Emilua will stay out of preemptiveness
(i.e. you’re guaranteed to have a safer environment) just like many others. But
if you’re restricted to cooperative multitasking, you managed to migrate some
scheduling decisions from runtime to compile-time. Most frameworks will stop
here, but Emilua will go just one mile further.</p>
<p>If you moved some scheduling decisions to compile-time, it makes sense to also
move sync primitives to compile-time…​ or, rather…​ <em>scheduling
constraints</em>. Ideally, your code wouldn’t compile when these constraints aren’t
respected. I’m not there yet and there are static analysers waiting to be
written, but the vocabulary to encode the user expectation in Lua is here. The
vocabulary works like C’s <code>assert()</code>. One alternative would be to just rely on
<code>mutex</code>es as usual, but there are these little abusers — like me — of
deterministic suspension points that you’ll never tame, so I’m adding this
little tool anyway to prevent further damage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_opinionated_concurrency_style">Opinionated concurrency style</h2>
<div>
<p>Bob Nystrom’s warning about two colors wasn’t enough.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose your async model; we don’t mind; we encourage experimentation.</p>
<p>If you don’t like callbacks and event emitters, use coroutines and write
blocking style code without actually blocking your event loop!</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>From experience with Boost.Asio, I noticed that you can’t just defer the choice
to the user and get rid of making one. What happened to Boost.Asio is that you
cannot appropriately support any one model.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Limitations from one model infect other models (e.g. orientation towards IO
objects and not threads). This point by itself could give a lengthy article,
but nowadays I’m less concerned with convincing people and more concerned with
respecting my own precious time, so you’ll only have my word here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot rely on the strengths that are exclusive to one model (e.g. disable
interruption at critical blocks). It may seem redundant with the previous
point because it’s just another face of the same coin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You just created a new model. <em>Your “unopinionated” model is a meta-model</em>
that forces every library provider to write convoluted code. Again, another
lengthy article that will not receive a share of my time. If you’re curious,
try looking for libraries built around Boost.Asio that work with the
completion token protocol.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Emilua cares about serving one concurrency style and serving it well: fibers.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>

<p>Boost.Fiber doesn’t need fibers::future::then - just suspend the fiber. If
you need more concurrency than that, launch another fiber. then() is
redundant with coroutine and fiber concurrency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
— Nat Goodspeed<br>
<cite>Boost mailing list, 2018</cite>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_active_style">Active style</h2>
<div>
<p>A friend of mine teached me this principle early on that affected all my future
projects: <em>design your abstractions where the user is an active party on
scheduling decisions</em>. I’ve been calling it the active style and people usually
don’t get it what it is about, but consequences of this design are better
understood (e.g. <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">dealing with
back-pressure</a>).</p>
<p>Ryan Dahl’s successor for NodeJS also got this point covered:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Node’s counterpart to promises was the EventEmitter, which important APIs are
based around, namely sockets and HTTP. Setting aside the ergonomic benefits of
async/await, the EventEmitter pattern has an issue with back-pressure. Take a
TCP socket, for example. The socket would emit "data" events when it received
incoming packets. These "data" callbacks would be emitted in an unconstrained
manner, flooding the process with events. Because Node continues to receive new
data events, the underlying TCP socket does not have proper back-pressure, the
remote sender has no idea the server is overloaded and continues to send
data. To mitigate this problem, a pause() method was added. This could solve the
problem, but it required extra code; and since the flooding issue only presents
itself when the process is very busy, many Node programs can be flooded with
data. The result is a system with bad tail latency.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>

<div>
<h2 id="_emilua_is_more_explicit">Emilua is more explicit</h2>
<div>
<p>Emilua is also just more explicit. Many years ago, NodeJS actually
attracted me. Its API (at the time) was better than the HTTP server libs that
I’d design. It helped to push me forward. Unfortunately it feels like it stopped
in time and didn’t preserve this "pusher" feeling.</p>
<p>What attracted me at the time was its lower-level approach to web protocols. I</p></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Unemployment, hunger, institutional breakdown, and the destruction of social bonds are not symptoms of a virus. They are the indirect violence of class warfare. The pandemic is a convenient scapegoat for the largest upward wealth transfer in modern human history. Under the pretext of a public health policy, elites have successfully waged a counterrevolution that will result in the erosion of working conditions and quality of life for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</strong></h5>



<p>Death, disease, and pandemics have always been part of human life and they always will be. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.8 million</a> Americans die every year and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">56 million</a> people die worldwide.

In 1968 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/1968-flu-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1-4 million</a> people died in the H2N3 influenza pandemic, during which businesses and schools <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stayed open</a> and large events were held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indefinite closures have never before been used as a disease control method on a global scale. These experimental restrictions were shaped by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-exposes-the-problems-and-pitfalls-of-modelling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discredited</a> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196234/covid-19-imperial-researchers-model-likely-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Imperial College Model</a> which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/europe/coronavirus-imperial-college-johnson.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicted</a> 2.2 million US deaths. Many <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-coronavirus-as-deadly-as-they-say-11585088464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epidemiologists</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doctors</a> questioned these doomsday projections and pointed out that there was <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not sufficient data</a> to justify lockdowns.

<p>In March unprecedented policies were rationalized through shocking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J60fQr0GWo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> from northern Italy. The region’s crowded ICUs were presented as a warning for the rest of Europe and the US. Unknown to many was the fact that Lombardy had been severely impacted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/lombardy-italy-coronavirus-doctors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing privatization efforts</a> and a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/557042/hospitals-in-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shrinking hospital system</a> regularly overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a>. This omission by mainstream media played a key role in developing the mythology that economic shutdown could magically eradicate a virus. In reality lockdowns have accelerated a cycle of austerity and created a self-fulfilling prophecy of perpetual crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chronic <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nursing-home-deaths-coronavirus-understaffing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understaffing</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/nyregion/nursing-home-workers-pandemic-jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockdown-induced layoffs</a> in nursing homes severely exacerbated covid’s death toll. 40% of US covid deaths are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/06/16/nursing-homes-account-for-over-40-of-us-coronavirus-deaths/?sh=54afb581300b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">linked to nursing homes</a>. 1 in 6 covid deaths in Vermont were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/02/vermont-nursing-home-covid-genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a single facility</a>. In New York (the state with the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second highest</a> covid deaths per million) hospitals sent over 6,300 elderly covid patients <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/new-york-hospitals-sent-6300-recovering-covid-patients-to-nursing-homes/2502812/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back into nursing homes</a>. Unprotected, underserved, and alone, the elderly are also afflicted by the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/nursing-homes-isolation-virus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow killer</a>” of loneliness. Isolation increases risk of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/loneliness-and-isolation-raise-risk-for-stroke-and-heart-disease-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease, stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/feeling-lonely-increases-alzheimers-risk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer’s</a>. It is <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20180504/loneliness-rivals-obesity-smoking-as-health-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as deadly</a> as obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day.</p>



<p>Financial insecurity will exacerbate these health risks for the elderly. Economic shutdown has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d1fce3e7-428b-4b8a-ab6a-119a38fa1e7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened</a> global pension funds and they may not recover. Millions of Baby Boomers have been forced into <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/11/19/nearly-30-million-baby-boomers-forced-into-unwanted-retirement/?sh=4fb8019d5d7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early retirement</a> without adequate savings. Many Americans are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/americans-are-forced-to-raid-retirement-savings-during-the-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dipping into their retirement funds early</a>. The Congressional Budget Office projects that $2.8 trillion in Social Security funds will be <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/528268-covid-19-damage-to-social-security-to-extend-beyond-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used up in a decade</a> due to the impact of un- and underemployment on lowering contributions.</p>

<p>Outcomes of lockdown are equally grim for children. Even if K-12 schools reopen in January 2021, the average student will have lost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/students-falling-behind/2020/12/06/88d7157a-3665-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 months of instruction</a>. Because literacy and education levels are a main <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2713445/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predictor of longevity</a>, these learning losses represent years of life stolen from students. Moreover, cases of severe abuse and mental-health related ER visits <a href="https://apnews.com/article/anxiety-mental-health-boston-coronavirus-pandemic-massachusetts-004adb5ee0ef17ff4b5e2e294e36ff3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are surging for children</a>. They will also experience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/sunday/covid-quarantine-children-immune-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune systems</a> due to lack of exposure to seasonal viruses and natural pathogens.</p>



<p>For people with chronic health conditions or those in need of urgent medical treatment, the short- and long-term consequences of lockdown are disastrous. In the United States, cancer screenings fell by <a href="https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-economics/cancer-screenings-epic-ehr-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">86-94%</a> in the spring. Many hospitals <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/47-hospitals-closed-filed-for-bankruptcy-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to close</a> due to lack of revenue from routine surgeries and procedures. Hospitals are expected to lose a total of <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2020-06-30-aha-report-hospital-financial-losses-covid-19-expected-top-323-billion#:~:text=An%20AHA%20report%20released%20today,least%20%24323%20billion%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$323 billion</a> this year. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/10/853524764/amid-pandemic-hospitals-lay-off-1-4m-workers-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.4 million hospital staff</a> were laid off in April while private health insurance companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/health/covid-insurance-profits.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled their earnings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the absence of meaningful investments in healthcare infrastructure, the covid mitigation strategies being pushed by federal, state, and local governments are neither credible nor effective. Elected officials routinely amplify raw case numbers in order to stoke fear and blame individuals for viral spread. As a result, we are currently “saving lives” by killing people. This is not an unforced error or a good policy idea implemented poorly. It is an economic agenda disguised as a health protocol.</p>



<h5>The New Caste System&nbsp;</h5>



<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom sends his children to <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/10/30/newsom-sends-his-children-back-to-school-classrooms-in-california-1332811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-person private school</a> while mandating virtual education for California public schools. He announced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/california-covid-lockdown-us-new-cases-hospitalisations-deaths-stay-at-home-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second statewide lockdown</a> just a few weeks after attending an indoor, unmasked <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/newsom-lobbyist-dinner-party-437892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner with lobbyists</a> at a Michelin three star restaurant where meals can cost up to <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2020/9/3/21421335/french-laundry-yountville-thomas-keller-indoor-dining-rich-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$850 per person</a>. Newsom is just one of many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/nyregion/cuomo-thanksgiving-mother.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politicians</a>, elites, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mask-mischief-11595625179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bureaucrats</a> who break the rules. A static social order is being solidified. In our new caste system the wealthy have political and social <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/u-k-to-exempt-high-value-business-travelers-from-quarantine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privileges</a> because they are considered clean and disease-free, while the more low-income someone is, the more they are treated as contaminated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of lockdown enthusiasts in the “work from home” caste is to shift risk away from themselves and onto essential workers and the poor. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201023-coronavirus-how-will-the-pandemic-change-the-way-we-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Only 40%</a> of the workforce can afford to stay home. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/aug/looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of%202020%2C%2043.4%20percent%20of%20U.S.,uninsured%20rate%20was%2012.5%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">43% of US adults</a> do not have adequate health insurance, and only 31% of low-paid workers have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid sick leave</a> compared to 92% of high-paid workers. “Stay home” is the self-congratulatory mantra of professionals who believe that their virtuous behavior prevents them from contracting covid. In fact, income is the <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/covid-19-class-war-death-rates-income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">main determinant</a> of covid mortality.</p>



<p>Lockdown fanatics have helped manufacture consent for a brutal reorganization of labor that will plunge millions of people into serfdom. The work-from-home lifestyle is only possible through the labor of logistics workers who transport, sort, and deliver goods. Currently about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/04/business/us-economy-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million jobs</a> that existed in February have not been replaced. Many workers have been forced to take on part-time, no-contract work, a labor model that is <a href="https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolling back</a> decades of hard-fought protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the Obama/Biden administration, 94% of new jobs created were gig work, and in 2017 <a href="https://www.ilo.org/washington/WCMS_642303/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,to%2043%20percent%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34% of the workforce</a> was employed through the gig economy. Shutdowns are accelerating this trend, with food delivery apps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/nyregion/bike-delivery-workers-covid-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing their profits</a> as workers struggle to get by. Subscription platforms like OnlyFans saw a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Coronavirus-took-their-jobs-away-OnlyFans-let-15175650.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surge in accounts</a> at the beginning of lockdown. In March the company saw a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/style/camsoda-onlyfans-streaming-sex-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% increase in users and 60,000 new creators</a>.

<p>Internationally, workplace closures and supply chain disruptions will result in the loss of <a href="http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_743036/lang--en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">305 million</a> jobs. <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/employment-promotion/informal-economy/publications/WCMS_743534/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.6 billion</a> informal economy workers are at risk of losing their livelihoods. This devastation will be compounded by famine and the increased <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spread of untreated diseases</a> like <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200624103257.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tuberculosis</a>. In July closed food markets were linked to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10,000 child deaths a month</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/business/coronavirus-destroying-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food is being discarded</a> and crops are rotting in the fields while the number of people facing acute hunger this year has doubled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html">265 </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the start of the covid crisis, vocal segments of the American left argued that economic shutdown was a way to resist <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/donald-trump-wall-street-coronavirus-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaires</a> and <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/we-need-a-global-democratic-socialist-response-to-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capitalism</a>. This demonstrated a deep misunderstanding of the way <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-investors-that-are-both-rich-and-smart.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financiers can profit</a> from economic contraction. Many on the left chose to ignore the Biblical scale of the destruction that economic stoppages would cause, arguing that the covid crisis was an <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/quarantine-coronavirus-economy-left-organizing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opportunity</a>. Today the left continues to advance the illusion that <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meaningful relief</a> is possible, while workers’ pensions are plundered, children’s futures disappear, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/07/economy/global-poverty-rate-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">150 …</a></p></div></div>

A useful exercise is to rethink the scenario  by replacing the malicious intent with reasons such as stupidity, stress or  just plain old misunderstanding.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Your five-year old probably isn't making a mess to make your life miserable  but rather because they're a toddler.</p></li><li><p>A social networking website probably didn't flag your content out of malice  but rather due to a faulty algorithm.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Occam's Razor</h2><p>When comparing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Occam's razor originally stated that entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily. In other words, don't complicate things when you don't need to. By shaving off unnecessary additions, the resulting explanation tends  to be less ambiguous, easier to verify, and just plain simpler. Occam's  Razor is often mentioned when selecting a simple solution over a complex  one. Note that this is a slightly stronger form than the principle  intended--reality can be complex and there are cases where the simple  solution is not correct.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>A sore throat during during the winter is probably the result of a cold even though the symptoms match a rare terminal disease on WebMD.</p></li><li><p>The pyramids being built by humans has far less assumptions than the pyramids being built by aliens.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>First Principles Reasoning</h2><p>Break complex problems into foundational elements and use these elements to build your reasoning.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>A first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition that cannot be derived from other assumption or propositions. By attempting to break down problems into first principles and re-constructing solutions using these building blocks, you're less likely to be biased by prior assumptions. This in turn can lead to more innovative solutions.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>A child repeatedly asking "why?" to answers for an initial question is intuitively thinking in first principles.</p></li><li><p>A company building a cheaper product than competitors by investigating ways of using the raw materials firsthand instead of just following existing conventions.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Proximate and Root Causes</h2><p>Discovering the root cause of an event involves looking deeper than the immediate causes for that event.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>A proximate cause is the event most closely associated with or immediately responsible for an observed result. This may differ from the root cause. Getting to a root cause often requires a deep dive into the situation using approaches like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning">Socratic questioning</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">5 Whys</a></p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Post-mortem reports for critical failures generally outline proximate causes and how they stem from the root cause. For instance a website was down due servers running out of disk space which was in turn a result of a bug which in turn was a result of poor testing and so on.</p></li><li><p>A child repeatedly asking "why?" to answers for an initial question is trying to get to the root cause.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Social Proof</h2><p>We tend to copy the behavior of others, especially during times of uncertainty.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Social proof is a term used to describe our tendency to follow the behavior of others. This tendency is amplified if we are uncertain about the situation. Social proof generally guides us into making fewer mistakesâ€”if many folks are doing something, itâ€™s usually the correct thing to do. However, this â€œauto-pilotâ€� behavior can be easily exploited to manipulate our decision making process. For instance, to lead us towards a decision that serves someone else's interests or is incorrect.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Laugh tracks in TV shows and hired clappers in a theater performance can trick us into perceiving the content to be funnier or higher quality than it actually is.</p></li><li><p>Testimonials increase our likelihood of buying a product, especially when they indicate popularity. Terms like â€œbest sellingâ€� or â€œrecommended by 9 out of 10 professionalsâ€� are marketing applications of social proof.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Survivorship Bias</h2><p>We tend to focus on things that survived and overlook things that didn't. This can lead to overly optimistic beliefs.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Survivorship bias occurs when we develop a skewed view of a situation by concentrating on the people or things that survived. Things that didn't survive lack visibility and are overlooked. A common result of survivorship bias is overly optimistic beliefs. By focusing primarily on the success stories, we fail to fully understand why the "failures" did not survive, often just assuming that it's due to a lack of qualities found in the survivors. Looking for counter examples when deriving patterns from success stories can be a useful exercise in combating survivorship bias.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>sWe often attribute the success of famous entrepreneurs solely to their behavior and overlook things like luck and timing. By ignoring the failed companies that followed similar approaches, we might be overly optimistic about the likelihood of our own entrepreneurial success.</p></li><li><p>It's easy to perceive music from the past as being higher quality than contemporary works. Music from the past, however, has gone through a selection process where higher quality works have survived. With contemporary music, we hear the mediocre along with the good.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Reciprocity</h2><p>We tend to feel obligated to repay positive actions towards us (e.g. favors, gifts) even if they are unwanted.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Reciprocity refers to a social norm in which we feel a sense of obligation when receiving positive actions towards us. For instance, receiving a favor or gift can trigger feelings of indebtedness to repay the act in someway. While reciprocity allows one to build relationships and exchanges, it can be exploited to gain someone's compliance to a request. This is because feelings of obligation can be felt even when receiving a positive action we do not want.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Before attempting to sell something, a salesperson may give you a small gift (e.g. a pen or a free sample). Even if this gift is unwanted, receiving it can still trigger a need to repay the gift, usually in the form of purchasing whatever is being sold.</p></li><li><p>A common compliance technique is to start by making a large request that's likely to be rejected followed by a second, smaller request. The second request, which is the intended request, is more likely to be accepted as it's seen as a favor.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Hindsight Bias</h2><p>The feeling that we could have predicted an event after it occurs (i.e. we "knew it all along").</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Hindsight bias is the feeling we get when we perceive an event as being predictable, even though there's little evidence to suggest we could have predicted it. Once the event has occurred, it's easy to work backwards and find explanations. While hindsight bias can result in increased confidence and performance, too much can lead to overconfidence and an inability to learn from experience. For instance, by assuming that we could have done better than others after knowing the results of their actions, we lost an opportunity to understand why those actions were made.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>In court, judgement of a defendant can be clouded by hindsight bias. The jury, knowing the outcome of the defendant's actions, might feel as if they could have predicted the outcome.</p></li><li><p>We may feel that people in the past were less intelligent or innovative than those of the present without acknowledging that they did not access to present day information. Related: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian%27s_fallacy">Historian's fallacy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_snobbery">chronological snobbery</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Confirmation Bias</h2><p>We have a tendency to perceive things in a way that re-enforces or aligns with our preexisting beliefs.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that causes us to see things in a way that confirms our preexisting beliefs. Because it involves selectively collecting and recalling information, the end result is a biased view point. In addition, confirmation bias may also cause us to ignore information that doesn't support our views. Closely related is the feeling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a> which refers to the discomfort we feel when holding contradictory beliefs.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>In social media, we're often shown content that we're more likely to agree with. This amplifies confirmation bias--we only see things consistent with our beliefs resulting a sort of "echo chamber". For more on this, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubbles</a>.</p></li><li><p>Belief in farfetched conspiracy theories can often be a result of confirmation bias. If one tries hard enough, they can find things that seem to support the theory while ignoring the evidence that refutes it.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Scarcity</h2><p>We tend to place higher value on things that are rare and lower value on things that are abundant.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Scarcity refers to our tendency to place value on things according to how rare they are. It's often used as a mental shortcut to assess the value of something based on how easy or difficult is it to acquire. Scarcity doesn't just apply to objects--it can also be applied to things like time and information. For instance, we might place high value on spending some time with a busy individual or getting access to confidential information. Since scarcity can increase our desire for something, it's often artificially created to sell something. A good strategy to combat this desire is to remember that scarcity only increases our desire to obtain something and doesn't affect the actual value we'll extract from it.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Sales techniques likes setting deadlines on promotions or indicating that limited quantities are available are designed to drive up scarcity driven desire for the item being sold.</p></li><li><p>When information is censored, we not only feel a stronger desire to know about it and but also tend to be more favorable to it.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Pareto Principle</h2><p>For many scenarios, 80% of the effects stem from 20% of the causes. This is often referred to as the 80/20 rule.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>In 1896, economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto">Vilfredo Pareto</a> found that 20% of the population in Italy owned 80% of the land. This ratio is commonly cited in wealth distribution (the richest 20% …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

      <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two years ago, I did something that I’d never done in my career before- I left a job
(at <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>) only a few months after starting it. In this post, I want to explain
what happened and what I learned from the experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<h4 id="the-job-switch">The job switch</h4>

<p>Back in the spring of 2019, I decided to leave <a href="https://www.stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I’d
been a software engineer for about a year and a half. The full details are best left
to a separate post, but at a high level I just wasn’t very happy with my personal situation; the
work I was doing in compute infrastructure had the unfortunate combination of being both
overly stressful and underappreciated. At the same time, I felt like my career prospects
were limited because the upper rungs of Stripe’s engineering individual contributor (IC) ladder put
a lot of emphasis on cross-team coordination and other, managerial-like activities that I didn’t
enjoy and felt I wasn’t very good at.</p>

<p>Given how hot the job market was at the time and the number of other, seemingly more interesting
opportunities available, I figured that I had nothing to lose by interviewing elsewhere.</p>

<p>After a few weekends of furiously-paced <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/master-coding-interviews">Leetcoding</a>, I was ready.
Unlike my previous job searches, there wasn’t any particular company that I was aspiring
to get into; instead, I just went through my <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/six-years-of-emails">backlog of recruiting emails</a>
and wrote back to a bunch that looked interesting. Among the messages I responded to was one
about <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>, an autonomous vehicle startup that was attempting to do driverless
grocery delivery.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, I went through the full recruitment slog, starting with lots of
recruiter phone calls, then following up with technical phone screens for a subset of
those, then doing onsite interviews for a subset of those. In the end, I got offers from seven
places, including Nuro.</p>

<p>During the process, I didn’t fall in love with any of the options. But, there
was something that made me feel more optimistic about Nuro than the other choices. Being a
hardware-oriented, robotics company, it was just really different from all of my previous employers,
and, after years of feeling stuck in my career, maybe different was good.</p>

<p>The company was super secretive about its technology; I wasn’t allowed to tour the office, for
instance, because they had hardware prototypes lying around that only employees were allowed to
see. I also wasn’t invited to ride along in their test cars, which would have been both fun and
informative. The external signs were good, though- they had raised a billion dollars from Softbank
and others, and the employee reviews on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor</a> were gushing.</p>

<p>Aside from being in a somewhat different space than my previous employers, another potential
downside was the commute. Stripe and my three jobs before that were all within a 15 minute walk
of my apartment in San Francisco. Nuro’s office was 40 miles away in Mountain View, which was
more than an hour each way by train. But, I had done longer commutes earlier in my career and figured
that I could handle it.</p>

<p>In the end, I went with my impulses and signed the offer. I had my last day at Stripe, took a short
vacation, and then showed up at the Nuro office, brimming with optimism, for my first day two weeks
later.</p>

<h4 id="realizing-my-mistake">Realizing my mistake</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, that optimism lasted for a grand total of 2 days. By Wednesday of my first week,
as I was riding the train home, I realized that I had made a mistake. My colleagues were
friendly and smart, and the company was doing interesting things, but the job just felt like a
lifestyle downgrade to me.</p>

<p>At Stripe and each of my jobs before that, I had had a short commute to a beautiful office, and
got to experience the instant gratification associated with developing purely software-based
products. Now, I was stuck taking a crowded train to a dark office littered with hardware parts,
working on a product that would take many years to reach mass-market adoption due to pesky little
things like manufacturing and road safety.</p>

<p>I had left Stripe seeking an upgrade, but instead I got a downgrade. And, while minor improvements
were possible, it seemed unlikely that things would completely change for the better in the near
term.</p>

<h4 id="getting-back-on-track">Getting back on track</h4>

<p>At this point, I had three choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quit immediately</li>
  <li>Start exploring new opportunities but don’t quit until something better is lined up</li>
  <li>Stick it out for at least a year</li>
</ol>

<p>My first instinct was to take option 1 and just go back to Stripe. When I reached out to my HR
contact, though, I found out that I’d have to go through team matching again and also get a new
offer; even though I’d left on good terms less than a month before, I couldn’t just revert back to
my previous position and pay. This was disappointing, but after giving it a little more thought,
I figured it was for the best because I had left Stripe for specific reasons; going back
to my old job wouldn’t fix those or make me feel better about them.</p>

<p>Another variant of option 1 would be to quit and take one of the other offers I had gotten
during my search. But, I had already rejected those for what I thought were good reasons,
so this didn’t feel like the best way out.</p>

<p>Option 3 was the one that would look the least bad from a resume perspective, and this seems to be
what a lot of people in tech do when they don’t like a job. But, life is short, I was really feeling
unhappy with the choice I had made, and I figured it wasn’t really fair to my colleagues at Nuro to
stick in a job that my heart wasn’t in.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I decided that option 2 was the best fit for me. I continued at Nuro and did my best
to get up-to-speed and to contribute to my team’s work, but at the same time jumped right back
into the job market. In addition to keeping things open with Stripe, I
<a href="https://yolken.net/blog/triplebyte-review">tried Triplebyte</a>, responded to more recruiter emails, and also
reached out to some former colleagues about the companies they were now at.</p>

<p>I then went through the whole recruitment process with a new set of companies. This time,
though, I was a lot pickier about where I interviewed (nothing in hardware or with long commutes!);
after a few weeks, I had four new choices including an updated offer from Stripe. After
a good amount of due diligence, significantly more than I had done in my previous search, I
decided to go to <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>.</p>

<p>When I put in my notice at Nuro, people were surprised that I was leaving so soon, but ultimately
were understanding. I left, took a short vacation, and then started at Segment. Thankfully,
the new job was a much better fit for me, and I’m much happier now!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<h4 id="do-your-due-diligence">Do your due diligence</h4>

<p>Switching jobs is a big deal, and it shouldn’t be done impulsively. Ideally, your due
diligence before signing a new offer should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Meeting with the team you’ll be working with in a low-stress, non-interview setting</li>
  <li>Touring the office and understanding what your specific workspace will be like</li>
  <li>Trying out the commute for a few days (if it’s significantly different than your current one)</li>
  <li>Trying out any new languages/technologies that you’ll be using on the job</li>
  <li>Getting hands-on demos of the company’s products (if they’re not freely accessible to consumers
  already)</li>
  <li>Seeing a summary of the company’s income and expenses over time (if not public)</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning about these things doesn’t guarantee that you’ll be happy in your new job, but it
at least reduces the risk of any unexpected surprises after you start.</p>

<h4 id="its-ok-to-quit-after-a-few-weeks-just-dont-make-it-a-pattern">It’s ok to quit after a few weeks (just don’t make it a pattern)</h4>

<p>When I started my second job search, I was worried that the short
tenure in the job I was trying to leave would be a turn-off to perspective employers. In reality,
however, it wasn’t a big deal- people asked about it, but seemed satisfied with my 20 second
summary and then moved on to other things.</p>

<p>The sense I get is that you’re allowed to quit a new job once in your career without any
repercussions. If you do it multiple times, however, then recruiters and hiring managers might
have second thoughts about interviewing you without strong internal references or some other signal
that you’ll be a good employee.</p>

<h4 id="switch-teams-before-quitting">Switch teams before quitting</h4>

<p>As I noted in a <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/leaving-a-job">previous post</a>, switching teams is a lot easier than
switching jobs. I didn’t do this before I left Stripe because there weren’t any other teams that I
was super enthusiastic about at the time. But, in retrospect, I probably should have given this a
try before quitting.</p>

<p>Even if the new team hadn’t been a perfect fit, it would have at least bought some time and given
me some additional experience that could help in future work. This is what I did at Google
and Airbnb, and in both cases the “second team” was what really opened up new opportunities for me.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>A previous <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">Adalytics</a> post discussed how tens of thousands of articles on the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, and <em>CNBC</em> websites appear to be marked as ‘unsafe’ by brand safety ad tech vendors. The post documented that those brand safety values appear to be utilized in ad auctions and ad server requests, meaning they could potentially be affecting news publishers’ ad revenues.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, journalists at a hedge-fund owned California newspaper <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2020/10/19/mcclatchy-tie-pay-to-clicks.html">declared</a> they were fighting an effort to tie performance reviews based on the “the popularity of their stories as measured by clicks.” Most major news publishers retain a long-standing separation between the revenue and editorial departments of their organizations. However, the mere possibility that ad revenue could in some rare instances bias managerial decisions warrants a further investigation into the factors that may influence the monetary value of a journalist’s content.

This analysis focuses on how content from individual journalists and contributors at The <em>New York Times</em> (NYT), <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (WSJ), <em>CNBC</em>, and <em>Forbes</em> are categorized as safe or unsafe by ad tech vendors. Notably, a number of war correspondents and Pulitzer Prize winners have more than two thirds of their news articles marked as ‘unsafe’ for certain digital ads to display on. Nicholas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Kristof">Kristof</a>, a double Pulitzer Prize winner who frequently advocates for human rights, has over 300 of his NYT articles (60.5%) labeled as brand unsafe. </p><p>A <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">previous</a> exploratory analysis of 22,722 recent New York Times articles revealed that 30.3% appeared to be labeled as unsafe by Οracle Grapeshοt. In this analysis, a more comprehensive dataset of 332,710 nytimes.com articles from 2015 to 2020 was assembled. For each of these articles that used Javascript code from Grapeshοt, a given page was considered to be ‘safe’ if it contained the term ‘gv_safe’ (based on information released in Grapeshοt’s documentation), and ‘unsafe’ if it included any labels such as ‘gv_crime’, ‘gv_adult’ or other unsafe categories. A large number (but not all) articles contained clearly labeled ‘author’ meta tags and ‘section’ meta tags that could be used to group articles.</p><p>The table below indicates which New York Times journalists and contributors had the largest proportion of their content labeled as ‘unsafe’. </p><p>Ali <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ali-winston">Winston</a>, an investigative reporter who  “covers the New York City Police Department” and covered issues of criminal justice and surveillance across the United States, had more than 96% of his articles labeled as unsafe. Numerous foreign correspondents who cover warzones, such as Thomas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-gibbons-neff">Gibbons-Neff</a> and Rukmini <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rukmini-callimachi">Callimachi</a> (four time Pulitzer Prize finalist), had more than 90% of their articles labeled as ‘unsafe’. Double Pulitzer Prize winner and human rights activist Nicholas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Kristof">Kristof</a> had 305 out of his 504 (60.5%) articles labeled as ‘unsafe’.</p><p><i>Table of observed Οracle Grapeshοt brand safety values from <a href="https://nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a>, grouped by journalist or author.</i></p><p>Additionally, it’s clear that certain sections of the New York Times are disproportionately likely to be labeled as ‘unsafe’. For example, 79.3% articles in the "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/obituaries">Obituaries</a>" section and 53.2% articles in the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/world">World</a>” section are labeled as unsafe. This is likely due to the fact that journalists often have to use keywords related to "death" when covering such topics, which may automatically trigger a negative classification.</p><p><i>Table of observed Οracle Grapeshοt brand safety values from <a href="https://nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a>, grouped by section.</i></p><p>As discussed in the previous <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">analysis</a>, the Wall Street Journal (as well as other News Corp owned web properties) appear to be using brand safety technology provided by Οracle’s Mοat division and Cοmscοre. The two vendors provide labels which appear to be incorporated into network requests to ad auctions and header bidding services.</p><p>Based on an analysis of 30,033 wsj.com pages, it appears that a number of journalists have more than 90% of their work labeled as ‘unsafe’ by either Mοat or Cοmscοre. Zusha <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/zusha-elinson">Elison</a>, who covers various gun and police related topics, had 92% of his articles labeled as “moat_unsafe” often due to “gv_arms” or “gv_death_injury”. Ben <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/ben-chapman">Chapman</a>, who “covers criminal justice for The Wall Street Journal in New York”, had at least 104 of his articles marked as "moat_unsafe".</p><p>Katherine <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/katherine-clarke">Clarke</a>, who covers residential real estate, appears to have 74 out of 132 articles (56%) labeled as “brandsafe: unsafe” by Comscore.</p><p><i>Table illustrating how many articles by each WSJ journalist were labeled as "unsafe" by either Mοat or Cοmscοre</i></p><p>There are a number of notable journalists, columnists, and writers who focus primarily on covering various advertising or digital marketing related topics. It appears that these writers are not exempt from having their content classified as “unsafe” by various vendors.</p><p>Megan <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/megan-graham/">Graham</a>, a reporter who covers advertising and marketing for CNBC and previously worked at Ad Age, had 23 out of her cnbc.com 219 articles (11%) marked as “moat_unsafe”. 15 were unsafe due to “gv_death_injury”, 7 were marked as unsafe due to “gv_arms”, and 3 were marked as unsafe due to “gv_tobacco”. The cnbc.com website also appears to use semantic <a href="https://adtechdaily.com/2018/06/21/admantx-launches-its-new-hyper-granular-contextual-taxonomy-for-more-precise-contextual-targeting-in-the-gdpr-era/">contextual intelligence</a> technology from Admantx, a company that was <a href="https://integralads.com/news/integral-ad-science-acquires-admantx/">acquired</a> by Integral Ad Sciences (IAS) in 2019. The Admantx technology does not appear to have binary classifications for “safe” or “unsafe”, but rather, seems to allow individual advertisers to avoid showing their ads on webpages that contain individual keywords. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of what appear to be individual brands’ keyword lists in various Javascript network calls. </p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/81MYYg9VNJb3Dn0IgzFKip0n_Klq2cgY1uOaLrpTRilIF-jJehcKjDJ5Rj3qVl_mKdU1BZVlXY6yFJ_hR4EhjHWloojQSNqi8_eObPXERggchiZgg0hLhnUV4yvFtLEalnJoI4zx" alt="Screenshot of Chrome Developer Tools showing IAS Admantx response values for an article on cnbc.com by Megan Graham"></p><p>The presence of a string ending in “_Neg” or “_Negative” may indicate that a given brand is blocking their digital ads from rendering on a given webpage due to the presence of certain keywords in that context (i.e. “Fidelity_Negative” may indicate that Fidelity wants to avoid having their ads show on that specific webpage). In Megan Graham’s case, 132 of her 219 cnbc.com articles contain the label "Barclays_Negative2" in the admantx.com network response. For example, 202 out 219 of her cnbc.com articles contain the Admantx label 'ErnstYoung_Neg', which may indicate that the British professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young want to avoid placing their ads on 92% of Graham’s articles because they consider them to be brand “unsafe”. Some of the keyword lists include interesting names, such as “IBM_JeffreyEpstein”, which appeared on 154 of Graham’s articles, or “FlexShares_Coronavirus” which appeared on 130 of her webpages.</p><p><i>Table illustrating which IAS Admantx category and keyword labels appear most frequently across CNBC reporter Megan Graham’s 219 articles. Some of these labels may correspond to brand specific keyword blocklists, which prevent a given brand’s digital ads from rendering on a given webpage. For example, the presence of “ErnstYoung_Neg” may indicate that the professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young is blocking their ads from showing on 202 of Megan Graham’s CNBC articles due to presence of certain keywords on those pages.</i></p><p>Sheila <a href="https://www.reuters.com/journalists/sheila-dang">Dang</a>, an advertising-focused Reuters reporter, had 7 out of 193 of her articles labeled as "moat_unsafe". Her February <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-football-nfl-superbowl-advertising-idUSKBN1ZX2JO">article</a> about how "<em>Doritos take top spot in Super Bowl Ads</em>" was categorized as "gv_arms" - this likely corresponds to a Oracle Data Cloud "avoidance category" <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/acquisitions/grapeshot-methodology.pdf">which</a> "avoids webpage textual content
around guns and weapons". Another <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cbs-results/cbs-beats-wall-street-estimates-for-quarterly-revenue-idUSKBN1KN2SQ">article</a> from August, 2018 about how "<em>CBS beats Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue</em>", was labeled as "moat_unsafe" due "gv_crime". This is likely a reference to an avoidance category <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/acquisitions/grapeshot-methodology.pdf">about</a> "sex and violent" crime segments.</p><p>Similarly to Megan Graham, many of Dang's articles also contain Admantx labels which may correspond to brand specific keyword exclusion lists. It appears that a large French luxury goods conglomerate may be blocking their ads from 75.1% of Dang's <em>reuters.com</em> articles. Several large software and banking corporations also appear to take issue with some keywords that appear on 60% of Dang's news pieces.</p><p><i id="reuters-shiela-dang-brandsafety-airtable">Table of IAS Admantx and Oracle Moat brand safety labels for 193 <a href="https://reuters.com/">reuters.com</a> articles by Shiela <a href="https://www.reuters.com/journalists/sheila-dang">Dang</a>.

      <p>Coming up with ideas for your startup’s blog can be mentally taxing. While an <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-audit/">SEO audit</a> can help you find opportunities in Google results, it can leave your blog topics feeling a little bit flat.</p>

<p>One strategy is to publish a mix of SEO-driven content with more creative, shareable posts that help you build organic backlinks and social proof. If you want to make sure you <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/ideas">always have some ideas in the hopper</a>, you need to put a healthy backlog of creative blog post ideas into <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/publishing-calendar">your publishing calendar</a></p>


      


      
<p>Over the past decade, I’ve written a lot of blog posts and I’ve seen many of these ideas work for myself or clients. While not every idea in this list is going to be a good fit for your startup, these might help spark your creativity.</p>

<h2 id="50-startup-blog-post-ideas">50+ Startup Blog Post Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="1-product-awareness">1. Product Awareness</h3>
<p>These ideas are great if your startup is still in the launch and product-market fit phase. Once you start building a collection of posts explaining your product, you can send these to prospective customers to help make your case.</p>

<p>Later on, as your product gains traction, these posts will offer Google searchers authoritative information that guides them into your funnel. If you’re going to start blogging, covering these topics should be at the top of your list.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight a little-known feature of your product.</li>
  <li>Highlight various use cases for your product.</li>
  <li>Write a “how to” guide for using/buying/setuping up your product.</li>
  <li>Create a customer case study.</li>
  <li>“10 ways to solve problem X” (One of which includes your product).</li>
  <li>Mythbusting a problem your product solves.</li>
  <li>Compare your product to your competition.</li>
  <li>Do a screencast or record a video using your product.</li>
  <li>Share an excerpt from an ebook, white paper, webinar, etc. with a call to action to download it.</li>
  <li>Respond to frequently asked questions about your product.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-interviews-and-surveys">2. Interviews and Surveys</h3>
<p>Another interesting way to generate content without quite as much writing work is to compile data from customers, partners, and prospects. I have published many interview posts and compiled the advice from an interview series into a comprehensive guide.</p>

<p>This strategy can net you dozens of blog posts with just a few hours of work, and your interviewees might even share it with their audience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interview customers who are using your product.</li>
  <li>Interview industry specialists.</li>
  <li>Interview someone who used to work for a competitor.</li>
  <li>Interview a professor, recent graduate, or someone who just retired from your industry.</li>
  <li>Interview speakers or sponsors at a conference.</li>
  <li>Ask a question or conduct a poll on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and share the results.</li>
  <li>Do a survey with Survey Monkey (or <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/tools/surveys">one of these other tools</a>) among your community members.</li>
  <li>Get experts to offer a tip and do a round-up of their recommendations.</li>
  <li>Feature guest posts from industry experts.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-roundups">3. Roundups</h3>
<p>Lists of tools, tips, and ideas (like this one) are among the most widely-shared and easily read content on the internet. Readers can skim the piece quickly and use the roundup as a jumping-off point for solving their problems, and <a href="https://www.grizzle.io/listicles/">they tend to rank well in Google</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas for generating lists that might do well on your blog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compile a list of popular sites in your industry (be sure to notify them and encourage them to share).</li>
  <li>Compile the most popular social media posts in your industry this month/year/week.</li>
  <li>Create a list of benefits for doing something.</li>
  <li>Create a list of things to avoid.</li>
  <li>Find tips in other content, create a list of those tips, and give links to those articles as the sources.</li>
  <li>Share a list of conference takeaways.</li>
  <li>Collect the top motivational YouTube videos, ebooks, webinars, or infographics for your audience.</li>
  <li>Collect Tweets from a webinar or conference hashtag, and offer your own takeaways in the blog post.</li>
  <li>Create a list of trends to watch.</li>
  <li>Make a list of products that complement yours well.</li>
  <li>Collect a list of social media accounts people in your industry should follow.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-thought-leadership">4. Thought Leadership</h3>
<p>Positioning your startup’s founders as important leaders in the space is a good way to build your brand and showcase your expertise. Some founders do this naturally, and others work with a ghostwriter. Either way, people in your leadership team should make a point to do some thought leadership content as you get your blog started.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take a stand on a controversial issue.</li>
  <li>Make a prediction related to your industry.</li>
  <li>Industry trends commentary.</li>
  <li>Side-by-side comparison of complementary company/service.</li>
  <li>Review a book your customers should read.</li>
  <li>Point out common mistakes in your industry and offer solutions on how to fix or avoid them.</li>
  <li>Relate your content to a current event or a celebrity (eg: “5 Lessons from Lady Gaga” or “What the Election Teaches Us About…”).</li>
  <li>Take the contrarian position on someone else’s article that you disagree with.</li>
  <li>Share your slides from a recent presentation.</li>
  <li>Respond to industry research with your own perspective. Offer a fresh angle to spark conversation.</li>
  <li>Do an in-depth case study about one company, or offer a few examples of how other companies do something successfully.</li>
  <li>Offer industry takeaways about breaking news.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-team-company-and-culture-focus">5. Team, Company, and Culture Focus</h3>
<p>Finally, if you’re looking to build more content that attracts talent or showcases your team, here are a few ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight your culture, mission, or values.</li>
  <li>Write about “What we’re not”.</li>
  <li>Create a music video for your company.</li>
  <li>Interview each member of your team about their career and experience.</li>
  <li>Post photos from a recent event/conference.</li>
  <li>Post screenshots from a virtual event.</li>
  <li>Videos/photos of employees behind the scenes.</li>
  <li>If someone gets promoted, talk about how/why they were successful.</li>
  <li>Post about the current season or holiday.</li>
  <li>Sum up the year that was.</li>
</ul>

Some people thrive in a high rise tower in the central business district. Mine is a Main Street town of the kind that peaked about a century ago. But there’s another more obscure environment that’s harder to define because it’s more about cultural imperatives rather than physical structures or location.</p><p>A reader reached out to me with a query. He and his wife and three daughters are in search of “a slower, more nature and community bound life, but without leaving behind people who read books, et cetera. I'm forever looking for where Henry Miller's Big Sur is today, or Provincetown, or even the Upper West Side of 1960, or the San Francisco of the early 90s. We have some money, but we don't want to be around people who are money driven.”</p><p>First, note that the desired location isn’t specifically urban or rural. There’s a huge spread between Manhattan and the rugged California coast at Big Sur. Provincetown and San Francisco are in-between versions of Main Street towns at different scales. And I don’t detect an inherent exclusion of a quality suburb in the statement either. The quest is about the intangibles that a place might provide.</p><p>I have to acknowledge the tension inherent in the quote. There’s a yearning for high culture, meaningful engagement with neighbors, and an attractive landscape. These things tend to cost extra and can be scarce. But there’s also a rejection of crass materialism.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great to live in exactly the right place at the right time when everything was still super authentic and affordable, but simultaneously unique and undiscovered? The whole thing is problematic and, let’s be honest, a bit tone deaf in terms of class and such. I understand the impulse. I will admit to sharing this same desire myself. So how to square these romantic notions with external reality without being a complete ass about it? I’ll start by poking holes in the nostalgia.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_35196"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_33388"><div><p>I got a flashback to my best friend Joann circa 1985. She was accepted to a prestigious art school in Manhattan and I helped her get settled into her first rented room. It was in pre-gentrification Times Square in what had once been a dentist office complete with linoleum floors, synthetic wood paneling, orange fiberglass chairs, and fluorescent lights. It felt like a public bus. There was no air conditioning in the sweltering heat of a New York summer. The makeshift kitchenette was equipped with an electric hot plate and an elderly microwave. Technically it wasn't a legal residence, but neither the authorities nor the landlord seemed to care. Code enforcement came years later - with Disney.</p><p>She rented her room from a married couple who painted and made documentary films about their artist friends in the city. Joann paid reduced rent in exchange for babysitting the couple's three year old son. Her bedroom was exactly the size of her mattress since the partition walls had been installed for maximum efficiency. The bedroom door opened outward toward the corridor and she would just fall in on the bed and hang her possessions on hooks like a boat. This was the version of urban loft living that never made it to the pages of Architectural Digest.</p><p>They all lived there because it was relatively cheap and the location allowed them to be close to the people and activities they cared about. They had an extraordinarily high tolerance for alcoholic schizophrenic neighbors. The accommodations were meant to be functional. They didn't strive to transform the place into anything beyond what it was. The apartment was filled with their art and film making equipment and the many visitors they collaborated with. The city was their living room, kitchen, and back garden.</p><p>While Joann was living there the couple bought a modest second home in rural Pennsylvania for about the cost of a nice car. Their goal was simple - provide a place to balance city life and enjoy the countryside with their kid without spending a lot of money. The house was absolutely nothing special and they made no effort to renovate the property beyond basic mechanical repairs. It wasn't in a bougie town with nice restaurants or themed boutiques. They hadn’t searched for a subdivision in a good school district. It was just a random spot in a farm field near nothing in particular.</p><p>What mattered most to them was the freedom that came with low overhead. Their city friends would migrate out with them for summer and winter holidays and they created their own cuisine, art, and conversation. And they read lots of books. They just weren't interested in much beyond the inner world they were busy creating themselves. They didn’t need to purchase culture from a fashionable postal code. They made their own. I learned a lot from that family and their example.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_14048"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_14342"><div><p>Some years later I had a friend who worked at the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/pkhouse/" target="_blank">Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center</a> on the far tip of Long Island which is now administered by Stony Brook University. In 1945 modern artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" target="_blank">Jackson Pollock</a> and his wife, fellow artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Krasner" target="_blank">Lee Krasner</a>, bought the little house on an acre and a half with water views for $5,000. That’s the current inflation adjusted equivalent of $73,000 today. Their patron <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Guggenheim" target="_blank">Peggy Guggenheim</a> provided the $2,000 down payment. Back then the average family earned $2,595 a year so a home could be bought with two years pay.</p><p>This was at a time when the Hamptons were still sleepy country villages and the national economy was only just emerging from wartime rationing. Their neighbors were farmers and fishermen, not financiers or movie stars. They had access to what was sold at the local general store, but not much else. And they were three hours from the city. Pollock struggled with his internal demons until his death in a drunken car wreck along with his mistress in 1956. The life of an artist isn’t always picturesque up close.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_45411"><div>

The organic locavore caterers and spa treatments were still decades away. So were the exquisite country estates that now populate the forest. Miller and the oddball collection of pre-hippie touchy feely types were there because it was beautiful and cheap.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_55944"><p>Miller’s first few books were banned in the United States because they were too racy for American culture at that time. He was on his third wife when he settled in at Big Sur and that marriage ended in divorce as well. Once his two children were grown he was an older man living in a small cottage in the forest alone much of the time. Miller helped establish the mystique of Big Sur, but the wealth that followed made his lifestyle difficult for others to replicate on a normal budget.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_59524"><div>

<p>In the United States, there is something of an intense debate over how the word&nbsp;<em>gyro</em>&nbsp;is supposed to be pronounced. Many people pronounce it /ˈdʒaɪɹoʊ/ (or, to use fauxnetics, “JAI-roh’). Many other people, however, insist that it is supposed to be pronounced /ˈjiː.ɹoʊ/ (that is, “YEE-roh” in fauxnetics). This debate even made it into the recent Disney Pixar animated film&nbsp;<em>Soul</em>, which includes a flashback scene in which a mischievous unborn soul named “Twenty-Two” is portrayed as arguing with the spirit of the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes (lived c. 287 – c. 212 BCE) over the correct pronunciation of the word.</p>



<p>If I were an ordinary pedant, I would simply tell you that the pronunciation /ˈjiː.ɹoʊ/ is correct and that the people who say /ˈdʒaɪɹoʊ/ are wrong. I, however, am no ordinary pedant. On the contrary, I am the most obnoxious and loathsome kind of pedant: a pedant who has spent years studying the Greek language at the university level and who knows far too much about it for my own good.</p>



<p>Therefore, I feel the need to point out that<em>&nbsp;neither&nbsp;</em>of the pronunciations given above is reflective of the actual pronunciation of the word in Modern Greek, since the nominative singular form of the word in Greek is actually γύρος (<em>gýros</em>), with an /s/ sound on the end, and the nominative plural form is actually γύροι (<em>gýroi</em>). Moreover, I feel the need to explain exactly&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;the way the word is spelled in English is so different from how it is pronounced in Greek and to explain precisely how the debate over the pronunciation of the word arose.</p>



<p><strong>A little background</strong></p>



<p>In order to understand the roots of the present controversy over how the word&nbsp;<em>gyro</em>&nbsp;should be pronounced, we need to understand why Greek words are often transliterated in ways that don’t reflect how they are actually pronounced.</p>



<p>In order to understand this, we need to go all the way back to Classical Attic Greek, the dialect of the Greek language that was spoken in the region of Attike, which includes the city of Athens, in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, since, as strange as it may sound, the modern system of transliterating Greek words into English is based primarily on equivalences between Greek letters as they were pronounced in the Classical Attic dialect and Roman letters as they were pronounced in Classical Latin over two thousand years ago.</p>



<p>In Classical Attic Greek, γυρός was not the name of a particular kind of sandwich, but rather simply an adjective meaning “round.” Here’s the breakdown of how the word would have been pronounced in Athens in the fifth century BCE:</p>



<ul><li>In Classical Attic Greek, the letter ⟨γ⟩ was usually pronounced as the voiced velar plosive /g/ like the letter ⟨g⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>got</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨υ⟩ was usually pronounced as the close front rounded vowel sound /y/ like the letter ⟨ü⟩ in the German word&nbsp;<em>über</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨ρ⟩ was pronounced as the voiced alveolar trill /r/ like the letter ⟨r⟩ in Modern Spanish or Italian.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨o⟩ was pronounced as a short close-mid back rounded vowel /o/ similar to the sound made by the letter ⟨o⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>tote</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨σ⟩, which is conventionally written ⟨ς⟩ when it occurs at the end of a word, was pronounced as the voiceless alveolar sibilant /s/ like the letter ⟨s⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>this</em>.</li></ul>



<p>Thus, in Classical Attic Greek, the word γυρός was pronounced /ɡyː.rós/.</p>



<p>During the Hellenistic Period (lasted c. 323 – c. 30 BCE), a new dialect of the Greek language known as “Koine” developed. Koine Greek was based primarily on Classical Attic Greek, but it was also influenced to some extent by other ancient Greek dialects. It became widely spoken throughout the entire eastern Mediterranean.</p>



<p>In Koine, the adjective γυρός was nominalized to become the second-declension masculine noun γῦρος, which means “circle,” “ring,” or “rotation.” Through this nominalization, the accent shifted from an acute accent on the ultima (i.e., the last syllable) to a circumflex accent on the penult (i.e., the second to last syllable), resulting in the noun form being pronounced /ɡŷː.ros/.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-851fdc9c4f7c7e20256617b08febf0ff" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><em>ABOVE: Diagram </em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Circle-withsegments.svg"><em>from Wikimedia Commons</em></a><em> of a circle. The word γῦρος or γύρος in Greek literally means “circle” or “rotation.”</em></p>



<p><strong>Sound shifts in Koine and Medieval Greek</strong></p>



<p>At some point between the second century BCE and the third century CE, the consonant sounds represented by the letter ⟨γ⟩ shifted. From roughly this period onwards, ⟨γ⟩ became pronounced as a voiced velar fricative /ɣ/ before the vowels ⟨α⟩, ⟨ο⟩, and ⟨ω⟩. Meanwhile, it became pronounced as a voiced palatal fricative /ʝ/ before the front vowels ⟨ε⟩, ⟨η⟩, ⟨ι⟩, and ⟨υ⟩. This is a sound very similar to, but slightly different from, the voiced palatal approximant, which is generally represented in English by the consonantal ⟨y⟩.</p>



<p>Other changes in the pronunciation of the Greek language took place during the Middle Ages. By the Middle Byzantine Period, it seems that uneducated people in the countryside of Greece had begun to pronounce the letter ⟨υ⟩ as the close front unrounded vowel /i/, which is the sound made by the letter ⟨i⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>machine</em>. This shift occurred as part of a well-attested process known as “iotacism,” which resulted in the letters ⟨ι⟩, ⟨η⟩, and ⟨υ⟩, which had originally represented three different sounds in Classical Attic Greek, coming to all eventually represent the same sound in Standard Modern Greek.</p>



<p>This shift in the popular rural pronunciation seems to have greatly perturbed the educated elites at the time. In around the eleventh century CE, the Greek writer Michael the Grammarian wrote a satirical poem in which a speaker complains about the way uneducated people in the countryside were pronouncing the letter upsilon. He declares:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Ἐμοὶ πατρίς, βέλτιστε, τραχὺ χωρίον,<br>ὅπου περ ἀνδρῶν καὶ βοῶν ἶσαι φρένες,<br>οἳ το κρύον λέγουσιν ἀφρόνως κρίον,<br>καὶ τὸ ξύλον λέγουσιν ἀγροίκως ξίλον.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This means (in my own translation):</p>



<blockquote><p>“My fatherland, oh dearest one, is a coarse village,<br>where the minds of men and cows are just the same.<br>They foolishly say ‘κρίον’ instead of ‘κρύον’<br>and they boorishly say ‘ξίλον’ instead of ‘ξύλον.’”</p></blockquote>



<p>Over time, the pronunciation that Michael derided as coarse and uncivilized seems to have won out; in Standard Modern Greek, the letters ⟨υ⟩ and ⟨ι⟩ are both pronounced /i/. Thus, in Standard Modern Greek, the word γύρος is pronounced /ˈʝiros/.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-134df5ea1d53237216706a67acb61eb8" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><em>ABOVE: Scene of everyday agricultural workers from an eleventh-century Greek manuscript of the gospels. It’s very likely that such laborers would have pronounced ⟨υ⟩ as /i/, while the scribe who copied the manuscript probably pronounced it /y/.</em></p>



<p><strong>Origin of the gyros sandwich</strong></p>



<p>Now that I’ve explained the origin of the Greek word γύρος and the history of its pronunciation, I should probably explain where the sandwich of this name originates from and how the name came to be applied to the sandwich.</p>



<p>Today in modern Greece, a cook who is preparing a gyros begins by roasting the meat vertically on a skewer and slicing pieces of meat away when they are done cooking. In Greece and Kypros, gyroi are normally made using pork, but a cook may sometimes choose to use chicken, beef, or lamb meat instead. Once the meat has been removed from the skewer, the cook usually serves it wrapped in pita bread as a sandwich. Often, it is served with tzatziki sauce, onions, and tomatoes.</p>



<p>The modern gyros didn’t arise all at once; many innovations had to be made before the gyros as we know it today could be invented. The first of these innovations was the invention of the idea of cooking meat on spits. This idea is extremely ancient; we know that people in the Aegean Islands were already roasting meat on horizontal spits at least over 3,600 years ago, and they were probably doing it long before that as well. Archaeologists excavating the Bronze Age site of Akrotiri on the Greek island of Thera unearthed stone firedogs dating to the seventeenth century BCE or earlier with notches clearly designed to hold skewers for roasting meats.</p>



<p>The<em>&nbsp;Iliad</em>, an ancient Greek epic poem that was most likely composed in around the early seventh century BCE, describes Chryses, the Trojan priest of the god Apollon, roasting meat on horizontal wooden skewers in book one, lines 458–466. The Athenian comic playwright Aristophanes (lived c. 446 – c. 386 BCE) references similar cooking practices in his plays&nbsp;<em>Acharnians</em>&nbsp;(line 1007),&nbsp;<em>The Clouds</em>&nbsp;(line 178),&nbsp;<em>The Wasps</em>&nbsp;(line 354), and&nbsp;<em>The Birds</em>&nbsp;(lines 388 and 672). Today, meats grilled on horizontal spits are known in Greece as&nbsp;<em>souvlakia</em>; they are distinct from, but similar, to gyroi.</p>

<p>The various other ingredients that are used in gyroi today also had to be introduced to Greece. Some of these ingredients were introduced to the Greek diet relatively early. Notably, pita bread—or at least a very similar kind of flatbread—is known to have existed in ancient Greece. The Greek Egyptian writer Athenaios of Naukratis, who wrote sometime in around the late second or early third century CE, quotes a description of the cooking process for a kind of flatbread known as&nbsp;<em>apanthrakis</em>&nbsp;in his book&nbsp;<em>Wise Men at Dinner</em>&nbsp;3.110b. The description reads as follows, as translated by S. Douglas Olson:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The&nbsp;<em>apanthrakis</em>&nbsp;is more delicate than wafer bread. This type too is probably produced on top of coals, like what Attic authors refer to as an&nbsp;<em>enkryphia</em>. The inhabitants of Alexandria offer it to Kronos and put it out in his temple for anyone who wants some to eat.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Similarly, onions, which are often served on gyroi today, were fairly common in ancient Greek cuisine and they are often mentioned as an ingredient in surviving ancient Greek recipes.</p>

<p>The onset of the worldwide autism epidemic has seemed a bizarre and unknowable phenomenon, existing through a wide range of symptoms and debilitating conditions. The underlying causes, however, are deceptively simple.</p>
<p>Long held birthing practices in hospitals have been abandoned in lieu of more “progressive” policies, and though seemingly innocuous, the results have been <span>disastrous</span>.</p>
<p>The human error involved in the onset of autism is very simple. Doctors have stopped spanking babies’ bottoms at birth, accused of abuse or trauma-inducing practices. Circumcision has also been on a widespread decline. Venupuncture at birth or shortly soon after is unheard as well for the same reasons. <span>All</span>&nbsp;of these have contributed to the massive spike in autism, for <span>ONE</span>&nbsp;very important underlying reason:</p>
<p>Without the PAIN stimulus, the baby is stuck in a biologically immature, semi-wake state leftover from the womb. The PAIN stimulus at birth is what compels the 1) baby’s CRY, which innervates the auditory pathway, the postnatal neuronal maturation process and begins&nbsp;the process of spatially encoding the environment (this tonotopy becomes the basis for the ocular system as well as finger joint/grasping abilities). It is also responsible for 2) the jump start of the reflexive processes to synapse at the brainstem for quick reaction speed, as well as internal endogenous processes such as the gastrocolic reflex (this is why autistic children are chronically constipated, fussy eaters). And, 3) the initiation of the <span>Ascending Reticular Activating System</span>, the body’s <span>wake up</span>&nbsp;call, which the auditory system is tasked with initially triggering after leaving the womb.</p>
<p>These three main underlying “missing factors” define the causal mechanisms of the autism epidemic.</p>
<p><span>1. Postnatal Auditory Development</span><br>
The most important thing to understand is that the auditory pathway is the <span>first</span>&nbsp;step of sensory organization and <span>begins</span>&nbsp;the brain’s understanding of its external environment. Every <span>other</span>&nbsp;sensory encoding system begins with the auditory system. Why? Because sound is the <span>only</span>&nbsp;sense we can actually initially physically “interfere” with and <span>interpret</span> the results. Meaning we can put out a stimulus <span>ourselves</span>, that interacts with and <span>interferes</span>&nbsp;with existent noise and environmental conditions. Our brains then decipher and interpret&nbsp;the results to spatially encode the environment so as to be able to interact with it.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acousticintegrity.com/acousticintegrity/Hugo_Zuccarelli.html">Hugo Zuccarelli</a>&nbsp;first established this in 1980 with his discovery of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holophonics">holophonics</a>&nbsp;as well as his proposal that the human ear and auditory system work as an <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry">interferometer</a></span>. The ramifications of his discovery, however, were lost on the medical community.</p>
<p>In animals like bats this auditory feedback system is very large, as they have adapted to acquiring food from their environments strictly by use of sound, e.g. sonar. In primates this system is smaller, because we only use the auditory pathway primarily until we fine-tune our finger motor skills, <i>and</i>&nbsp;our visuospatial system kicks in.&nbsp;Once&nbsp;human vision orients itself <span>based</span>&nbsp;on the auditory encoding of the environment, the biological Law of Precedence takes effect and strict emphasis on the auditory system is abandoned.</p>
<p>This is why babies <span>coo</span>. They are pinging their environments and learning to orient and fine-tune their ability to recognize and interact with physical stimuli, and focus their eyes.&nbsp;Their finger grasping and understanding of the positioning of their own joints, fingers, and body positioning becomes more honed and fine-tuned as they coo and grasp.</p>
<p>Autistic babies have also been observed to fail the “tilting test”, e.g. they fall over without catching themselves like normal babies.&nbsp;This is because the vestibular system is innervated at the same time as the auditory pathway as they both make up the vestibulocochlear nerve. Without this primal innervation, the saccule and utricle never become sensitive to linear acceleration and head-tilting.</p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;</span><span>Nociception/”PAIN”</span><br>
The mechanoreceptors associated with physical insult to the human body initiate internal reflexive “smooth muscle” processes such as peristalsis, sphincter relaxation, and proper pulmonary function. The <span>lack</span>&nbsp;of this stimulus results in many of the known conditions and symptoms of autism.</p>
<p>Glutamate and Substance P/NK<span>1</span>&nbsp;binding work together to trigger proper intestinal smooth muscle contraction and control. This results in peristalsis, sphincter relaxation, even vomiting.&nbsp;This is why without the required “stimulus” autistic babies are chronically constipated, and extremely fickle eaters.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine and nitric oxide production work together to coordinate proper pulmonary function for clearing airways of pathogens. This is why&nbsp;doctors and medical personnel have begun to take notice of the differences in sound that autistic babies make versus normal babies. ASD babies are known to make cries that are higher pitched and with smaller intervals between, because they are not drawing breath properly. Mothers have also reported being confused by the sounds their babies make, not knowing or being able to interpret what’s wrong so they can properly care for them.</p>
<p>These normal bodily processes are all initially triggered by “noxious stimuli”, e.g. PAIN.</p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;</span><span>Ascending Reticular Activating System</span><br>
“Residual muscle tension” which keeps us still during sleep, needs to be cut as fast as possible, otherwise it’s like living in a slow waking state and we simply cannot survive on our own. Bottom line, the human body and mind need to be able to react&nbsp;<em>reflexively</em> to the external environment.</p>
<p>Our body’s waking system, the <span>ascending reticular activating system</span>, is stimulated directly by sound and touch. “Neurons of the reticular formation, particularly those of the ascending reticular activating system, play a crucial role in maintaining behavioral&nbsp;<a title="Arousal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal">arousal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Consciousness" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness">consciousness</a>.”&nbsp;In 1949 Dr. Magoun recorded potentials within the medial portion of the brain stem and discovered that auditory stimuli directly fired portions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_formation">reticular activating system</a>.</p>
<p><span>Robotics</span><br>
This has profound&nbsp;implications for robotics, as without this baseline understanding of sensory integration, scientists have been stuck attempting to create robots that walk/move with zero predictable precision. Without the auditory integration and understanding of their environment, robots are stuck “learning” their environment over and over again every time they take a step as visual processing systems are a <span>secondary</span>&nbsp;source of information-gathering. They cannot be fine-tuned and honed without an auditory platform upon which to be based off of.</p>
<p>Smart cars will now be able to be programmed to be much more “aware” of their surroundings, and be able to navigate much&nbsp;more accurately.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br>
All of this is easily explained by the simple logic that it makes no biological sense&nbsp;for a baby to start any of these processes until it’s outside the womb. It’s not supposed to be moving around grasping for things, gastrointestinal processes are not needed until the baby is ready to start processing food itself, and of course a baby in the womb cannot safely use its own airways.</p>
<p>To make sense of this it would serve to go back and examine <span>very closely</span>&nbsp;how an entire generation of medical professionals was <i>shamed</i> into giving up practices long-held as routine and necessary since before recorded human history.</p>
<p>But there’s more to the scenario, another disturbingly false pocket of data being propagated worldwide with ruinous results,&nbsp;a false sense of communal sharing of information among young families that preaches the “evils” of vaccinations. We’ve just seen firsthand the dangers of this, epidemics in western states, reports of single individuals unknowing of their condition, passing on antiquated diseases to dozens of people.&nbsp; But there’s a heinous concurrence at work here, because&nbsp;the <span>hidden</span>&nbsp;horror is to realize that all it can take is a <i>single</i> vaccination to <span>CURE the autism condition</span>. Venupuncture provides the same level of stimulus as a spank at birth, and can serve to finally fully integrate a child’s senses correctly. The process isn’t immediate, and it <i>may</i>&nbsp;take a bit of reinforcement, but it’s there.</p>
<p>There’s a special kind of destructive irony to the fact vaccinations are being presented as the <i>cause</i>&nbsp;of autism. Which of course serves to make parents of autistic children even less likely to vaccinate.</p>
<p>This is also&nbsp;why&nbsp;there are reports of medical professionals and school teachers wondering why some children were ever diagnosed in the first place, it’s because&nbsp;that child ended up experiencing some type of injury and subsequently completed the auditory/reflexive circuit on their own. Everyone <span>else</span>&nbsp;is imbuing their child with a <i>powerful</i> learning disability. In fact I would not hesitate to say that the autistic condition is a hellish reality, to be trapped in a perceptual prison, a primitive, <a href="https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/05/12/functionalapproach/">psychedelic drug trip</a> with no escape. They can’t make sense of what they see or hear, they know only confusion, fear, and oblong shapes that fill their visual field with threatening gestures, emitting loud echoing noises that blanket their landscape with unknowable, imperceptible monsters.</p>
<p>Because of the curvature of our eyes, we are born with an inverted view. Light and visual info coming into the eye gets refracted upside down onto the retina, over time the brain learns to correctly orient the image. It’s clear autistic children have major problems with their vision and ocular systems. Some may presumably never learn to invert the image their retinas project, or only partially, many presumably experience a warped view of reality.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder autistic children experience chronic levels of stress, inflammation and anxiety; their lives are living nightmares. <br></p><p> <a href="https://www.manwhore.org/drills-based-training-with-mw/">

<p>The last year has been particularly annoying for nocoiners—those of us who don’t hold crypto and view bitcoin as a Ponzi, like a Ponzi, or <a href="http://www.tr0lly.com/bitcoin/bitcoin-is-not-a-literal-ponzi-scheme/">something more complex</a>.</p>



<p>We have had to endure Tether minting tethers with abandon ($17 billion worth in 2020 alone) and bitcoiners obnoxiously cheering bitcoin’s new all-time highs, the latest being <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hits-30k-for-1st-time-ever">$33,000</a>. Considering bitcoin began 2020 at around $7,500, that is a long way up. (<a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/21/are-pixie-fairies-behind-bitcoins-latest-bubble/">Things went full crazy in March</a>.) But we believe 2021 will be a year of comedy gold when this giant hill of dung all comes tumbling down.  </p>



<p>I’ve spoken with several notable bitcoin skeptics, gathered their thoughts, and compiled a list of new year predictions. They shared their prophecies on Tether (a stablecoin issuer that has so far minted $21 billion in dubiously backed assets to pump the crypto markets), new regulations and the future of bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is what they had to say:</p>



<h2><strong>Nicholas Weaver: T’will be the year the music stops</strong></h2>



<p>“This is the year the music stops,” Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Weaver has been following bitcoin since 2011. His work is largely funded by the National Science Foundation. He believes the bitcoin ecosystem is running low on cash. (This is the fate of all Ponzi schemes. Ultimately, they run out of new investors and when that happens, the scheme collapses.) In the case of bitcoin, he believes real dollars in the system are rapidly being replaced by fake ones in the form of tethers.</p>



<p>“Tether has been squeezing every dollar out of the system, and there aren’t enough suckers,” he said, meaning there aren’t enough folks waiting in line to buy bitcoin at its ever increasing prices. “When the dollar stock goes to zero, the system will collapse completely because you get a mining death spiral.”</p>



<p>Miners reap 900 newly minted bitcoin per day in the form of block rewards. If they can’t sell those for enough fiat money to pay their monstrous power bills, it makes no sense for them to stay in business. And since their job is to secure the bitcoin network, bitcoin will become vulnerable to repeated attacks.</p>



<p>Also, governments are finally waking up, said Weaver, alluding to new global efforts to clamp down on money laundering, capital outflows, and the financing of terrorism via cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He foresees Tether getting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/nyregion/liberty-reserve-operators-accused-of-money-laundering.html">Liberty Reserve treatment</a> any day now. He also thinks China will decide “screw it, bitcoin is evading capital controls as a primary purpose, let’s cut off the subsidized electricity.” </p>



<p>Without cheap electricity, bitcoin miners—most of whom are in China—may find it difficult to stay afloat.&nbsp;Already bitcoin miners in Inner Mongolia <a href="https://decrypt.co/39718/bitcoin-miners-in-china-lose-access-to-cheap-electricity">no longer receive electricity at subsidized rates</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Jorge Stolfi: I can’t make price predictions</strong></h2>



<p>A computer science professor in Brazil, Jorge Stolfi wants to avoid making predictions on bitcoin’s price. He’s been following bitcoin since 2013—and has seen it through two prior bubbles—so he knows too well that anything can happen. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="5227" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/stolfi/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,168" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="stolfi" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" alt="" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure></div>



<p>“I really don’t know how far the insanity can go. The crypto market is 100% irrational, sustained entirely by ignorance and misinformation,” he said. “How can anyone make predictions about that?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stolfi is a denizen of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/">r/Buttcoin</a>, a subreddit that makes fun of bitcoin, where he painstakingly explains the finer points of crypto nonsense to the unenlightened. In 2016, he submitted a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2018-040/srcboebzx2018040-4064523-169183.pdf">letter</a> to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warning against the risks of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and comparing bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme. (The SEC has shot down every bitcoin ETF proposal to date on the basis that bitcoin’s price is too easy to manipulate.)</p>



<p>“And since price determines everything else in the crypto space, I can’t make predictions on pretty much everything else,” Stolfi continued. “For example, If the price were to crash below $10,000, I bet that we would have a lot of comedy gold coming from MicroStrategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last several months, the Virginia-based enterprise software company has funneled $1.2 billion of its funds into bitcoin. As a result, Michael Saylor, the company’s CEO, now spends most of his time on Twitter shilling bitcoin.&nbsp;In September, Saylor <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1307029562321231873">compared</a> bitcoin to “a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy.”</p>



<p>Stolfi also thinks that we will probably forget about several coins that were big in the past, like Bitcoin SV (BSV) and IOTA, maybe even bitcoin cash (BCH). “And we will also forget about blockchain technology.”</p>



<h2><strong>Frances Coppola: Crypto exchanges will become like licensed banks&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Over the last week, Frances Coppola has been battling an army of bitcoin trolls and sock puppets on Twitter after suggesting that <a href="https://twitter.com/Frances_Coppola/status/1345395222243586050">bitcoin is not scarce</a> in any meaningful sense.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5222" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/frances-coppola/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg" data-orig-size="260,260" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="frances-coppola" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=260" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=260" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=260" alt="" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg 260w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Scarcity is a key part of the myth bitcoiners perpetuate to make people think bitcoin is valuable in the same way gold is and to create a sense of buying urgency—quick, grab some before it’s all gone!—so naturally, bitcoiners responded by dog piling on her. She isn’t happy about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I hope bitcoin crashes and burns because I am so bloody furious, but I think it will be a while yet before it does—maybe about June,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coppola is a UK-based freelance writer, who spent 17 years in the banking industry. She wrote the book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Peoples-Quantitative-Easing/dp/1509531300">The Case For People’s Quantitative Easing</a>,” and has 58,000 Twitter followers.</p>



<p>The cause of bitcoin’s upcoming crash, she believes, will be an epic battle between the Wild West of crypto and regulators, a topic she covered in a recent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-financial-system-fight-it">Coindesk article.</a></p>



<p>If the regulators win, crypto exchanges will become like licensed banks and have to comply with things like the Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping law that reined in mortgage practices and derivatives trading after the 2008 financial crash, she said. On the other hand, if the regulators lose, she believes their next move will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>“We’d see drastic restrictions on what interactions banks can have with crypto, perhaps a total ban on retail deposit-takers having crypto exchanges and stablecoins as clients,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We might also see something akin to a Glass-Steagall Act for crypto exchanges and stablecoins, so that retail deposits are fully segregated by law from trading activity.” By that, she means exchanges won’t be able to lend retail deposits to margin traders or use them to fund speculative positions in crypto derivatives.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>David Gerard: Bitcoiners will get their big boy wish</strong></h2>

<p>After years of begging for bitcoin to be taken seriously as a form of money, bitcoiners will be getting exactly what they asked for, said David Gerard, a bitcoin skeptic and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Shrugged-Facebook-Tried-Money-ebook/dp/B08KK9SZP6">“Libra Shrugged,”</a> a book on Facebook’s attempt to take over the money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year will see more regulation of crypto, as coiners discover to their dismay just how incredibly regulated real-world finance is, he said. “Just wait until someone sits them down and explains regulatory real-time compliance feeds.”</p>



<p>What does Gerard think about Tether? “I could predict the guillotine will finally fall on Tether, but I predicted that for December 2017, and these guys are just amazing in their ability to dodge the blade just one more day,” he said.</p>



<p>Since 2018, the New York Attorney General has been investigating Tether and its sister company, crypto exchange Bitfinex, for fraud. Over the summer, the New York Supreme Court ruled that the companies need to hand over their financial records to show once and for all just how much money really is underlying the tethers they keep printing. The NYAG <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=2AsYgvjJAsSdalpfkInbHA==">said</a> Bitfinex/Tether have agreed to do so by Jan. 15.</p>



<p>Gerard also foresees that there will continue to be no use cases for crypto that absolutely anything else does better. “Everything the <a href="http://buttcoinfoundation.org/">Buttcoin Foundation</a> was talking about in 2011 is still dumb and broken,” he said.</p>

<p>Elon Musk says he is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/elon-musk-highly-confident-spacex-will-land-humans-on-mars-by-2026.html">“highly confident”</a> that his company SpaceX will be sending humans to Mars in six years. Naturally, Musk wants to set up a self-sustaining city on the red planet.

<p>Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University, doesn’t mince words when it comes to crypto predictions. He simply told me: “The Bitcoin bubble will burst in 2021. Triggers will be reg/law enforcement action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is good reason to take him seriously. Roubini famously warned of the 2008 financial crisis, a prophecy that earned him the moniker “Dr. Doom.”&nbsp;He is also <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/dr-doom-s-bubble-burst-nouriel-roubini-s-hot-tub-gets-heave-ho">known for his parties</a>, which leads a few of us nocoiners to believe that bitcoiners’ are fundamentally driven by bitterness over the fact that we have better soirées.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Update 4th Jan 2021: If you don't need Python 3.9, installing azure-cli natively can be done&nbsp;by using this homebrew formula:&nbsp;<a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/azure-cli">https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/azure-cli</a>. Note: there's an open issue with upgrading:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/16417">https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/16417</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>Anyone else having trouble installing Azure CLI natively on Apple Silicon? You may remember some <a href="https://www.thectgrid.com/blog/apple-silicon-right-tool-remote-work-economy/">rough edges being mentioned in our previous post</a>.&nbsp;If like me you're a big user of Azure's cloud services and you've got your hands on a new M1 MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, then you might have noticed that installing some software isn't as straight forward as it used to be. In this post I'll take you through the steps I took to install Azure CLI natively on your Apple Silicon Mac.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-macos">Official install docs</a></p>

<p><em>Note: this post is likely to become old pretty quickly given the pace at which things are being fixed for M1.</em></p>

<h2>Install HomeBrew</h2>

<p>As of the last few days, homebrew now supports Apple Silicon Mac natively which means no more <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#alternative-installs">manual steps</a> on the M1, just go to the <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew homepage</a> and install as normal. It should install into <code>/opt/homebrew/</code>, you can test it by running <code>$ brew</code> in the terminal.</p>

<h2>Install wget</h2>

<p>This step is the simplest in this whole process, savour it:</p>

<pre><span>brew install&nbsp;wget</span></pre>

<h2>Install Python 3</h2>

<p>Install Python 3 with this command:</p>

<pre><span>brew install python3</span></pre>

<p>It will download and build targetting Apple Silicon ARM. We now need to check you can access python3 via the Terminal and that the right version is being loaded (MacOS comes with older versions of both Python2 and Python3):</p>

<pre><span>type&nbsp;-a&nbsp;python3
python3 is /usr/bin/python3</span></pre>

<p>If a path going via your homebrew folder isn't at the top of the list, e.g. <code>python3 is /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9</code> , you can simply create an alias for it in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file.</p>

<p>Open <code>~/.zshrc</code> with either nano or vim:</p>

<pre><span>nano ~/.zshrc</span></pre>

<p>and add these lines:</p>

<pre><span>alias&nbsp;python3='/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9'
alias&nbsp;pip3='/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3'</span></pre>

<p>Save (<code>Control + O</code>) and exit (<code>Control + X</code>), and run this for the changes to take effect:</p>

<pre><span>source&nbsp;~/.zshrc</span></pre>

<p>Now check that your homebrew version of python3 is at the top of your <code>type -a</code> list:</p>

<pre><span>type&nbsp;-a&nbsp;python3
python3 is an alias&nbsp;for&nbsp;/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9
python3 is /usr/bin/python3</span></pre>

<p>You can run the same test for <code>pip3</code>. If the homebrew version is at the top of the <code>type -a pip3</code> list then you're good to go!</p>

<h2>Wall of Compilation Errors: pip3 install azure-cli</h2>

<p>Normally it would be enough to run:</p>

<pre><span>pip3 install azure-cli</span></pre>

<p>and this would've been the end of the post had it not been for the wall of compilation errors I received as pip attempted to compile the dependencies for azure-cli. The following packages needed manual intervention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>cffi</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>cryptography</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>bcrypt</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>PyNaCl</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>After spending some hours troubleshooting these errors I was close to throwing in the towel, calling it a day on native brew/python and moving over to rosetta2. And then a breakthrough...</p>

<h3>Build cffi</h3>

<p>Building and installing the <code>cryptography</code> package requires <code>cffi</code> to be installed, and OpenSSL lib include files to be in your PATH. Both of these need manual attention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>cffi doesn't build via pip</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>OpenSSL isn't in the path</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>To build and install cffi follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Install libffi</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>brew install pkg-config libffi</span></pre>

<ol start="2">
	<li>
	<p>Take note of the path to this libffi.pc file:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>find&nbsp;/opt/homebrew/ |&nbsp;grep&nbsp;"Cellar.*libffi.pc"
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libffi/3.3/lib/pkgconfig/libffi.pc</span></pre>

<ol start="3">
	<li>
	<p>Grab the sources from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cffi/">https://pypi.org/project/cffi/</a>:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>wget&nbsp;https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/66/6a/98e023b3d11537a5521902ac6b50db470c826c682be6a8c661549cb7717a/cffi-1.14.4.tar.gz
​
tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;cffi-1.14.4.tar.gz
cd&nbsp;cffi-1.14.4</span></pre>

<ol start="4">
	<li>
	<p>Edit setup.py and add the path for libffi.pc that you noted down in step 2 to <code>include_dirs</code>:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span><code>setup.py</code></span></p>

<pre><span>import&nbsp;sys,&nbsp;os
import&nbsp;subprocess
import&nbsp;errno
​
# on Windows we give up and always import setuptools early to fix things for us
if&nbsp;sys.platform&nbsp;==&nbsp;"win32":
&nbsp; &nbsp;import&nbsp;setuptools
​
​
sources&nbsp;= ['c/_cffi_backend.c']
libraries&nbsp;= ['ffi']
include_dirs&nbsp;= ['/usr/include/ffi',
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'/usr/include/libffi',
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'/opt/homebrew//Cellar/libffi/3.3/lib/pkgconfig/']
​
...</span></pre>

<ol start="5">
	<li>
	<p>Build</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>python3 setup.py install</span></pre>

<p>cffi is done! Now to the next dependency ...</p>

<h3>Build cryptography</h3>

<p>azure-cli requires an older version (&lt;3.0.0) of cryptography, which in turn needs the OpenSSL library. First grab OpenSSL via brew:</p>

<pre><span>brew install&nbsp;openssl</span></pre>

<p>Grab the lib path:</p>

<pre><span>find&nbsp;/opt/homebrew |&nbsp;grep&nbsp;"Cellar.*openssl.*/lib$"
​
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1i/lib</span></pre>

<p>Now install version 2.9.2 and reference the OpenSSL lib and include folders from above:</p>

<pre><span>pip3 install&nbsp;cryptography==2.9.2&nbsp;--global-option=build_ext&nbsp;--global-option="-L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1i/lib"&nbsp;--global-option="-I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1i/include"</span></pre>

<p>Only two more dependencies to go.</p>

<h3>Build bcrypt and PyNaCl</h3>

<p>Both bcrypt and PyNaCl have the same steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Download sources</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Manual install</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>bcrypt</h4>

<p>Go to <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/">https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/</a> and download sources, unpack, and run setup.py:</p>

<pre><span>wget&nbsp;https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d8/ba/21c475ead997ee21502d30f76fd93ad8d5858d19a3fad7cd153de698c4dd/bcrypt-3.2.0.tar.gz
​
tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;bcrypt-3.2.0.tar.gz
cd&nbsp;bcrypt-3.2.0
python3 setup.py install</span></pre>

<h4>PyNaCl</h4>

<p>Go to <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/">https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/</a>, get sources and do the same:</p>

<pre><span>wget&nbsp;https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/cf/5a/25aeb636baeceab15c8e57e66b8aa930c011ec1c035f284170cacb05025e/PyNaCl-1.4.0.tar.gz
​
tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;PyNaCl-1.4.0.tar.gz
cd&nbsp;PyNaCl-1.4.0
python3 setup.py install</span></pre>

<h3>Install azure-cli</h3>

<p>Finally, you should have everything you need to install azure-cli via pip. Go ahead and try it:</p>

<pre><span>pip3 install azure-cli</span></pre>

<p>Good luck and thanks for reading!</p>

  <time datetime="2021-01-03T13:30:00+00:00">03 Jan 2021</time>
  <p>Swift in a sense is very much like C++, and when I say C++ I mean C++11 and beyond. One could also say that Swift is <em>cleaner</em> C++, or C++ without the backwards compatibility baggage from the 80s. To give an idea here’s a minimal <em>modern</em> C++ code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;       // 1
</span><span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>std</span><span>;</span>      <span>// 2</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>      <span>// 3</span>
  <span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span> <span>// 4</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>               <span>// 5</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now lets break them down from Swift perspective.</p>


<p>Swift equivalent would be <code>import iostream</code>. Frameworks usually come with an umbrella header as a single file, so typically we need to add only one include statement per framework like in Swift. But unlike Swift, we need to add include statements for every file we want to use from our own code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;framework&gt;      // external framework
#include "path/to/file.h" // local file
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>std</span><span>;</span> <span>// 2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unlike Swift, C++ has a proper support for namespaces. So if two types in different frameworks have same type name they can be resolved using their namespaces. For example <code>fwkA::JSON</code> and <code>fwkB::JSON</code>. To get a more Swift like behavior we can add <code>using</code> to indicate that the symbols do not need their namespace for every single usage.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span> <span>// 3</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the modern way of writing functions in C++. In classic fashion this function could also be written as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span> <span>// 4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like Swift we can also override operators in C++. In this case the <code>iostream</code> library provides <code>cout</code> which is an object of type <code>ostream</code> that outputs to <em>standard output stream</em>. <code>iostream</code> also provides overrides for <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code> for many common types like for <code>string</code> that we’re using above. But it can also work for our custom types if we provide the <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code> for our type. The Swift equivalent to this would be the <code>CustomStringConvertible</code> protocol.</p>



<p>And finally since our function requires a return type <code>int</code> we have to end our function with a <code>return</code> statement.</p>

<p>With a basic introduction, now let us take a look at C++ in a bit more detail from Swift perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#variables">Variables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#string">String</a></li>
  <li><a href="#array">Array</a></li>
  <li><a href="#dictionary">Dictionary</a></li>
  <li><a href="#optional">Optional</a></li>
  <li><a href="#function">Function</a></li>
  <li><a href="#closures">Closures</a></li>
  <li><a href="#classes">Classes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#error-handling">Error handling</a></li>
  <li><a href="#generics">Generics</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50 
let myConstant = 42
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto myVariable = 42;
myVariable = 50;
const auto myConstant = 42;
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Just like in Swift types can be deduced by the compiler using <code>auto</code>, but if required we can always also provide the type information explicitly.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let myFloat: Float = 3.14
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
float myFloat = 3.14;
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Unlike Swift, type conversions can also occur implicitly in C++. This needs to be carefully watched out for to avoid hard to find bugs. For other cases we need to explicitly convert data from a type to another. For example <code>int</code> to <code>string</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let label = "The width is "
let width = 94
let widthLabel = label + String(width)
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto label = "The width is ";
auto width = 94;
auto widthLabel = label + to_string(width);
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="string">String</h2>

<p>String interpolation in C++ isn’t as good as with Swift. But nonetheless we can construct <code>string</code> with either explicit string conversion, like we saw above</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto apples = 3;
auto oranges = 5;
auto appleSummary = "I have " + to_string(apples) + " apples.";
auto fruitSummary = "I have " + to_string(apples + oranges) + " pieces of fruit.";
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Or using <code>ostringstream</code> which works just like <code>cout</code> and makes use of <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>apples</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>ostringstream</span> <span>ss</span><span>;</span>
<span>ss</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"I have "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>apples</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>" apples."</span><span>;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>ss</span><span>.</span><span>str</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which can then further be reduced to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>ostringstream</span><span>()</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>"I have "</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>apples</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>" apples."</span><span>).</span><span>str</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto apples = 3;
auto oranges = 5;
auto appleSummary = (ostringstream()&lt;&lt; "I have "&lt;&lt;apples&lt;&lt;" apples.").str();
auto fruitSummary = (ostringstream()&lt;&lt;"I have "&lt;&lt;(apples + oranges)&lt;&lt;" pieces of fruit.").str();
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="array">Array</h2>

<p>Swift <code>Array</code> equivalent in C++ is <code>vector</code>. Here’s how you use it</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
var shoppingList = ["catfish", "water", "tulips"]
shoppingList[1] = "bottle of water"
shoppingList.append("blue paint")
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto shoppingList = vector&lt;string&gt;{"catfish", "water", "tulips"};
shoppingList[1] = "bottle of water";
shoppingList.push_back("blue paint");
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>And this is how you iterate a <code>vector</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
for item in shoppingList {
  print(item)
}
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
for (auto &amp; item : shoppingList) {
  cout &lt;&lt; item &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code>&amp;</code> here means that we wish to use <code>item</code> as a reference. If we were to use <code>auto item</code> it would always create a new copy.</p>

<h2 id="dictionary">Dictionary</h2>

<p>Swift <code>Dictionary</code> equivalent in C++ is <code>map</code>. Here’s how you use it</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
var occupations = [
  "Malcolm": "Captain",
  "Kaylee": "Mechanic",
]
occupations["Jayne"] = "Public Relations"
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto occupations = map&lt;string, string&gt; {
  {"Malcolm", "Captain"},
  {"Kaylee", "Mechanic"},
};
occupations["Jayne"] = "Public Relations";
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>And this is how you iterate over a <code>map</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
for (key, value) in occupations {
  print("\(key) : \(value)")
}
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
for (auto&amp; [key, value]: occupations) {
  cout &lt;&lt; key &lt;&lt; " : " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="optional">Optional</h2>

<p>Swift developers love <code>Optional</code> types. Fortunately for us, C++ also got <code>optional</code> types starting c++17. Although not as fancy as with Swift, but the core idea is the same: A type that either has the value or not. Here’s an example:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
func greeting(_ required: Bool) -&gt; String? {
  return required ? Optional("Hello") : nil;
}

func main() -&gt; Int {
  let s = greeting(false) ?? "Hi"
  print(s) // Hi

  if let str = greeting(true) {
    print(str) // Hello
  }

  return 0
}
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto greeting(bool required) -&gt; optional&lt;string&gt; {
  return required ? optional{"Hello"} : nullopt;
}

auto main() -&gt; int {
  auto s = greeting(false).value_or("Hi");
  cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl; // Hi

  if (auto str = greeting(true)) {
    cout &lt;&lt; *str &lt;&lt; endl; // Hello
  }

  return 0;
}
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code>*str</code> can be thought of as force unwrapping in Swift, <code>str!</code>. And after <em>dereferencing</em> we can either use the <code>.</code> or the handy <code>-&gt;</code> operator to access the variable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>str</span><span>).</span><span>size</span><span>();</span>
<span>str</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>size</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>C++ functions do not have argument labels</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
func greet(_ person: String, on day: String) -&gt; String {
    return "Hello \(person), today is \(day)."
}

greet("John", on: "Wednesday")
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto greetPersonOnDay(string person, string day) -&gt; string {
  return (ostringstream()&lt;&lt;"Hello "&lt;&lt;person&lt;&lt;", today is "&lt;&lt;day&lt;&lt;".").str();
}

greetPersonOnDay("John", "Wednesday")l
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>But if you really miss having named arguments there are many tricks of all shapes and sizes out there. The simplest is to use a <code>struct</code> for arguments</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Args</span> <span>{</span> <span>string</span> <span>person</span><span>,</span> <span>day</span><span>;</span> <span>};</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>Args</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>ostringstream</span><span>()</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>args</span><span>.</span><span>person</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>", today is "</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>args</span><span>.</span><span>day</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>"."</span><span>).</span><span>str</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>greet</span><span>({.</span><span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>.</span><span>day</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Wednesday"</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="closures">Closures</h2>

<p>C++ has a good support for closures. Here’s an example:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
func hasAnyMatches(list: [Int], condition: (Int) -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Bool {
  for item in list {
    if condition(item) {
      return true
    }
  }
  return false
}

func lessThanTen(number: Int) -&gt; Bool {
  return number &lt; 10
}

var numbers = [20, 19, 7, 12]
hasAnyMatches(list: numbers, condition: lessThanTen)
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto hasAnyMatches(vector&lt;int&gt; list, function&lt;bool(int)&gt; condition) -&gt; bool {
  for (auto item : list) {
    if (condition(item)) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

auto lessThanTen(int number) -&gt; bool {
  return number &lt; 10;
}

auto numbers = vector&lt;int&gt; {20, 19, 7, 12};
hasAnyMatches(numbers, lessThanTen);
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>That said, C++ still doesn’t has all the fancy functional operations like <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>...</code> that we get with Swift, but they’re coming soon with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges">C++20 ranges</a>. For now we can use <code>transform</code> as an equivalent to Swift <code>map</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
numbers.map({ (number: Int) -&gt; Int in
  let result = 3 * number
  return result
})
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
transform(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), numbers.begin(), [](auto number) -&gt; auto {
  auto result = 3 * number;
  return result;
});
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>The C++ code here would actually mutate the <code>numbers</code>. If we want the truly Swift <code>map</code> equivalent we would have to create an empty <code>vector</code> and append data to it</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>mappedNumbers</span> <span>=</span> <span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{};</span>
<span>transform</span><span>(</span><span>numbers</span><span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(),</span> <span>numbers</span><span>.</span><span>end</span><span>(),</span> <span>back_inserter</span><span>(</span><span>mappedNumbers</span><span>),</span> <span>[](</span><span>auto</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>return</span> <span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span> 
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>

<p>Unlike Swift in C++ there isn’t much difference between a <code>struct</code> and a <code>class</code> with the only difference being that a C++ struct has all members <code>public</code> by default whereas a <code>class</code> has all members as <code>private</code> by default. Whether the instance is mutable or not depends on how it is declared.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
class Shape {

  func simpleDescription() -&gt; String {
    return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."
  }

  var numberOfSides = 0
}

var shape = Shape()
shape.numberOfSides = 7
var shapeDescription = shape.simpleDescription()

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>After the JPEG standard was released in 1992, JPEG images became synonymous with digital photography and are used in almost every application which works with photo quality images. The reason the adoption of the standard was fast and nearly universal is that it makes use of multiple techniques simultaneously to reduce the compressed file size. One of those is an understanding of the limits of the human visual system and which information is important to preserve versus which is less important and can be removed.</p><h2 id="the-jpeg-coding-algorithm">The JPEG coding algorithm</h2><p>There are several steps needed to compress an image using the JPEG method (see image below). To begin, it is usually converted from RGB into the YCbCR colorspace. The reason this is necessary is to allow sub-sampling of the pixels. The human eye is more sensitive to changes in luminance than changes in chrominance. This allows the chroma channels to be downsampled while keeping the luma channel at full resolution. The image can lose 50% of its data with this step and the perceived degradation is quite minimal. The image is then divided into 8x8 MCUs or minimum coded units (the equivalent terminology for video codecs is Macro Blocks). These MCUs are square blocks of pixels which are compressed based on the similarity to each other. The pixels in each MCU are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discrete Cosine Transform</a> (DCT). The operation allows for the easy removal of high frequency information (fine detail) to further compress the image. The more high frequency coefficients are removed, the smaller the file and the blurrier the image becomes. This effectively controls the “Q Value” or compression amount used by encoders.</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-coding.png, https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-coding@2x.png 2x" alt="JPEG coding steps"><figcaption>JPEG coding steps</figcaption></figure><p>One of the many clever ideas incorporated into the standard is to use the similarity in DC value (essentially the brightness) between adjacent MCUs to further reduce the data size by compressing just the change from one to the next instead of encoding the entire value. This is depicted above in the “DPCM coding” block. This is a great idea, but it creates a small problem. By having each successive MCU’s DC value(s) depend on a delta from the previous, it means that if there is an error in the data, the MCUs from that point on down will all be wrong.</p><p>Making matters slightly worse is that the compressed symbols which encode the image data (shown above as “Huffman coding”) are Variable Length Codes (VLC). A single wrong bit can corrupt the data from that point forward. Back in the ‘old’ days when JPEG was invented, this was a very real concern because images were often transmitted over channels (e.g. acoustic modem) that may not have had robust error correction or stored on media (e.g. floppy disks) that were prone to errors. Knowing that the data may suffer from errors, a feature was added to the standard to mitigate the amount of the image that would be corrupted by bad data. The idea was to periodically reset the previous DC value to 0, forcing the next MCU to encode its entire value as a delta from 0. This means that any corrupted DC values will only affect pixels up to the next restart point.</p><p>This is implemented with Restart Markers. They are 2-byte markers placed in between the MCUs at regular intervals (e.g. every 100 MCUs). If a data corruption occurs, it’s easy to scan forward in the file to the next restart marker (JPEG markers are always on byte boundaries and preceded by 0xFF). Once the next restart marker is found, the image can be properly decoded from that point on since the number of MCUs between each restart marker is known.</p><h2 id="the-ever-evolving-use-of-digital-images">The ever evolving use of digital images</h2><p>Starting not long after the JPEG standard was released, computer networks and storage were getting more reliable and incorporated error detection and correction (e.g. TCP/IP). The solid state storage cards used in digital cameras were quite reliable and the restart markers were ‘forgotten’ for a while since they made the files slightly larger without giving much perceived benefit. During that period, computer software was mostly designed to run on a single processor using a single thread. The fact that a JPEG image needed to be decoded in a single pass due to its use of variable length codes and a string of successive delta values for the MCU didn’t cause any problems for software since it was designed to run as a single thread anyway.</p><p>In the last few years however, computers and our use of JPEG images have changed dramatically. Nearly every computing device has multiple CPUs and runs an operating system with multiple threads (even phones). The other change is that people are taking, editing and viewing billions of JPEG photos on their mobile phones. Each generation of phones produce larger and higher resolution images. For anyone working with tons of photos, the time to encode and decode them has become increasingly important because of the sheer volume and size of new images being generated.</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/images-chart.png, https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/images-chart@2x.png 2x" alt="The sum of transfer size kilobytes of all external images requested by the page."><figcaption>The average transfer size of images requested by the web page. Data source: <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images#bytesImg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP Archive</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="repurposing-a-good-idea-into-an-even-better-idea">Repurposing a good idea into an even better idea</h2><p>Computers have been getting more powerful on a mostly continuous trajectory since the 1970s. A general term used to describe the continuous improvements in silicon processing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moore’s Law</a> was coined many years ago to commemorate Gordon Moore’s prediction that computers will double the number of transistors every 18 months. This has held mostly true for the transistor count, but the maximum speed of computers has basically hit a dead end due to the physical limitations of silicon and power+heat issues. Since individual processor speed hasn’t advanced much in the last few years, the emphasis has shifted to employing many processors to complete tasks faster by working in parallel. In today’s computing environment, it’s advantageous to be able to divide a task into sections and assign them to multiple CPUs. Not all tasks are possible to divide because each successive part may depend on the results from the previous. JPEG encoding and decoding are normally difficult to divide into pieces and run in parallel because of the way each successive MCU depends on the previous one and the use of variable length codes.</p><p>However… A convenient benefit of restart markers is that the VLC data is reset to a byte boundary (after the marker) and the MCU DC delta value is also reset. This means that both JPEG encoding and decoding could be divided into multiple threads with the use of restart markers. For encoding, the image could be divided into symmetrical strips and each strip could be encoded by a different processor. When each processor completes that task, the output of each can then be ‘glued’ together using restart markers. For decoding, the task can be spread across as many processors as there are restart markers. The only extra effort needed is to scan forward in the compressed data looking for the restart markers first since the size of the compressed data between each varies and there is no ‘directory’ in JPEG files showing where the restart markers are located.</p><h2 id="real-world-example">Real World Example</h2><p>With multi-threaded applications, the performance rarely scales 1:1 with the number of CPUs utilized (e.g. splitting a task into 12 threads on 12 CPU cores doesn’t mean it will run 12x faster). There is extra overhead in managing the threads and the memory is usually a single entity shared among the processors. Let’s run a test on the following image:</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-timings-image.jpg" alt="JPEG timings example image"><figcaption>Image credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@matthewhenry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Henry</a> on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>Among other techniques, at Optidash we incorporate this idea of using restart markers to greatly accelerate both the decoding and encoding of images. The image above was run through one of our testing tools on a 2018 MacBook Pro 15” laptop with a 6-core Intel i7 processor. Here are the results:</p><div><table><thead><tr><td>Number of CPUs</td><td>Image decode time</td><td>Image encode time</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>53ms</td><td>264ms</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>25ms</td><td>104ms</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>18ms</td><td>61ms</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see in the table above, there is a measurable advantage to splitting JPEG coding into multiple parts and assigning them to different CPUs. Depending on the task, the speed rarely scales linearly when using more CPUs. In this case, the intense use of large areas of memory limits how much benefit multiple CPUs can improve the overall speed.</p><p>Here’s some pseudocode which demonstrates how a multi-threaded JPEG encoder might look:</p><pre><code>void ThreadedWriteJPEG(assorted JPEG parameters, int numThreads) {
    int slice;
    pthread_t tinfo;

    // set completion counter
    sliceRemaining = numThreads;

    // Start a thread for each slice
    for (slice = 0; slice &lt; numThreads; slice++) {
        pthread_t tinfo;

        // Use a ‘slice’ structure to hold info about each thread’s work
        // This includes a pointer to the start of that strip of pixels
        // and the number of lines to compress

        &lt;setup slice structure for each thread’s work&gt;

        pthread_create(&amp;tinfo, NULL, JPEGBuffer, &amp;slices[slice]);
    } // for each slice

    // wait for all worker threads to finish
    WaitForThreads(&amp;sliceRemaining);

    // merge slices into a single file and write it
    WriteJPEGBuffer(slices, numThreads);
}
</code></pre></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content">
            <p>A small business based out of South Dakota was able to turn an initial investment of $2,500 into over $500,000 a month in sales, all by leveraging the power of TikTok Influencers.</p>

<p>Craig Mount and Erika Peterson started their peanut butter company, Nerdy Nuts, out of their home in the summer of 2019. The idea stemmed from a feeling of uncertainty, when Petersonâ€™s go-to peanut butter plug shut down, thatâ€™s when Craig Mount purchased an Olde Tyme PN1 nut grinder for $870 on Ebay. The grinder was eventually forgotten about, until Peterson put it to use in the summer of 2019, and just like that, <a href="https://nerdynuts.com/">Nerdy Nuts</a> was born.</p>

<h2>Starting Small</h2>

<p>The couple started small, with two flavors, honey roasted and white chocolate. They would begin selling their new peanut butter at local farmers markets, and their booth would consistently bring in around $1,000 every Sunday, not bad for what they considered a â€œlow-stressâ€� side hustle.</p>

<p>Although their decision to start small was solely based off the fact that the couple was busy raising and child and working their day jobs, this turned out to be a massive factor that ultimately contributed to their success. Selling at the farmers market meant that they had a lot of face-to-face interactions with their customers, this allowed for them to hand out samples and gather real-time feedback on their product, â€œIt became an excellent testing ground â€“ and a perfect way for us to iterateâ€� said Mount. This real time feedback allowed for Nerdy Nuts to iterate at a rapid pace, something that wouldâ€™ve been more difficult if they decided to cast a wider net at the start.</p>

<h2>Branding &amp; Early Success</h2>

<p>After doing some market research, Mount decided that Nerdy Nuts should be branded as a flavorful and fun brand, considering that a majority of direct-to-consumer (D2C) peanut butter brands were more focused on advertising themselves as â€œhealthyâ€� or â€œketo-friendlyâ€�. </p>

<p>By deciding to go the â€œfunâ€� approach with their branding, Nerdy Nuts opened up the door to many more possibilities when it came to growth tactics and marketing, one example of this would be their US election candidate inspired flavors. In June of 2019, Nerdy Nuts decided to launch a specialty line of flavors based on the favorite foods of each US election candidate.</p>

<p><img src="https://d5ik1gor6xydq.cloudfront.net/blog/29/nerd_nuts_peanut_butter.jpg" alt="Nerdy Nuts used TikTok influencers to boost sales."></p><p>This tactic ultimately landed Nerdy Nuts their first taste of virality, when their story was picked up by Fox Business. Within 48 hours of their national talk show appearance, the company made $20,000 in sales. This early virality showed the small business that there was demand beyond the farmers markets that they were used to, so they transitioned their focus to becoming a D2C brand and ditched the farmers market/retail approach. This decision would not only give them a larger reach, but also be more cost-effective than running a storefront.</p>

<h2>TikTok Virality</h2>

<p>Months after their first taste of going viral, Nerdy Nuts was once again a viral sensation, but this time on TikTok. This was nothing compared to the virality they experienced with Fox News, it was even better, â€œthese influencers made the Fox News sales look like a jokeâ€� said Mount.</p>

<p>The growing company was experimenting with different marketing approaches when they decided to try out influencers on TikTok. Mount reached out to Ali Grace Morsell and Hailey Peters, both of which had around 500,000 followers on the platform at the time. He offered both influencers free product, â€œthey were just so flabbergasted that anyone would want to send them something for free.â€� <a href="https://thehustle.co/how-a-tiny-peanut-butter-company-grew-to-500k-per-month-in-sales/">said Mount</a>. Aside from offering them the product for free, Mount also promised the influencers a 10% cut of all sales.</p>

<p>I think itâ€™s safe to say that things went better than expected. The influencers posted about the product and racked up over a million views, which <a href="https://thehustle.co/how-a-tiny-peanut-butter-company-grew-to-500k-per-month-in-sales/">ultimately resulted in 5,947 sales</a>. The hashtag #nerdynuts currently has just under 2 million views alone, definitely a contributing factor to the $165.2k in sales during the month of July, not too shabby for a small peanut butter company out of South Dakota.</p>

<p><img src="https://d5ik1gor6xydq.cloudfront.net/blog/29/hashtag.jpg" alt="The Nerdy Nuts TikTok hashtag has over 2 million views."></p><p>Sales continued to increase until August of 2020, when the company topped over $500,000 in sales â€“ a 20x increase from just a few months prior.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down the Strategy</h2>

<p>Mount is well aware that not everyone can just recruit some influencers and expect to go viral on TikTok, heâ€™s seen other influencer collabs flop, so what made the Nerdy Nuts collab pop? Whether or not Mount is aware of it, there are some key decisions he made that allowed for the Nerdy Nuts collab to become a success.</p>

<h3>1. Choosing the Right Influencers</h3>

<p>The most obvious, yet crucial, aspect of running an influencer campaign is definitely <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/Crucial-Steps-to-Identifying-The-Best-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Industry">choosing the right influencers</a> for the job. If you take a look at <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@happyhealthyhailey?source=h5_m">Hailey</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aligracemorsell?source=h5_m">Aliâ€™s</a> TikTok pages, it wonâ€™t take much to realize that these are both middle-aged woman that have children and have food-focused pages, both ideal candidates for a brand like Nerdy Nuts.</p>

<p>By being very picky with the influencers you choose to represent your brand, not only are you getting in front of an audience that is actually interested in hearing about your product, but youâ€™re working with an influencer that would be highly likely to enjoy your product as well. Ali and Hailey both have a young family, so theyâ€™re most likely already cooking all the time, experimenting with new foods and packing their childrenâ€™s lunches. By choosing influencers that are highly relevant to your niche, you are ensuring you get someone that is just as passionate about your brand.</p>

<h3>2. Having a Good Product</h3>

<p>This one is not as obvious as the previous point, but it is still an important piece of the puzzle. We mentioned in our influencer marketing <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/how-hismile-teeth-built-a-multi-million-dollar-brand-using-influencers">case study on HiSmile Teeth</a>, that the founders ensured they had a product that people actually wanted before sending it out to influencers. The bottom line is, if you have a product that nobody wants, then influencers are not going to want to promote it because at the end of the day they are consumers too.</p>

<p>By starting small and only selling at farmers markets, without knowing it, Nerdy Nuts was perfecting their product as much as possible to get it ready for the mass market. It was apparent that customers were loving the product, so by sending it out to influencers, the company was giving them a product that they most-likely would have enjoyed or even bought without the company asking.</p>

<p>While this point may not be directly correlated to the success of an influencer marketing campaign on TikTok, it most definitely plays an important role. Weâ€™ve seen cases of this before, <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/The-Greatest-Example-of-Influencer-Marketing-On-Instagram-Fashion-Nova">such as with Fashion Nova</a>, where having a product that consumers genuinely loved ended up resulting in a viral feedback loop.</p>

<h3>3. Leave the Creativity to the Creators</h3>

<p>If you take a look at the content posted by Hailey and Ali as part of their original Nerdy Nuts campaign, you will notice that the content came off as very authentic and genuine, this is because the creativity was left to the creators.</p>

<p>When working with influencers on any platform, it is important to be aware of type of content they post and ensure that your vision aligns with theirs. The last thing you want to do is force an influencer to post a piece of content about your brand that comes off as disingenuous or scripted. Content coming from an influencer is not a TV or radio ad, so it shouldnâ€™t come off as one.</p>

<p>In order to the maximize your ROI, it is important to understand your boundaries when working with influencers.</p>

<p><b>Your responsibilities:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Sourcing and vetting the influencers.</li>
    <li>Getting the product to the influencer.</li>
    <li>Making influencer aware of campaign goals.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Influencer responsibilities:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Formulating the creative strategy and creating the content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re reading this thinking to yourself â€œdamn, I should try using TikTok influencersâ€� youâ€™re in luck, because just as Nerdy Nuts discovered for themselves, TikTok influencers are highly underrated and undervalued at the time of writing this article. Influencers are also a topic we discuss in our <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-TikTok-for-Brands-in-2020">ultimate guide to TikTok for brands in 2020</a>, we think they're an essential part to anybodies marketing strategy.</p>

<p>While 500,000 followers on TikTok may not be as valuable as 500,000 followers on Instagram, reaching nearly 2 million people organically just by gifting your product to an influencer is unheard of on any other platform aside form TikTok. </p>

<p>Nerdy Nuts is a prime example of how small direct-to-consumer businesses can leverage the power of influencer marketing. If youâ€™re looking to source some influencers for your campaign, and youâ€™re not sure where to start, check out <a href="https://collabstr.com/">Collabstr.</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Obsidian is described as “A second brain, for you, forever”. It is a desktop app (available for Windows, Mac and Linux) that acts as a knowledge base working on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.</p>



<p>The app is developed by the hugely talented Licat (Shida Li) and Silver (Erika Xu) who also brought us the delightful&nbsp;<a href="https://dynalist.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynalist</a>&nbsp;(an outliner note-taking tool similar to <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/knowledge/logseq-the-note-taking-app/">Logseq</a>).</p>



<p>The app is offered as a free download, although sponsoring the devs is possible by upgrading your license through a one-time payment (USD 25+). By upgrading the license, we gain insider builds (early releases) and access to the exclusive dev channel on Discord.</p>



<h2>Why Obsidian?</h2>



<p>Your notes are saved locally on your machine in plain text markdown format, allowing you to easily transfer your notes to other apps or open them with Notepad, in essence, there is no vendor lock-in. You are in complete control of your notes and files and can use Google Drive, GitHub, Dropbox etc. to sync your notes between different machines.</p>



<p>Having control over my notes gives me peace of mind. I am free to do what I want with them, and even though with the Obsidian app I can use various functions (backlinks, graph view, etc.) I know that should the app disappear, the content is mine and will forever be mine.</p>



<p>The ease of using the app could not be more straightforward. Once downloaded and installed, you are greeted with a welcome screen similar to the one below:</p>

<p>From here you can either create a new vault (notes repository) or open an existing vault. You can also open the “help vault” which includes several help files such as a formatting guide, and appearance customisation guides amongst other how-tos.</p>



<p>Once you have created / opened a vault, you can start taking notes at your heart’s content. You are free to choose to structure your notes the way you wish. You can have folders similar to traditional note-taking tools or go structure free and store all your notes in one main directory.</p>



<p>The beauty of creating links between your notes (with a simple [[“name”]] link) means that you should always be able to find what you are looking for and generate ideas (see <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/personal-knowledge-management/">Personal Knowledge Management</a>) from your notes.</p>



<p>The app works in markdown format with the possibility of rendering the preview side by side, as shown below. You can also have more than one note open simultaneously by opening additional panes that can be infinitely split and resized. This is great if you want to cross-reference notes or create a work product from multiple notes.</p>

<p>The markdown format may feel a little overwhelming at first, but things get easier after taking a few notes. The other benefit of having notes in markdown or rendered view is that it is easy to copy and paste the text into an online blogging platform or a Word document. For instance, I created this post in Obsidian and copied and pasted the text to WordPress and voila.</p>



<p>Having said the above, the lack of a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type interface is a little annoying in my point of view. Sometimes the markdown format is confusing to read, or if you are in preview mode, you need to go back to edit mode to tweak the text. The good news is that this is on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a>. Fingers crossed this comes soon.</p>



<p>In addition to the devs being hugely talented and ever-present to answer questions and chat on the Discord, the speed of development is phenomenal. Nearly every other week, we are presented with an update that includes new features and bug fixes.</p>



<h2>Features</h2>



<p>There are a significant amount of features available in Obsidian, so I thought to include below what I consider to be the main ones:</p>



<ul><li>Offline – <em>can access whether connected or not. Notes are stored offline and are yours</em></li><li>Backlinking – <em>easily see which pages link to the page</em></li><li>Random Note – <em>opens a random note which is useful for discovering old content</em></li><li>Daily Note – <em>create today’s note at the click of a button</em></li><li>Starred Notes – c<em>an star “favourite” notes for easy access</em></li><li>To-do list – <em>easily create to-do lists</em></li><li>Outline – <em>see the structure of your note and easily navigate to other sections by clicking</em></li><li>Search – <em>easily find what you are looking for</em></li><li>Graph View –&nbsp;v<em>isualise a page or your notes collection in a graph with many different filter / view options</em></li></ul>



<p>I have included below a brief video I did of the main features available in Obsidian.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Obsidian Introduction - A alternative Roam Research app for Notes / PKM / To Do / Journal" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJYHMCbqZbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In addition to the above main features, there are a couple of additional features which warrant a separate mention. These are:</p>



<h2>Publish</h2>



<p>A useful feature of Obsidian is Obsidian Publish where you can take your notes and convert them into an online digital garden / blog. The simplicity of doing this through “no code” means that there is no prior technical knowledge required. You only need to sign up (USD 8 per month per site (early-bird price)), choose a name, select which notes to publish and there you have it – your own personal online space.</p>



<p>The outcome can look something like this <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example</a>. Developments are in the pipeline to allow for custom domains and other tweaks to make it more personal and improve the experience.</p>



<h2>Plugins</h2>



<p>With the ability to install and use third-party plugins and such a large community of users, many plugins are available to choose from to customise the app to suit your needs. The plugins are easily installed in the app (simply click install on the plugins browser page within Obsidian) and allow you to do things like:</p>



<h3>Mind Map</h3>



<p>View your note as a mind map. For example, activating the mind map view on this article results in the following diagram:</p>







<p>I find this plugin great as although you can see the note’s outline using the Obsidian outline feature, this allows you to visualise it differently.</p>



<h3>Calendar</h3>



<p>Enables a Calendar View to visualise and navigate between daily notes and easily create a daily note for a past, or future date.</p>







<h2>Areas of Improvement / Wish List</h2>



<p>There are a few areas of improvement which I feel would elevate the app even further. These improvements include:</p>



<ul><li>A What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type editor interface,</li><li>Mobile app to view / take notes on mobile,</li><li>Ability to see more information on notes in bulk (like date created, last modified, word count).</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>With a few tweaks and the addition of a WYSIWYG interface, this app has the potential to become a top note taking app. Notes are stored locally, so are yours and forever yours. The features available in the app allow you to take notes, visualise your notes and generate ideas easily.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This tutorial is meant to help find clues as to who is calling you when you’re receiving calls from an unknown phone number (a number that is displayed on your phone’s screen, but you don’t recognize).</p><p>It’s quite short and simple, and I hope it helps, as it’s written with the intention of tracking whoever may be bothering or harassing you.</p><p>First I’d like to clear up the following meanings:</p><ul><li><strong>unknown phone number</strong> – a phone number that is displayed on my phone’s screen but I don’t have the caller’s information</li><li><strong>private phone number</strong> – a number that’s not displayed on my screen when someone is calling because the caller is withholding their number.</li></ul><p>I wanted to quickly clear this up because I suspect some interpret the term of <strong>unknown phone number</strong> as <strong>private phone number/call</strong>, and I don’t want to take up someone’s time with information that’s not useful to them.</p><h2 id="method-1-finding-the-facebook-account-associated-with-the-unknown-number">Method 1 – Finding the Facebook account associated with the unknown number</h2><p>With this method we’ll try to have Facebook show us the account associated with the phone number by trying to login with it and then clicking <code data-enlighter-language="raw">Forgot Password?</code>, which will lead us to the next page where Facebook shows us the associated account.</p><p>Please also keep in mind that I am not an expert in this area. Although I don’t think that investigating an unknown phone number in this manner is an offence in any way, I do think you should proceed at your own risk.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that even though this method probably has a good chance of working, the number may not be associated with a Facebook account.</p><p>Also, since it will look like you’re trying to log in, Facebook will probably notify the user in some form. In my case I just got notified that I can enable one click login, for security reasons.</p><p><img width="593" height="532" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp 593w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-300x269.png.webp 300w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-380x341.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" alt="word image 7" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 12" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp 593w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-300x269.png.webp 300w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-380x341.png.webp 380w"></p><p>I’m not certain of other cases, however.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    <p>Every time I go back to Rust, I have to figure out how the module system works again. Here are some of my notes comparing it to Python’s module system.</p>

<p>These notes are for Rust 2018.</p>

<ul id="markdown-toc">
  <li><a href="#crates" id="markdown-toc-crates">Crates</a></li>
  <li><a href="#packages" id="markdown-toc-packages">Packages</a></li>
  <li><a href="#file-layout" id="markdown-toc-file-layout">File layout</a>    <ul>
      <li><a href="#crate-roots" id="markdown-toc-crate-roots">Crate roots</a></li>
      <li><a href="#module-lookups" id="markdown-toc-module-lookups">Module lookups</a></li>
      <li><a href="#nested-modules" id="markdown-toc-nested-modules">Nested modules</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="crates">Crates</h3>

<p>A <strong>crate</strong> is a build target in Rust. A crate can either be a library or a binary. It can be built with <code>cargo build</code>.</p>

<p>In Python, libraries are called “packages”. Binaries are an entirely heterogenous concept, typically installed by configuring <a href="https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/">entry points</a>. Such a binary doesn’t even need to be Python code (for example, it can be a shell script instead).</p>

<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>

<p>A <strong>package</strong> in Rust consists of up to one library crate and any number of binary crates. (It’s required that there be at least one library or binary crate.)</p>

<p>In Python, a single “distribution package” (i.e. one that you can <code>pip install</code>) can contain multiple “import packages” (i.e. one that you can <code>import</code>), while Rust allows at most one import package per distribution package.</p>

<h3 id="file-layout">File layout</h3>

<h4 id="crate-roots">Crate roots</h4>

<p>Python places <code>__init__.py</code> at the root of a package to indicate that it’s importable as a package. Similarly, Rust conventionally puts <code>lib.rs</code> at the root of a crate as the library <strong>crate root</strong>. (Unlike Python, the name can be re-configured, but <code>lib.rs</code> is the default.)</p>

<p>In Python, <code>__main__.py</code> corresponds to the main entry point for the module when run with <code>python -m</code>. Rust conventionally puts <code>main.rs</code> as a binary crate root. (This can also be renamed, which is probably desirable if you have more than one binary.)</p>

<h4 id="module-lookups">Module lookups</h4>

<p>In Python, all modules are available by importing them via their filesystem path name. For example, <code>import foo.bar</code> first looks for a <code>foo/</code> directory on the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Then it looks for a <code>bar/</code> package or a <code>bar.py</code> module underneath the <code>foo/</code> directory.</p>

<p>In Rust, modules also correspond to their paths on the filesystem (by default; <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html#the-path-attribute">you can use the <code>path</code> attribute</a> to change this behavior). However, they are not immediately <code>use</code>-able just because the corresponding file is present! They must be declared with a <code>mod foo;</code> declaration in the crate root file (e.g. <code>lib.rs</code>).</p>

<h4 id="nested-modules">Nested modules</h4>

<p>In Python, a nested module <code>foo.bar</code> is implemented either by <code>foo/bar.py</code> or <code>foo/bar/__init__.py</code>. You can’t use both. If you want to have sub-modules of <code>foo.bar</code>, you’ll place additional modules or packages under <code>foo/bar/</code>.</p>

<p>A statement like <code>from foo.bar import qux</code> could either be importing a symbol declared in <code>foo/bar/__init__.py</code> or the module <code>foo/bar/qux.py</code>. Some developers choose to explicitly re-export the public interface of <code>bar</code> in <code>__init__.py</code> for clarity, and prefix sub-modules with underscores (e.g. <code>_qux.py</code> instead of <code>qux.py</code>).</p>

<p>In Rust, you use <code>foo/bar.rs</code> to declare members of the namespace <code>foo::bar</code>. If you also want to have sub-namespaces of bar (e.g. <code>foo::bar::qux</code>), then you additionally create the <code>bar/</code> directory alongside <code>bar.rs</code>. To access a sub-namespace <code>qux</code> inside <code>bar.rs</code>, the line <code>mod qux;</code> must be added to <code>bar.rs</code>. (This is similar to how we have to add <code>mod foo;</code> at the top-level <code>lib.rs</code>.)</p>

<p>To re-export the namespace and make it available to all users outside of <code>bar</code>, it should be changed to <code>pub mod qux;</code>.</p>

<p>The main take-away is that Rust requires the explicit re-exporting of nested modules using <code>mod</code> at each step of the hierarchy, while Python does not.</p>

            <p>
    Posted on January  3, 2021
    
</p>


<ul>
<li>I spent the year as a software engineer writing Haskell, and switched to remote work during the pandemic with everyone else.<br>
</li>
<li>Wrote a lot of code, and focused on Haskell as a language for software engineering.<br>
</li>
<li>Completed 3 courses from Georgia Tech on bayesian statistics, computer networking, and embedded compilers, as part of a masters program I’ll finish in 2021.<br>
</li>
<li>Wrote more Haskell code this year than probably all other years combined, and made it through 2020 feeling pretty good about things. I’ll mark that in the win column!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m writing this post as a collection of my thoughts on the last year, and a reflection on the major things I’ve learned.<br>
The majority of my Haskell experience is in the form of writing code for web servers that talk to databases serve up APIs, although I am very interested in compilers and language research!</p>
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>On The Practice Of Software Engineering</li>
<li>Haskell Observations</li>
<li>Musings On Type Level Programming</li>
<li>Build Systems</li>
<li>The Year In Readings</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="on-the-practice-of-software-engineering">On The Practice of Software Engineering</h2>
<p>Software engineering is about understanding the trade offs (performance, latency, domain modelling, et cetera), and implementing a solution that solves a problem with a solution space of development time, cost, and quality. Not every project you engage in will focus on code quality, but working at a company where some projects can focus on quality is a tremendous joy and enriching experience, and am very thankful to my teammates who made this possible!</p>
<p>One of the best exercises I had this year was going through my PRs and consolidating all the comments by theme, which taught me as much about my own code as what other people think about code in general.</p>
<p>An important perspective when writing code, is understanding how that software will exist through time, what demands will be placed on it, and how the fundamental assumptions will inevitably change. A big lesson for me this year is learning that a system can start out well, but through product mis-alignment, tight time constraints, and feature expansion, it can become an irreplaceable web of sadness littered through your code base too costly to remove!</p>
<p>On a psychological note, through trial and error I realized I only have so many “high performance” hours in a week where you can be sustainably productive without lowering the quality of the hours you work. Some corporations have even found workers are even more productive with 3 day weeks versus 5! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191105011855/http://nypost.com/2019/11/04/microsoft-japans-3-day-weekends-boost-productivity-by-40/">source</a> I’m not saying we should go that far, but when you’re home all the time coding in a pandemic, balance is key to staying fresh and effective!</p>
<h2 id="haskell-observations">Haskell Observations</h2>
<p>Contributing to ghc is HARD!<br>
It’s a complex and old code base, and although there is plenty of documentation, it takes a ton of work to be able to understand ghc well enough to contribute at the level needed to fix bugs and implement new features. That said, there is a ton of documentation work that still needs to be done, and is pretty beginner friendly work!</p>
<p>Use Template Haskell to generate code only as a last resort! The available alternatives, including deriving instances, have grown rich with options over the past few years, and these alternatives are less likely to eat up your compiler time or make cross-compilation an herculean task! Quasiquoters are a notable exception to this, as are inserting filenames/git commits at compile time, the key is to use it sparingly!</p>
<p><a href="https://haskell.pl-a.net/">Haskell Planetarium</a> as a link aggregation has enough content to be readable everyday, and along with <a href="https://haskellweekly.news/">Haskell Weekly</a> are my <code>goto</code> sources of Haskell related content.</p>
<p>Next, and pretty obviously, <strong>you can use Haskell to deliver value in business</strong>. This is already established, but watching different teams write similar web services at their direction showed me that there is a lot of variety within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, answers the following questions will vary from project to project, and asking them will get you oriented in a new project pretty quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which prelude is being used?<br>
</li>
<li>How are effects handled?<br>
</li>
<li>How are API routes defined?<br>
</li>
<li>How do you interact with the database and manage a transaction session?<br>
</li>
<li>How do you write an sql query?<br>
</li>
<li>What’s the nature of the “expression problem” for internal data types?<br>
</li>
<li>What is the strategy for manipulating internal objects, i.e.&nbsp;lens/generic lens?<br>
</li>
<li>How are log messages generated?<br>
</li>
<li>What’s the testing strategy, is a fuzziness generator used?<br>
</li>
<li>How do you run the tests locally, given the architecture?</li>
</ul>
<p>By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem">Expression Problem</a> I mean which typeclasses are needed to be derived or defined, like <code>ToJSON</code> or serialization. I’d like to add that the overwhelming majority of effects I’ve seen have been handled using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl">mtl</a> and/or <code>IO</code>, but we appear to be close on extensible effects, and the work done on <a href="https://github.com/hasura/eff">eff</a> looks promising!</p>
<h2 id="musings-on-type-level-programming">Musings On Type Level Programming</h2>
<p>A theme for this year for me was exploring the intersection between type level programming and good software engineering practices. It’s one thing to know Haskell, it’s another to write beautiful code that’s as easy to understand as it is to maintain. As a prior, my stance on new, complex Haskell features is to “write junior code”. However, given a sufficiently experienced team familiar with type level programming, the trade-offs of the features themselves can be evaluated per se…</p>
<h3 id="haskell-type-level-solutions-worth-their-weight">Haskell Type Level Solutions Worth Their Weight</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/squeal-postgresql">squeal</a>, takes a while to learn, but with generated schemas helping write some code, a deep embedding tied to the schema is very maintainable. A key aspect of getting this solution to work is to have a repeatable way to generate the same schema that’s used in production. Ours is (<a href="https://github.com/mwotton/squealgen">squealgen</a>), which works great!<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens">generic-lens</a>. For a long time, I avoided lenses, but with <code>DuplicateRecordFields</code> and <code>OverloadedLabels</code> <code>generic-lens</code> provides some great utilities beyond lens/prism for manipulating structures that I’ve come to rely on.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant">servant</a> great for defining routes for clients/servers, and even the streaming stuff can work!<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/deriving_via.html">DerivingVia</a>, very useful way to extend newtypes and generic deriving, and gives you a way to write a lot of maintainable code in a few short lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="haskell-type-level-programming-ideas-ive-unsuccessfully-tried-to-apply-but-am-holding-out-hope-for">Haskell Type Level programming ideas I’ve unsuccessfully tried to apply, but am holding out hope for…</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type level witnesses</strong>: although they did work for a specific problem, getting kind constraints to play nicely with associated libraries turned out harder than I imagined, and I’m not 100% convinced the added complexity if worth the effort.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>GADTs</strong>: Know the type for each individual data constructor? Sounds good! I just haven’t had a problem where this is exactly what I’ve needed.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Existensial Types</strong>: There is a bug that prevents generic deriving from “just working” reasonably in the last situation I tried them, and I’d rather just use an alternative approach, like a smart constructor, over writing my own generic instance. <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/10514">GHC bug report</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="build-systems">Build Systems</h2>
<p>I’m not sure what else to say here, other than build systems in Haskell leave something to be desired!<br>
Stack works, but doesn’t cache well, and there’s the dreaded <code>flat namespace error</code> and related errors that sometimes are most easily fixed by manually removing the offending library, or worst case removing your <code>.stack</code> directories.<br>
Alternatively, Nix is an efficient and robust build system, but is really complicated, and takes a non-trivial amount of time to learn and set up if you’re going to use that for your CI build system. I want to learn Nix and use it for personal projects, it’s just a question of priorities, and figuring out how to get it to work with <code>ghcid</code>.<br>
In 2021, I should really try <code>cabal</code> :)</p>
<h3 id="my-development-environment">My development environment</h3>
<p>The Haskell development environment has really improved over the last few years, and here’s the setup I eventually settled on:</p>
<ul>
<li>iTerm2 on MacOS, using <code>tmux</code> as a window/panel manager.<br>
</li>
<li><code>neovim</code> as my version of <code>vim</code> for writing code.<br>
</li>
<li><code>hasktags</code> to “jump to definition” with <code>vim</code> shortcuts. Not perfect with <code>OverladedLabels</code> within a large code base, but good enough!<br>
</li>
<li><code>hoogle</code> command line utility to search for polymorphic function types or package sources.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a> online to browse docs. (press ‘s’ on a package page to open a search prompt).<br>
</li>
<li>A variety of tools using <code>fzf</code> for searching within and for files, and browsing git diffs and commits.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage-search.serokell.io/">Serokell’s Regex Hackage Search</a> which just came out, but something I think could be very useful for arbitrary searches over Hackage!<br>
</li>
<li><code>ghcid</code> is pretty amazing, and I’m not sure how I wrote Haskell without it! It gives fast incremental recompilation, and can be configured to run a test suite or bash command on completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The haskell development environment is getting better all the time, and although I’ve set up Haskell Language Server a few times for small side projects, I haven’t taken the time to try it on a larger code base, despite the extremely helpful project devs!</p>
<p>My ideal tool, would be something that consolidates the different search interfaces (hackage, regex on hackage, local search, jump to definition, et cetera), to create a utility that jumps to definition or docs given what’s in scope for a given module or even project.</p>
<h2 id="the-year-in-readings">The Year In Readings</h2>
<p>Here’s a sampling of the “essential” articles I came across in 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/decade.html">Haskell for a New Decade</a> a good reading to start off the year!<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://tech.channable.com/posts/2020-04-07-lessons-in-managing-haskell-memory.html">Lessons in Managing Haskell Memory</a> is a really interesting article about speeding up code execution time using “compact regions”. Memory management in strict, typed functional programming languages is a pretty wide open area, “compact regions” are a worthy approach!<br>

        <h2 id="the-paradox">The paradox</h2>

<p>Stein’s paradox is among the most surprising results in statistics.  The basic
idea is easily stated, but it is difficult to understand how it could possibly
be true.  The premise is this: suppose that I have a Gaussian distribution with
a variance of unity and some mean which I don’t tell you.  I then draw a single
sample from this distribution, give it to you, and ask you to guess the mean.
What do you do?  Well, you don’t have a lot of information to go on here, so
you just guess that the mean is the number I gave you.  This is a good guess!
(We will make the notion of a “good guess” a little more precise later on.)</p>

<p>No big surprise there.  Now we play again, but this time, my distribution is a
<em>two</em>-dimensional Gaussian.  The covariance is the identity matrix (so this is
equivalent to sampling from two independent one-dimensional Gaussians).  But
again I have not told you the mean (which is now a two-dimensional vector).
Once more I draw a single sample from the distribution, hand it over to you,
and ask you to guess the mean.  You simply guess that the mean is the sample I
have given you.  Once more you have guessed well!</p>

<p>Now we do the same thing in three dimensions.  I draw a single sample, hand it
over to you, and ask you to guess the mean.  Just as before, you guess that the
mean is the sample I gave you.  But this is no longer a good guess!  Stein’s
paradox is that if we play this game in three dimensions or more, a better
guess is to say that the mean is this:</p>

\[\hat{\mu} = \textrm{ReLU} \left(1 - \frac{D - 2}{|\mathbf{x}|^2} \right)
\mathbf{x},\]

<p>where \(D\) is the dimensionality of the Gaussian, and \(\mathbf{x}\) is the
sample drawn from the distribution.  This is the so-called “James-Stein
estimator.”</p>

<p>Who would have thought!  What is going on here?</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-guess-good">What makes a guess good?</h2>

<p>Before we go on, we should clarify exactly what we mean by a “good guess.”  We
are trying to do what is called “parameter estimation” in statistics — based
on a sample from a distribution, we want to infer some underlying parameter (or
parameters) of the distribution.  (In this case the parameter we are interested
in is the mean.)  In order to quantify how good or bad our estimate is we
choose a function called a “loss function.”  There is some freedom in choosing
a loss function, but the mean squared error is a common choice and has a lot of
valuable properties.  Stein’s paradox assumes that we are using the mean
squared error.  So if we guess that the mean is \(\hat{\mu}\) and the true
value of the mean is \(\mu\), then the loss is</p>

\[\mathcal{L} = |\hat{\mu} - \mu|^2.\]

<p>Now, of course, we need some rule to go from the sample \(\mathbf{x}\) to the
estimate \(\hat{\mu}\).  This rule is just a function of some kind, say,
\(f(\mathbf{x})\).  This function has the special name of an “estimator.”  We
can choose whatever function we want here.  Our original guess was to just use
\(f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}\).  But another choice here is to say
\(f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x} + 7\), or \(f(\mathbf{x}) = \sin(\mathbf{x}) /
\mathbf{x}^{71}\), or even just \(f(\mathbf{x}) = 31\).  It doesn’t take much
imagination to see that there are an infinite number of possible choices.  But
presumably some of these choices are better than others.  How do we know which
ones are good?</p>

<p>Statisticians use the concept of <em>risk</em> for this purpose.  Risk is simply the
expected value of your loss function.  One thing that can be a little confusing
is that the risk is a function of <em>both</em> your choice of estimator <em>and</em> the
true value of the parameter itself.  So in the original game where you’re
guessing the mean of a one-dimensional Gaussian, the risk will be a function of
whatever rule you decide to use and the actual, unknown value of the mean.</p>

<p>The fact that the risk is a function of the true value of the parameter makes
things a little tricky.  If you’re trying to decide between two estimators, you
might find that one estimator works better for certain values that the
parameter can take, and the other works better for others.  As a dumb example,
let’s go back to guessing the mean of a one-dimensional Gaussian.  Our original
estimator was \(\hat{\mu} = x\).  But another, perfectly valid, estimator is
\(\hat{\mu} = 7\).  In other words we ignore the sample entirely and say that
the mean is 7 no matter what.  Generally this doesn’t seem like a smart thing
to do.  But if the mean turns out to actually be pretty close to 7, on average
this will be the better guess!  Specifically, the risk of our initial estimator
is</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{R}_{x} &amp; = &amp; \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(x - \mu \right)^2 \right] \\
&amp; = &amp; \int (x - \mu)^2 e^{-(x-\mu)^2 / 2} \, dx \\
&amp; = &amp; 1.
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>And the risk on our second, dumb estimator is</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{R}_{\textrm{dumb}} &amp; = &amp; \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(7 - \mu\right)^2 
\right] \\
&amp; = &amp; \int (7 - \mu)^2 e^{-(x - \mu)^2 / 2} \, dx \\
&amp; = &amp; (7 - \mu)^2.
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>As long as the true mean, \(\mu\), happens to be between 6 and 8, the dumb
estimator of just saying 7 actually has lower risk!</p>

<p>Based on this example it might seem that we’re stuck.  Since we don’t know the
true value of the mean, we can’t generally say if one estimator is better than
another.  And indeed this is often the case.  But there are certain situations
where this is not true.  If we have two estimators and one of them has a lower
risk <em>for any possible value the parameter can take</em>, we can say that one is
definitively better than the other.  In statistical parlance, we say that the
worse estimator is “inadmissable.”</p>

<p>In more precise terms, Stein’s paradox states that in three dimensions or more,
the naive estimator (just guessing that the mean is \(\mathbf{x}\)) is
inadmissable because the risk of the James-Stein estimator is lower for any
possible mean I could choose.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-james-stein-estimator-doing">What is the James-Stein estimator doing?</h2>

<p>Before we can understand <em>why</em> the James-Stein estimator gives you a better
guess than the naive estimator \(\textbf{x}\), we should understand <em>what</em>
exactly it’s doing.  The idea is that we take the naive guess \(\textbf{x}\)
and then we scale it towards the origin by some amount.  The factor by which we
scale it is:</p>

\[\textrm{ReLU}\left(1 - \frac{D - 2}{| \textbf{x}|^2} \right).\]

<p>The ReLU function simply takes the maximum of its argument and zero, so this
scale factor will be either positive or zero.  Let’s suppose that it’s
positive.  In this case we scale it towards the origin more if the magnitude of
the sample is smaller and less if it is lower.  In the limit of \(|\textbf{x}|
\to \infty\) we don’t change it at all and our guess reduces to the naive
estimator \(\textbf{x}\).</p>

<p>In the other limit, if \(|\textbf{x}|\) is very small, then the ReLU function
will kick in and just set the scale factor to zero.  Hence anytime we get a
sufficiently small sample we throw it out and just guess that the mean is zero
instead.  And all else being equal we will shrink our estimate more in higher
dimensional spaces than in lower dimensional spaces.</p>

<p>So that is what the James-Stein estimator is doing.  Why does it work?  Before
we can answer that we need to take a quick detour.</p>

<h2 id="samples-in-high-dimensional-spaces">Samples in high dimensional spaces</h2>

<p>High dimensional spaces are counterintuitive.  One of the counteruintitive
properties of high dimensional distributions is this: a sample from a symmetric
high dimensional distirbution is highly likely to be further from the origin
than the mean.  Specifically, for an isotropic \(D\)-dimensional Gaussian, the
difference between the average distance to a sample and the distance to the
mean grows as \(\sim\)\(\sqrt{D}\).</p>

<p>It’s a little strange to put it this way, but isn’t so surprising with a little
bit of thought.  Even in two dimensions we can see that this is the case just
by drawing it:</p>

<p><img src="https://joe-antognini.github.io/assets/posts/steins-paradox/circle-origin.png"></p>

<p>The shaded area of the circle is less than half the area, so we are less likely
to choose a sample closer to the origin than the mean.  What perhaps makes this
counterintuitive is that in two dimensions a fairly large fraction of the
circle is still shaded.  But as the dimensionality increases, this fraction
decreases exponentially.  Once the dimensionality is even moderately large we
are highly unlikely to sample a point in this shaded region.</p>

<p>One caveat here is that this effect decreases the larger the mean is.  You can
imagine that as we move the circle further away from the origin, the shaded
fraction gets closer and closer to ½.  So long as the mean is sufficiently
large, the probability of sampling a point closer to the origin than the mean
can be close to ½ even in high dimensional spaces; it just requires a very
large mean.  We can start to see here the connection to the James-Stein
estimator, which also gets very close to the naive estimator \(\mathbf{x}\) as
the mean (and hence \(|\mathbf{x}|\)) gets very large.</p>

<p>What we are doing by shrinking the estimate towards the origin is correcting
for the tendency of the typical sample to be slightly further away from the
origin than the mean.  This correction allows us to reduce the overall risk of
the estimate. [<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>]</p>

<h2 id="how-arbitrary-is-the-origin-really">How arbitrary is the origin, really?</h2>

<p>Stein’s paradox is particularly strange because there are actually two
counterintuitive things going on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The origin is arbitrary, so why does moving your estimate towards the origin
help?</li>
  <li>Why does this not work in one or two dimensions?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a look at the first of these.  A central principle in physics is
that of relativity — coordinate systems are arbitrary, so the laws of physics
must be valid in all of them.  Surely this is also true in statistics as well.
We can choose the origin to be wherever we like, so it cannot contain any
information.  But this sensible assertion is false.  Statistics is not physics.</p>

<p>If we truly had no information about the mean, what value would the sample
have?  If it could really be <em>anything</em> then presumably its value would …</p></article></section></div></div>

</p>
<p>This Christmas, a family member sent me a <span>URL</span> to a family Zoom call. However, they didn’t send me a direct link to Zoom. Instead, they sent me a<span></span> <span>“</span>tinyurl.com” link.</p>
<p>When I clicked on the link, my <span>URL</span> bar flashed an intermediate domain that was neither Zoom nor TinyURL. Later, I used cURL to see where this <span>URL</span> was really going.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -v https://tinyurl.com/examplezoom
...
&gt; GET /examplezoom HTTP/2
&gt; Host: tinyurl.com
...
&lt; location: https://redirect.viglink.com?key=a7e37b5f6ff1de9cb410158b1013e54a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F123456789&amp;prodOvrd=RAC</code></pre>
<p>
<em>(all <span>HTTP</span> responses abridged for clarity)</em>
</p>
<p>Sure enough, the redirect wasn’t clean at all. TinyURL was first sending me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VigLink" target="_blank">VigLink</a><a href="#footnote-1WA7" id="ref-1WA7"><sup>1</sup></a>. VigLink is an advertising (tracking) company that specializes in affiliate marketing.</p>
<p>Following the redirect in cURL reveals another unsavory fact. VigLink <em>sets cookies</em> before they send me to the intended destination on Zoom.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -v <span>'https://redirect.viglink.com?key=a7e37b5f6ff1de9cb410158b1013e54a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F123456789&amp;prodOvrd=RAC'</span>

<p>These cookies give them the ability<a href="#footnote-2WA7" id="ref-2WA7"><sup>2</sup></a> to track me across every other site that uses their advertising tech. Who knows what VigLink is doing with my data, but I personally wouldn’t trust an advertising company to keep my browsing history to themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they didn’t give me a chance to opt-out of this tracking. I’m currently based in Europe and I would expect to see at least an interstitial asking for consent to be tracked. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/privacy.php" target="_blank">TinyURL’s privacy policy</a>, last updated in 2012, has no mention of either third party data-sharing nor the cookies they share from affiliates.</p>
<p>This isn’t a phenomenon limited to TinyURL. More common <span>URL</span> shorteners like t.co (Twitter) and bit.ly set cookies when you click on a link. While neither redirect you to an advertising company like TinyURL, Twitter’s primary business model is advertising, and <a href="https://bitly.com/pages/privacy" target="_blank">bit.ly’s privacy policy</a> says they share data with third parties to<span></span> <span>“</span>…provide advertising products and services…”</p>
<p>Don’t use <span>URL</span> shorteners. And if you click on a link from a <span>URL</span> shortener, I recommend using tools like the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/" target="_blank">Temporary Containers Firefox extension</a> to limit the scope of ad tracking. Personally, I took the time to send Sovrn (VigLink’s parent company) a <a href="https://ylukem.com/files/_viglink-gdpr-email.png"><span>GDPR</span> request</a>, and made sure to give them my tracking cookie. I’ll update this blog and <a href="https://ylukem.com/newsletter">my newsletter</a> if I actually get anything substantive back.</p>

<p>2.3x faster than reference counting, unoptimized!</p>

<p>
<b>Generational references</b> are a new memory management technique that's easy, deterministic, and <i>very</i> fast.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
This technique is the first ingredient in Vale's final <a href="https://vale.dev/blog/hybrid-generational-memory">hybrid-generational memory</a> design, which is even faster. Our eventual goal is to be as fast as Rust, and perhaps even as fast as C++.
</p>
<p>
This article explains how generational references work, how they compare to reference counting, and what makes it all so fast. <a href="#note0" data-noteid="0">0</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="built-on-single-ownership">
 Built on Single Ownership</h2>
<p>
Recall that in Vale, an object is freed when its <b>owning reference</b> goes out of scope. An object always has exactly one owning reference pointing to it. <a href="#note1" data-noteid="1">1</a>
</p>
<p>
We can have as many <b>non-owning</b> references as we want.
</p>
<p>
Our goal here is to make it so when we dereference a non-owning reference, the program safely halts (or does something else <a href="#note2" data-noteid="2">2</a>) instead of triggering memory unsafety. <a href="#note3" data-noteid="3">3</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
To keep the language simple and the learning curve easy, we explicitly don't want to force a borrow checker on the user. However, we'd like an approach that has as little <a href="https://vale.dev/blog/hybrid-generational-memory#afterword-how-might-it-compare-to-rust">run-time overhead</a> as the borrow checker.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="generational-malloc-and-the-sacred-integer">
 Generational Malloc and the Sacred Integer</h2>
<p>
Generational references use <b>generational malloc</b>, which is like regular malloc, except at the top of every allocation is a <b>generation number</b>, which tracks how many objects have previously been at this memory location.
</p>
<p>
One could also think of it as describing "I am the <b>n</b>th inhabitant of this memory location".
</p>
<p>
Freeing an object will increment its generation number. Nobody else ever modifies it.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Later on, we use this number to see if a particular object is still alive, explained further below.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational malloc would normally be an adjustment to mimalloc or jemalloc, but we can simulate it with our own <span>genMalloc</span> and <span>genFree</span> functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>genFree</span> increments the generation number, and instead of calling <span>free</span> <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a><a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a>, remembers the allocation in a free-list. There's a free-list for every size class (16b, 24b, 32b, &lt;=48b, &lt;=64b, &lt;=128b, etc).
</li>
<li>
<span>genMalloc</span> pulls from a free-list if possible. If it's empty, it calls <span>malloc</span> and initializes the generation number to 1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find our experimental implementation in <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a>.

 Vale has three release modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Resilient mode, which is fast and memory safe; it will halt the program when we try to dereference a freed object.
</li>
<li>
Assist mode, for development, to detect potential problems even earlier.
</li>
<li>
Unsafe mode, which turns off all safety.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resilient mode uses hybrid-generational memory.

 Generational Reference: More than just a pointer!</h2>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Vale's references are <b>generational references</b>. A generational reference has two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A pointer to the object.
</li>
<li>
A "target generation" integer.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To create a reference to an object, we get its allocation's generation number, and include it in the reference.

This prevents use-after-free problems, and makes Vale completely memory safe.

and the person who opens the door says:

Generational references are only the first steps towards hybrid-generational memory, but we decided to run some early experiments to see how it compares to existing memory models.
</p>
<p>
For this experiment, we benchmarked <a href="#note8" data-noteid="8">8</a> <a href="#note9" data-noteid="9">9</a> three flavors of Vale:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Unsafe</b>, with no memory safety, the equivalent of C++ (minus caveats, see below!)
</li>
<li>
<b>RC</b>, where we use naive reference counting for all our objects.

<li>
<b>GM</b>, which uses generational references.

 Here, we benchmarked against other flavors of Vale, to isolate the differences between unsafe, reference-counting, and generational references.

Once we implement full hybrid-generational memory, we'll be benchmarking against C++ and Rust, stay tuned!

Try it out! In the Vale release, you can find a benchmark folder with scripts to run the benchmarks. You can find the source code for the various approaches <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/tree/master/Midas/src/c-compiler/region">here</a> (feel free to swing by the <a href="https://discord.gg/SNB8yGH">discord server</a> and we can point you to the right files).

<b>Note these caveats!</b> To isolate the difference between generational references and the other approaches:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In all flavors, we only allocate objects on the heap, except for primitives. Future versions will add stack allocations.
</li>
<li>
We used <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a> for all versions, though only GM ever touches the generation number, the other versions ignore it. Future versions will integrate generational malloc into jemalloc or mimalloc directly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we address these limitations, we can get more precise benchmarks against the other approaches.

 Why is this so fast?</h2>

<p>
Generational references are much easier for the CPU to handle than reference-counted references, because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Generational references have no aliasing/dealiasing overhead, just on dereference.
</li>
<li>
Generational references cause less cache misses.
</li>
<li>
Liveness checks' branching is easier to predict than RC decrements' branching.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Reference counting is costly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Whenever we "alias" (make a new reference to an object), we have to dereference the object to increment its counter.
</li>
<li>
Whenever we "dealias" (throw away a reference), we have to:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Dereference the object to decrement its counter,
</li>
<li>
If the counter is zero, deallocate it.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

As you can see, reference counting incurs a cost whenever we alias or dealias. <b>Generational references don't have that cost.</b> The above snippet would have zero overhead if it used generational references.

Instead, generational references incur a cost whenever we dereference an object:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>getShipName</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>)</span> <span><span>str</span> </span><span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<p>  <br>  <br>  <span>ret <span><span>ship</span><span>.</span><span>name</span></span>;</span><br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  

</section>
<section>
<p>
This is cheaper because <b>programs dereference less than they alias and dealias:</b> our sample program had 4.7 million counter adjustments, but only 1.3 million liveness checks. <a href="#note10" data-noteid="10">10</a> <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a>

<h3 id="more-cache-friendly">
 More Cache Friendly</h3>
<p>
Reference counting is not very "cache friendly". Adding and subtracting integers is basically free on modern CPUs, but the real bottleneck in modern programs is how <i>far</i> those integers are: if it's been recently accessed, it's in the nearby cache, and only takes a few CPU cycles to fetch. Otherwise the CPU will "cache miss" and have to bring it in all the way from RAM, which could take <b>hundreds</b> of cycles. <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a>
</p>
<p>
In our reference-counted <span>launchShip</span> example, the <span>ship.__ref_count++</span> could take a few cycles if <span>ship</span> is already in the cache, or hundreds of cycles if it's not.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational references are more cache friendly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When a generational reference goes away, we don't need to reach into memory (unlike RC, where we have to decrement a counter).
</li>
<li>
We don't need to increment when aliasing (see previous section); we don't need to reach into memory to increment.
</li>
</ul>

</section>

      </div>
  
<div>

      <div>
        <div>
    
<div id="note10" data-noteid="10">
<p><span>10</span></p><section>
<p>
 Half of these are aliasings and half are dealiasings. Aliasing happens whenever we access a member (e.g. <span>person.name</span>) or make a new reference (e.g. <span>&amp;person</span>).
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note11" data-noteid="11">
<p><span>11</span></p><section>
<p>
 Many languages are able to skip a lot of the adjustments, using static analysis. For example, Lobster can remove up to 95%. Our experiment doesn't have those optimizations; it compares naive RC to naive generational references.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
								<p>Concept creep has to be one of my biggest pet peeves.</p>
<p>What’s concept creep? It’s pretty much what it sounds like. Concept creep occurs when a concept that originally meant something very specific later comes to encompass a much broader set of unrelated, or only loosely related, phenomena.</p>
<p>Psychology has been particularly plagued by concept creep. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2016.1082418?journalCode=hpli20&amp;">According to Nick Haslam</a>, who is credited with coining the phrase:</p>
<p>Many of psychology’s concepts have undergone semantic shifts in recent years. These conceptual changes follow a consistent trend.&nbsp; Concepts that refer to the negative aspects of human experience and behavior have expanded their meanings so that they now encompass a much broader range of phenomena than before. This expansion takes “horizontal” and “vertical” forms: concepts extend outward to capture qualitatively new phenomena and downward to capture quantitatively less extreme phenomena…In each case, the concept’s boundary has stretched and its meaning has dilated.&nbsp;Although conceptual change is inevitable and often well motivated, concept creep runs the risk of pathologizing everyday experience and encouraging a sense of virtuous but impotent victimhood.</p>
<h2>Codependency, Narcissism, and Emotional Labor Are Very Specific Things</h2>
<p>Many concepts have fallen prey to this effect. One notable example is&nbsp;<a href="https://poly.land/2018/04/13/polyamory-helped-ditch-codependence-find-healthy-interdependence/">codependency,</a>&nbsp;which had a very specific meaning when it was first coined in substance abuse circles (the state of another person being co-addicted to substances by proxy, owing to their close relationship with an addict) but now is used by the general population to describe an entire array of behaviors that have nothing to do with the original concept and aren’t necessarily even pathological depending on the particular context (thinner than average boundaries, people pleasing, dependence in general, etc.).</p>
<p>A similar fate has befallen&nbsp;<em>narcissism.&nbsp;</em>There are actually pretty specific criteria for narcissistic traits, behavior, and of course the full blown personality disorder. However, it’s fashionable now for lay folks to label anyone that behaves like a jerk a “narcissist,” where many times the person in question is actually showing a pattern of behavior more consistent with other cluster B disorders (i.e., antisocial, borderline, histrionic). Or they’re just being kind of jerky and inconsiderate — but in a way that’s divorced from anything that’s really beyond the diagnostic pale. Because just because someone’s annoying or acting in a hurtful way, it doesn’t make them disordered.</p>
<p>It’s happening virtually everywhere you look. The Atlantic ran a piece recently on how <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/11/arlie-hochschild-housework-isnt-emotional-labor/576637/?fbclid=IwAR02EtM3N1RaZiq3fF48-uz32pWWoJ0iCxM-Tab6N7WPHV7-np4Vxl406zM">emotional labor has suffered concept creep</a>, an article which features an interview with the sociologist who originally coined the term.</p>
<h2>Not All Psychological or Emotional Invalidation Is Gaslighting.</h2>
<p>However, I would have to say that in my own work these days, I’m most frequently dealing with concept creep in regards to gaslighting.</p>
<p>The term <em>gaslighting</em> originally referred to a very specific form of psychological manipulation. Its origins stem from a play from the 1930s called&nbsp;<em>Gaslight</em>, in which a man tries to make his wife and other people think she’s insane by messing with small aspects of her environment and then telling her she’s wrong and possibly insane when she later points it out to him. In one instance, this literally involves <em>dimming gaslight</em>s in the house while he’s up to some shenanigans (he’s not a nice dude and also killed another lady and is rooting around looking for the dead woman’s jewels), thus the name.</p>
<p>So the term gaslighting informally came to describe an effort to manipulate someone’s perception of reality in a way that can make someone else feel crazy and doubt their own sanity. Where classically this process was dependent on a person messing with physical objects in one’s external environment, it’s also come to be understood that it’s possible to gaslight someone through less concrete methods: Lying, misdirection, denial, etc.</p>
<p>This is fine and a fairly minor extension of the original more literal use.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> a problem, however, is that people have started to use it refer not just to this specific form of manipulation but instead to refer to <em>any</em> form of psychological invalidation.</p>
<p>One common misapplication I’ve seen many times in my travels is the following: In situations in which your partner disagrees with you about a subject that’s actually quite ambiguous and you get hurt by it, people are quite eager to jump in and say that the partner is gaslighting you. But that’s not what gaslighting is. Not every hurtful interpersonal conflict is (in fact, while gaslighting certainly happens, it’s relatively rare compared to other more common forms of maladaptive relating).</p>
<h2>Emotional Invalidation Versus Gaslighting</h2>
<p>However, it’s trendy so people are using the word&nbsp;<em>a lot —&nbsp;</em>whether they really&nbsp;<em>should&nbsp;</em>or not. Often what’s being mistakenly described as gaslighting these days is at best an honest disagreement over something ambiguous — or at worst, it’s an instance of emotional invalidation.</p>
<p>What’s emotional invalidation? It’s when someone else tells you that your emotions or thoughts aren’t valid. This can happen in a number of ways. Someone can simply ignore them and go about their merry way without considering them. Or they can outright judge you for them (“that’s a stupid way to feel”). They can even reject your own assessment of your emotional state by telling you, “Oh that’s not how you really feel.”</p>
<p>Is emotional invalidation hurtful? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Is emotional invalidation gaslighting? Nope, not really.</p>
<p>A better example of gaslighting would be if someone told you that they never had conversations with you that you know you did and tell you that you must be crazy or overworked if you think that actually happened. Or if they’re hiding things on you and telling you that you must be mistaken about those items getting lost (especially if they put them back in their original place later, causing you to doubt your sanity).</p>
<h2>But What Does It All Mean, Basil?</h2>
<p>Okay, so <a href="https://poly.land/2018/11/02/that-doesnt-need-to-be-a-word-is-an-incredibly-boring-stance/">language is evolving</a>. Whoop de freaking doo. That’s what language does, right? Maybe it’s annoying to prescriptivists (like a lot of other things), but what’s the big deal?</p>
<p>Well, concept creep has consequences.</p>
<p>In addition to Nick Haslam’s concerns above about pathologizing the everyday, I also find myself frustrated by the difficulty concept creep poses to communication. Where those terms once held some utility in talking with others, I find more often than not that when I’m attempting to problem-solve relationship issues with an individual that I absolutely cannot take any of that at face value. If they say that their partner is gaslighting them or they tell me that their ex was a narcissist, that ends up being <em>incredibly</em> low-yield information. Instead of learning anything important from those descriptors, I find myself expending considerable energy in followup questions, uncovering exactly what they think those words mean. What happened? What behaviors are we talking about?</p>
<p>Where several years ago, I was much more likely to have the individual describe the actual behavior at default, it’s more likely these days for people to start using labels instead as a shortcut. And ones they are often not applying correctly.</p>
<p>To be fair, there’s always going to be a place for that kind of followup in the helping professions. And people are generally unreliable narrators, incredibly biased and subjective sources of information, something you basically always have to keep in mind when you’re working with them and talking over complex social issues with them.</p>
<p>But concept creep really does seem to have gotten worse in recent years.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  		<p>At around this time last year, I was being flooded with various articles on new year's resolutions and yearly summaries - as is typical in early January. I was trying to decide whether there is anything I hoped to change in my life. One of the big points on my 'roadmap to becoming a better human' google doc (everyone has one, right?) was being more aware of what happens with my time (what do I spend it on? am I sure I'm making <em>most</em> of it?). This sounded like an actionable new year's resolution, so I decided to give it a try. However, I tend to get a bit intense sometimes and so I kind of logged all my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p>
<h4>You did what!?</h4>
<p>I logged my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p>
<p>Here, check out this screenshot from my google sheet (btw, the spreadsheet title is just "Life"):</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/spreadsheet_banner.png" alt="A screenshot of a google sheet I used to track my data with different activities coloured differently" title="Life"></p>
<h3>Why would you do this!?</h3>
<p>I wanted to see what happens with my time. I knew I was spending quite a lot of it on social media, but I wasn't sure how much exactly. I also knew I was working quite a lot and wanted to quantify exactly how much (spoiler alert: not that much). I hoped that keeping track of what I do would help me to identify chunks of time that were being wasted and to turn them into <em>quality</em> time.</p>
<p>It was also a purely scientific curiosity - there were many less important questions that I was curious to find answers to: do I get less sleep while at uni? How much time do I spend with people vs on my own? What are the effects of drinking alcohol? and many others.</p>
<h3>Ok, sure, whatever. How much effort did this take?</h3>
<p>Not that much actually!</p>
<p>When I started, I was fully expecting to get bored with the whole thing and stop after maybe a month or so. Surprisingly, logging what I do turned out to be quite easy. As you might have noticed, I get quite excited about data so seeing my spreadsheet getting bigger and more colourful was enough of an incentive to keep me going. In the few instances, when I came close to stopping, a strong FOMD (fear of missing data) would always get me back on it.</p>
<h4>Technicalities</h4>
<p><a href="#data">I don't care, I want to see the data.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I decided to log my activities in 15-minute intervals - I wanted to be able to catch shorter activities (especially procrastination) but didn't want it to be too crazy (though I might have lost the right to decide what is crazy when I started the whole project)</li>
<li>I was using google sheets to log my data. I liked them because are online by default allowing me to log my data both on my laptop and my phone, the drag-to-copy cell content function makes it easy to log longer activities and the conditional formatting makes the spreadsheet nice and colourful providing instant gratification. You can access my template <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XBUFCJGVL73kFvD0yO5e63fLfRuebemcqhnQoafXad4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
<li>I divided my activities into broad categories to make noting them down easier. Some categories were divided further into subcategories.
For me, the categories were:
<ul>
<li><strong>sleeping:</strong></li>
<li><strong>focused work</strong> - what I really understand as productivity:
<ul>
<li><strong>uni</strong> - university (until June) and PhD (since October)</li>
<li><strong>self-improvement</strong> - job applications, but also working on my personal projects (like writing code to analyse my data, or learning to draw)</li>
<li><strong>admin</strong> - answering emails, filling forms etc (btw filling my time tracking spreadsheet was in this category)</li>
<li><strong>organising</strong> - things like organising events for a society, conferences and other extracurricular things</li>
<li><strong>German</strong> - to track language learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>low-focus work</strong> - same subcategories as in focused work. Low-focus work included activities that were more mechanical and didn't require too much brain power. For example, admin or organising my notes would be low-focus, while reading papers or writing essays would be focused work.</li>
<li><strong>socialising</strong></li>
<li><strong>culture</strong> (with subcategories: <strong>books</strong>, <strong>films</strong>, <strong>documentaries</strong>, <strong>TV shows</strong>, and <strong>other</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>human function</strong> - the boring stuff I need to do to stay alive (showering, making food, eating and things like that. On trips also setting tents etc)</li>
<li><strong>other quality time</strong> - things that didn't really fit into the other categories. Subcategories: <strong>blogs</strong>, <strong>podcasts</strong>, <strong>news</strong>, <strong>games</strong>, <strong>YouTube</strong>, <strong>chilling</strong> (for the times when I needed to just lie down or stare at the wall), and <strong>other</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>travelling</strong> - time spent in buses/cars/planes etc</li>
<li><strong>exercising</strong> - deliberate exercise - running, cycling, exercise routines</li>
<li><strong>exercising (lower intensity)</strong> - mostly walking/slow cycling, but also stretching</li>
<li><strong>procrastinating</strong> - mostly social media</li>
<li><strong>idle</strong> - waiting in queues etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The data</h2>
<p>Alright, so now that I hopefully managed to calm you down, let's use the data I have to answer a few questions:</p>
<h4>What did I do in 2020?</h4>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/year_props.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time in total I spent on different activities"></p>
<p>Turns out my top three activities of the year are sleeping (7h 45min on average per day and I'm very proud of this), working (6h 20 min on average per day) and socialising (3h 25 min on average per day). It is mostly what I would expect except that it always scares me how much time we actually spend unconscious. I can't decide whether 1h 20 min spent on human function (eating and showering etc) is a lot or not (a downside of a small sample size, I guess). On one hand, I could probably use that time to do more fun things but on the other hand maybe I should just chill.
The procrastination time (on average 10 mins per day) is definitely less than it actually is - I will talk more about it in the productivity section below.</p>
<p>Another cool feature of the way I was logging my data was that I could log more than one activity into a single time slot (walking and listening to a podcast is a classic). This means that the total time spent on all activities sums up to more than 365 days - you can see this as 'extra days' on the plot above. Turns out that this year, I had 395 surplus hours or 16.5 surplus days. I hope I didn't spend them on human function.</p>
<p>Some of the categories from the plot above were divided into more helpful subcategories:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/High_intensity_work.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within focused work">
<img src="https://samplesize.one/img/Low_intensity_work.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within low-focus work"></p>
<p>By far, most of my work was towards uni and PhD - 51 days in total. After excluding the time from June to September, when I had holidays, this gives around 5hrs of work per day. While this includes weekends, this does not seem like a lot, especially that weekends are not really well respected at uni.</p>
<p>Finding out how little focused work I do, even on the days that feel productive, was one of the biggest surprises of analysing my data. It turns out that a typical working day (9-17) would usually only give around 5-6 hours of actual work, while the rest of time would dissolve on low-focus work, chatting to people, coffee breaks and other little distractions. While there were days when I would reach 8 hours of focused work (for focused uni work I had 32 such days this year), they required either spending the whole day (9-22) working or a <em>lot</em> of effort to stay focused. Both were quite tiring and unsustainable in the long run. I guess the lesson here is that when it comes to focused work, the 8-hour working day is an unattainable target and should not be used as a benchmark.</p>
<p>I also do a lot of admin - nearly half of all the time I spend on culture. This is fairly sad and a potential action point for the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/culture.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within culture"></p>
<p>I spent a fair amount of time reading books - nearly 1.5h per day on average! I'm quite happy with this since this is a habit I consciously worked to develop this year. During this time, I have read 35 books (12,715 pages according to Goodreads<sup id="fnref1">
<a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a> </sup>
). If you want some recommendations, my top three would be: A Gentleman in Moscow, The Places in Between, and Little Fires Everywhere. On the other hand, I can't really find films or TV shows that I would really get into, so if you have any that you love, let me know! Also a bonus: the 'documentaries' are really just Louis Theroux and I don't regret a single minute.</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/Quality.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within quality time" title="Other quality time subcategories"></p>
<h4>How did the time spent on different activities change over the months?</h4>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/hrs_per_month_timeline.png" alt="A stacked plot showing how the average daily hours spent on different activities changed throughout the months"></p>
<p>As above, the hours sum to more than 24 because of logging two activities in a single time slot if I was doing them simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can quite clearly identify the 'hard lockdown' times - April+May and November. In both periods, there is a noticeable increase in working hours, reduction in socialising and increase in culture. In the spring I was finishing my Master's thesis and revising for my exams so I would expect the increase in productivity regardless of lockdown. However, seeing the same pattern in November (when we were discouraged from coming to office) seems to suggests that I am actually working more when working from home. This is probably due to both fewer distractions but also to the lack of alternatives. Normally, I would often stop working to meet friends. During the lockdown, when this is not an option, I often just continue working.</p>
<p>I would love to talk about all the other categories, but the post is getting quite lengthy so you can explore them here (another bonus: look for my binge of playing Zoo Planet):</p>

<h4>Hacking my monkey brain to increase productivity</h4>
<p>As I was analysing at my data throughout the year, I was quite disappointed in how little I worked and was looking for a way to increase it.
Inspired by <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/09/time-well-spent/">this post</a> I decided to gamify my productivity by giving myself points for activities I wanted to do more of.
I was hoping that they would act as sources of instantenous pleasure for my monkey brain (which wants fun <em>now</em> and doesn't really care about future me) to make it do things that might be less fun but beneficial in the long run.
Given that I already had data on my activities throughout the day, assigning points was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I would get:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 points per hour for the most productive activities (focused work towards uni &amp; self-improvement and exercising)</li>
<li>3 points for reading books</li>
<li>2 points for reading blogs, listening to podcasts, lower intensity work etc</li>
<li>0 points for things that are important but I do them anyway (socialising, sleep etc)</li>
<li>-4 points for procrastination</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are my points for this year:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/points.png" alt="A calendar with days coloured according to the amounts of points I got on a given day"></p>
<p>and their distributions throughout the months:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/points_per_month.png" alt="A plot of the distributions of points throughout the months"></p>
<p>Turns out my monkey brain is <text><strong>crazy</strong> </text> about points. The moment I started, every day became an exercise in optimisation. You can see that from April, …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I am switching from Mac to Linux.</p>
<p>This is how the adventure started to find the best linux distro, with a seemless user experience and minimum maintenance.</p>
<p>In the past months I experimented with various distros:</p>
<ul>
<li>bare debian</li>
<li>Pop!_OS</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>Elementary OS</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t even want to get my hands dirty with Arch. To each their own, right?</p>
<p>Read below to read my experience and to which distro I settled using.</p>
<h2>Experience recap</h2>
<h3>with bare debian</h3>
<p>Driver support for WiFi and Bluetooth were absent out of the box.</p>
<p>Still too much to adjust and tweak to get a decent user experience.</p>
<p>Not for me.</p>
<h3>with Pop!_OS</h3>
<p>Seemed like a fresh approach to the linux distro landscape, but I had major hiccups when it comes to display drivers.</p>
<p>Weird issues like blank screen after switching to HDMI external display. Troublesome boots when display was attached.</p>
<p>Weird glitches and graphical artifacts when resizing windows.</p>
<p>No issues with drivers.</p>
<p>I bet it works great on System76 machines though.</p>
<h3>with Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Glitches when working with external monitors.</p>
<p>Blank screen after booting connected via HDMI.</p>
<p>Weird behaviour when putting laptop in clamshell mode. Either not turning on, or shortly showing the login screen and then going to sleep.</p>
<p>No issues with drivers.</p>
<p>Recurrent issues with the confusing Software center versions not compatible with the applications on it.</p>
<p>Amazon EKS keeped popping up as a “promoted” application, without the possibility to remove it.</p>
<p>Bye Ubuntu.</p>
<h3>Elementary OS</h3>
<p>No issues with drivers.</p>
<p>No issues with external monitor. Wake and sleep with HDMI works like expected.</p>
<p>No blank screen when booting from external monitor.</p>
<p>Decent software center (with donations built in), also using snap was great.</p>
<p>Slight issues when disconnecting the external monitor and using the laptop, works after a few tries.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<h2>Elementary OS is good enough for me</h2>
<p>The user experience is stunningly similar to what I was used to with a Mac.</p>
<p>Switching windows is intuitive.</p>
<p>If you forget a shortcut, just press <code>&lt;SUPER&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>With <code>snap</code> it almost feels like using <code>brew</code> and <code>brew cask</code>.</p>
<p>Using it in clamshell mode works like a charm.</p>
<p>The system even wakes up from sleep using a Bluetooh logitech keyboard with mouse (namely the Logitech k400 I think).</p>
<p><s>Still need to find a better Terminal emulator, because I’m not really fond of the one built-in. Perhaps time to try Alacritty?</s></p>
<p><a href="https://dottorblaster.it/2020/12/back-to-linux/">dottorblaster.it</a> suggested <a href="https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/">Tilix</a>, and I can relate: it’s pretty awesome and provides a similar experience to iTerm.</p>
<p>This is how I am writing this very blog post.</p>

        <p>This paper is endorsed by the <a href="https://willing.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Willing.com</a> Legal Advisory Board, whose members include Daniel L. Mosley, Robert H. Sitkoff, and John H. Langbein.</p>
<p><strong>A Note from Willing:</strong></p>
<p>Since launching in 2015, we heard from a lot of customers who struggled with the requirements for creating a will. They wanted to know: Can’t I just sign online, electronically? Can I store my will online with Willing?” In each case, the answer was no, unfortunately not — wills still live in the physical, pen-and-ink world, and their execution calls for the physical presence of witnesses and a notary.</p>
<p>We learned that the execution requirements were causing some people to procrastinate indefinitely when it came to making a will, or to make mistakes when signing that meant they hadn’t created a valid will when they thought they had. We wanted to come up with a solution. So, we worked with our Legal Advisory Board and other experts to examine the law in depth and think about how it could be updated to leverage technology while preserving its important functions. The result was this paper, which provided the foundation for our efforts to pass the Electronic Wills Act in a number of states.</p>
<p>As the legislation has moved along, we’ve heard both strong support and strong opposition. Naturally — and rightly — folks who practice in this area care a lot about getting it right. We also care a lot about getting it right, and to that end we welcome any and all input. We want nothing more than to have a constructive relationship with all interested parties, because we know it’ll make for better laws. If you’d like to engage with us, please do so by reaching out to <a href="mailto:ewills@willing.com">ewills@willing.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To make a valid will, all American states require a person to comply with a set of formalities that trace back to a pair of statutes enacted by Parliament centuries before the invention of the light bulb. These formalities generally require a will to be in writing, signed by the testator, and witnessed by at least two people. There are good reasons for requiring formalities to make a will. Nevertheless, the traditional will formalities have not adapted to an evolving technological context in which nearly all transactions—including massive end-of-life transfers under pension plans, brokerage accounts, life insurance policies, and the like—can be made electronically. Accordingly, this paper argues in favor of legislation authorizing electronic wills made in compliance with a set of electronic formalities suited to the modern age. These reforms would improve access to will-making while facilitating the integration of wills with the many other methods of deathtime transfer that operate outside the law of wills.</p>
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Technology is everywhere in modern American life. Using computers, smartphones and tablets, people can purchase almost any conceivable item and communicate instantaneously with others around the world. At the same time, businesses have used technology to become more efficient and profitable, and governments have employed technology to serve their citizens more quickly, conveniently and effectively.<sup><a id="fnref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The law has made these advances possible by actively fostering the use of technology in commerce. Statutes such as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“E-SIGN”), which Congress enacted in 2000, and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”), which the Uniform Law Commission promulgated in 1999 and which has been enacted in nearly every state, have firmly established the principle that electronic documents and signatures should be given the same legal effect as paper and ink.<sup><a id="fnref2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Modern commercial life would be impossible without these statutes—they make it possible for people to do their banking online, purchase a book on <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> and order an Uber car to pick them up.</p>
<p>The law governing the execution of wills is a notable exception to the technological and legal progress that has improved people’s lives in recent decades.<sup><a id="fnref3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> In order to make a valid will, most American states require a person making a will (the “testator”) to satisfy three core “will formalities”: (1) <em>writing</em>—the will must be in the form of a writing;<sup><a id="fnref4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> (2) <em>signature</em>—the will must be signed by the testator; and (3)&nbsp;<em>attestation</em>—the will must be signed by at least two witnesses, who attest to the testator’s signature.<sup><a id="fnref5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> These three core formalities predate the invention of the light bulb—across the country, they have remained largely unchanged for hundreds of years and, as we will see, are not generally thought to apply to electronic media.</p>
<p>At the same time, a system parallel to the law of wills allows individuals to pass property at death without going through probate court or complying with the will formalities. “Nonprobate” modes of transfer, such as inter vivos trusts, life insurance, and transfer-on-death bank, brokerage and pension accounts contain the majority of Americans’ wealth,<sup><a id="fnref6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> but are governed by other bodies of law, and thus are not subject to the will formalities.<sup><a id="fnref7" href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> Because these other bodies of law have embraced technology to a greater extent than the law of wills—and in fact are subject to both E-SIGN and UETA, which validate electronic documents and signatures—electronic media are already familiar, and even sanctioned, in the context of the most common deathtime transfers. <sup><a id="fnref8" href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet there are good reasons for the will formalities. As we discuss below, the formalities are intended to provide evidence of the testator’s intent, caution him as to the significance of making a will and protect him from fraud and duress. They have endured in part because “[w]hen the court is asked to implement the testator’s intention, he will inevitably be dead and unable to authenticate or clarify his declarations.”<sup><a id="fnref9" href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> In the technological age, however, when many other significant transactions (including nonprobate wealth transfers) can be made electronically, the question arises whether the formalities should adapt to accommodate digital execution.</p>
<p>We believe that the process of making and validating a will can be effectively translated into an electronic format that preserves the functions of the original formalities. This would bring the advantages of technology to bear on end‑of‑life planning, allowing more people to provide for a thoughtful disposition of their property at death. Accordingly, this paper will argue for laws expressly permitting electronic wills by way of a digital writing, signature and attestation (and, where applicable, electronic notarization) using well-established technologies already recognized in commercial contexts, including in the nonprobate system. In making this argument, we both (a)&nbsp;acknowledge the value of the formalities and their present inseparability from many states’ law of wills; and (b)&nbsp;endorse the sound policy of Congress, and of nearly every American state, that electronic documents and signatures should be treated exactly the same as paper documents and ink signatures—and we urge the application of that policy to the law of wills.</p>
<p>In Part&nbsp;II below, we discuss the ways property can be transferred at death, including the uses and benefits of wills. We continue in Part&nbsp;III to survey the history and policy basis of the will formalities. In Part&nbsp;IV, we identify trends in statutory and case law that suggest that jurisdictions in America and abroad are already moving toward the policies we endorse in this paper. We also discuss the prominent role of technology in the nonprobate system. We conclude in Part&nbsp;V by explaining how the will formalities can be adapted to the modern age and noting the many benefits of modernization.</p>
<h2>MODES OF PROPERTY SUCCESSION</h2>
<p>There are two main ways that property is transferred at death: (a)&nbsp;through the “probate system”, which is governed by the law of wills (or in the absence of a will, by the laws of “intestacy” discussed below), and (b)&nbsp;the “nonprobate system”, which is not governed by the laws of wills <em>or</em> intestacy, but rather by the law governing the mode of transfer at issue. As we will see, the nonprobate system has assumed a far greater importance in the last 50&nbsp;years—today, Americans are able to pass (and in many cases, <em>do</em> pass) virtually all of their property outside the probate system, without being required to comply with the safeguards of the will formalities. This “nonprobate revolution” points toward the legal and practical basis for the modernization of the will formalities that we endorse in this paper.</p>
<h3>Wills and the Probate System</h3>
<p>Under American law, “[p]roperty owners have the nearly unrestricted right to dispose of their property as they please”,<sup><a id="fnref10" href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> both during their lives and at their deaths. This policy of “freedom of disposition” is the “organizing principle of the American law of succession”,<sup><a id="fnref11" href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> and has been recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court as a Constitutionally protected property right.<sup><a id="fnref12" href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> As the American Law Institute has stated, “American law does not grant courts any general authority to question the wisdom, fairness, or reasonableness of the donor’s decisions about how to allocate his property. The main function of the law of wills is to <em>facilitate</em> rather than <em>regulate</em>.”<sup><a id="fnref13" href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> As Harvard Law School Professor Robert H. Sitkoff has described it:</p>
<p>“The American law of succession embraces freedom of disposition, authorizing dead hand control, to an extent that is unique among modern legal systems. Within the American legal tradition, a property owner may exclude his or her blood relations and subject his or her dispositions to ongoing conditions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The right of a property owner to dispose of his or her property on terms that he or she chooses has come to be recognized as a separate stick in the bundle of rights called property.”<sup><a id="fnref14" href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>A will is the traditional legal tool that allows an individual to exercise his freedom of disposition. By making a will, a person can choose what happens to his property following his death—in other words, a will says <em>who</em> …</p></div></div>

source code on laptops. Development happens strictly on workstations inside
their private networks, with some using their text editor’s support for
remote file editing and others running editors on those machines via SSH.</p><p>Adapting to this situation has indirectly led me into a bit of a rabbit
hole, forcing me to acknowledge my core values, better understand the
relation between progress and human flourishing, and ponder about the
question: why technology?</p><p><em>(Chapters are mostly self-contained.)</em></p><h3 id="the-computing-experience">The computing experience</h3><p>One of the oldest pieces of software still in use was recently described as</p><blockquote><p>A sort of hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic-kernel operating
system, and the International Space Station.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, they were talking about Emacs. And yes, it is kinda true.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tron.jpg"></figure><p>I’ve been using Emacs for a while and had opportunities to use it to work
on projects in remote machines. There are a few quirks, but after changing
a setting here and there, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/tramp/Quick-Start-Guide.html">Tramp</a> is mostly usable. Tramp makes it possible
to transparently treat remote directories, files, commands, and more, <em>as if
they were local</em>. Opening a remote buffer via <code>M-x find-file /ssh:user@remote-host:/some/project</code> and having tools like Magit and Eshell
work out of the box feels like magic.</p><p>I'm not aware of similar functionality in Vim, but VSCode users recently
got
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview">something pretty close</a>.</p><p>Emacs runs either as a standalone graphical application (GUI) or in a
terminal emulator (TUI). In terms of features, GUI Emacs can be seen as a
superset of TUI Emacs. Among many other things, it makes it possible to
display:</p><ul><li>images, PDFs, rendered web pages (even YouTube!)</li><li>graphical popups (with code documentation, linting tips, compilation
errors, completion candidates, etc.)</li><li>heterogeneous fonts (distinct sizes, families, emphases, etc.)</li></ul><p>TUI Emacs has the terminal emulator (and also commonly tmux) limiting
and conflicting with the clipboard, keybindings, colors, and more. None of
these limitations are present in GUI Emacs.</p><p>For these and other reasons I use GUI Emacs and Tramp to work on remote
projects instead of TUI Emacs via SSH. Some do the opposite, and that’s
fine too! Even with the limitations shown above, TUI Emacs is very
powerful, and its performance in an SSH session is still superior to Tramp.</p><p>Even so, one might think displaying images in Emacs is not a big deal. Just
<code>open image.png</code> and get an actual image viewer application to render it,
right? Things get interesting in a remote Tramp buffer: <code>M-x find-file image.png</code> will display the <em>remote</em> image right there in your <em>local</em> Emacs
instance. Or in case you’re in a remote <em>dired</em> buffer, pressing <code>RET</code> on an
image file will do the same. It’s a non-disruptive workflow that allows one
to remain in the comfort of Emacs.</p><p>dired is a built-in file manager.</p><p>If you’re not an Emacs user, chances are the previous sentence doesn’t carry
much weight. <em>What’s good about staying inside Emacs</em>?</p><p>It is safe to assume that most of your <em>development</em>, or more broadly, your
<em>computing environment</em> is represented below:</p><ul><li>operating system (macOS, GNU/Linux distribution, Windows, etc.)</li><li>window manager (the one provided by your OS, i3, Openbox, XMonad, etc.)</li><li>terminal emulator (iTerm2, xterm, rxvt, alacritty, etc.)</li><li>shell (bash, zsh, fish, etc.)</li><li>terminal multiplexer (tmux, GNU Screen, etc.)</li><li>text editor or IDE (Vim, VSCode, Xcode, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)</li><li>email, web browsing, multimedia, and communications</li></ul><p>Each item above is a discrete computer program. They’re extensible in
disconnected ways, and to varying degrees. They’re <em>islands</em>. Most of the
time integrating them is an uphill battle, and commonly just plain
impractical. Having used a computing environment centered around TUI Vim
and tmux for a decade, I know the pain of trying to make the shell, the
terminal, and every command line application running in it have the same
look, feel, and behavior of being inside Vim. It is impossible.</p><p>The emergence of the web browser as a software platform is in part an answer
to this disconnectedness.</p><p>In contrast, Emacs unifies and equalizes the computing experience as much
as one desires, so that it happens—and is extended—in a single,
cohesive environment.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/alt_tab_small.jpg" alt="Figure 3: My computing environment."><figcaption><p>Figure 3: My computing environment.</p></figcaption></figure><p>People commonly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jjxatm/whats%5Fyour%5Fjob%5Fwhats%5Fyour%5Fdaily%5Femacs%5Fworkflow/">use Emacs</a> to process their email inbox, communicate in
chat, navigate the web, write code, and prose. At their core, these
activities are one and the same: text-editing. Being able to perform them
using the same keybindings and functionality for movement, search, text
manipulation, completion, undo-redo, copy-paste, is already a big deal, but
it’s not all: their integration into a single environment unlocks pleasant
and efficient workflows that would be much less convenient elsewhere.</p><p>Creating a to-do item for something your partner just asked you (while you
were concentrated on a task) that will show up automatically on your agenda
tomorrow? Just a few keystrokes and you’re back to the task. Converting
some text notes you quickly scribbled down into a beautiful PDF via LaTeX,
uploading it to S3, and referencing the URL in a reworded existing git
commit message? If you’re an experienced Emacs user, chances are you can
<em>visualize</em> effortlessly and efficiently executing these actions without ever
leaving Emacs.</p><p>This interconnectedness is part of the value of computing environments like
the one provided by Emacs. The whole becomes greater than the sum of its
parts.</p><p>Programmability gives it a further dimension of value: parts can be
combined as you see fit, in arbitrary and possibly unforeseen ways.</p><p>Now, back to the <em>displaying an image from a remote host</em> use case. For that,
I can think of some alternatives:</p><ul><li><code>scp</code> the image file between hosts and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li>Mount the remote filesystem and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li><code>ssh</code> into the remote host from a modern terminal emulator capable of
rendering images and use a program like <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat.html">icat</a></li></ul><p>In Emacs, you just press enter.</p><h3 id="opening-a-file">Opening a file</h3><p>At work I contribute to a moderately-sized monorepo at 70 thousand files,
8-digit lines of code and hundreds of PRs merged every day. One day I
opened a remote buffer at that repository and ran <code>M-x find-file</code>.</p><p><code>find-file</code> is an interactive function that shows a narrowed list
of files in the current directory, prompts the user to filter and scroll
through candidates, and for a file to open.</p><p>Emacs froze for <em>5 seconds</em> before showing me the <code>find-file</code> prompt. Which
isn’t great, because when writing software, opening files is actually
something one needs to do all the time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>Luckily, Emacs is “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor”, and comes with profiling capabilities: <code>M-x profiler-start</code>
starts a profile and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> displays a call tree showing how
much CPU cycles are spent in each function call after starting the profile.
Starting a profile and running <code>M-x find-file</code> showed that all time was being
spent in a function called <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>, which was being
called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><h3 id="searching-files">Searching files</h3><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1

the buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it
return <code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote

In many languages you create a mutable array object and append to it.</p><pre><code><span>var</span> myArray <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'one'</span><span>,</span> <span>'two'</span><span>,</span> <span>'three'</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><p><span>function</span> <span>addOne</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  myArray<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span>item<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></p><p>myArray</p></code></pre><p>We mutate the original array.</p><pre><code><span>addOne</span><span>(</span><span>'four'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>myArray</code></pre><p>In Clojure, whenever you "append" to a vector (array) you get a "new" vector and the original does not change. Anyone with a reference to the original can always count on it being the same.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> my-vector <span>[</span><span>"one"</span> <span>"two"</span> <span>"three"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>my-vector</code></pre><p><code>conj</code> returns a new vector with the arguments appended.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> my-new-vector <span>(</span><span>conj</span> my-vector <span>"four"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>my-new-vector<br></code></pre><p>The original vector is unchanged.</p><pre><code>my-vector<br></code></pre><p>Functions like <code>reverse</code> return a new vector, rather than mutating the original.</p><pre><code><span>const</span> myArray <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"one"</span><span>,</span> <span>"two"</span><span>,</span> <span>"three"</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br>myArray<span>.</span><span>reverse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>myArray</p></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> my-vector <span>[</span><span>"one"</span> <span>"two"</span> <span>"three"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>reverse</span> my-vector<span>)</span><br></code></pre><p>Our original vector is unchanged.</p><pre><code>my-vector</code></pre><p>This encourages us to use compositions of functions instead of functions that mutate objects. The benefit of this might not be immediately obvious, but this shift encourages writing programs in a way that's simpler. Programs made up of small reusable components are easier to change later. We just need to focus on the scope of the function, the inputs, and the outputs. We don't need to worry about prior state.</p><p>The first thing you will notice in Clojure is how many parens there are and how dense the code is. It takes some getting used to, but the parens have a lot of benefits.</p><p>We can always rewrite syntax repetition with macros and there are plenty of techniques for reducing the number of parens including "threading" operators like <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>. The following is equivalent to the header.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span> but<br>     there<br>     are<br>     so<br>     many<br>     parens<span>)</span></code></pre><p>Function calls are different in Clojure than most languages. It is represented by a list where the first element is the function and the rest are the arguments to that function.</p><pre><code><br><span>(</span><span>defn</span> my-function<br>  <span>[</span>arg1 arg2<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>str</span> arg1 arg2<span>)</span><span>)</span><p><span>(</span>my-function <span>"first"</span> <span>"second"</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>The syntax is extremely regular. It's natural to wrap a function in another function.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>my-function <span>(</span>my-function <span>"first"</span> <span>"second"</span><span>)</span> <span>"third"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Since all functions including built in functions are called the same way, it's easy to swap any function out with another, including built-ins.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span> <span>"True"</span> <span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span>my-if <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span> <span>"True"</span> <span>"False"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>The parens replace a lot of the curly brace notation in other languages.</p><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span><span>(</span><span>arg1<span>,</span> arg2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>arg1<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> arg1<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> arg2<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span> my-function<br>  <span>[</span>arg1 arg2<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>not</span> <span>(</span>blank? arg1<span>)</span><span>)</span><br>     arg1<br>     arg2<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Go has support for asynchronous "go channels" due to special syntax baked into the language. Clojure added the same features and syntax as a third party library. In Javascript you have to wait for syntax to be adopted or use a transpiler but in Clojure it could by implemented by anyone as a library.</p><pre><code>messages <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><br><span>go</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> messages <span>&lt;-</span> <span>"ping"</span> <span>}</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>msg <span>:=</span> <span>&lt;-</span>messages<br>fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>msg<span>)</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span>def c <span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>go</span> <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>!</span> c <span>"hello"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>println</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;</span><span>!</span><span>!</span> c<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Clojure is really good at extracting data from maps and sequences. It is a really good for "data programs", that are mostly calling an API, transforming a sequence, and calling another API.</p><h2>Positional Destructuring</h2><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> large-list '<span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>]</span> large-list<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><h2>Destructuring with named optional parameters and defaults</h2><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span> configure <span>[</span><span>val</span> options<span>]</span><br><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span><span>{</span><span>:keys</span> <span>[</span>debug verbose<span>]</span><br>       <span>:or</span> <span>{</span>debug <span>false</span><span>,</span> verbose <span>false</span><span>}</span><span>}</span> options<span>]</span><br><span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>"val="</span> <span>val</span> <span>" debug="</span>debug <span>" verbose="</span>verbose<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><p><span>(</span>configure <span>"foo!"</span> <span>{</span><span>:debug</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>Having a fast feedback loop is crucial to be productive. When I first started programming I would write some code, compile, then manually test my changes, maybe with a debugger. Then I discovered TDD with an auto test runner, which gave me a faster feedback loop, since I could be reasonably confident my program worked without having to recompile for every change. The fastest feedback loop I've discovered so far is the Clojure REPL with editor integration. With Emacs and CIDER I can execute code in my editor as I write it. Having a fast feedback loop for exploratory coding before writing tests helps me be a lot more productive and write higher quality code. Other languages also have REPLs but I feel Clojure is uniquely well suited to this workflow because of its immutable functional nature.</p><p>Testing is simpler when most things are maps and pure functions. This is an example from the "Gilded Rose Kata".</p><pre><code>    <span>@Test</span> <span>public</span> <span>void</span><br>        <span>BackstagePassQualityControl</span> qualityControl <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BackstagePassQualityControl</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>    <span>shouldNeverIncreaseQualityToMoreThanFifty</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>Item</span> backstagePass <span>=</span> <span>anItem</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>                <span>.</span><span>withName</span><span>(</span>BACKSTAGE_PASS_ITEM_NAME<span>)</span><br>                <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>        backstagePass<span>.</span><span>setSellIn</span><span>(</span>FIVE_DAYS<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>        backstagePass<span>.</span><span>setQuality</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>        qualityControl<span>.</span><span>updateQualityFor</span><span>(</span>backstagePass<span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>        <span>assertThat</span><span>(</span>backstagePass<span>.</span><span>getQuality</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>is</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span></p></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> max-quality-pass<br>  <span>{</span><span>:quality</span> <span>50</span><br>   <span>:sell-in</span> <span>5</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><p> <span>(</span>deftest test-backstage-pass-peak<br>  <span>(</span>testing <span>"Quality never goes over 50"</span><br>    <span>(</span>is <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>50</span> <span>(</span><span>:quality</span> <span>(</span>i/update-item max-quality-pass<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>Clojure has good interop with the worlds most popular languages. You can tap into the Java ecosystem for foundational libraries like the AWS SDK or database clients. Clojurescript has an excellent wrapper around React called Reagent. You can write your entire stack in Clojure, meaning a single person can be extremely productive. The interop story isn't perfect though: although it works technically, the difference between the programming models does have some friction. This can usually be solved by writing a wrapper.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>System/getProperty <span>"java.vm.version"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Now that Moore's Law is ending, we can't rely on speed increases of a single core anymore. We need to write code that can take advantage of multiple cores and that can correctly run in parallel. I don't feel good about using some languages like Python or Javascript that are single inherently single threaded. Languages like Java or C++, which weren't designed with concurrency in mind are hard to use correctly. Clojure's data structures are thread safe by default and it has numerous concurrency primitives. The language design de-emphasis the us of state and emphasizes the use of values instead.</p><p>I initially disliked clojure coming from my semi strongly typed Java and C++. If you use types you have to consider their downsides and the cost of the coupling introduced by type information flowing through your program. After using Clojure, I find things like the "builder pattern" contrived. There is usually only a few types of true "data" and the rest of the program are subsets and combinations of the data, which don't always deserve an explicit name or type. I feel using languages that encourage classes encourages you to make abstractions too early, and making the wrong abstraction is much worse than repetition. A lot of the "bugs" you catch at compile time are often self inflicted bookeeping mistakes due to the increased complexity. I think testing is a much stronger form of software validation and will catch the errors that types would have.</p><p>The design choices and tradeoffs in Clojure were made deliberately. There are much fewer sharp edges and historical accidents in Clojure than any other language I've used. Clojure is opinionated on the way you write software but if you buy into that opinion, using pure functions and immutable data structures, the experience is very streamlined.</p><p>I remember having to learn the difference between comparing primitives and objects in Java. Code like this feels unintuitive.</p><h2>Equality</h2><pre><code><span>Integer</span> a <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Integer</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>Integer</span> b <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Integer</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p><span>if</span> <span>(</span>a <span>==</span> b<span>)</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>if</span> <span>(</span>a<span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span>b<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Comparing object equality is almost never what I want to do and I don't think it's a good default behavior.</p><pre><code><br><span>(</span><span>{</span>foo<span>:</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span> <span>===</span> <span>{</span>foo<span>:</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>This does what I expect, and I don't need to know the difference between <code>=</code>, <code>equals</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>===</code>, <code>deepEqual</code>, and <code>deepStrictEqual</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>:foo</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span> <span>{</span><span>:foo</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>There is only <code>=</code> for structural equality and no assignment operator. The only <code>false</code> value is <code>nil</code> and everything else is <code>true</code>.</p><h2>Polymorphism without classes</h2><p>Clojure is described as having "polymorphism a la carte", which means it has the benefits of inheritance and interface without being forced to use it and without many of the downsides.</p><p>In Java, we could do something like this to represent a shape that can be extended in other areas of the program.</p><pre><code><span>abstract</span> <span>class</span> <span>Shape</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>public</span> <span>double</span> <span>area</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>        <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span><br><span>}</span><p><span>class</span> <span>Rectangle</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Shape</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>protected</span> <span>int</span> width<span>,</span> height<span>;</span></p><p>    <span>public</span> <span>Rectangle</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> width<span>,</span> <span>int</span> height<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>        <span>this</span><span>.</span>width <span>=</span> width<span>;</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>height <span>=</span> height<span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span></p><p>    <span>public</span> <span>double</span> <span>area</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>        <span>return</span> width <span>*</span> height<span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>class</span> <span>Triangle</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Shape</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>protected</span> <span>int</span> a<span>,</span> b<span>,</span> c<span>;</span></p><p>    <span>public</span> <span>Triangle</span><span>(</span><span>in…</span></p></code></pre></div></section></main></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/consistency_confidence_0_tw.png" alt="How to make New Year’s resolutions work for you" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><strong>Most New Year's resolutions fail</strong>. To be precise, it’s around 80%.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/why-set-yourself-up-for-failure-ditch-new-years-resolution-do-this-instead.html#:~:text=Seriously%2C%20you%20are%20rare%20indeed,is%20in%20the%20tradition%20itself.">[1]</a></p><p>Why do people still repeat something that mostly doesn’t work?</p><p>Because people love the concept of a fresh start.</p><p>From a certain date,&nbsp;<em>I’ll change my life, I’ll lose weight, start a business, I’ll be perfect</em>.</p><p>Can you hear the hope in this? Even if we’re unsatisfied with the current state of things, we can see our future brighter. Even if we’re fat and currently eating the 5th donut, we can feel somehow good about ourselves because we’re planning to stop doing this after a certain date.</p><p>The problem with resolutions is that we overestimate our abilities and time available in the future. We think that in the future we'll have much more time than right now. We make this mistake because we think about our future plans only in vague and unclear terms, but we’ll be probably just as busy as we are now.</p><p>We also think that our willpower will be much stronger than now. We think we won’t give up this time. It will be different.</p><p>This lets us get away with being lazy now and not trying. We basically throw all the effort on our future selves. However, when the date arrives and it’s time to change, most of us can’t do it.</p><p>Even if the previous paragraphs might sound discouraging, we still think that New Year’s resolutions can work. Drawing a thick line behind your past is helpful in changing yourself.</p><p>However, you need to think about New Year’s resolutions differently.</p><h2>How to make New Year’s resolutions work</h2><h3>1. Don’t say what the hell</h3><p><a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-start-working-after-you-procrastinated-the-whole-day">As we’ve covered here</a>, when people screw up something (like their diet) they say&nbsp;<em>what the hell</em>&nbsp;and binge eat everything.</p><p>This is the common reason why New Year’s resolutions fail. Once people fail at doing their new chosen behavior, they start thinking that it doesn’t matter now, and stop trying (or resume their bad habits again).</p><p>For example, people create a complicated “perfect” morning routine: Wake up at 6 am, do yoga for 15 minutes, write in a diary, take a cold shower... A few days in, they don’t wake up on time and they say:&nbsp;<em>I failed to wake up on time, my routine can’t be perfect anymore,</em>&nbsp;and they don’t do anything else. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>Let’s say you decide you finally want to start publishing your blog posts and you commit to writing for 30 minutes every day. You’re two weeks in and you forgot to write yesterday. Most people will be really mad about not writing yesterday and many will say:&nbsp;<em>I screwed up, I didn’t follow the plan</em>, and then they don’t write that day or the next day, and then stop writing altogether.</p><p><strong>However, you don’t need to be perfect. That wasn’t the goal. The goal was to publish on your blog. You can still do that. Missing one day doesn’t mean anything in the long run.</strong></p><p>If you fail, forgive yourself and instead of saying&nbsp;<em>what the hell</em>, resume right now or the next day.</p><p>At this point in time, you might also not feel like you want to get after the original goal anymore. In this case, examine why you wanted to achieve the goal in the first place. Weak or impersonal reasons often lead to abandoning it rather quickly.</p><p>That’s why you should only choose to change the most painful things or pursue the things you want the most. Reasons like I heard it’s good for my career, my family wants me to do it, or it’s good to know multiple languages won’t cut it. Your reasons for changing should be strong and personal.</p><p>When you have strong reasons for why you wanted to change, you realize that doing anything at all is better than doing nothing. You understand that you don’t have to say&nbsp;<em>what the hell</em>&nbsp;because the goal wasn’t to be perfect, but better.</p><h3>2. Know that difficult times will come</h3><p><a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-change-yourself">As we’ve covered in How to change yourself</a>, the first wave of inspiration and motivation runs out eventually. This is when the real progress happens.</p><p>In the beginning, when everything is going great, we start wearing rose tinted glasses that make us overestimate our ability to control and change ourselves.</p><p>We think that we know it all.</p><p>The bad news is that after the first thrill runs out (usually takes a week or two), it gets more difficult. This is also when most people fail.</p><p>When it gets more difficult, that’s when you need to use your discipline to stick through with the behavior.</p><p>We tell you this not to discourage you, but to help you stay realistic. When you know that there will be some hard days, you won’t be surprised. Many people quit because they think everything will go smoothly and then they hit an obstacle and bail.</p><p>The good news is, if you stick with your new behavior for 3-4 weeks, it will become significantly easier later on.</p><p>Expect that you’ll need to use your willpower to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/3-tricks-to-start-working-despite-not-feeling-like-it">act despite not feeling motivated.</a></p><h3>3. Mindset shift: Start thinking about helping your future self</h3><p>When the difficult times come, we often get into a mindset of despising the endeavors we’ve decided to pursue. We feel like we&nbsp;<em>have to</em>&nbsp;do them and we don’t want to. We would rather do something easy like watching Netflix, playing video games, or checking social media.</p><p>You already know that you should remind yourself why you wanted to make a change in the first place. However, sometimes even this doesn’t help. Certain activities that are beneficial for you in the long term don’t feel great in the moment.</p><p>There is a simple mindset shift that can make hard things easier to do:&nbsp;<strong>You’re helping your future self.</strong></p><p>When you start thinking about helping your future self, instead of thinking about just suffering now with no payoff, everything gets easier.</p><p>Think about it in this way: Whenever you procrastinate, you make things harder for your future self. There isn’t a way to escape responsibilities forever. On the other hand, if you start working consistently, you make it easier for your future self. Additionally, your future self will eventually become your present self. It’s still you after all.</p><p>Everything you are or have is the result of the choices your past self made for you.</p><p>Eating healthy so you’re not fat?&nbsp;<em>Thank your past self for that.</em></p><p>Learned a valuable skill and can get a job easily?&nbsp;<em>Thanks, past me, I can buy nice things.</em></p><p>Finished a task ahead of deadline?&nbsp;<em>Great, I can now enjoy free time.</em></p><p>Next time, you feel like you don’t feel like working, remind yourself that every task you do successfully will help your future self. And when you get to that point in the future, you'll feel proud of the choices you made.</p><h3>4. Become accountable to someone</h3><p>One of the easiest ways to stick with a behavior is by becoming accountable to someone else.</p><p>We think we can hold ourselves accountable, but that often fails in reality. We’re great at coming up with rationalizations for why we ate that cake, skipped that workout, or checked social media in the middle of our workday.</p><p>I didn’t do it because ____________. We can always come up with good reasons for why we didn’t do something. We do this to protect our conscience because we don’t like to face the truth.</p><p>When you become accountable to someone else, however, rationalizations become way more difficult. The other person can easily tell whether you’re bullsh*ting or not.</p><p>Here are some ways to use accountability to your advantage.</p><h4>1. Take on a new habit with a friend</h4><p>One frequent use of this is the "gym buddy system." It can be hard to get ourselves to do a hard activity like working out, and commit to it.</p><p>However, if we make a pact with a friend to show up every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday after work and do a workout, we add a bit of extra pressure that helps us actually show up. We don't want to disappoint our friend, do we?</p><p>Do you have a friend who wants to do something you also want to do? Working out, journalling, studying...?</p><p>Make an agreement, set a time, and hold each other accountable!</p><h4>2. Make a bet</h4><p>Another way to motivate yourself can be making a bet.</p><p>You can also do this with friends or you can use a service like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stickk.com/">StickK</a>or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.com</a>.</p><p>Both services allow you to place a financial bet - if I don't do X, I will lose X money.</p><p>Beeminder gets data from a variety of sources - you can set a goal of writing a certain number of words every day or running X miles and connect it to Google docs or Strava, and if you don't honor your commitment, you'll lose money.</p><p>Sometimes pressure is productive. Want to heighten the stakes? Make a bet.</p><h4>3. Join Deschool program</h4><p>If you want to get serious about this,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/program">join our Deprocrastination Deschool.</a>&nbsp;We'll hold you accountable and help you make the changes you need to make.</p><p>We’re launching the next run on the 4th of January.</p><p>First, we will help you figure out why you procrastinate.</p><p>Then each week, we'll help you find 1-2 changes that you can make to improve your productivity and procrastinate less.

<p><em>Dec 31, 2020</em></p>
<p>Got a web app responding too slowly because of a database query?
The query plan is what you'd want to look at.
Let's look at the execution plan that Postgres shows you when you
use the EXPLAIN statement and see how to interpret that.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/using-explain.html">Postgres documentation on using EXPLAIN</a>
is excellent, but I thought writing a concise version will serve as a note to my future self.
To start off, let's run with a simple schema of three tables: (a) Users,
(b) Articles, and (c) Orders.</p>
<pre><code>users:
 id |      email
----+------------------
  1 | jon@example.com
  2 | Jane@example.com
</code></pre>

<pre><code>articles:
 id |    name
----+-------------
  1 | Playstation
  2 | Xbox
</code></pre>

<pre><code>orders:
 id | user_id | article_id | qty
----+---------+------------+-----
  1 |       1 |          1 |   2
  2 |       1 |          2 |   1
  3 |       2 |          1 |   4
  4 |       2 |          2 |   3
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose we want to query the <code>users</code> table by the email address, the plan that
postgres generates is:</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='jon@example.com';
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
   Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
</code></pre>

<p>Since we have an index on the email column, postgres has decided to use that
to search the users table. If we didn't have that index, it would do a sequential
scan over the entire table:</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='jon@example.com';
----------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..14.00 rows=2 width=222)
   Filter: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
</code></pre>

<p>To get all the orders of a user, the query plan is:</p>
<pre><code> EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=0.30..40.57 rows=6 width=238)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
         Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using orders_userid_index on orders  (cost=0.15..32.31 rows=9 width=16)
         Index Cond: (user_id = users.id)
</code></pre>

<p>What's going on here? First, postgres is using the index on the email column
to search the users table for users for email jon@example.com.
For each matching row (we expect a single matching row in this example),
an index scan is performed over the orders table get all orders for that user id.
Translated to pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>for user in users.filter(email='jon@example.com'): # uses the email index
    for order in orders.filter(user_id=user.id): # uses the userid index
        yield (user, order)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's try joining all the three tables to get the full details of all the orders of a user:</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    INNER JOIN articles
        ON orders.article_id=articles.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=0.45..41.71 rows=6 width=460)
   -&gt;  Nested Loop  (cost=0.30..40.57 rows=6 width=238)
         -&gt;  Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
               Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
         -&gt;  Index Scan using orders_userid_index on orders  (cost=0.15..32.31 rows=9 width=16)
               Index Cond: (user_id = users.id)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using articles_pkey on articles  (cost=0.15..0.19 rows=1 width=222)
         Index Cond: (id = orders.article_id)
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to joining the two tables, but we have another loop to join the third table.
In pseudocode, this is what's going on:</p>
<pre><code>for user in users.filter(email='jon@example.com'): # uses the email index
    for order in orders.filter(user_id=user.id): # uses the userid index
        for article in articles.filter(id=order.article_id): # uses article_id primary key
            yield (user, order, article)
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of an index scan, you might come across a bitmap heap scan like this:</p>
<pre><code> EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=4.37..23.02 rows=6 width=238)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
         Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Heap Scan on orders  (cost=4.22..14.76 rows=9 width=16)
         Recheck Cond: (user_id = users.id)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on orders_userid_index  (cost=0.00..4.22 rows=9 width=0)
               Index Cond: (user_id = users.id)
</code></pre>

<p>In a plain index scan, postgres fetches a row pointer from the index and immediately
fetches that row from the table. But with a bitmap index scan, all the tuple pointers
that match the filtering condition are gathered and an in-memory bitmap data structure
is created. From this, the actual tuples in the table are visited in physical location order.
This improves locality of accesses to the table and matters a lot for spinning rust HDDs but
can also help with SSDs too. What's that "recheck condition"? If the bitmap gets large,
postgres converts it to a lossy bitmap that stores only physical pages instead of individual
tuples. So when the tuples are read from the physical pages, postgres has to recheck which
tuples in that page match the filtering condition. Bitmap scans also do well when there
are multiple filtering conditions using ORs and ANDs since the bitmap data structure supports
these operations efficiently.</p>
<p>Postgres collects statistics about the content of the tables. If it expects very few rows
to match the filtering condition, an index scan is preferred. If many rows are expected to
satisfy the filtering condition, a bitmap scan is preferred. If a substantial portion of the table
is likely to be fetched, the sequential scan wins. One of the authors of Postgres, Tom Lane, has
an email thread on <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/12553.1135634231@sss.pgh.pa.us">this topic</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49024533">three types of joins</a> you're likely to come across in a
query plan are: (a) Nested loop join, (b) Hash join, and (c) Merge join. For example, here is a hash join:</p>
<pre><code> EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  (cost=14.03..47.45 rows=12 width=238)
   Hash Cond: (orders.user_id = users.id)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on orders  (cost=0.00..28.50 rows=1850 width=16)
   -&gt;  Hash  (cost=14.00..14.00 rows=2 width=222)
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..14.00 rows=2 width=222)
               Filter: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
</code></pre>

<p>The hash join can be used only when the join condition is the equality operator.
Postgres constructs an in-memory hash table of the filtered users and scans the
orders table and retains those tuples which have a matching user id in the
constructed hash table.</p>
<p>The nested loop is the preferred option when at least one side of the join has very
few matching tuples. Hash join is used when both sides of the join have a large number of tuples.
Merge join is preferred when both sides of the join are large but can be sorted on the joining
condition using an index.</p>

              <p>I often see people believe in their solution and think theirs are better than the others'. They defend their cases without having an exact reason. These situations often create long and meaningless discussions that go nowhere. Often they result in conflicts and people being offended by others' behavior.</p><p>Some people take action and implement their idea. Act fast, fail fast, and learn quicker. But this doesn't work when two or more people discuss how to implement a change or use new hyped technology. When people only talk a bit and implement a new hype, it often ends up with resentment. When we act and embrace failing that fast, we cannot keep someone accountable.</p><p>On the other hand, some people try to get everyone's confirmation to implement something that affects a large group. This strategy doesn't work either. Because it's impossible to get everyone on the same page, each person has a different opinion. When we try convincing everyone, we cannot implement anything at all. We just talk, and decisions come later than we need.</p><p>That's why we need to balance both taking action and asking people to present their opinion on a topic. This balance is achievable with an excellent process. I helped build this balanced process in an organization where we aimed to solve another problem - the lack of feedback. We introduced a process called <strong>Request For Comments (RFC). </strong>It is a common feedback mechanism in the software world presented by the Internet Society (ISOC) and used currently in the Rust language.</p><p>The RFC process uses a document written by someone about their proposal on a topic. It has <strong>a specific timeframe</strong> and <strong>everyone can give feedback</strong> on it. The RFC and feedbacks are posted <strong>publicly</strong>. Everyone can join the discussion. The goal is to include as many people as possible to access more points of view and spread the knowledge simultaneously. The good thing is that people focus on the proposed idea and give their feedback based on facts instead of only beliefs. On the other hand, it has a way bigger effect.</p><p>While the initial goal of the RFC is collecting feedback, I think it achieves a way more significant benefit by only <strong>writing the document itself</strong>. Writing shapes thoughts. Everyone has an opinion on any topic. But people who write their ideas form them into great content that is based on the facts.</p><p>Writing helps to clear the mind. When we write on any topic, we separate our proposal from ourselves. It's still part of us. But since we plan to present it to the public and leave it there forever, we start being careful. And most of the time, we are not starting with blank white paper.</p><p>The RFC processes use either a template or follow one standard style in documents. The aim is to help the authors to explain their plan in a structured way and, at the same time, make giving feedback easier. Each section of the document has its own goal, which helps separate the intent from the idea in a certain way.</p><p>We used <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/educ303x/wiki-old/uploads/Main/SRI_NABC.doc">the NABC model from Stanford</a>. The model starts with defining the <em><strong>N</strong></em>eed, followed by <em><strong>A</strong></em>pproach, <em><strong>B</strong></em>enefits, and lastly, <em><strong>C</strong></em>ompetitors. Separating the Need from the Approach is very smart. While writing the need, the authors have to understand it very well. The approach and benefits sections are pretty straightforward, where authors define their strategy and list down the advantages. Since most people focus on them when they talk about ideas, it's also easy to write. Then the competition section comes. It is the part the authors have to consider competitors of their proposal. Thinking about an alternative solution instead of their suggestion requires people to focus on the problem instead of blindly loving and defending their solutions. With these four parts, the NABC is a pretty good model. But it's not the only one.</p><p>Everyone has different needs. Therefore the formats might differ. Our manager at work also came up with a way more straightforward structure with only four questions to answer. It was only for our team, while the engineering department had the RFC process for a wider audience.</p><p>The RFCs have another effect on the organization. The process seeks a <strong>consent-based </strong>environment,<strong> not a consensus-based </strong>one. If some people care about a topic a lot and come up with a written document that explains many things in detail, everyone can (and should) trust them. The authors shouldn't wait for everyone's confirmation of their proposal. When they get enough feedback, they should be able to continue further with or abandon the idea. It's their decision. Since they prepared the doc and collected many comments on it, they can have a better judgment.</p><p>The process brings <strong>accountability</strong>, as well. Whoever writes the proposal should be kept accountable. When people know that they will be accountable, they tend to approach more carefully and consider different aspects seriously. Holding someone accountable doesn't mean that there will be a blame in case of failure. It only means that they have to follow up on their proposals, make sure it results in some way, and answer questions on the way. Also, most of the time, the RFC process is separated from the implementation process. While the author is accountable for the RFC itself, the implementation can be done by different people, and the RFC author might not be involved in it at all.</p><p>These hidden gems of writing the idea in a structured way and asking people for comments afterward prevents many endless debates. The culture changes with it as well. Instead of endless debates, we create discussions and solutions based on facts. The process prevents people from talking and doing nothing. Even though the RFC process might not be perfect itself, writing is enough to halt the endless and meaningless discussions. It also helps build trust in the community. So, if you are new to the RFC system, start with writing down your proposal. I'm pretty sure that the result will be way better than expected.</p><hr><p>Check out the comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25622149">HackerNews</a>.</p><hr><p><em>Cover Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@30daysreplay">30daysreplay Marketingberatung</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-fb5b0f28bd71f240bdf3"><p>For the past few months, we’ve been working hard on the next big update for <em>Diagrams</em>, and today we’re announcing <em>Diagrams 2.0 Macaw!</em> Read on to learn more about the upcoming changes.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1608210356524_22353"><p><em>Diagrams 2.0</em> is a new milestone for the app in terms of functionality. The update takes its name from the macaw, a beautiful parrot with vibrant, colorful feathers. Just as macaws come in a variety of colors, you’ll be able to apply an extended pool of colors to your diagrams. And in addition to the introduction of new color variations and text formatting options, we rethought the customization workflow from the ground up.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1608210356524_71943"><p>With <em>Diagrams 2.0</em>, you’ll be able to use different palettes. When creating a diagram, you can start with one of the preset palettes or create your own palette from scratch. Each document will have its own set of types in the palette, which can be edited, allowing you to create as many different element and relationship combinations as you need. You’ll no longer be limited to four colors of each shape!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1608210356524_75334"><div><p>Whether you want to do some simple brainstorming with just a few boxes, or create complex technical diagrams with dozens of different shapes, colors, and arrows, the new document palettes offer the flexibility you need!</p><p>Lastly, <em>Diagrams 2.0</em> will be ready for the next generation of the Mac ecosystem. In addition to a shiny new app icon and an overhauled UI specifically tailored for macOS Big Sur, it will include support for the Apple M1 chip.</p><p>This update is free for all existing users, and we can’t wait to share more details with you! Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/diagramsapp" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://diagrams.app/newsletter">subscribe to our newsletter</a> to be notified as soon as the update goes live <em>early next year</em>.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1608213579082_8666"><div><h2>Beta Program</h2><p>But wait, there’s one more thing! We’re starting a new beta program to get your feedback and improve <em>Diagrams</em>. The beta program will be limited to a closed tester group, but we’re happy to provide as many seats as possible. If you’re interested in testing new features during development, feel free to join the beta now!</p></div></div></div>]]>

I am a survivor of the Cambodian holocaust. That's who I am.”</p><p>“I believe what the old monk taught me. And everything he said came true, only in reverse. My family was unhappy, my village was unhappy, and so was the country. And now I look back on it all and think about the connections, and wonder whether I myself was partly to blame.”</p><p>“And when I saw their false pride, I felt I finally understood what war is about. Men fight for glory or ideals, but the result is not glorious or idealistic. The main result, besides the suffering, is that civilization is set back many years.”</p><p>“If I didn’t worry about the Khmer Rouge, it was because I didn’t believe they could be any worse than the Lon Nol regime… It surprises me now, but most of us pretended that life was almost normal. We made ourselves believe that Phnom Penh was a little island of peace and it was going to stay that way.”</p><p>“We had not been in favor of the revolution. We had not been against it. We didn’t even care about politics much. But now that the revolution had come, we had been bulldozed by it, reduced to the same level as the other exiles around us. And there was no new society building. Just the rubble of the old one.”</p><p>“To avoid our own deaths people like me were doing things we knew were wrong. And as we scrambled to protect ourselves, or sought to gain favor with the new powers, the old relationships were torn apart.”</p><p>“What made it worse, what made it more appalling was that somehow it was ordinary. You put one foot in front of the other and you kept on walking. You heard the cries of the weak but you didn’t pay much attention, because you were concentrating on yourself and your own survival. We had all seen death before.”</p><p>“How fast man changes! How fast he sheds his outer humanity and becomes the animal inside! … Children left their parents to die, wives abandoned their husbands and the stronger kept on moving. The Khmer Rouge had taken away everything that held our culture together, and the result was this: a parade of the selfish and the dying, Society was falling apart.”</p><p>“They knew that a small lie can be caught and that a big lie is easier to get away with.”</p><p>“There were no laws under the Khmer Rouge except the law of silence. There were no courts except Angka Leu. Maybe the prisoners hadn’t worked hard enough. Or they stole food. Or a chhlop, a spy, overheard them making remarks about Angka. People disappeared. That is all we knew. And I knew that someday I would be one of them.”</p><h4><a href="https://amzn.to/2KSRnZu">Confessions: An Innocent Life in Communist China</a></h4><p><em>Kang Zhengguo, translated by Susan Wilf</em></p><p>“‘Behavior’ meant putting on a deliberate show of allegiance to the authorities. When the teachers and school leadership evaluated your ‘behavior,’ they were referring to your politics, and you had to play the game right if you wanted a rating of ‘well behaved.’ Behavior ratings were as important as tests and grades since they affected one’s class rank, admission to select groups, and future prospects in general.”</p><p>“As I was browsing the big-character posters on the street on a winter day in 1966, it dawned on me that people everywhere were jumping onto the Cultural Revolution bandwagon to try to better their own lots, and I sensed their pent-up rage spilling out like water roiling over a dam… After paying lip service to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, which conveniently proclaimed the right to rebel, the aggrieved parties blamed all their problems indiscriminately on the bourgeois reactionary line. Now that leaders had been pronounced fair game, nobody was afraid to lash out at them anymore.”</p><p>“Instead of telling me why I was being detained or charging me with a specific crime and asking me to confess, he told me to make my deposition first. As if the reason for my arrest were a riddle to which only he knew the answer, he had turned the interrogation into a guessing game.”</p><p>“It was my first experience with such poverty, and I was learning some new lessons about human nature. Apparently, people could coexist only if everyone was equally destitute, and a stroke of good luck could be a nuisance in disguise.”</p><p>“Broaching the forbidden was tantamount to “advocating” or “appreciating” it; that was the prevailing logic.”</p><p>“Even if I had been duped, I had no reason to regret having performed a good deed.”</p><h4><a href="https://amzn.to/3aZ95Fu">Blood Red Sunset: A Memoir of the Chinese Cultural Revolution</a></h4><p><em>Ma Bo, translated by Howard Goldblatt</em></p><p>“It was my background. My mother sealed my fate the day she became a writer. People from literary families were among society’s foulest outcasts… Revolutionary soldiers hate cultured people, writers especially, so they had no use for me.”</p><p>“‘Ma Bo, the masses have complained about your behavior during these denunciation meetings… Just because you weren’t permanently labeled doesn’t mean there isn’t a label with your name on it. Labels are in the hands of the masses, who can stick them on you anytime they want!’”</p><p>“But getting angry wouldn’t do any good… I was a counterrevolutionary mirror that reflected people’s true souls. When they looked into it they discovered they weren’t as attractive as they’d thought. That made them unhappy, so they blamed the mirror.”</p><p>“Experience told me that Jin Gang’s sympathy for me was tied to his own interests. If I were drowning, he would be the last person to come to my rescue.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve noticed certain skills in people I admire, from Paul Graham, Vitalik Buterin, to Ender Wiggin.</p>

<p>Most normal people like me don’t realise these are skills. This makes the skills powerful - not everyone can see them, and very few people have mastered them.</p>

<p>However, I aim to change that. What follows below are 10 skills sourced from admirable people that I want to develop this decade.</p>

<p>Powerful life skills make powerful people.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">Learn to take compounding seriously</h2>

<p>It’s not just your wealth that compounds, but life experience and knowledge, too.</p>

<p>So, learn the most basic, most useful skills first. The longer you wait to learn skills like these, the less time there is for compounding magic. That’s what this entire list is about: powerful skills to learn and use for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>And even though you’ve heard about compounding, this item is first on the list, because <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/taking-ideas-seriously.html">taking ideas seriously is hard</a>.</p>

<p>A good way to figure out what compounds is <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">to figure out what’s a platform</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-develop-taste">Learn to develop taste</h2>

<p>Despite prevalent beliefs, taste isn’t subjective.</p>

<p>While it may seem like it on the outside, when you say “I just love this painting” or “I just love this coffee machine” - all it means is that the defining characteristics are illegible to you. And noticing this is the first step.</p>

<p>Let’s take a specific example. Say you’re designing a high quality clay pot - and you’ve never done this before.</p>

<p>What’s a good way to develop taste for quality here?</p>

<p>If you’ve heard this claypot parable, you know the answer: start by making lots of crap pots.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A,” forty pounds a “B,” and so on. Those being graded on “quality,” however, needed to produce only one pot—albeit a perfect one—to get an “A.”</p><p>

Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes—the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay. - <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9o17A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art and Fear</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Let others tell you what you’ve made is crap. Learn why. Notice when they tell you something is great. Figure out why.</p>

<p>This transfers to writing as well: Popular advice to get better is to write a lot of junk, do it a 100 times, and pay particular attention to what is received well. Here’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another example - developing taste for design</a>.</p>

<p>In effect, you bootstrap good taste by first learning what others consider good. Then, <a href="#learn-to-see-systems">you see the system behind it</a>. Then you break the rules and still manage to awe.</p>

<p>Then you’ve developed taste.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-sequence-things-well">Learn to sequence things well</h2>

<p>Waking up when others are asleep and getting lots done is a super power. It’s born out of a system of <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/sequencing-things-in-the-right-order.html">learning to sequence things well</a>.</p>

<p>It means choosing the right time for that Netflix binge.</p>

<p>It means being prepared before the meeting, not scrambling to get things done after.</p>

<p>It means reading the coursebook before the lecture, not after.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-what-others-see">Learn to see what others see</h2>

<p>How well can you understand other people? Can you sense their desires, their concerns, and what events lead to those desires and concerns?</p>

<p>If you can do this, you can understand them. But not before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. - <a href="https://amzn.to/2KKe8Px" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ender’s Game</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth going this far because understanding is powerful. It helps you empathise. It helps you negotiate. It helps you figure out why you don’t have product-market fit. It helps you learn quickly: you can switch through personas and see what will and won’t work.</p>

<p>How do you do learn to see? I know no better way than to practice. Try it a 100 times. <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/subscribe">Come back next year</a>, and maybe I’ll have a better way once I’ve done it a 100 times.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-make-and-execute-decisions-quickly">Learn to make and execute decisions quickly</h2>

<p>Most people have a bias towards analysis-paralysis versus getting shit done.</p>

<p>When decisions are reversible - and they mostly are - speed is a super power. Cultivating a habit of making decisions quickly, and then executing them is better than just thinking about it.</p>

<p>Training this skill begins as easily as deciding what to eat on a huge menu. It’s a small step, but over time, <a href="#learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">even the smallest steps compound</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s an <a href="https://firstround.com/review/speed-as-a-habit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example in the context of business</a>. And a <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1345140364995227648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet from Sam Altman</a>.</p>

<p>In the world of viral infections, a 50% lockdown is worse than a 0% and a 100% lockdown, both. The virus isn’t contained, and businesses have to shut down, too.</p>

<p>In the world of immigration policies, letting some specific people in is better than letting no one or everyone in. The middle ground is better than the extremes.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is great, you’re in a concave disposition.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is worse than either, you’re in a convex disposition.</p>

<p>The world is sometimes concave, and sometimes convex. Knowing your topology can help you make better decisions.</p>

<p>I first noted this when <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin explained it</a>. Read it for more concrete examples.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-tell-stories">Learn to tell stories</h2>

<p>People donate more to charity when they know a single victim’s story, versus statistics of a thousand deaths. It’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifiable Victim Effect</a>, but it’s the power of stories over facts. The right framing gets you further than all the facts combined.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideas &amp; facts contextualised by stories are more powerful than either alone.</p>

There’s lots to unpack here, and this is the first skill I’ve been working on for the past few months. Watch out for a long blogpost in 2 weeks!</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-dive-into-the-source-code-when-documentation-isnt-enough">Learn to dive into the source code when documentation isn’t enough</h2>

<p>Sometimes, there’s no precedent for what you want to do. Or the people who did it before didn’t write a manual.</p>

<p>In cases like these, figuring things out for yourself is powerful. Research papers and obscure books aren’t just for scientists. They’re freely available on the internet* for all of humanity to use. Learn to use it. Learn about resources like <a href="https://sci-hub.do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciHub</a>, <a href="https://libgen.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibGen</a>, and hiring researchers. You’re allowed to hire people (specially graduate students!) to satisfy your research concerns.</p>

<p>… and when you’re done, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#writing-code">preserve context for future you</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a lot like trying to use an API that has no documentation. Would’ve been easy if there was documentation, but there isn’t. So you got to do it the hard way: read the source code and figure out what you need to make things work.</p>

<p>It’s also like <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html">figuring out what you need to build rockets yourself</a> when existing ones are too expensive.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-be-specific">Learn to be specific</h2>

<p>Every time I gave an example above, I was training my specificity muscles.</p>

<p>Most of the time, most people don’t know what they’re talking about. Not being specific is a sign of that. The more abstract the word, the harder it is to pin down a meaning.</p>

<p>For example, “negative ramifications” doesn’t tell you what exactly happened, while “the sonic boom from the new supersonic jet destroyed windows in a 100m radius” is a lot more specific.</p>

<p>Learn to be specific, and learn to spot when others aren’t. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s how</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-systems">Learn to see systems</h2>

<p>There’s two kinds of people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bob, who will see this list, find some skills very interesting, and then go about honing those skills</li>
  <li>Alice, who will see this list, and wonder how I came up with these
<!-- - The Inspiration-Junkie, who will lurk and move on to the next inspiring post without changing anything -->
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice would then try to understand the system that generated these ideas. Then, she’ll adopt the system, and come up with skills possibly more relevant to herself.</p>

<p>Having the option to do both is powerful. Since Bob is the default, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">learn to be like Alice</a>. Choose <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/understanding-systems.html">systems when things are important</a> to you. Choose hacks when you need a quickfix.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
          
        
        <h2 id="what-does-varlink-provide">What does varlink provide?</h2>

<p>Everybody understands it. Varlink uses a simple human and machine readable <a href="https://varlink.org/#interface">text file</a> to
describe an interface with all its data types, method calls and errors. The text file, in its simplicity,
does not require any specific knowledge to join a discussion about design, development, and
maintenance of an API.</p>

<p>It documents itself, in the sources and on the wire. Varlink interfaces describe themselves readable to
humans and reliably consumable by machines. Varlink services are introspectable at runtime. Varlink
interfaces provide their documentation along with the interface description.</p>

<p>Everything is readable. Varlink uses plain text messages, has no magic numbers, no unnamed values, is
easily debuggable with things like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">strace</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">netcat</a>,
<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>.</p>

<p>Varlink itself is simpler than the service that uses it. Varlink uses direct connections, has no
central message handling component, it is easily debugged, secured, isolated, tested.</p>

<h2 id="which-transports-can-be-used-to-speak-varlink">Which transports can be used to speak varlink?</h2>

<p>Varlink can be implemented on any connection-oriented transport.The most common example are streaming
sockets, but it can also be implemented on kernel special files like device nodes or encapsulated in
other protocols, like HTTP, GSS-API or SASL.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-monitor-changes-or-subscribe-to-signals">How can I monitor changes or subscribe to signals?</h2>

<p>Varlink connections can be turned into monitor connections, they are soft-negotiated between the
client and the service. The client asks the server to possibly reply with more than one reply, the
server replies and indicates that it might have more replies and the client should wait for them.</p>

<p>To avoid race conditions between the reading of the current state and subscribing to updates, a
typical varlink monitor method call first returns the current state and then sends changes in
subsequent replies to the same request on the same connection.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-sequence-numbers-in-calls-and-replies">Why are there no sequence numbers in calls and replies?</h2>

<p>Varlink operates on connections, all messages are strictly in order on the same connection and always
received in the order they are sent. Connections support message pipelining, but not multiplexing.
Complex interfaces can use multiple connections at the same time.</p>



<p>The varlink message <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">header</a> can be extended by vendors if needed. Added keys should use
the reverse-domain notation including the vendor’s name. The concept is similar to the X-prefix used for
HTTP headers, but neither they nor naked keywords should be added by vendors, since they may clash with
other vendors or future varlink protocol specifications.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-records-separated-by-a-nul-character-and-do-not-specify-a-length">Why are records separated by a NUL character and do not specify a length?</h2>

<p>The simplest possible transport of varlink messages is a raw streaming socket, which forwards JSON
records separated by a NUL character. Conceptually the NUL character belongs to the transport not to
the varlink message. If varlink messages are encapsulated in HTTP, HTTP will specify the record length
and not use a NUL byte.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-unsigned-integers-and-why-are-there-no-integer-sizes-specified">Why are there no unsigned integers, and why are there no integer sizes specified?</h2>

<p>Like JSON, varlink is intentionally underspecified in this regard. The implementation should use
integers large enough to carry the signed integer value, and return an error if it cannot handle the
received number.</p>

<h2 id="the-varlink-type-system-specifies-features-which-do-not-directly-map-to-json-how-are-they-serialized">The varlink type system specifies features which do not directly map to JSON, how are they serialized?</h2>

<p><a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition#type">Enums</a> are serialized as a JSON name/value pair, with the enum value as a
string. <a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition#type">Maps</a> are serialized as JSON objects, every map element is
represented as a name/value pair.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-transmit-file-descriptors">Can I transmit file descriptors?</h2>

<p>Varlink intentionally does not support features or side-effects specific to transports. Encapsulating
varlink messages in other protocols, passing them over proxies is a requirement of varlink.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-reference-a-file">How can I reference a file?</h2>

<p>Varlink should be remotable, therefore you should not point a remote service to a file, which is local
to the client. Just send the content and an identifier/name of the file.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-transfer-larger-amounts-or-foreign-data">How can I transfer larger amounts or foreign data?</h2>

<p>You can either send the data as a string, or use the “upgraded” connection feature, where you opt-out
of the varlink protocol after calling a method with the <code>upgrade</code> <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">header</a> field set
to <code>true</code>. After sending this message the connection is yours for sending whatever you want. To
speak the varlink protocol to the service again, you need to open a new connection. Upgraded varlink
connections are similar to the websocket concept.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-a-oneway-request-useful">When is a <code>oneway</code> request useful?</h2>

<p>Setting <code>oneway</code> in a <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">method call</a> means that the service will not send a reply. This
might be useful when many messages are sent as part of one transaction, and only one single reply is
needed to confirm the transaction. It might also be useful for non-critical data like a debugging
interface, to minimize round-trip handling.</p>

<p>The most important reason to add this feature right from the start is, that it could not be added to
the protocol at a later time, because all implementations need to support it right away to correctly
handle the strict message ordering requirement.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-error-numbers-or-human-readable-messages-in-errors">Why are there no error numbers or human readable messages in errors?</h2>

<p>Varlink errors are interface-specific and identified by a string. If required, Interfaces could add a
<code>message</code> field to the error parameters which contain human readable text. The primary focus of
varlink errors is machine consumption, in most cases a carefully chosen descriptive CamelCase error
sufficiently describes the error to humans.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-find-the-service-which-implements-a-local-interface">How do I find the service which implements a local interface?</h2>

<p>On systems with the <code>org.varlink.resolver</code> interface reachable on a defined varlink URI, the
client can call the <code>method org.varlink.resolver.Resolve(interface: string) -&gt; (address: string)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-varlink-services-accessed-from-a-remote-machine">How are varlink services accessed from a remote machine?</h2>

<p>The varlink command line tool, as well as some varlink language bindings offer the possibility to
connect to a service via a <code>bridge</code>.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Python:
<a href="https://varlink.org/python/#varlink.Client.new_with_bridge">varlink.Client.new_with_bridge()</a></li>
  <li>Rust:
<a href="https://docs.rs/varlink/4.0.0/varlink/struct.Connection.html#method.with_bridge">Connection::with_bridge()</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The bridge command normally is <code>ssh &lt;host&gt; varlink bridge</code>, calling <code>varlink bridge</code> on the
remote host. The <code>varlink bridge</code> command parses all method calls on stdin, queries the
<code>org.varlink.resolver</code> on the remote system for the interface address, connects to this address
and forwards all method calls matching the interface name to the local service on the remote machine.
It reads the replies and passes them back to stdout. Instead of <code>ssh</code> any other connection command
 could be used. Instead of <code>varlink bridge</code> any other utility, which offers an equal
 functionality, could be used.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-get-the-version-number-of-an-interface">How can I get the version number of an interface?</h2>

<p>Varlink interfaces do not have a version number, they only have a feature set described in detail by
the interface definition, which is part of the wire protocol.</p>

<p>If your interface has users, you should not break the interface, only extend it, never remove or
incompatibly change things which might be already in use. Clients can fully introspect a service and
figure out which features the interface supports; this is more expressive than any simple numbering
scheme. If you break the API or remove stuff, just release it with a new name, commonly done by adding
a number to the interface name, like <code>org.example.interface2</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-extend-an-interface-in-a-backwards-compatible-way">How do I extend an interface in a backwards compatible way?</h2>

<p>Varlink does not use positional parameters or fixed-size objects in its interface definition or on the
 wire, all parameters are identified by their name and can be extended later.</p>

<p>Things like this are not needed:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
       /* … */
       /*
        * Reserved space to allow possible future extensions without
        * breaking the ABI. You should not touch these, because the
        * names of these variables may change.
        */
       uint32_t reserved_int1;
       uint32_t reserved_int2;
       uint32_t reserved_int3;
       uint32_t reserved_int4;
} my_service_struct_foo;
</code></pre>

<p>Extending existing structures should be done via optional fields (nullable type, maybe). The result of
the methods, when passed parameters without the optional fields should be the same as in older
versions. Method parameters can be extended the same way. The expected behavior for omitted
fields/parameters should be documented. Removing fields, types, errors or methods are not backward
compatible and should be avoided.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-socket-activation-work">How does socket activation work?</h2>

<p>Varlink language bindings commonly implement the systemd socket activation protocol. The environment
of the started service will be augmented with the variables LISTEN_FDS, LISTEN_NAMES, LISTEN_PID.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_listen_fds.html">Read more</a></p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-implement-exit-on-idle-for-my-service">How do I implement exit-on-idle for my service?</h2>

<p>Services can be started on-demand with socket activation. When there is no background task running and
no clients connected to the service, the service can decide to close the listening socket and exit. A
new connection from a client will activate the service again. Because varlink is strictly
point-to-point, there is no buffering involved and the service activator will queue all incoming
messages, exit-on-idle can be implemented in a race-free manner.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-restrict-the-access-to-my-service">How can I restrict the access to my service?</h2>

<p>The most commonly used method is to rely on the permissions of a UNIX socket in the file system.
Services which need a more fine-grained access control can check the connection credentials of a unix
socket and decide per call if they want to act on behalf of the client.
If varlink would be wrapped in GSS-API, e.g. kerberos tickets could be used for more fine grained
access control.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will introduce simple but useful basic widgets and explain the
widgets which we introduced earlier in more detail. All these widgets are really easy
to use. We have constructor functions with names which starts with "new" like
newButton(), we can add these widgets to containers, and connect them directly to
signals or map them to GActions. You should also study the C API documentation of
these simple widgets to learn about all the other functionality that is also
available, like provided functions, available signals or widget properties.  Remember
that GTK widgets build a class hierarchy so functionality may be provided by parent
classes.  For example the GtkCheckButton is a subclass of GtkToggleButton and both
are of course widgets, so you may have to consult all that API documentation to find
functions or properties that you may desire. Also consider using the devhelp tool to
navigate the C API docs. For the more advanced and complicated widgets like
GtkTreeView, GtkListView and GtkDrawingArea we will give only minimal examples in
this chapter to give you a basic feeling what they are and how they can be used.
GtkTreeView and GtkListView are powerfull widgets to display larger textual and other
data sets. And the GtkDrawingArea is a widget where we can draw arbitrary two
dimensional graphics by using drawing functions of the cairo graphics library. We can
use the GtkDrawingArea for pure display purpose, or we can combine it with user input
activities to create advanced CAD tools. One more advanced GTK widget is the
GtkGLArea which can be used to display three-dimensional OpenGL graphics.  But as
creating graphics with OpenGL is a wide area for which many whole books have been
written, we will not try to cover that topic in this book.</p>
<p>The GTK widgets can be grouped into container widgets which arrange other widgets
like GtkBox or GtkGrid, into mostly passive widgets for displaying data like the
GtkLabel, and into the active widgets which accept user input like GtkEntry. For an
overview you may visit the widget gallery page:</p>

<div>
<h3 id="_label">Label</h3>
<p>The GtkLabel is a simple widget that can display some text. The text can have
multiple lines when desired, can wrap automatically and can support style attributes
like italic or boldface. The label widget is mostly used to label other widgets or to
display some textual messages to the user.  GtkButtons use a label widgets to display
its text.  For the actual text display the pango library is used, which supports many
advanced text renderings like right to left text and many attributes like
strike-though, underline, overline (since pango v 1.46) and many more.  GtkLabels
like all GTK widgets support utf8 unicode text which allows display of glyphs of
exotic languages as well as a large range of symbols.</p>
<p>The GtkLabel is one of the simplest GTK widgets and the C API documentation should be
easy to understand and can be used in Nim straight forward:</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_properties">Properties</h4>
<p>GTK uses the concept of properties to set or modify the internal state of GTK widgets
or other entities.  For most properties GTK offers setter and getter functions which
we use when available, so we have not to deal with properties that often. But in some
cases it is necessary, so we will introduce the basics at this point already. GTK
properties have textual names like "wrap" or "gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" and
a typed state like boolean true/false, integer states or states of other types. In C
code most often the function g_object_set() is used to set one or multiple
properties. That function uses multiple untyped arguments. As it is not type safe it
is not provided by gobject-introspection and is not available in most high level GTK
bindings including Nim. Instead we use g_object_set_property() called just
setProperty() to set single properties in Nim.  Unfortunately that procedure needs a
GValue as third parameter which makes it use a bit complicated.</p>
<p>The following example program defines a helper procedure called toBoolVal() to create
a GValue with matching type and content from a Nim bool value. We use the resulting
GValue to set the wrap property of our label and the
"gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" property of our whole application. Both
properties expects a boolean GValue.</p>

<p>In our toBoolVal() proc we have to create a GType variable first. For this we can use
the typeFromName() proc to which we have to pass the correct GTK type name, or with
recent gintro versions we could use getType() procs like gBooleanGetType() directly.
Guessing the right name is not always easy — for string types we would have to use
gStringGetType() or typeFromName("gchararray"). With that GType we can first init() a
GValue variable and then set its value. GValues are used a lot in gtkListView and
GtkThreeView widgets, we will learn more about GTypes the GValue variables later when
we explain these widgets.  In the above example program we use the function
setProperty() two times. First we set the property
"gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" for our whole application to true. To do that we
query the default settings with a call of getDefaultSettings() and then set that
boolean value. The result is that our whole app uses a dark color scheme when
available. The second use of setProperty(), again for a boolean variable, is to set
the "wrap" property of one of our label widgets. For this the label class provides
the function setWrap() which we generally would use. We used a GtkBox to arrange our
two labels vertically in our window. We will learn more details about the GtkBox
containers in the next section.</p>
<p>While GtkLabels are most of the time passive entities, they provide some signals like
"activate-link" and "move-cursor".  By default label text can not be copied to the
clipboard, but we can call setSelectable() on a label widget to make it selectable.
Then we can click with the mouse on the text, we can select all or part of the text
and the label widget will get a popup menu which pops up when we press the right
mouse button allowing to select and copy the label text to the clipboard. This can be
useful when a label displays messages which we may want to copy elsewhere.  One of
the many useful functions offered by labels is setEllipsize() which determines how
text not fitting into the available are is handled. That function is often used in
conjunction with setMaxWidhChars() or setWidhChars().  Our second example program
below displays some chess pieces using utf8 unicode glyphs, and an ordinary text
which is displayed in a small font and which is shortened by showing ellipsis when
the enclosing window is small. The label widget with the chess pieces is made
selectable, so you can copy the content into another window, maybe into an instance
of the the gedit text editor.</p>

<p>In both label texts we use html tags like &lt;big&gt; or &lt;small&gt; to modify the text
display. Currently we have to additional call setUseMarkup() on the label to tell it
that html tags should be used. We may expect that for the case that we use
setMarkup() that should be not necessary — maybe it is a bug of early GTK&nbsp;4
release? Modifying the label display with enclosed tags directly is convenient, but
restricted to only a few attributes. In the next section we will lean how we can use
XML UI files to do more advanced text customization.</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_gtklabels_and_xml_ui_files">GtkLabels and XML UI files</h4>
<p>Earlier in this book we used already XML files to describe the structure of popup
menus.  And we said at the beginning of the book that GTK allows to declare the whole
GUI or parts of it with XML UI files which is then loaded by the GTK builder. Below
you can see such an XML UI file which describes a label and two buttons, which are
arranged into a GtkGrid widget.</p>

    <div><p>A colleague of mine has repeatedly called for some of the controllers in our project to be refactored. He says they're messy, but what I think he means is that they're hard to understand. At first glance they do seem complex yes but upon closer inspection:</p><ul>
<li>There are step-by-step instructions in the comments explaining what's going on.</li>
<li>Variable and method names are descriptive but not overly verbose.</li>
<li>The code is spaced, formatted and indented correctly.</li>
</ul><p>I can see why my colleague might see the code this way; it does have multiple concerns, but it came to be this way iteratively over the course of two years. Everything it does relates to a previously-defined requirement i.e. it does what it's supposed to. We also haven't made any changes to it for several months because it hasn't caused any bugs nor are there any major performance bottlenecks.</p><p>One common developer bias is that old code is bad. You've never heard anyone say the phrase "legacy code" without contempt in their tone. I <i>can</i> appreciate that sometimes old code doesn't conform to newer practices agreed on by a team. For example, legacy PHP code might use the now-deprecated PSR-2 standard, but the tech lead might want everyone to write PSR-12. But is this really a good enough reason to potentially jeopardise a piece of working functionality?</p><p>I think the reason old code is often seen this way is because it takes longer to remember. Developers yearn for clarity but if they're not immediately able to recall <a href="https://notoriousbfg.com/building-software-sharing-knowledge" target="_blank" title="Link: https://notoriousbfg.com/building-software-sharing-knowledge">under what circumstances some code was written</a> (in a few seconds or less), they only see ambiguity.</p><div id="posthaven_gallery[1659795]">

<p>Even when we talk about code, when we're able to recall previous conversations/decisions/motivations quickly, we can talk about it confidently and convey to others that we understand it well. Unfortunately saying, "I need five to ten minutes to refresh my memory of this" doesn't convey the same sense of confidence. Always prepare.</p><p>Part of the solution to reducing this "time to recall" is through better internal documentation. We use a tool like <a href="https://www.codestream.com/" target="_blank">Codestream</a> but I'll admit that context is not always captured; sometimes it's the "why" not the "what" that's relevant. In my opinion, good old-fashioned comments work best; I try to write mine like a numbered set of instructions. Of course you can also convey meaning with your git commit message.</p><p>The other part of the solution is to agree as a team under what circumstances code should be refactored. If your team collectively agrees that stable, well-documented code should be refactored, run.<br></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
<p>Compression is a trick that can be used to solve a load of problems. Often, your
tools will compress content transparently: most modern browsers ask for gzipped
HTTP payload, and some filesystems can be configured to compress blocks without
the user ever asking.</p>

<p>Outside of well known use cases, there are a variety of opportunities to improve
efficiency or save a load of money by leveraging compression. It’s useful to be
aware of common use cases, so you can take these opportunities when they arise.</p>



<p>As a recent example, my team were migrating logs from one Elasticsearch cluster
to another. While not quite Big Data™, this cluster had 10 billion log entries,
or some 60TB of raw JSON.</p>

<p>Having experience tackling long-running, large-scale migrations like this, you
want to build a process that allows you to ‘save game’ as frequently as
possible. This means you can build and run an export process, handling whatever
issues will occur (they will, I promise!), then move cleanly on-to the import
process. As with exports, your import process will also screw up: so it, too,
should be easily re-runnable.</p>

<p>As it is used across a load of GoCardless systems, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">Google
Pub/Sub</a> is a natural fit for this problem.
Google’s marketing tagline even sounds like it was written to describe our
ideal, decoupled process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that
produce events from services that process events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Pub/Sub, you <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher">publish messages to topics</a>. Each topic can
have many subscriptions, which <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber">consumers can pull messages
from</a>. In the most simple terms, the migration would:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Export logs from the origin cluster into a (per-index) Pub/Sub topic</li>
  <li>Configure the Pub/Sub subscriptions to retain events (set
<code>retain_acked_messages</code>, see: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview">Replaying and purging messages</a>)
so that we may replay them, if our import goes wrong</li>
  <li>Import logs by pulling messages from the topic subscriptions</li>
</ol>

<p>So, what’s this got to do with compression? Like most Cloud services, Pub/Sub
charges on usage, which means we’ll incur fees proportional to the data we’ll
push through the service.</p>

<p>These charges are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$40 per TiB delivered, applied to publish and subscribe</li>
  <li>Google Compute Engine network rates (we’ll ignore these, as they get complicated)</li>
  <li>Seek-related message storage, to retain our messages, at $0.27 per GiB-month</li>
</ul>

<p>In the best case where we import/export successfully on the first attempt (this
won’t, and did not happen), we’ll be charged <strong>2 x $40 x 60TB = $4,800 for
message delivery</strong>, as it will apply to both publish and subscribe. If we retain
our messages for 2 weeks while the migration is on-going, we’ll be charged <strong>0.5
x $0.27 x 60,000GB = $8,100 for message storage</strong>.</p>

<p>This leaves a <strong>lower-bound of $12,900 to perform the migration</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, GoCardless isn’t poor. And as a rule of thumb, you normally want to
optimise for engineering hours over infrastructure cost.</p>

<p>But if you can reduce cost with a minimal amount of effort, you should.</p>



<p>To this end, we made a small change to our migration tool (<code>elastic-toolbox</code>) to
support compression of the messages we published to Pub/Sub.</p>

<p>With error handling removed, this is the publish method, where we apply
compression after serialisation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Publish takes a message and publishes it to the Pub/Sub topic. If</span>
<span>// compression is enabled, the message payload is compressed, and the</span>

<p>As our savings will be proportional to our compression ratio (compressed /
original bytes), we care a lot about how compressible our data is.</p>

<p>JSON logs are likely to be very compressible as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Logs share many of the JSON keys, which can be de-duplicated (<code>kubernetes.pod_name</code>)</li>
  <li>Values of common log fields might occur very often (<code>kubernetes.labels.namespace</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the modified <code>elastic-toolbox</code> to run an concurrent export of three
different indices, we can use the
<code>elastic_toolbox_export_pubsub_write_compression_ratio</code> Prometheus metric (see
the <code>compress</code> method above) to build a heatmap of compression ratios:</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Compressed bytes / original bytes, always &lt;30%
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This heatmap shows that all messages compressed to <strong>at most 30% the original
size</strong>. When measured over our entire corpus of logs, we average at a <strong>~12%
compression ratio, meaning 1GiB of logs becomes just 120MiB.</strong></p>

<p>Our original bill of $12,900 has become 12% x $12,900 = $1,548.</p>

<p>This means <strong>we’ve saved about $11,500.</strong></p>

<p>Explore the data for yourself at this <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">Raintank Snapshot: elastic-toolbox compression</a>.</p>



<p>The most obvious next step was to apply this to our logging pipeline all the
time. Given we ship container logs straight into Pub/Sub, pulling them out of a
subscription into Elasticsearch, we can easily write a
<a href="https://www.fluentd.org/">fluentd</a> filter that applies the same compression
strategy.</p>

<p>My colleague Ben put together an awesome dashboard to track how much we save,
which works out to be <strong>several thousand a month</strong>:</p>

</figure>



<p>If you work in a Cloud environment, there are so many opportunities to save
money by compressing your data.</p>

<p>Beyond logs, another GoCardless example is a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/gocardless/draupnir">draupnir</a>. This service hosts copies of
our production databases for load testing and forensic analysis (query plan
prediction, etc). Google SSD storage costs $187 per TiB/month, which means every
copy of our <strong>5TB Postgres costs $1,000/month</strong>.</p>

<p>Draupnir might host several copies at a time, depending on the use cases. We can
save a load of money by enabling <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Compression">btrfs
compression</a> to
transparently compress the filesystem blocks, allowing us to use <strong>~70% less SSD
capacity</strong> than we may otherwise.</p>

<p>And if you thought compression was limited to cost savings, you’d be wrong!
Having suffered from occasional micro-outages when people ran large backfills or
built new database indexes, we solved the problem by enabling Postgres WAL
compression (see <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/postgresql-underused-features-wal-compression/">Postgres Underused Features: WAL Compression</a>,
or the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-wal.html">Postgres Write Ahead Log docs</a>).</p>

<p>The outages were caused by database operations creating a large amount of WAL
churn, where the replica would stall while writing the WAL to disk. By
compressing the WAL stream, we <strong>significantly reduced the IO spikes, allowing
the replica to handle the stream without issue</strong>.</p>

<p>There are more examples, but I think this paints a good picture.</p>



<p>Compression is a trade-off, a decision we make to trade CPU for another resource
that might be more expensive or less available. The value assigned to CPU,
memory, or network bandwidth continually changes, and you’ll need to make this
calculation on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>This post aimed to cover a scenario where the cost of compression, in both
compute resource and time-to-build, was significantly outweighed by the savings
it would make. Not all situations will have the same economics, but it takes a
few minutes of napkin maths to decide either way.</p>

<p>I hope this case study prompts consideration of compression outside of standard,
boring use-cases, and helps to find opportunities where you can apply it to your
own systems.</p>

<p>I will tell you a word, and you think of the first image that comes to your mind. Are you ready? Leader!</p>



<p>If you have thought of a white man, dressed in a perfectly fitting suit, you have thought about what most people think when they hear that word. But is that all there is for this word? Apart from the unconscious bias of race and gender, does it define leaders’ characteristics?</p>



<p>If we check the word ‘leader’ in the dictionary, we find:&nbsp;<em>“a person who guides or directs a group”.&nbsp;</em>That definition is so straightforward and clear that we often don’t question what makes a great technical leader. This article will dive deep into the requirements to become a great technical leader. We will understand the similarities and differences to non-tech leadership, and I hope this can guide you in your career.</p>



<h2>The first pillar: Teamwork</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/annie-spratt-O-40u5howqw-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/annie-spratt-O-40u5howqw-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/annie-spratt-O-40u5howqw-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p><span>Technical leadership doesn’t exist isolated; some other type of leadership always accompanies it.</span></p>



<p>An abundance of developers thinks their managers are obsolete dinosaurs who don’t know how to write a single code line. Yes, they may be right in some cases, but that doesn’t mean their managers cannot execute the tasks at hand. Let me explain!</p>



<p><span>The most important organizational factor for a company is to make sure they never lose sight of strategic decisions.</span> The bigger the company, the more substantial the term ‘strategy’ becomes. Enterprise strategy is the only way companies can guarantee employees are walking in the same direction and working for the same goals. Once the top management team decides which will be their primary goals, they are passed down to every team hierarchically, ensuring it reaches every single soul.</p>



<p>Managers are responsible for making sure their segment of the company is under control strategically, but not tactically, and there is where technical leadership shines. The fundamental responsibility of tech leadership roles is to make sure the manager’s strategic definitions are going in the right direction and that projects are executed correctly without hurting any of the premises defined by the board of directors.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>The quintessence of technical leadership success is to work with your business partners as if you were a single entity in this universe. If you don’t do that, you will be doomed, I promise.</span></p>



<h2><strong>The second pillar: Knowledge</strong></h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/matthew-feeney-Nwkh-n6l25w-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/matthew-feeney-Nwkh-n6l25w-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/matthew-feeney-Nwkh-n6l25w-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>You have become a technical leader. Congratulations! This promotion means you are a ‘knowledge reference’ to your peers. While this may seem counter-intuitive, <span>it means you now have way more pressure to keep yourself updated on computer science’s latest trends.</span></p>



<p>Let’s be sincere and frank here: people become more suspicious of you when you cannot clarify their doubts and help them solve their difficulties. There will be times where you will be challenged by developers both directly and indirectly, as they will try to check your boundaries and understand if you’re ready for that position. If you can answer those provocations politely and with strong fundamentals, you succeed at gaining developers’ trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Answer challenges appropriately and remember that if you respond in a non-polite way, you fail. You fail both because you have misbehaved and because you are there to support people. It is OK not to know things, make sure you write it down and be ready for answering the question the next day. Never say phrases such as: “Oh, you don’t know that? What a shame! Let me show you how to do that right”, that is typical of lousy knowledge leadership.</p>



<p><span>Never doubt your authority, but make sure you recognize your ignorance. Keep working on what you don’t know in a planned and organized fashion. Technology evolves fast, and without study planning, you will get obsolete fast too.</span></p>



<p>Another critical point is that <span>technical leadership implies that you will have to coach and help your peers think about problems in new ways.</span> But to delve into how to do that, we need to talk about the next pillar: communication.</p>



<h2><strong>The third pillar: Communication</strong></h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pavan-trikutam-71CjSSB83Wo-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pavan-trikutam-71CjSSB83Wo-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pavan-trikutam-71CjSSB83Wo-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>Just like non-technical leaders, you will be responsible for communicating your ideas, and your action plans to execute each one of them. You will receive several invitations to present ideas to various people, such as clients, managers, developers, boards of directors, etc. But what differs from the regular communication of business leads? Well, a lot!</p>



<p>The first thing you have to understand is that the higher you go in your leadership career, the fewer people will understand the words you use. The more you know, the greater your vocabulary and the attention you will give to the definitions you use; hence you can’t talk as you normally would. You have to put a lot of effort to talk using less technical vocabulary.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>I think this exercise applies well to this case, which helps techies explain challenging concepts in a very accessible format:&nbsp;<em><u>“How would you explain X to five years old with the fewer words possible?”</u></em>.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>From my personal experience, I can tell you that developers live a very pressuring moment where technology novelties emerge every day. The learning pace they need to maintain in their careers is hard, which gives origin to the famous imposter syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>The most important lesson I’ve learnt is that to motivate developers, the most efficient method is to help them learn new concepts and abilities</span>.&nbsp;That stern necessity to continually learn new things is the most significant pain in their lives. When you allow them to ease that pain, you start a genuine mentorship relationship that is exceptional for them and augment their loyalty and desire to work.</p>



<p><span>To create a safe learning environment for developers, you need to want that: genuinely!</span>&nbsp;Otherwise, you will cause questions and ideas to become threats. Developers will start to judge each others’ words, and you will create an oppressive environment.</p>



<p>It is harder for technical leaders to think of people first, but the truth is that no matter where you work, the labour output will always be produced directly or indirectly by people. But how can we excel at guiding a group of people?</p>



<p>First, you have to understand that almost every company oscillates into more relaxed and more challenging moments. The lower you go into the company’s hierarchy, the more difficulty you will find to maintain resiliency.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>Be positive! The world is a constant duality of good and bad aspects of everything. Always choose to see the positive elements of every situation!</span>&nbsp;You have the choice to look at things as opportunities, no matter how hard they are, it means people will learn new things in the process. Doing that is key to developing an inspirational communication style that motivates your followers and allows them to ease their uncertainties.</p>



<p>Remember that on the other side of all communication media, there are people. Demonstrate consideration and understand that everyone has feelings and personal lives, ambitions and dreams. It never hurts to acknowledge their achievements or ideas to improve work quality. Remember to compliment others when they do outstanding work, and teach them the lessons you’ve learnt to become a technological leader. They might want that too.</p>



<p><span>The most important concept here is: Be real! You are not a technological machine. When you act genuinely, you will perform accordingly: People first, then comes technology.</span></p>



<h2><strong>The fourth pillar: Vision</strong></h2>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash.jpg" alt="An image of a road suggesting long-term vision" data-id="791" data-full-url="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash.jpg" data-link="https://douglasrocha.me/?attachment_id=791" srcset="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>The last, but not least important pillar for a great technical leader is vision. It is expected from you to understand the direction that the company is going in the short and long-term (5+ years). This pillar is only possible when you accomplish all the previous steps to become a great technical leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have excellent&nbsp;communication&nbsp;with the&nbsp;business leads,&nbsp;you will never understand the company’s&nbsp;strategical direction. If you have poor contact with the developers, either because you&nbsp;lack knowledge&nbsp;or&nbsp;treat them poorly, you won’t have support to execute your projects. <span>This paragraph shows how important it is to build the previous steps before you go into this one</span>, so let’s dive into what we mean by vision.</p>



<p>As we said before, the higher you go into the company’s hierarchy, the more critical the word strategy becomes. An understanding of the long-term plan is the only way you can excel in technical leadership roles. To suggest new features and products, you have to communicate with business leaders, and unless you talk the same language as them, you won’t be able to sell your ideas.</p>



<p><span>It doesn’t mean that you cannot criticize the strategical plan of the company!</span>&nbsp;Remember you are a technical person, if business leaders make decisions that go against technology’s core principles, you have to express your opinions, so don’t be afraid to do that.&nbsp;<span>Make sure you are polite and build your arguments with analytically profound details.</span> The larger the amount numbers, graphs, and projections, the easier it will be to explain your criticisms.</p>



<p><span>When you achieve the enlightenment of where the company is going, you become the technical glue.</span> When managers fail to explain the vision, you will be responsible for guaranteeing the tactical execution of projects is going in the right direction, so you must pass on the vision to the technical team.&nbsp;<span>The big picture is essential because it allows us to create a sense of unity and progress</span>, enabling creating a healthy development team culture.</p>

<a href="#intro">#</a></h2><p>My previous post <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline">Object Detection at 1840 FPS</a> made some readers wonder who would need to detect anything at 1840 FPS, but my good friend and “performance geek” <a href="https://tanelpoder.com/">Tanel Põder</a> had a different response:</p><blockquote><p>Nice article, I wonder if you could get to 2000 FPS?</p></blockquote><p>Challenge accepted.</p><p>This article is a deep dive into the techniques needed to get there. We will rewrite Pytorch model code, perform <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/master/tools/onnx-graphsurgeon">ONNX graph surgery</a>, optimize <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/master/plugin/batchedNMSPlugin">a TensorRT plugin</a> and finally we’ll quantize the model to bits (to 8 bit precision, that is). We will also keep track of divergence from full-precision accuracy with the COCO2017 validation dataset.</p><p>Code supporting this article can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/pbridger/tensorrt-ssd300-8bit-quantized">github.com/pbridger/tensorrt-ssd300-8bit-quantized</a>.</p><p>A quick preview of the final results:</p><div><p>

<label for="tabs-Preview-3">All Results</label></p></div><p>So how do we get to 2000 FPS? My previous post already brought the big guns — a <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline">TensorRT-optimized DeepStream pipeline</a> was needed to hit 1840 FPS running on 2x Nvidia 2080Ti cards. This time we will abandon TorchScript and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk">DeepStream</a>, and we’ll put in the work to fully embrace TensorRT model compilation and execution.</p><h3 id="on-optimizing-arbitrary-numbers">On Optimizing Arbitrary Numbers
<a href="#on-optimizing-arbitrary-numbers">#</a></h3><p>1840 FPS, 2000 FPS, 2530 FPS — there is nothing special about any of these numbers, they are all hardware, resolution and model dependent. These optimization articles are about the practical usage of cutting-edge tools and techniques to achieve ambitious project goals or unlock cost savings.</p><p>Tuning a pipeline for throughput maximizes hardware utilization and efficiency in the datacenter, and it allows us to deploy larger models or more complex systems in compute-limited contexts (think IoT, embedded and mobile). It’s also just fun to explore the limits of powerful tools!</p><p>Let’s get started with a baseline from the <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline">previous article</a>.</p><h2 id="stage-0-deepstream-baseline">Stage 0: DeepStream Baseline
<a href="#stage-0-deepstream-baseline">#</a></h2><p>To recap, we got peak throughput with the DeepStream pipeline by using a hybrid model — a TensorRT-optimized SSD300 front-end with postprocessing code running in TorchScript in the libtorch runtime. All processing on GPU, of course. Here’s a reminder of some of the throughput milestones from the last article:</p><p>Why did we need TorchScript? Several common object-detection postprocessing operations — including thresholding and non-max-suppression (NMS) — can’t be seamlessly exported from Pytorch to ONNX and compiled with TensorRT. Leaving these operations in TorchScript allowed us to get great performance without rewriting any model code or creating TensorRT plugins.</p><p>Looking at the performance trace from Nsight Systems, we can see the TorchScript postprocessing comes in just under 10 ms. When we compiled the inference step with TensorRT we saw around 43 ms of TorchScript turn into about 16 ms equivalent processing — so anything executing in TorchScript seems ripe for optimization.</p><p>Here’s what it looked like in Nsight Systems:</p><a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/tensorrt-object-detection-quantized/images/ds_80pc_tensorrt_hacked_ds_two_batch.png"><figure><img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/tensorrt-object-detection-quantized/images/ds_80pc_tensorrt_hacked_ds_two_batch_hudc758a7e69d7157937e6a1d7caab6946_489589_896x520_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="520"><figcaption><small></small></figcaption></figure></a><p>Let’s eliminate the TorchScript postprocessing and get the entire model running end-to-end in TensorRT.</p><h2 id="stage-1-end-to-end-tensorrt">Stage 1: End-to-End TensorRT
<a href="#stage-1-end-to-end-tensorrt">#</a></h2><p>The baseline Pytorch SSD300 model (including postprocessing) cannot be easily compiled with TensorRT for several reasons, all of which involve missing (or impossible) support for tensor operations:</p><ul><li><p>Subscripted tensor assignment results in <code>ScatterND</code> (indexed assignment) nodes in ONNX.</p></li><li><p>Score thresholding uses a mask operation, which cannot be expressed in the fixed-dimension world of TensorRT.</p></li><li><p>Torchvision’s batched non-max suppression (NMS) operation has no exact equivalent in TensorRT.</p></li></ul><p>We can fix the first by tweaking model code and re-exporting to ONNX, but to fix the other issues we’ll have to modify the ONNX computational graph — replacing these operations with a TensorRT plugin.</p><h3 id="11-rewriting-subscripted-tensor-assignment">1.1 Rewriting Subscripted Tensor Assignment

But in polite company, we may try and substitute those swears with a similar-sounding word.</p>  <p>Robertson and her colleagues at the Swear Lab at Keele University in the U.K. wanted to understand what it was about swear words that has this analgesic effect on our pain, and if those fake swears are convincing substitutes for our brains.</p>  <p>Their research is published in the journal <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00723/full"><u>Frontiers in Psychology</u></a>.</p>  <h2>'Fouch' and 'twizpipe' just won't cut it</h2>  <p>To find out how swearing affects pain tolerance, Robertson and her colleague, psychologist <a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/people/richardstephens/"><u>Richard Stephens</u></a>, invented two fake swear words, 'fouch' and 'twizpipe.'&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We hypothesized that perhaps 'fouch' might help in the same way that swear words help because it sounds very similar, it's got that 'FFF-CHH' sound at the end," said Robertson, a post doctoral research assistant&nbsp;in the department of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford.</p>  <p>She adds that 'twizpipe' was chosen because it represented another hypothesis about why swears work —&nbsp;because they&nbsp;sound&nbsp;funny.</p>  <p>"There was an idea that perhaps swear words help because they're hilarious, and they help distract you in that way."</p>  <p>Robertson and Stephens then had 92 participants immerse their hands in a tub of ice cold water for as long as they could — which is a harmless, but painful experience. These participants were told to randomly repeat one of four words every three seconds - either a conventional swear word (in this case, the familiar 'f-word'), a neutral word (the word 'solid') and the words 'fouch' and 'twizpipe.' Throughout, the participants gave ratings of their pain perception, emotion, humour, and distraction levels, as well as had their hearts monitored.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>Swearing gives you that little bit of a jolt, it helps your heart beat faster, it helps your respiration rate increase, and so it gives you that power, that adrenaline to get through a stressful period.<svg focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="23px" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g display="none"><g display="inline"><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg></span><cite>- Olly Robertson,&nbsp; Keele University</cite></span></blockquote>    <p>The new 'fake' swear words had the exact same effect on pain threshold and pain tolerance as the neutral word.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

  <article>
	<header>
		
		<time date="2020-12-22">December 2020</time>
	</header>

		<p>
		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-sources.png" alt="Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, showing a lot of inlined unreadable scripts">
			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product / Company / Business landing page and marketing sites</li>
			<li>Personal portfolio / bio</li>
			<li>Blog</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from athe REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can I minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is on the rise, the economy is on a decline and businesses are re-structuring themselves around what many consider the new normal. Increasingly more organisations are opening themselves up to the possibility of working remotely beyond just the temporary measure in the fight against COVID-19. Many begin to see remote work as not only a necessary consequence, but rather as a new opportunity to diversify their workforce, increase employee productivity and cut some cost. The biggest cost saving obviously comes from office space, and not just in terms of raw square footage but also in location. When previously companies had to boast huge HQs in expensive areas, now they can spread themselves thinner across more affordable cities. Another big cost saving can come from employee salaries. A more distributed workforce and more work from home opportunities will inevitably mean a bigger talent pool competing for the same open positions, effectively giving employers a bigger choice.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to existing employees' salaries the direction taken by big tech companies couldn't be of starker contrast. Companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-50percent-of-facebook-employees-could-be-working-remotely.html">Facebook or Twitter</a> have made it clear that employees who choose to relocate to more affordable cities can expect big cuts to their existing salary whereas companies like <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/10/27/evolving-reddits-workforce/">Reddit announced that they won't reduce the salary of any of their 600 US workers</a> regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>These recent announcements have revived a <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-employee-compensation/">long standing debate</a> around the topic of <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/equal-pay-for-equal-work-at-a-remote-company/">equal pay for equal work</a>. Before COVID-19 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/28/why-we-pay-local-rates/">GitLab has already sparked a lot of controversy</a> around the concept of "cost of living" adjusted salaries. At GitLab two engineers who perform the exact same work could get vastly differently compensated based on where they live. It doesn't require a lot of imagination to understand that such policies can alienate a lot of good people and further contribute to the perception of an ever growing inequality gap. Personally I find cost of living adjusted salaries very problematic as they deflect from the real market forces which come into play. Those should be a decent minimum living wage and the forces of demand &amp; supply. If someone is a professional in a niche market, a rare specialist in a scientific field or an exceptionally sought after engineer then cost of living should have no say in determining their pay. Those so called knowledge workers are often higher in demand than there is supply. A good indicator for the scarcity of one's profession is when their employer recruits talent from all across the world and advertises unique perks such as relocation bonuses, dental care or exceptional holiday packages. These benefits would not exist if there wasn't a fierce competition for a particular skill.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real economics at play, it still comes down to a good old negotiation where each person has to stand up for their own beliefs and reach an agreement on their pay. If you find yourself in a situation where your current salary might be at risk due to recent relocation then hopefully the following write-up can help you to negotiate equal pay for equal work. It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.</p>
<h2 id="same-duties-same-pay">Same duties, same pay</h2>
<p>If you're reading this blog post then you're most likely not being paid for your time or place of work. You are being paid for your knowledge, your skills, your duties, the challenges which come with your work and most importantly the responsibilities of your role. Your professionalism and your personal commitment which you bring to your every day job will not diminish when you move into a new place. Whether you work remotely or not, you will still contemplate over that tough work problem in your spare time. You will still lose sleep over that big presentation the next day. You will still stay up late to meet an important deadline by the end of the month. You do it because you take pride in your work. You do it because of a sense of personal accountability to your team. It is those qualities which have earned you the trust of your manager over the years. It is those qualities which earned you a pay rise long ago. Changing postcodes doesn't take away your accomplishments from the past. Changing postcodes shouldn't take away the things which you have already earned before.</p>
<h2 id="same-value-same-pay">Same value, same pay</h2>
<p>The value of your contributions hasn't been compromised by moving house. Customers still pay the same price for the products which you have helped to build. Sales figures didn't drop when you went remote. Why should your employer reduce your pay when they are not passing that cost saving onto their customers by cutting their own price? Based on the same principle why your employer won't reduce their prices when downsizing office, you also shouldn't accept a lower salary after moving place. The concept is the same and you shouldn't accept one principle for them, but another for yourself. As you continue to deliver the same value and quality as before, you equally deserve the same compensation in return.</p>
<h2 id="your-savings-their-savings">Your savings, their savings</h2>
<p>Let's be clear, when you transitioned from office to home it's not like you're the only one who benefited from a lower cost of living as a result. Whatever savings you might have made on your rent, your employer does now too. Every person in an office requires an extra desk. Every additional person requires a fraction more of bathroom space. More people mean bigger kitchens, bigger break out areas, more meeting rooms, larger hallways, bigger stairways and more facilities to comply with fire safety regulations. There is more pressure on lifts to avoid bottle necks during peak times. There is more building maintenance work to be done and more frequent cleaning intervals required. A bigger workforce automatically means more individual needs. Extra bicycle storage rooms, canteens, car parks, private offices, outdoor spaces, a bigger selection of refreshments and a larger variety of office perks are just a few to name. Unless your employer is prepared to share their own operational saving directly with you, why should you share your personal operational saving with them? Fundamentally their savings are theirs, and your savings are yours.</p>
<h2 id="their-profit-your-profit">Their profit, your profit</h2>
<p>Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer re-structured themselves to benefit from lower tax? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer opened up a new factory in a less regulated place? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer outsourced a call centre into a country without minimum wage? Probably not, because it was your employer and not you who took the risk. Guess what, when you are courageous enough to relocate to a different country, city or state, then any financial gains from your move are also only yours to claim. This shouldn't be a huge surprise as nothing comes without its own significant risk. Economic security, social safety nets, unemployment benefits, retirement support, access to public health services, cost of qualitative education or medical treatment are often some of the compromises which have to be taken into account. Simple things such as free playgrounds for children, access to public recreational grounds, well maintained parks, a good public transport system funded by tax or basic luxuries such as political stability or the ability to safely park a new car on a public road are many other cost calculations not to be dismissed. Of course this is not always the case, but those considerations are for you to make. Nobody else, particularly not your employer, who has a financial interest of dismissing or downplaying those issues should be making those calculations on your behalf. This is such a basic principle that it's almost offensive to suggest the opposite. Your employer should not decide what sort of lifestyle you deserve.</p>
<h2 id="higher-cost-higher-pay">Higher cost, higher pay</h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, working from home is not cheap. First of all, working permanently from home requires an entire additional room. If your family lived in a three bedroom house before, now you need four.
Thanks to COVID-19 most will agree that working from a sofa is neither practical, nor sustainable or realistic by any means. A proper office desk and a good ergonomic chair are a necessity at the least. Those requirements alone make a legitimate home office significantly more expensive than many would like to admit. Throw in a couple of monitors, a qualitative web cam, microphone, printer, shredder, peripheral devices, a whiteboard, noise cancelling headphones, a mesh router and a backup laptop (assuming you'll get a work laptop provided) then the true cost of a home office begins to reach eye watering levels.</p>
<p>Some employers will try to provide you those supplies, but any seasoned remote worker will tell you to decline such an offer. After all you're still equipping your own personal home. You shouldn't have to pick from a selection of office desks which don't match your walls. You shouldn't have to settle on a chair which doesn't appeal to your eye. You shouldn't have to accept a black bezelled screen when all your other equipment is in space grey. Most importantly though, you want to treat those things as your own. You don't want to change your monitors when you change your job. You don't want to have to go through your employer to make a warranty claim. You don't want to ask for permission to replace a worn out chair. Instead you want to get a pay rise which allows you to set up your home office in the most productive way. If your employer is smart enough then they will not want to manage all of that inventory (which they never get to see) either.</p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, the true cost of working from home does not stop there yet. When working remotely nothing disrupts productivity more than a low bandwidth internet connection. One cannot …</p></div></div>

<p>The guide has six sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction.</strong> Why plan at all? To get more out of life, to take responsibility for your time.</li>
<li><strong>Tools.</strong> All you really need is pen, paper, and some time. There’s also a very quick introduction to mind mapping and mind mapping software. I then present my fourteen life categories that I use for breaking down my life into its constituent parts and analyzing them.</li>
<li><strong>A snapshot of the past year.</strong> Using the fourteen categories, how are things going? What went well or poorly in the past year? What is the status of your goals and projects?</li>
<li><strong>The next 8,760 hours.</strong> First off, what is your “ideal you”? What do you want each area of your life to look like in an ideal world? Which areas need the most work? What are your major projects or goals to focus on in the upcoming year? Set some priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize for success.</strong> Setting goals is necessary but not sufficient. Using what’s known about <a href="http://alexvermeer.com/getmotivated/">procrastination and motivation</a> we can optimize our chances of success. If you address uncertainties before they creep up, you’ll be better prepared for them. If you schedule regular reviews you’re more likely to stay on track.&nbsp;Squeeze it all into a one-page calendar to keep yourself motivated and remember the big picture.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Resources.</strong> A small collection of additional resources to help you implement the rest of the guide and for further reading.</li>
</ol>

<p>A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, VOC 202012/01, emerged in southeast England in November 2020 and appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation. We fitted a two-strain mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to observed COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy, and deaths; SARS-CoV-2 PCR prevalence and seroprevalence; and the relative frequency of VOC 202012/01 in the three most heavily affected NHS England regions (South East, East of England, and London). We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%) than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that VOC 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number Rt to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures. It may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/reports/uk-novel-variant/2020_12_23_Transmissibility_and_severity_of_VOC_202012_01_in_England.pdf">Read the full preprint here.</a></strong></p>

Grey shaded areas (panels A, C, D) reflect the period of time when England was in a second national lockdown. We cut off the data after 1 December 2020 due to a substantial decrease in representativeness after this time (Fig. S4). (B) Proportion of S gene drop-outs (5 – 11 December) versus mean reproduction number (27 November – 4 December) by local authority in England. The one-week lag accounts for delays from infection to test. (C) Percentage change (95% CI) in Google Mobility indices relative to baseline over time and (D) setting-specific mean contacts (95% CI) from the CoMix study (9) over time and by age for local authorities that went into Tier 4 compared to the rest of England. Educ = education setting. Some local authorities that were within the South East, East of England, and London NHS England regions did not go into Tier 4 and were therefore included in the rest of England for panels C and D. (E) Estimates of R0 (50% and 95% CI) from CoMix social contact survey compared to Rt estimates from REACT-1 SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey for England. R estimates based on single and aggregated REACT-1 survey rounds are shown.</p>

January 3, 2021 | https://www.vincentdelft.be/post/post_20210102 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.vincentdelft.be/post/post_20210102">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I'll list some of my tips and tricks around OpenBSD. <br>
I'm using OpenBSD as daily machine since +10 years now and I'm still amazed how simple and powerful this system is. </p>
<p>So most of the elements listed here under will match <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ksh">KSH</a> on OpenBSD. I'm using Openbox as window manager, xterm as terminal and neovim as editor. </p>
<p>If you want to re-use some of those ideas, you will have to adapt it to your own config. </p>

<p>On OpenBSD folder's organization is :</p>
<pre><code>- Base applications in /
- Packages in /usr/local
</code></pre>
<p>So I push all my own application is ~/.local</p>
<p>So, one of my first line in ~/.profile is the following</p>
<pre><code>PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>An other important element for Windows Manager and xdg's tool (pkg_add xdg-utils)  is to find .desktop files in :</p>
<pre><code>~/.local/share/applications
</code></pre>

<p>I often have lot of xterm windows open. Generally they are split between the Openbox virtual desktops depending on the scope/activity. </p>
<p>But even that, I have lot of windows. So, I like to change their window title, in order to retrieve them more easily when doing a Alt-TAB or by checking the task bar. </p>
<p>To modify the window's title of xterm, here after a simple command I've added in my .profile:</p>
<pre><code>set_title()
{
    echo -n "\033]0;$1\007"
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you want to change the window's title, you just have to type in the window where you want a new title:</p>
<pre><code>set_title "dev branch xxx"
</code></pre>

<p>To avoid the monochrome of xterm, I'm using colorls (pkg_add colorls). </p>
<p>Then in .profile, I put:</p>
<pre><code>export LSCOLORS=gxfxcxdxbxegedabagacad
alias ls='colorls -GF'
</code></pre>
<p>The first line defines the color to use in the different situation. With colorls we have 11 different situations (directory, link, socket, pipe, exe, ...). For each of those 11, you must provide the foreground color and the background color. <br>
The second line is just to over-write the standard /bin/ls command. The -G is to use the defined colors, with -F colorls adds some visual characters to differentiate folders, executable, ... </p>

<p>As daily machine, I have a laptops, which travel a lot. So I need to know the exact state of the battery. This information is displayed on my status bar. But I do not look it so frequently. So, I prefer to have this information in my preferred shell. </p>
<p>I'm using the following script from my .profile file:</p>
<pre><code>battery()
{
    local bat=""
    local level=""
    local charg=""
    bat=$(apm -b 2&gt;/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$bat" -a "$bat" -lt "4" ]; then
        level=$(apm -l 2&gt;/dev/null)
        charg=$(apm -a 2&gt;/dev/null)
        if [ -n "$charg" -a "$charg" -eq "1" ]; then
            #charging
            print -- "\033[01;32m$level%\033[00m"
        else
            if [ "$level" -lt "20" ]; then
                #print red
                print -- "\033[01;31m$level%\033[00m"
            else 
                #print blue
                print -- "\033[01;34m$level%\033[00m"
            fi
        fi
    else
        #no battery
        print -- ""
    fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>It does report the battery status, if there is one, with 3 colors: green when the power cable is connected, blue when the battery is in good state, red when the battery is bellow 20%. </p>
<p>To have such information directly in my shell, I'm using it in PS1:</p>
<pre><code>export PS1='$(battery)\h:\w\$ '
</code></pre>
<p>By doing this, battery's usage is refreshed each time I press "enter". </p>
<p>The other parameters of PS1 does not provide colors, they display hostname "\h", folder "\w" and default prompt "\$". </p>
<p>Here after a print screen with colorls showing different type of files. Note that I've changed the window's title ;-)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.vincentdelft.be/static/post/post_20210102/color.png"></p>

<p>It's frustrating to type keywords completely, so I'm a big fan of the completion feature of KSH. </p>
<p>It's really easy to configure: just create an array with the elements you have to select. Then you just have to type TAB to have the relevant choice displayed in front of you. </p>
<p>I group them by command. </p>
<pre><code># ssh, scp
set -A SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS ~/.ssh/known_hosts
if [ -f /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts ]; then
 SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS="${SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS[@]} /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts"
fi
HOST_LIST=$(awk '{split($1,a,","); gsub("].*", "", a[1]); gsub("\[", "", a[1]); print a[1] " root@" a[1]}' $SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS | sort | uniq)
set -A complete_ssh -- $HOST_LIST
set -A complete_scp -- $HOST_LIST

set -A complete_ifconfig_1 -- $(ifconfig | grep ^[a-z] | cut -d: -f1)

set -A complete_signify_1 -- -C -G -S -V
set -A complete_signify_2 -- -q -p -x -c -m -t -z
set -A complete_signify_3 -- -p -x -c -m -t -z

set -A complete_sndioctl_1 -- $(sndioctl | cut -d= -f 1)

set -A complete_chown_1 -- $(users)

alias drcctl="doas rcctl"
set -A complete_drcctl_1 -- get getdef set check reload restart stop start disable enable order ls
set -A complete_drcctl_2 -- $(/bin/ls /etc/rc.d)
</code></pre>
<p>The first lines allow me to list all known hosts from known_hosts files. </p>
<p>The next group display possible interfaces on my machine for the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig</a> command. </p>
<p>The next group is to simplify the usage of signify, per type of command. </p>
<p>For sndioctl it display the possible parameters we can change. </p>
<p>for chwon's command, completion display the known users on my machine. </p>
<p>The last group of command concerns <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rcctl">rcctl</a>. Since I'm never using "root", I've created a drcctl command in order to have the usual commands as 1st parameter, then the list of possible daemon available on my machine. </p>
<p>With such completion, I'm no more forced to type the full list of parameters. </p>
<p>For example, if I type:</p>
<pre><code>ifc "TAB" i "TAB" scan, I will execute the command
ifconfig iwm0 scan

drc "TAB" sta "TAB" pos "TAB", will become
doas rcctl start postgresql
</code></pre>

<p>Very simple tricks with facilitate the usage of a system like OpenBSD and KSH</p>
<p>In the same "laziness" I'm also a big fan if <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>. I'll describe how I'm using is in a next blog's post. </p>

January 3, 2021 | http://pulkomandy.tk/_/_Development/_Opensource%20your%20abandonware | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://pulkomandy.tk/_/_Development/_Opensource%20your%20abandonware">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>As you may know, back in 2007 I ressurected the development of <a href="http://grafx2.googlecode.com/">GrafX2</a>.
this old pixelart program, made only for DOS, was left out 6 years earlier by the authors, that had moved on to more modern computers.
Today, graFX2 is amongst the best tool for pixelling, particularly on Linux or other alternative operating systems.
Many people are using it daily to draw really nice pictures. The newer versions added a lot of features such as layers, and there's more to come.</p>

<p>This was possible only because the authors decided to release the source when the project stopped. The code wasn't perfectly clean; it was tied to ms-dos
with some optimized parts written directly in assembly language and accessing the video card hardware directly. Of course, getting an SDL-based version out of it
was not easy. But still, it took considerably less time than rewriting everything from scratch. Also, part of the userbase for the old GrafX2 upgraded to
the new one. For some of them it felt like getting back home after years of using suboptimal tools.</p>

<p>During the revival of GrafX2, I had to develop my web searching skills a lot. First, the original GrafX2 website was offline, and the sourcecode was
gone with it. Thanks to <a href="http://www.filewatcher.com/">filewatcher</a>, an ftpsearch engine, and <a href="http://www.archive.org/">the web archive</a>,
I was able to locate a copy on some russian FTP. Then, I wanted to get in touch with the authors to let them know their software finally found some use.</p>

<p>But grafX2 isn't the main purpose of this article. Last month, I downloaded APlayer, a music player for BeOS. After some hacking to get it working on Haiku
(which eventually led to uncovering and fixing a compatibility bug), I noticed that most musics from Burned Sounds, my preferred chiptune collection, didn't load.
The strange thing is that most of them were in formats supposed to be recognized by APlayer. But looking closer, it turned out they are packed using the Shrink
algorithm. This is a packing system from Amiga days, which can be unpacked only on amiga for lack of any sourcecode or format information. Well, that was until yesterday.
Using my high web searching skills, I found the author of Shrink and kindly asked him by mail if he was willing to release the sourcecode for hissoftware, the last version being from
1996.</p>

<p>He was a bit surprised to see there was some files using Shrink still around, but he had a linux version of the archiver. This version is now released as GPL sourcecode
at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ashrink/">sourceforge</a>. This is an important step for me in getting more open source software available ; but also in preserving
old files packed in this format. I hope some other people will find it useful too.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention I also made possible the release of a whole lot of other BeOS software made by Arvid and Jonas Norberg. This include the sawteeth sound synthetizer, as
well as the backslash n demo, and also some other unfinished code.</p>

<p>The overall message is, for developpers : think about opensourcing your old projects. Even if the source is not as clean as it could be ; even if they are of no use for you ;
even if they only work on a dead since 10 years operating system : someone, somewhere, may find it useful. You can visit the <a href="http://www.unmaintained-free-software.org/wiki/Main_Page">
Unamintained Free Software</a> page to get some examples of how passing on a project to someone else may work. But not everything goes through this website.</p>

<p>For non-developpers, don't hesitate to get in touch with the devs, even for unmaintained apps, and ask for an open source release. If the software is dead, the author isn't going to get
anymoney for it, so why not release it so other people can improve it ? This is the fastest way to get more open source software. And don't be shy, developpers are, above all, normal people, and they
do like hearing from users.</p>

  <p>The early Research Edition Unix versions featured a program that would turn a stream of ASCII text into utterances that could be played by a voice synthesizer. The source code of this program was lost for years. Here's the story of how I brought it back to life.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-lost-code">Finding the lost code</h3>
<p>The (early 1973) Third Research Edition of Unix <a href="https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v3man/v3man.pdf#page=130">documented</a> a program that would receive as input ASCII text and convert it into phonemes that could then be played by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votrax">Votrax</a> voice synthesizer made by the Vocal Interface Division of Federal Screw Works. The program was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">M. D. McIlroy</a>, who documented its operation in a detailed <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/speak.tar">technical report</a>.</p>
<p>Although the program appeared in the Unix manual pages up to the 1975 <a href="https://ia800600.us.archive.org/19/items/v6-manual/v6-manual.pdf#page=251">Sixth Research Edition</a>, its source code was missing from the archives that had survived. Even its author lacked a copy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in 2011, Jonathan Gevaryahu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620170452/https://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2011-December/002538.html">found</a> most parts of the program's source code in unallocated space of a Sixth Research Edition disk dump. (This means that the code was once stored on disk, but was later deleted, and the parts where it resided were never allocated to other uses.) Even better, he could reconstruct a single block that was missing from the program's compiled version, which was also available. Based on these findings, I added the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.c">speak source code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.v">speech rules</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo">GiHub repository of Unix history</a> I am maintaining.</p>
<h3 id="reviving-the-code">Reviving the code</h3>
<p>To see how the program was working, I experimented with making it run and compile. As the program was written in an ancient dialect of C and was also unlikely to be portable, I first tried to make it work on a Sixth Edition Unix running on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMH">SIMH</a> PDP-11 emulator. This attempt quickly failed, because the console wasn't reliable enough to allow me to transfer the code via copy-paste.</p>
<p>I then run the PDP-11 2.11 BSD Unix on the same emulator, which offers rudimentary internet connection capabilities. After configuring a <code>.rhosts</code> file to allow remote copying (to obtain remote access, you simply add your remote host and user name), I was able to move the code to that machine.</p>
<p>However, compiling the code wasn't immediately possible. To make it compile I</p>
<ul>
<li>changed the old <code>=+</code>, <code>=^</code> to the modern <code>+=</code>, <code>^=</code> operators,</li>
<li>added forward declarations for functions returning pointers,</li>
<li>inserted an assignment operator in initialized constants (<code>int tflag 0;</code> became <code>int tflag = 0;</code> — I didn't even know this form ever existed),</li>
<li>changed calls from <code>seek</code> to <code>lseek</code>, and</li>
<li>added a proper exit code to <code>exit</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At that stage the program could compile, but was crashing when I tried to run it. Given that 2.11 BSD lacked <em>gdb</em> and was generally slow and difficult to use, I decided to port the program to modern Unix/Linux. I also added more declarations, including full function prototypes to find other problems. (In early versions of C you didn't need to declare a function before using it.) I then methodically removed all compiler warnings, which allowed me to pinpoint a variable that was declared as a pointer but used as an integer. By correcting its declaration I fixed the initial crash.</p>
<p>Now I had a program that compiled and run, but was still crashing in some cases, and also wasn't producing correct output. For this further changes were needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I replaced writing to a string with a write to a <code>char</code> array.</li>
<li>I corrected the size of a structure that was assumed to be 4.</li>
<li>I documented some functions to be able to follow the program logic.</li>
<li>I fixed the assumption that integers occupied two bytes.</li>
<li>I replaced integers initialized as pairs of characters (e.g. <code>'u1'</code>) with a macro that initialized the value in an endian-neutral manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these changes the program was able to compile the rules file and produce <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v5/v5man.pdf#page=285">Votrax phoneme codes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-voice-output">Getting voice output</h3>
<p>Votrax voice synthesizers and their descendant chips (which appear to use similar phoneme codes) <a href="http://www.redcedar.com/sc01.htm">are not longer marketed</a>. In order to listen to the generated voice I needed a workaround. My first attempt was to use samples from the <a href="https://github.com/sealj553/votrax-speak">votrax-speak GitHub repository</a>. Converting the phoneme Votrax codes into their mnemonic names, and passing the corresponding sample files as arguments to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX">SoX</a>, allowed me to create a sound file consisting of the phonemes played together. However, the generated sound file was almost unintelligible. As I read later, a great advantage of Votrax synthesizers was how they merged together the phonemes into continuous speech, which was not the case with my approach.</p>
<p>My second attempt involved using the phoneme output functionality of the <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng">espeak-ng</a> program. For this I created <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak/blob/master/votrax-espeak.md">a map</a> between the Votrax phoneme codes and the corresponding <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/phonemes.html">espeak phonemes</a>, which I then coded into a <em>sed</em> script that would feed <em>espeak</em> with the output of Unix <em>speak</em>. Through this method I was finally able to produce somewhat intelligible speech with a pipeline, such as the following.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>echo</span> Hello world <span>|</span>
<span>speak</span> speak.m <span>|</span>
<span>LC_ALL=</span>C <span>./votrax-espeak.sed</span> <span>|</span>
<span>espeak</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="code-availability">Code availability</h3>
<p>The revived source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak">this GiHub repository</a>.</p>

					<p>Once upon a time, someone with the handle “entha_saava” posted this question on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23791152">Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can someone knowledgeable explain how are lisp REPLs different from
Python / Ruby REPLs? What is the differentiating point of REPL
driven development?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is that there is a <a href="http://mikelevins.github.io/2020/02/03/programming-as-teaching.html">particular kind of programming</a>
in which you build a program by <em>interacting</em> with it as it runs, and
there are certain languages and runtimes that are designed from the
ground up to support that kind of programming.</p>
<p>Python and Ruby are not examples of such languages.</p>
<p>Why not? That’s the crux of entha_saava’s question, right? What are
these <strong>repl-driven</strong> programming systems, and what makes them
different from Python and Ruby and every other language that offers a
repl?</p>
<p>For that matter, what’s a repl?</p>
<p>The word <strong>repl</strong> is an acronym that stands for <strong>read-eval-print
loop</strong>. The term comes from the history of Lisp. From the start, sixty
years ago, the standard way of working with a Lisp has been to start a
language processor, type expressions at its prompt, and wait for it to
evaluate the expressions and print their results, before prompting for
another expression. Read, eval, print. Loop.</p>
<p>Nowadays, repls are all the rage. Every language and its brother
offers a repl. There’s a website, <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>, whose
entire purpose is to provide all the repls.</p>
<p>It doesn’t actually provide <em>all</em> the repls, of course. What’s
particularly ironic is that it doesn’t provide either of the canonical
repl-driven development environments: Common Lisp and Smalltalk.</p>
<p>That brings us back to entha_saava’s question: if Common Lisp and
Smalltalk are repl-driven environments, and Python and Ruby are not,
what’s the difference? What do Lisp and Smalltalk have that Python and
Ruby don’t?</p>
<p>What they have is a language and runtime system that are designed from
the ground up with the assumption that you’re going to develop
programs by starting the language engine and talking to it, teaching
it how to be your program <em>interactively</em>, by changing it <em>while it
runs</em>.</p>
<p>I can hear the objections formulating already. I’ve seen them
before. Yes, every language with a repl can do some things in the
repl. Obviously that’s true; if it weren’t, then the repl would be
entirely useless.</p>
<p>Being able to do <em>some</em> things in the repl does not make an engine
into a repl-driven programming environment. What distinguishes
old-fashioned Lisp and Smalltalk environments is that you can do
<em>everything</em> in the repl. They place no gratuitous limitations on what
you can do; if the language and runtime can do it, then the repl can
do it.</p>
<p>For example, you can ask the current version of Clozure Common Lisp to
rebuild itself from scratch by evaluating the following expression at
the repl prompt:</p>
<pre><code>(rebuild-ccl :full t)
</code></pre>
<p>CCL responds by completely rebuilding itself from source.</p>
<p>The point is not that you would want to rebuild CCL this way all the
time. The point is that there are no artificial limitations on what
the repl can do. The full range of the development system’s
capabilities is accessible from the repl.</p>
<p>That’s one of the first things I notice when using newer, lesser
repls: I’m always running into things I can’t do from the repl.</p>
<p>It’s not just about freedom from restrictions, though. Proper support
for interactive programming means that the language and its runtime
have positive features that support changing your program <em>while it
runs</em>.</p>
<p>Try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a function, <code>foo</code>, that calls some other function, <code>bar</code>, that
is not yet defined. Now call <code>foo</code>. What happens?</p>
<p>Obviously, the call to <code>foo</code> breaks, because <code>bar</code> is not defined. But
what happens when it breaks? What happens next?</p>
<p>If your favorite repl is Python’s or Ruby’s or any of a few dozen
other modern repls, the answer is most likely that it prints an error
message and returns to its prompt. In some cases, perhaps it crashes.</p>
<p>So what’s my point, right? What else could it do?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is the “differentiating point” of
repl-driven programming. In an old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk
environment, the break in <code>foo</code> drops you into a <strong>breakloop</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>breakloop</strong> is a full-featured repl, complete with all of the
tools of the main repl, but it exists inside the dynamic environment
of the broken function. From the breakloop you can roam up and down
the suspended call stack, examining all variables that are lexically
visible from each stack frame. In fact, you can inspect all live data
in the running program.</p>
<p>What’s more, you can <em>edit</em> all live data in the program. If you think
that a break was caused by a wrong value in some particular variable
or field, you can interactively change it and resume the suspended
function. If it now works correctly, then congratulations; you found
the problem!</p>
<p>Moreover, because the entire language and development system are
available, unrestricted, in the repl, you can define the missing
function <code>bar</code>, resume <code>foo</code>, and get a sensible result.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s a style of programming, well known in Lisp and
Smalltalk circles, in which you define a toplevel function with calls
to other functions that don’t yet exist, and then define those
functions as you go in the resulting breakloops. It’s a fast way to
implement a procedure when you already know how it should work.</p>
<p>If you’re a user of old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk systems then this
all sounds obvious to you, but that reaction is not common. Surprise
is much more common, or even suspicion: what’s the catch?</p>
<p>The catch is that the designers of your language system had to think
that facility through in the planning stages. You don’t get a decent
implementation of it by bolting it on after the fact. Breakloops need
<em>full</em> access to the <em>entire</em> development system, interactively, with
a computation and its call stack suspended in the breakloop’s
environment.</p>
<p>Let’s take another example of a facility designed to support
interactive programming. Once again, try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a datatype. I mean a class, a struct, a record type–whatever
user-defined type your favorite language supports. Make some instances
of it. Write some functions (or methods, or procedures, or whatever)
to operate on them.</p>
<p>Now change the definition of the type. What happens?</p>
<p>Does your language runtime notice that the definition of the type has
changed? Does it realize that the existing instances have a new
definition? When something touches one of them, does it automatically
reinitialize it to conform to the new definition, or, if it doesn’t
know how to do that, does it start a breakloop and ask you what to do
about it?</p>
<p>If the answer is “yes,” then you’re probably using a Lisp or Smalltalk
system. If the answer is “no,” then you’re missing a crucial element
of repl-driven development.</p>
<p>Remember: the point is to support programming <em>interactively</em>. You
don’t want to have to kill your program and rebuild it from scratch
just because you changed a definition. That’s silly; adding and
changing definitions is most of what you do! If your development
environment is going to support interactive development, then it had
better know how to keep your program running when you change some
definitions.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned Lisp and Smalltalk system know how to do that. There are
also a few other kinds of systems, mostly older ones, that know how to
do it.</p>
<p>These are not eccentric new ideas out of left field. They’ve been
around for half a century. They contribute materially to productivity
in interactive development.</p>
<p>They’re what sets <strong>repl-driven development</strong> apart from mere
development with a repl.</p>
<p>Now, not every programmer prefers that kind of development. Some
programmers prefer to think of development as a process of designing,
planning, making blueprints, and assembling parts on a
workbench. There’s nothing wrong with that. Indeed, a
multibillion-dollar international industry has been built upon it.</p>
<p>But if you prefer interactive development, if it’s more natural to
you, then it can make you enormously more productive, not to mention
happier in your work.</p>
<p>Interactive development with a proper repl-driven environment is the
exception. Most programming is done in other ways.</p>
<p>As a consequence, there are a lot of programmers out there who’ve
never even heard of it, who have no idea that it exists. My intuition
is that some fraction of those programmers would prefer well-supported
interactive programming, and would benefit from it, if they just knew
what it was.</p>
<p>Maybe if enough programmers are exposed to that style of programming
then we’ll begin to see new tools that embrace it.</p>

<h3 id="superhuman">Superhuman</h3>

<p>Superhuman is an invite-only $30/month email client.<sup id="fnref:pricing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pricing">1</a></sup> People like it for its sleek design, responsive speed, and suite of keyboard shortcuts to improve a user’s email efficiency. People justify this purchase over free alternatives by the fact that they spend hours on email everyday. Part of Superhuman’s feature offering includes read statuses, which is useful for executives and sales people who like to keep a pulse on their conversations.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.growthalytics.com/images/2021-01-02-the-sublime-text-editor-of-x/superhuman.png" alt="Superhuman Product Screenshot"></p>

<p>Users love Superhuman. Take a quick peak on Twitter<sup id="fnref:twitter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:twitter">2</a></sup> at the effusive praise the company gets. Andreessen Horowitz led the latest investment round in the company with a valuation of roughly $260 million.</p>

<p>Following in the tailwind of this prosumer email client that has taken Silicon Valley and Twitter by storm are a suite of companies claiming to be “Superhuman for x”.<sup id="fnref:superhumanofx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:superhumanofx">3</a></sup></p>

<p>As identified by Todd Goldberg, the “Superhuman of X” has the following traits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed for speed.</li>
  <li>Built as an opinionated product experience for a specific use case and/or target audience.</li>

<h3 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h3>

<p>I present Sublime Text: a piece of software more than a decade older than Superhuman, that shares the above attributes. Sublime can be driven primarily by keyboard shortcuts. It’s as thoughtfully designed as I have been shamefully unwilling to purchase the non-trial version for 80 USD. The similarities lie much deeper than that. Sublime has two close-to-instant-speed search-bars: one for opening a file in your project [goto] and one for executing commands.</p>

<p>Sublime Text is also simultaneously opinionated but also configurable. It is simple enough for a programmer to install, open, and “hit the ground running” on a big project with a combination of GOTO (⌘+P) and project search (⌘+Shift+F).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I once worked in highly regulated environments and needed a way to recall dozens of complex passwords that changed frequently. I tried to use a password manager, but could not due to the burdens and insecurity of some common design flaws. I wrote a Deterministic Password Generator <a href="https://github.com/62726164/dpg">DPG</a> to address this.</p><p>If after reading this you still wish to use a traditional password manager, I suggest that you put your passwords into a plain text file and symmetrically encrypt it with <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> or use <a href="https://www.pwsafe.org/">Password Safe</a>. I have no relation with either.</p><p>Here are three common design flaws in password managers:</p><ol><li>Password storage</li><li>Reliance on remote systems</li><li>Web browser integration</li></ol><h2 id="password-storage">Password storage</h2><p>When passwords are stored, they must be encrypted and then retrieved later when needed. Storage, of any type, is a burden. Users are required to backup stored passwords, synchronize them across devices and implement measures to protect them.</p><p>Users must also devise a master password to unlock the encrypted passwords stored by the password manager. This is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_keying">master key</a>. It is generally accepted that master keyed locks are less secure than non-master keyed locks. If the master password is exposed, then confidence (in all the passwords that it unlocks) is lost.</p><p>And, are we certain that the encryption used to store the passwords is implemented correctly? Has the encryption been externally validated? Some password managers are closed-source and proprietary and cannot be examined.</p><p>Encryption is hard. Even respected, expert developers with many years of experience (who seldom make mistakes) <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2011-01-18-tarsnap-critical-security-bug.html">do make mistakes</a> that render encryption weak or in some cases almost useless.</p><h2 id="reliance-on-remote-systems">Reliance on remote systems</h2><p>Ironically, password managers rely on remote systems largely because they store passwords. The first design flaw causes the second.</p><p>Remote systems are outside the user’s control. They are opaque and cannot be examined and should not be trusted with password management. These systems may not be available when needed. They may not be storing or transmitting passwords correctly.</p><p>Externally, the systems may seem correct (strong HTTPS, reasonable CSP) but behind the scenes, no one really knows what’s going on. How are the passwords being transmitted, generated and stored internally? Who has access to them?</p><p>Several popular cloud-based password managers have reported security breaches: <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/onelogin-breach-reignites-concerns-over-password-managers/d/d-id/1329034">1</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/potent-lastpass-exploit-underscores-the-dark-side-of-password-managers/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/06/hack-brief-password-manager-lastpass-got-breached-hard/">3</a>.</p><h2 id="web-browser-integration">Web browser integration</h2><p>Web browsers today have “everything but the kitchen sink” capabilities built-in and are becoming more and more complex each year. They are turning into whole platforms that have browser plug-ins and extensions for every possible need known to humankind.</p><p>While many of these add-ons are handy and useful, we should not trust them with password management. Browsers are just too complex and have far too much going on.</p><h2 id="dpg">DPG</h2><p>I wrote DPG (The Deterministic Password Generator) around 2010 to address the design flaws described above. Here are its key concepts.</p><ol><li>Never store passwords. Rather, generate them as needed based on user input. The need to backup, synchronize and properly encrypt passwords is removed. There is no master password that immediately unlocks all of the other passwords. There is nothing to become lost, stolen or corrupt.</li><li>Only run locally on end-use devices. No reliance on remote systems or web browsers.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/62726164/dpg">DPG is open-source</a> and has several implementations. The passwords it generates can be verified and validated by external implementations in multiple programming languages.</li></ol><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>DPG removes many of the flaws that I have experienced with traditional password managers over the years. Try it. You may like it. I hope you find it as useful as I have.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/passwords">passwords</a></li><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/compliance">compliance</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<!-- Article: Content
================================================== -->
<section>
	<div>
	<p>Please write a short essay in response to each of the three essay topics below. There is a 100-word minimum and a 250-word maximum for each essay.
</p>		<p>First, let’s briefly get a sense of what 250 words means. It’s two average paragraphs, or three lean paragraphs. Also known as: not a ton of space! The burden is on you to think about the meatiest point you need to make, and then to build your surrounding elements strategically, so that they help you deliver that point with maximum impact, concisely. It’s not as easy as it may sound. For our analysis, we’re mostly going to dig into the “meat” aspect.</p>
<h3>Essay 1: The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning.</h3>
<p>Strangely, this one rides or dies on the PROOF that you’re actually, truly, genuinely excited about learning. What serves as proof? Action. The stuff YOU DO in response to the stuff you’re inspired by… that demonstrates it, and makes it real. Anyone can CLAIM to be super inspired by X Y and Z and talk about it. But if all they do is talk, does it really matter? Not exactly the world’s sexiest Zen koan, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Something to consider here – something common to folks who are genuinely excited about learning – is an unusual comfort level with being WRONG. A thirst for learning is predicated on (1) acknowledging that you don’t know everything already, and (2) that the stuff you may THINK you know, is wrong or incomplete. Why mention this? Cuz it can help your case to give EVIDENCE of that. Have you ever been wrong about something, and were THRILLED to discover what ended up being a BETTER WAY OF LOOKING AT SOMETHING? Walk us through what it felt like, why it might have felt bad at some point, but why it felt GOOD eventually to have developed, improved, evolved. We need to really PROVE that you’re turned on by learning, and admitting that you’ve been wrong (and loved it), is an excellent way to do so.</p>
<p>Another way, alluded to earlier, is purely through action. Is there evidence of “tirelessness” when you’re attempting to learn something? We need to see ways in which you pursue this thing, especially when it’s INCONVENIENT to do so. In other words, if your pursuit is compelling, but kinda expected, it won’t weigh as much. If you decided you wanted to get some cereal, and then went out and bought yourself some cereal… um, okay? But if on the way, it started to rain, and a hurricane arrived, and the store closed, so you hitchhiked to another location, and that store was closed too, so you decided to call your friend you know who happened to have an extra box, but he wasn’t home, so you decided to……. [yada yada]…. You ended up with your box of Crispix. Now THAT GUY’s interest in “cereal” seems unimpeachable, no? Show us how, when pursuing something for the sake of learning, you’ve done it (1) when no one else was looking, or (2) when it became inconvenient to do so, but you still did it, or (3) when the risk of continuing to do it started to outweigh the benefits, or… you get the idea.</p>
<p>Most students will focus on THE THING they’re excited about, rather than proving their excitement through action. It’s that second group that ultimately wins, because we now have reason to believe that they have that forward-leaning trait which will carry them through college and beyond. (And that’s whole point of this question – to make sure you won’t drop out in freshman year when you take a class that’s harder than any class you’ve ever taken before.)</p>
<h3>Essay 2: Virtually all of Stanford’s undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate—and us—know you better.</h3>
<p>Classic Stanford undergrad question. The mistake we see 95% of the time on first drafts is the impulse to try to “slip in” resume highlights. As if this is a veiled attempt by Stanford to get those highlights, instead of, you know, just asking for them. The way to impress Stanford here is through honesty and charm. But mostly honesty.</p>
<p>Indulge us here and take two swings at this. On the first attempt, get it out of your system, whatever letter you want to write, just take a crack and then file it away for the time being.</p>
<p>On your second attempt, go with us on a little journey. Start by <strong>creating a roommate</strong>, leaving everything to chance (the same way it’ll more or less work out when you’re actually assigned a roommate in your freshman dorm). For starters, your roommate will almost certainly be the same gender. Now, generate a bunch of parameters, like ethnicity, height, weight, athletic/ musical/etc., liberal/conservative, east coast/southern/west-coast/etc., affable/surly, cool/not-so-cool, American/foreign-born/etc.…. Don’t spend too much time, because it doesn’t really matter much. Give this guy or gal a name. Again, don’t get stuck on this, the idea is to paint a vague picture. But once you have this picture, commit to it for a second. Imagine a real person on the other end.</p>
<p>Now, you’re gonna address a fresh new letter to this person. If the open-ended-ness of the Stanford prompt leaves you stuck, consider some of the following ideas. Write the letter using one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if your roommate just confided in you, and told you an incredible secret. Something that leaves your roommate in an extremely vulnerable emotional state having just put him/herself on the line. What might you reveal about YOURSELF in response? “Hey, so here’s something most people don’t know about ME…” (What might follow that up?)</li>
<li>Treat it as though it were a dating profile. What kinds of preferences would you reveal about yourself that might give the BEST clues about what you’re all about? Think about quirks and specificity here. If you were to say “I like Chinese food” it doesn’t say all that much since so many different types of people would fall under that same category. If, however, you were to say you absolutely HATE the HBO show “Game of Thrones” that would have the opposite effect since “most people are obsessed with that show (INCLUDING ALL OF US AT ADMISSIONADO, SO WATCH YOUR STEP!).” Can you stack up a few such preferences that, when summed, may help someone get a sense for what you’re all about, and even better, become more curious to get to know you better?</li>
<li>You know that classic question “if you were stuck on a desert island forever, what album would you bring?” … You can put a twist on it here. Name a few KEY possessions you’re gonna bring that’ll be essential to your comfort. Forget bland necessities like “a toothbrush” (since everyone will be packing one of those). More like, the “sounds of the rainforest” you use to lull yourself to sleep every night. Stuff like that. And possibly even suggest a few things you DON’T have that your roommate may bring to complete the set for total roommate symbiosis. You don’t need to follow this conceit exactly, but maybe this gives you an idea from which you can springboard to help show us something about who you are exactly, and what makes you … you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Essay 3: Tell us about something that is meaningful to you, and why?</h3>
<p>Ha, in 250 words… you’re asked to grapple with one of life’s more challenging questions. A fitting test for a place like Stanford. Let’s start with what NOT to do.</p>
<p>Extinguish the desire to imagine what Stanford wants to hear. If you pen a response that you <strong>BELIEVE</strong> will put you in good stead because you think it shows maturity, or emotional intelligence, or whatever else… you are in for a crash landing. Or, tell you what, let’s a make a deal. Write that version, and keep it handy. Now write <strong>ANOTHER</strong> version that may never ever see the light of day. Think of this as a private diary entry. An exercise that may lead to something. But take the pressure away that someone might read it, so be more honest than you might want to be otherwise.</p>
<p>For this version, imagine you’re addressing a &nbsp;huge crowd (as if you are the Pope, or MLK), and it’s a crowd of people who… aren’t really contributing all that positively to society. Maybe they’re lazy. Maybe they’re irresponsible. Maybe they’re disaffected. Maybe they’re dangerous. Let’s just call them the folks who aren’t model citizens of the world.</p>
<p>What might you say to inspire these folks? Think about it. If you were to say something obvious, wouldn’t it run the risk of not having much of an impact? Make it less about you (just for a second), and instead think about what you might say to inspire this crowd. If you were to say “say no to drugs” or “do unto others…” or “cherish each day as though it were your last” … hasn’t everyone heard it already? If they haven’t internalized those ideas, they’re certainly not gonna do so just because <strong>YOU</strong> said it, right? But they might if they hear something <strong>NEW</strong>, something fresh about what matters, in a way that may cause them to re-evaluate things or see things through a new lens.</p>
<p>Obviously, you won’t want to write about something trivial, like “driving a nice car matters because the value of a smooth ride is more pleasing than a bumpy one.” Unless it’s a cracking metaphor, something like that might make your message seem like you didn’t give it a whole lot of thought, or, worse, you’re someone who’s so privileged that that type of material comfort is truly something that matters more than deeper, cooler things. So, it probably will have to do with human interaction, or a way of approaching things, or a state of being, or the like. Think about where others are going wrong. What are others <strong>MISSING</strong>, in a way that leads to irresponsible behavior, actions, attitudes, etc.? What matters to <strong>YOU</strong> that makes you feel like your compass is pointed in a better direction?</p>
<p>This conceit (of addressing a crowd) is meant to unlock ideas, not for you to embrace the idea too literally. You’re not proselytizing. So, if it helps, use your imagination of …</p></div></section></div></div>

<p>I’ve recently been thinking about why listening can be very difficult. One aspect that always comes to mind, a practice that is exceptionally difficult to give up, is the tendency to finish other’s thoughts. Here’s some similar scenarios to illustrate:</p>
<p>Meet Alice, a senior engineer on a team and Bob a recent addition on the team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: Hey Alice. Got a sec?<br> Alice: Sure Bob. What’s up?<br> Bob: I was trying to use system X and I run into problem Y. I …<br> Alice: Oh, must be issue Z? That concurrency bug surfaces from time to time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can go one of 2 ways. Either, Alice is on the money and has helped Bob figure it quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: Oh! Right! I hadn’t thought about that. Why is that?<br> Alice: My pleasure.<br> etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or alternatively, Alice is off the mark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: I don’t think so. I’m seeing more of issue A.<br> Alice: I see. Must be the installation ordering!<br> etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both these cases, Alice quickly concludes what issue Bob might be facing. With her wealth of experience on the team and deep knowledge of the systems, she is able to usually have a good idea what the issue is. However, in both cases, Alice unintentionally doesn’t allow Bob to complete his thoughts. What else could Bob have said about the issue? He, for instance, could have elaborated on the steps he had taken so far, and how he went about trying to figure out the issue. All this information could have given Alice more context and a better opportunity to coach Bob as he ramps up on the team even better. It also could have fostered more relationship building between them. Unfortunately, this doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>Cases such as this are very common. Let’s look at Juan a manager and Neda, an engineer that reports to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Juan: Hey Neda! How’s the project going?<br> Neda: The project is coming along well. I do have some reservations on it’s value to the company. It…<br> Juan: What aspects are giving you reservations?<br> Neda: The project will take Y months and at best generate Z in revenue. <span>I…</span><br> Juan: That sounds pretty decent to me. This project has been a long time coming and will have impact around the company beyond revenue. It will…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Juan does a good job trying to understand the problem a bit better at the start asking a clarifying question. However, when he gets a whiff of what he thinks the issue is, he quickly jumps to address it, attempting to complete Neda’s thoughts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t possible to truly know what another’s thoughts are. We simply cannot <strong>(yet)</strong> read each other’s minds. If we don’t let others finish their thought, we risk souring the conversation and/or relationship: whether that means the other person has to correct us and redirect the conversation or that the other person resorts to not voicing their opinions.</p>
<p>We all have busy schedules and want to be efficient in our conversations. As leaders, we often are having similar conversations with many different people. So much so, that we usually know what the person is<span></span> <span>“</span>getting at”; it is very tempting to make the connections! The crux though, is that when we guess wrong, it can be disastrous.</p>
<p>So the next time you have the urge, pressing as it may be, to complete someone’s thoughts, hold your tongue. Let them go over what they think even if you’ve heard it all before. Before you respond, ask yourself, have they finished their thought? Are you about to complete their thought because you think you know what they are getting at? Don’t respond until they finish. With all the context they give you, give them that great response! They will appreciate you for it. If you really must, and can’t fight the urge, count down for 5 seconds of silence or try asking a clarifying question instead.</p>

	<div>
		<article>
			<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"><em>Seeing Like a State</em></a>, James C. Scott defines “legibility” as something a state imposes on its people and resources.  It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same<sup id="fnref:abstraction"><a href="#fn:abstraction">1</a></sup>, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.</p>

<p>One of Scott’s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests.  These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.</p>

<p>And so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps.  A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand.  If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it.  Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Image_of_the_City"><em>The Image of the City</em></a>, Kevin Lynch defines “legibility” as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it.  It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.</p>

<p>Lynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they’d navigate from one part of the city to another.  He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.</p>

<p>Some cities, such as Boston, were highly legible; its map was full of reference points, and its residents were confident in each step of their imagined journey.  Other cities were less so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A]lmost anyone can, if attentive, learn to navigate in Jersey City, but only at the cost of some effort and uncertainty.  Moreover, the positive values of legible surroundings are missing: the emotional satisfaction, the framework for communication or conceptual organization, the new depths that it may bring to everyday experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moral hazard described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em> exists in any field of design.  In software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software.  This is trivially true of enterprise software, since the users are not the buyers, but given the increasingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">monopolistic bent</a> of all software companies, it can be also true in the consumer space.</p>

<p>This is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry’s continuous attempts to resurrect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a>.  Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles.  As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.</p>

<p>Scott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they’re mostly process-oriented (“take small steps”, “favor reversibility”) and entirely focused on harm reduction.  For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.</p>

<p>But this is just one side of the coin; to apply the insights in either book we must understand both kinds of legibility, and what separates them.  To get there, though, we must first explore two works of fiction.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Gnostics were a collection of early Christian sects which fused the gospels with Platonic dualism.<sup id="fnref:gnostics"><a href="#fn:gnostics">2</a></sup>  A true Creator was responsible for the world of ideal forms, while a lesser being, a <strong>demiurge</strong>, was responsible for the pale shadow of our physical world.  For the Gnostics, the work of the demiurge was a veil over our eyes, created out of malice or ineptitude, and their goal was to pierce that veil, to achieve <strong>gnosis</strong>.</p>

<p>Philip K. Dick had a lifelong fascination with the Gnostics, and their ideas appear constantly throughout his novels.  Nowhere is this more evident than in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch"><em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the novel, the Earth has become uninhabitably hot, forcing everyone to take shelter in buildings or subterranean structures during the day.  People are being forcibly migrated to even more hardscrabble lives on nearby planets, which can only be escaped via Perky Pat layouts, effectively Barbie Dream Houses they can temporarily inhabit using Can-D, a drug illicitly distributed by the creators of Perky Pat.</p>

<p>Using the drug, users are transported to a single, perfect day in San Francisco, before the Earth became too hot, in the bodies of a wealthy, beautiful couple.  They can accessorize their escapism by purchasing “minned” items, which will appear full-size and functional within Perky Pat’s world.</p>

<p>This is a false gnosis, layering something simple and idealized atop the messiness of the physical world, rather than peeling it back.  False gnosis is a central theme in all of Dick’s writing, which makes him perhaps the only science-fiction author who truly anticipated our present day.  Like everyone else, he failed to predict the smartphone, but he alone seemed to understand how completely technology could intermediate our understanding of the world.<sup id="fnref:cyberspace"><a href="#fn:cyberspace">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Three Stigmata</em> begins with the return of Palmer Eldritch, an industrialist who had travelled to Proxima Centauri in search of new business opportunities.  He has brought with him a new drug, Chew-Z, which promises the same escape as Can-D without the need to buy any accessories.</p>

<p>Anyone taking Chew-Z can create their own world to inhabit, but every person in that world takes on aspects of Eldritch himself, sharing his prosthetic hand, eyes, and mouth.  Even as the drug seems to subside, Eldritch remains, making it impossible to know what’s real.</p>

<p>In time, it’s revealed that the returned Eldritch is not the businessman, but rather a dying demiurge who has assumed his form.  He toys with anyone who takes Chew-Z, creating escapist fantasies that prove to be every bit as flawed as their real lives.  By the end, Eldritch has begun to merge with humanity, even infecting people who never touched the drug.</p>

<p>Eldritch doesn’t offer gnosis, but neither does he offer pure escapism like Perky Pat.  He gives humanity an understanding of <em>himself</em>, of the nature of the veil over our eyes.  Even if it tells us nothing of what lays beyond, Dick seems to suggest it’s the most we can hope for.<sup id="fnref:exegesis"><a href="#fn:exegesis">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A different sort of demiurge is portrayed in Italo Calvino’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities"><em>Invisible Cities</em></a>, in which Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of all the cities he’s seen in his travels.  They sit in the Khan’s palace, at the center of an empire which has exceeded his grasp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption’s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.  Only in Marco Polo’s accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His descriptions of the cities, however, are narrow.  In one, he only describes a memory it evokes.  In another, he only describes the relationship between the city and its reflection in the surrounding water.  Sometimes the cities themselves are narrow; one such city has been reduced to freestanding pipes, with attached bathtubs and fountains, populated by nymphs and naiads.</p>

<p>These are pieces of cities, mixed and distilled from everything Polo has seen in his travels.  But at their core, they are facets of a city he never describes, the city he knows best, his birthplace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Polo said: “Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them.  And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To distinguish the other cities’ qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit.  For me it is Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco Polo is a worldly man, but he is not of the world; he is Venetian, and everything is understood and remembered through that lens.  What he has discovered, in the course of his travels, is that certain pieces of Venice are timeless.  These are what will survive the collapse of the Khan’s empire, what will constantly reoccur throughout time; always different in detail, but unmistakably the same.</p>

<p>And yet Polo, just like Eldritch, does not offer true gnosis.  Each city hides all but a tiny piece of Venice through omission and fantastic obfuscations like the nymphs and naiads.  Unlike Eldritch, however, he offers choice.  The set of cities he describes is neither minimal nor exhaustive; each can be considered or ignored in isolation.</p>

<p>These cities may obscure their underlying reality, but they don’t attempt to replace it.  Instead, they simply reveal a resonance, a commonality of experience we might otherwise have missed.</p>

<hr>

<p>The legibility described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em>, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is <strong>singular</strong>; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator.  The legibility described in <em>Image of the City</em>, and offered by Marco Polo, is <strong>faceted</strong>; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.</p>

<p>Creating singular legibility is simple: find something that’s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it.  What’s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you’d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.</p>

<p>Faceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively.  It’s not, however, something we can simply create on our own.  Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.</p>

<p>How do we lay the proper groundwork?  It depends on what you’re …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
		<p>Writing in a thick notebook can be troublesome when you get close to the end of a page. If you're like most people you will encounter a zone where the palm, fingernails or wrist (which I will refer to collectively as "palm") of your writing hand have nowhere to rest, and you may find yourself trying to "float" your hand over the page. As a result, control of the pen-tip becomes enough of an effort to hamper the free-flow of thoughts from the brain through the nervous system to their final conversion to written word.</p>

<p>At best, you get your point across, but usually not without some effort, frustration, and sloppy penmanship.</p>

<p>I suppose one could simply turn to a fresh page before this becomes an issue. That would probably be ok with cheap notebooks, but if you are reading this, yours is probably not cheap, and you intend to wring out all of its value by using every bit of its space.</p>

<p>Thus, as your palm starts to drift off the bottom edge of the page, it needs somewhere to rest...two possible solutions come to mind...one is free, the other cheap:</p>

<p>1. The Smart Phone Trick (free)</p>
<p>2. The Writing Mat (cheap)</p>


<p><strong>The Smart Phone Trick</strong></p>

<p>Placing your smartphone at the bottom of the book at the right point serves as a rest for your palm. It feels like instant relief, at least compared to the alternative of doing nothing at all. It's as if your hand lost its balance at the edge of the page, and the phone is there to catch it.</p>

<p>A smart phone is also a very good thickness (about 10mm) for this purpose. At some point it will be lower than the page you are writing in, and at other points higher, but the differential will never be very great because you won't always need it.</p>

<p>A thin paperback also works well for this purpose, but it can't be too wide or long because it will use up a lot of desk space and may even dig into your forearm. And you'll have to always remember to have it on hand. So, a smartphone is nearly the perfect size....and it is very handy for many of us most of the time. It may take some trial-and-error to figure out exactly when and where you need to deploy the device, but once you do, you will once again find your thoughts freely flowing to any point on the page.</p>

<p>And, as a pen-and-paper person, you may gain some satisfaction from knowing that technology doesn't always exist just for its own sake.</p>


<p><strong>The Writing Mat</strong></p>

<p>Writing mats (sold on this site) are great for enhancing the pen-to-paper connection, and if while writing you press hard with fine points it will protect the lower pages from impressions.</p>

<p>They are also great as a lower extension of the page you are writing on. For that purpose the thin plastic mats seem to work better than the soft mats because they are stiffer and give more support to the palm. But the soft ones work fine too. As you get to that troublesome point on the page, you just keep moving the mat down as long as you need to, and it provides a gentle slope on which your palm can rest.</p>

<p>The mat should be at least the same size as the paper. It can be larger, but larger doesn't have any real advantage other than being able to work with more notebook sizes. They are also harder to carry around. But even if you have the perfect size mat, you have to remember to have it with you, so you may prefer the smart phone trick anyway.</p>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>There are many folks that don't write in notebooks because of this very issue, but given these simple solutions it doesn't have to be hard at all. There is also a certain feeling of satisfaction, security and abundance when writing in a thick notebook, and anyone can deploy these or similar tactics in order to get the full experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>We hear a lot about APIs as financial institutions open up their services for public access, but webhooks can be just as useful for user experience in personal finance management.</p>
<p>APIs are more passive whereas webhooks are more pro-active.</p>
<p>This makes a difference from a programmatic point of view, which then affects user experience.</p>
<p>You can imagine this difference with e-mail for example.</p>
<p>Imagine a time before push notifications. Without push notification, the manifest practice is to "Check mail". Remember those quaint days when we used to push that Send/Receive button? That's API call for you.</p>
<p>While we can code applications in such a way as to check an API very often, it's not very bandwidth-compute-energy efficient.</p>
<p>Webhooks are much better. Like push notification, applications gets notified when a transaction happens and changes its state accordingly.</p>
<p>Along with the change of state, any other triggers or reactive components can then come alive, a much better pattern :)</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>"As Bitcoin surpasses previous price records and re-enters mainstream consciousness following several wilderness years, the twelve-year-old cryptocurrency appears to have “arrived” in the eyes of the market. The value proposition of an ungoverned, uncensorable digital means of value transfer is clear for all to see…but can humanity and Earth afford the thermodynamic price tag? </p>

<p>To maintain the integrity of the transaction record, the Bitcoin network creates a hard boundary to the outside through exacting validation requirements. However it does not possess any feedback mechanism or capacity to respond to the consequences of the thermoeconomic challenges it issues. This insensitivity of ‘mined’ cryptocurrencies to the energy sources used to secure them has led to criticism as to their inability to mitigate their ecological externalities."</p>

<p><em>by a literal banana</em></p>



<p>As a banana who lives among humans, I am naturally interested in humans, and in the social sciences they use to study themselves. This essay is my current response to the Thiel question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” And my answer is that surveys are bullshit.</p>



<p>In the abstract, I think a lot of people would agree with me that surveys are bullshit. What I don’t think is widely known is how much “knowledge” is based on survey evidence, and what poor evidence it makes in the contexts in which it is used. The nutrition study that claims that eating hot chili peppers makes you live longer is based on surveys. The twin study about the heritability of joining a gang or carrying a gun is based on surveys of young people. The economics study claiming that long commutes reduce happiness is based on surveys, as are all studies of happiness, like the one that claims that people without a college degree are much less happy than they were in the 1970s. The study that claims that pornography is a substitute for marriage is based on surveys. That criminology statistic about domestic violence or sexual assault or drug use or the association of crime with personality factors is almost certainly based on surveys. (Violent crime studies and statistics are particularly likely to be based on extremely cursed instruments, especially the Conflict Tactics Scale, the Sexual Experiences Survey, and their descendants.) Medical studies of pain and fatigue rely on surveys. Almost every study of a psychiatric condition is based on surveys, even if an expert interviewer is taking the survey on the subject’s behalf (e.g. the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). Many studies that purport to be about suicide are actually based on surveys of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. In the field of political science, election polls and elections themselves are surveys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I mean by “surveys” is standard written (or spoken) instruments, composed mostly of language, that are administered to subjects, who give responses, and whose responses are treated as quantitative information, which may then be subjected to statistical analysis. It is not the case that knowledge can never be obtained in this manner. But the idea that there exists some survey, and some survey conditions, that might plausibly produce the knowledge claimed, tends to lead to a mental process of filling in the blanks, of giving the benefit of the doubt to surveys in the ordinary case. But, I think, the ordinary survey, in its ordinary conditions, is of no evidentiary value for any important claim. Just because there exist rare conditions where survey responses tightly map to some condition measurable in other ways does not mean that the vast majority of surveys have any value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Survey evidence seems to be a new phenomenon. Robert Groves (2011) argues that it is a 20th century phenomenon, arising in the 1930s, achieving a golden age from the 1960s to the 1990s, and then falling off in prestige and reliability after that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is it important that surveys are new? I think it is important to remember that there is no ancestral practice equivalent to surveys. That is to say, there is no ancient human practice or context in which people anonymously tell the pure, innocent truth with language, in response to questioning, with no thought for the motives of the questioner or the effect of their answers. However, in the new, wholly invented ethnomethod of [doing a survey], it is imagined that subjects do tell the innocent truth, comprehending the underlying sense of the question but not answering with any motive or particularity of context. The anonymity of survey takers is given as proof that they feel free to tell the truth, rather than being perceived as a bar to asking them what they might have meant by their responses.</p>



<p>To get at the philosophical weirdness of the survey, it is necessary to dissect the phenomenon of survey-taking in detail. First I will consider the legal perspective, since that is an ancient domain of getting at truth through language in particular contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Surveys and Legal Evidence</strong></p>



<p>The vast majority of evidence in the legal context is and has always been testimonial. That is, a witness testifies in language to communicate some fact to the judge or jury, and the judge or jury then decides how much to believe it. This is true even for modern DNA evidence: the expert witness testifies about the alleged meaning of the laboratory findings, even if documents (also testimony of the writer or preparer) are also given to the trier of fact to examine. Good evidence and garbage evidence are both usually testimony.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the English common law tradition, the biggest rule about testimonial evidence is hearsay. To put it colloquially, the hearsay rule says that testimony has to come from the horse’s mouth. If you saw someone run a red light and crash into a fire truck, you could undergo the ritual of being put under oath (agreeing that negative legal consequences could befall you for untrue speech), and testify about what you saw in court. Then you would be subject to the further ritual of cross-examination, in which all the aspects of your testimony could be questioned: your vision, whether you had your glasses on, where you were positioned, what specifically you mean by “crashed,” your relationship with the driver, and perhaps even whether you had a past conviction for forgery, which might make you seem like a liar in general. Those responsible for deciding whether to believe your testimony would have the chance to look at your face and mannerisms while testifying, to look at your clothes and hair and grooming, to see whether your eyes are bloodshot, in order to judge your responses to questioning. This may seem superficial and unfortunate, but in conversation we make these judgments all the time. And a witness may lose credibility for appearing too slick as often as for appearing too tattered, as in ordinary life.</p>



<p>However, if you wanted to testify about what you heard <em>someone else</em> say, someone who isn’t present for ritual oath-taking and questioning, that would be hearsay, admissible only under a list of exceptions. The exceptions to the hearsay rule are generally contexts in which language evidence is considered particularly likely to be accurate and truthful, such as a record kept in the ordinary course of business, or an emotional shout just after the crash (the idea being that you wouldn’t have time to think up a lie).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Survey evidence, then, is plainly hearsay, since when we hear claims based on survey evidence, we get no opportunity to judge the credibility of the statements as we might in conversation (much less under oath). However, survey evidence is often admissible in legal proceedings, particularly under the much-abused “state of mind” exception. But I think the more common reasoning underlying admission of survey evidence is as stated by a legal scholar at the beginning of the golden age of surveys (Zeisel 1959): “[S]ince surveys provide the best, <strong>if not the only</strong>, evidence on certain issues, and since expert knowledge in the field has advanced sufficiently to protect the trier of the facts from error, the law may well lower its heavy guard” (bolded emphasis mine). In other words, survey evidence is admissible because there’s no other way to get at the underlying facts. Consider trademark confusion: how would one measure whether consumers confuse one mark with another except by asking them in some clever way? The phenomenon of confusion is hidden in the minds of consumers, and can’t be measured with calipers or rulers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even when surveys are the only way to get at some particular knowledge, they may be done well or poorly. Zeisel (1959), citing <em>Coca-Cola v. Nehi Corp.</em>, 27 Del. Ch. 318, 326, 36 A.2d 156 (1944), says:</p>



<blockquote><p>Other aspects of an interview can also become grounds for criticism. Word association tests given to students in a classroom were rejected because their reactions were “bound to differ from that of the buyer in the market place when confronted with the.., beverage …. ” As another court remarked, “the issue is not whether the goods would be confused by a casual observer, but [rather] .. .by a prospective purchaser at the time he considered making the purchase. If the interviewee is not in a buying mood but is just in a friendly mood answering a pollster, his degree of attention is quite different.”</p></blockquote>



<p>That is to say, even though a survey might be the only way to judge the phenomenon of confusion, a college classroom was judged to be sufficiently different from shopping in a store (e.g.) to render the survey meaningless. I find this standard touchingly exacting compared to the present lax standard for taking survey evidence seriously. The present standard seems to be that the more math you do to survey data, the more reliable it is.</p>



<p>The meaning of my title is from a joke told at the end of <em>Annie Hall</em>:</p>



<blockquote><p>I thought of that old joke—you know, this guy goes to a psychiatrist and say doc, my brother’s crazy! He thinks he’s a chicken. And the doc says, why don’t you turn him in? Then the guy says, I would, but I need the eggs. I guess that’s pretty much now how I feel about relationships. They’re totally crazy, irrational, and absurd, but I guess we keep going through it because most of us need the eggs.</p></blockquote>



<p>Surveys are perhaps the only way to get certain information, information about the most important and pressing phenomena, about happiness and suffering in all its forms. These are eggs that most of us need. So even though surveys are bullshit, they are not “turned in” like the unfortunate brother in Woody Allen’s joke, but embraced in a plausibility structure whose maintenance is widespread and in which we are all complicit.</p>



<p><strong>The Phenomenon of the Survey</strong></p>



<p>To understand what’s wrong with surveys, we must alternate between critically examining survey …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <p>
                Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Press down to soft
                drop. Use Z and X to rotate. Press enter to pause/unpause. Press
                escape to quick reset.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Pieces</h3>
            <p>
                There are 7 pieces total. There are 6 pieces made out of every
                possible configuration of 3 triangles, and 1 piece made out of a
                single triangle, which will always spawn in groups of 3.
                <img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/allPieces.png">
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Mechanics</h3>
            <p>
                The mechanics are very similar to NES Tetris. It uses the same
                DAS, entry delay, and level speed timings.<br>
                All of the pieces are made out of 3 connected right triangles.
                There is also a white, single triangle piece which can be used
                to fix holes in your stack. It will always come out 3 at a time.
                The single triangle is also special, lines will only be cleared
                once they have all been placed. This allows you to fill 3 lines
                to score a Tritris!
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Phasing</h3>
            <p>
                <b>IMPORTANT - Since the release of the Youtube video, phasing
                    has become easier. There are no longer any frame-perfect
                    tricks. Instead, all phases can be performed by holding each
                    key (rotate can now be held to become "charged").</b>
                <br>
                One of the most unique mechanics of Tritris is phasing. A piece
                will always move to the next location as long as the next
                location is valid (no intersecting triangles). By moving a piece
                in multiple ways at the same time, pieces are able to do many
                types of tucks and spins. Below are a few examples.
            </p>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/down.gif"></p><p>
                        The pieces are able to easily move down into an empty
                        space.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/downRotate.gif"></p><p>
                        For the bottom right triangle, X (rotate) is held once
                        above the desired position.
                        <b>Due to the phasing update, down does not need to be pressed.</b>
                        Once all 3 triangles are placed, the line clears.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/downMove.gif"></p><p>
                        Left or right are held when the piece is above the
                        desired position, and when the piece moves down, it also
                        moves horizontally.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/multiple.gif"></p><p>Here are a few examples of some phases!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <hr>

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/tritris.gif"></p><p>A Tritris is scored!</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In Tritris, clearing 4 lines at a time is not possible, so
                    the highest score value is obtained from 3 lines at a time,
                    a Tritris. This can only be achieved by settings up 3 rows,
                    each missing only one triangle, then placing a single
                    triangle in each row. Once all triangles are placed, the
                    rows clear and a Tritris is scored!
                    <br>
                    A triple is equivalent to a Tetris in NES Tetris, a double
                    is equivalent to a triple, and a single is equivalent to a
                    double.
                </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s still magic even if you know how it’s done.</p>
<p>— Terry Pratchett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Software is now as essential to research as telescopes, test tubes, and reference libraries.
This means that researchers <em>need</em> to know how to build, check, use, and share programs.
However,
most introductions to programming focus on developing commercial applications,
not on exploring problems whose answers aren’t yet known.
Our goal is to show you how to do that,
both on your own and as part of a team.</p>
<p>We believe every researcher should know
how to write short programs that clean and analyze data in a reproducible way
and how to use version control to keep track of what they have done.
But just as some astronomers spend their careers designing telescopes,
some researchers focus on building the software that makes research possible.
People who do this are called <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#rse">research software engineers</a>;
the aim of this book is to get you ready for this role by helping you go from
writing code for yourself to creating tools that help your entire field advance.</p>
<div id="intro-big-picture">
<h2> The Big Picture</h2>
<p>Our approach to research software engineering is based on three related concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#open_science">Open science</a>: Making data, methods, and results
freely available to all by publishing them under <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#open_license">open
licenses</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#reproducible_research">Reproducible research</a>: Ensuring that anyone
with access to the data and software can feasibly reproduce results, both to
check them and to build on them.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#sustainable_software">Sustainable software</a>: The ease with which to
maintain and extend it rather than to replace it. Sustainability isn’t
just a property of the software: it also depends on the skills and culture
of its users.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>People often conflate these three ideas,
but they are distinct.
For example,
if you share your data and the programs that analyze it,
but don’t document what steps to take in what order,
your work is open but not reproducible.
Conversely,
if you completely automate your analysis,
but your data is only available to people in your lab,
your work is reproducible but not open.
Finally,
if a software package is being maintained by a couple of post-docs
who are being paid a fraction of what they could earn in industry
and have no realistic hope of promotion because their field doesn’t value tool building,
then sooner or later it will become <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#abandonware">abandonware</a>,
at which point openness and reproducibility become less relevant.</p>
<p>Nobody argues that research should be irreproducible or unsustainable,
but “not against it” and actively supporting it are very different things.
Academia doesn’t yet know how to reward people for writing useful software,
so while you may be thanked,
the effort you put in may not translate into academic job security or decent pay.</p>
<p>Some people worry that if they make their data and code publicly available,
someone else will use it and publish a result they could have come up with themselves.
This is almost unheard of in practice,
but that doesn’t stop it being used as a scare tactic.
Other people are afraid of looking foolish or incompetent by sharing code that might contain bugs.
This isn’t just <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>:
members of marginalized groups are frequently judged more harshly than others,
so being wrong in public is much riskier for them.</p>
<p>With this course, we hope to give researchers the tools and knowledge to be
better research software developers, to be more efficient in their work, make
less mistakes, and work more openly and reproducibly.
We hope that by having more researchers with these skills and knowledge,
research culture can improve to address the issues raised above.</p>
</div>
<div id="intro-personas">
<h2> Intended Audience</h2>
<p>This book is written for researchers who are already using Python for their data analysis,
but who want to take their coding and software development to the next level.
You don’t have to be highly proficient with Python,
but you should already be comfortable doing things like reading data from files
and writing loops, conditionals, and functions.
The following personas are examples of the types of people
that are our target audience.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Amira Khan</dt>
<dd>completed a master’s in library science five years ago
and has since worked for a small aid organization.
She did some statistics during her degree,
and has learned some R and Python by doing data science courses online,
but has no formal training in programming.
Amira would like to tidy up the scripts, data sets, and reports she has created
in order to share them with her colleagues.
These lessons will show her how to do this.
</dd>
<dt>Jun Hsu</dt>
<dd>completed an <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a> fellowship last year after doing a PhD in Geology
and now works for a company that does forensic audits.
He uses a variety of machine learning and visualization packages,
and would now like to turn some of his own work into an open source project.
This book will show him how such a project should be organized
and how to encourage people to contribute to it.
</dd>
<dt>Sami Virtanen</dt>
<dd>became a competent programmer during a bachelor’s degree in applied math
and was then hired by the university’s research computing center.
The kinds of applications they are being asked to support
have shifted from fluid dynamics to data analysis;
this guide will teach them how to build and run data pipelines
so that they can pass those skills on to their users.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div id="intro-syllabus">
<h2> What You Will Learn</h2>
<p>Rather than simply providing reference material about good coding practices,
the book follows Amira and Sami as they work together to write an actual software package
to address a real research question.
The data analysis task that we focus on
relates to a fascinating result in the field of quantitative linguistics.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf’s Law</a> states that the second most common word in a body of text
appears half as often as the most common,
the third most common appears a third as often, and so on.
To test whether Zipf’s Law holds for a collection of classic novels
that are freely available from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>,
we write a software package that counts and analyzes the word frequency distribution
in any arbitrary body of text.</p>
<p>In the process of writing and publishing a Python package to verify Zipf’s Law,
we will show you how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize small and medium-sized data science projects.</li>
<li>Use the Unix shell to efficiently manage your data and code.</li>
<li>Write Python programs that can be used on the command line.</li>
<li>Use Git and GitHub to track and share your work.</li>
<li>Work productively in a small team where everyone is welcome.</li>
<li>Use Make to automate complex workflows.</li>
<li>Enable users to configure your software without modifying it directly.</li>
<li>Test your software and know which parts have not yet been tested.</li>
<li>Find, handle, and fix errors in your code.</li>
<li>Publish your code and research in open and reproducible ways.</li>
<li>Create Python packages that can be installed in standard ways.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="intro-using">
<h2> Using this Book</h2>
<p>This book was written to be used as the material for a (potentially) semester
long course at the university level,
although it can also be used for independent self-study.
Participatory live-coding is the anticipated style for teaching the material,
rather than lectures simply talking about the code presented <span>(Brown and Wilson <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/references.html#ref-Brow2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Wilson <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/references.html#ref-Wils2018" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/references.html#ref-Wils2018" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>.
The chapters and their content are generally designed to be used in the order
given.</p>
<p>Chapters are structured with the introduction at the start, content in the middle,
and exercises at the end. Callout boxes are interspersed throughout the content
to be used as a supplement to the main text,
but not a requirement for the course overall.
Early chapters have many small exercises;
later chapters have fewer but larger exercises.
In order to break up long periods of live-coding while teaching,
it may be preferable to stop and complete some of the exercises
at key points throughout the chapter,
rather than waiting until the end.
Possible exercise solutions are provided (Appendix&nbsp;<a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/solutions.html#solutions">A</a>),
in addition to learning objectives (Appendix <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/objectives.html#objectives">B</a>)
and key points (Appendix <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/keypoints.html#keypoints">C</a>) for each chapter.</p>

				<p>Recently I have been spending time on improving the performance of <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a> (my encrypted backup tool), and wanted to compare it to some existing tools to try and find its relative performance in the backup tool landscape.</p>
<p>This post compares <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a>, <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>, <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">borg backup</a> and plain old tar + gzip + GPG across a series of simple benchmarks.</p>
<p>What do all these tools have in common?</p>
<ul>
<li>They encrypt data at rest.</li>
<li>They compress data.</li>
<li>They have some form of incremental and/or deduplicated snapshotting.</li>
<li>They are all pretty great backup systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to checkout the project websites to learn more, let’s get to the benchmarks.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<p>For these tests we are using the following versions of the given software:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNU tar 1.32 + gzip 1.10 + GPG 2.2.23</li>
<li>Bupstash 0.6.1</li>
<li>Borg 1.1.14</li>
<li>Restic 0.11.0</li>
</ul>
<p>The test machine has an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X 16-Core Processor with 16 GB of ram, and an NVMe SSD hard drive. It is probably best to simply compare results relatively, as reproducing my test environment exactly would be difficult.</p>
<p>The scripts I used for my benchmarking can be found <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/EncryptedBackupShootout">here</a>, though they will definitely need tweaking for your environment.</p>
<h3 id="deduplication-and-compression">Deduplication and compression</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we take 20 different consecutive versions of the linux kernel source code and add them all to the same directory, we then create a snapshot and measure the size of the resulting tarball/repository.</p>
<p>The linux kernel versions chosen for this test are all the consecutive git commits preceeding version 5.9, with the resulting directory containing 21 GB of uncompressed files.</p>

<p>This benchmark shows the advantage the more sophisticated tools have over plain tarballs, they all have extremely good compression ratios when similar data is added multiple times to
a backup repository.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-fresh-directory-snapshot">Creating a fresh directory snapshot</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we are snapshotting a copy of the linux
5.9.8 source code.</p>
<p>The directory we are snapshotting is 1.1 GB comprised of 74725 files and directories.</p>
<p>The snapshots are all made to tmpfs so hopefully does not measure delays introduced by the network or disk activity.</p>

<p>Bupstash is the clear winner here for raw snapshotting speed.</p>
<h3 id="sending-a-fresh-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending a fresh snapshot to a remote server</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark except the files are sent to a remote server hosted on google cloud via ssh. This benchmark should only be considered an approximation of the effect latency has on the tool performance as it is so dependent on network speeds.</p>
<p>At the time of benchmarking my connection to the remote server can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>server -&gt; client 10MiB/s</li>
<li>client -&gt; client 2.5MiB/s</li>
<li>ping 32 milliseconds</li>

<p>Plain tar takes the win, Restic performs poorly here, it has a far more latency-sensitive upload protocol.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-incremental-directory-snapshot">Creating an incremental directory snapshot</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark, except now we measure the time for an incremental snapshot using the builtin caching mechanism of the tools. What this means is each tool keeps a record of what files it has already sent, and is able to
skip doing that work again.</p>

</details>
<p>Incremental tar is the clear winner here, but why are the other tools slower? I think this is mainly because the other tools present each snapshot to the user as a full backup and thus do extra work to spare the end user from managing incremental backups manually.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that <code>bupstash put</code> is an order of magnitude faster than the other similar tools, though I currently can not explain clearly why that may be the case.</p>
<h3 id="sending-an-incremental-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending an incremental snapshot to a remote server</h3>

<p>These results match closely with the local incremental snapshots.</p>
<h3 id="restoring-a-snapshot">Restoring a snapshot</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will restore the snapshot made in the fresh local snapshot benchmark to tmpfs. This is what measuring what happens when you need to do a bulk disaster recovery from your backup repository.</p>

<p>Bupstash is the winner for restoring backups.</p>
<h3 id="restoring-a-snapshot-from-a-remote-server">Restoring a snapshot from a remote server</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will restore the snapshot made in the fresh remote snapshot benchmark to tmpfs. The main difference from the previous benchmark is the introduction of
an internet connection between the backup repository and restore point.</p>
<p>Network conditions are the same as the fresh network snapshot benchmark.</p>

</tbody>

</details>
<p>Interestingly, the introduction of the network pushed tar ahead of bupstash for backup restoration - this is something I am very interested in investigating further.</p>
<h3 id="pruning-an-old-backup">Pruning an old backup</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will be removing an old snapshot from the backup repository on the same computer. For this test we generate a backup repository with 50 different snapshots of different versions of the linux kernel source code and then time how long it takes to remove one of the snapshots. This benchmark simulates
cycling old backups out of your backup repository when you no longer need them.</p>
<p>Tar with incremental backups does not easily support pruning of old backups, so does not participate in this benchmark.</p>

<p>The bupstash garbage collector is an order of magnitue faster than both restic and borg at pruning the backup repository.</p>
<h3 id="pruning-an-old-backup-on-a-remote-server">Pruning an old backup on a remote server</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will be removing an old snapshot from the backup repository stored on a remote server. The remote server is the same as the one used in fresh remote snapshot benchmark, and the test data is the same as the local prune bench mark.</p>

<p>Once again restic suffers the worst from introduced network latency of all the tools.</p>
<h3 id="approximate-peak-client-side-ram-usage">Approximate peak client side ram usage</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we repeat the fresh snapshot benchmark, but measure the peak client ram usage (RSS) as reported by the ‘time’ command. For tar we approximate this by summing the peak memory usage across tar, gpg and gzip.</p>

<p>Bupstash is very memory-efficient compared to restic and borg, but ultimately loses out to the simplicity of tar + gzip + GPG.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-discussion">Conclusions and discussion</h2>
<p>GNU Tar + gzip + gpg is an excellent encrypted backup option and performed better than I expected. I think tar and gpg is still a great choice for users who prefer to DIY their own backup scripts. With this in mind, we must ask what are the problems with tar that the other tools address? My opinion is that managing
incremental backups, deduplication, pruning, and searching backups are far more difficult when using incremental tar compared to borg/restic/bupstash. With incremental tar, it quickly becomes quite hard to track which incremental
tarballs depend on eachother and you often need to periodically do full snapshots - losing most of the speed benefits.</p>
<p>As the biased author of bupstash, I am also pleased with how it has performed and hope I can push it further in the future. Restic, while fast at local operation, seems to trail the other tools when network latency is thrown into the mix. Borg is an all-around great tool and performed very well.</p>
<p>I can see both strengths and room for improvement in each of the tools tested, and encourage everyone to give them a try for yourself if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your time and see you next time :).</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The blog post <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride">“I want off Mr. Golang’s Wild Ride”</a> by Amos incited
me to write a comment on its <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25616593">HN</a> submission page. But as the comment ran 5
paragraphs long, I have turned it into this blog post.</p>

<p>It is a well written and in-depth look at the rot inside the Golang ecosystem.
Make sure to read to the end and notice that the rot started at the core
contributors level.</p>

<p>Golang’s tagline, from their <a href="https://github.com/golang/go">repository</a>, is “Go is an open source
programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient
software.”</p>

<p>Reading this post by Amos should make it clear to you that Golang has succeeded
ONLY in the “simple” part of the claim; unless written with extreme care,
programs written in Golang are neither reliable, nor efficient.</p>

<p>Amos presents some examples of why I have disliked Golang since the beginning.
After having used Golang for a few years seriously, I disliked it enough to
start a fork of the language named <a href="https://github.com/gurjeet/gofy/tree/gofy">GoFY</a>. I named the language as such
because, since the beginning when I saw some of initial presentations by Rob
Pike specifically, and some others’ presentations and blog posts generally, they
had an air of ego when dismissing others’ opinions and concerns, and appeared to
say “these are our decisions, that is how it is, and if you don’t like it, Go
F*** Yourself”. So the project name was a GoFY to them back, from me.</p>

<p>I’m sure it looks a great language from afar, and for newcomers. But as a
seasoned developer who has seen a few other languages in thier lifetime, you
will quickly begin to see the problems with the language and the ecosystem
around it.  The astute among you may notice that in my <a href="https://gurjeet.singh.im/blog/persistence-perseverance">post yesterday</a> I
did not claim to be an expert in Golang; it’s hard to be an expert in something
that’s fragile, flaky and full of special cases. For the same reason I
never took up using MySQL; I have heard enough stories of its flakiness and
special cases that it never looked like a solid technology to me. I openly and
whole-heartedly recommend learning and using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> to anyone who would
listen.</p>

<p>Fortunately I did not invest any more time in it other than to document a few
times in section <a href="https://github.com/gurjeet/gofy/tree/gofy#gofy-desired-differences">“GoFY Desired Differences”</a> as to what I would
like to see different in the GoFY language, which in turn would make it better
than Golang, at least for long-time systems developers like myself. I am glad I
didn’t burn any oil on it because creating a new language, even a fork, is
neither easy nor quick.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>In the modern nation state, courts ("justice") operate with the threat of violence. The exact way a dispute is settled varies (jury, single judge, etc.), but the "finality" of the resolution they provide is based on the fact that the state asserts the final say, and if you don't agree, it doesn't matter, because they have men with guns. Importantly, they don't just have <em>some</em> men with guns (that's something <em>you</em> might have, too), they have an overwhelming number of men and increasingly large guns depending on how much you don't want to accept their say.</p>
<p>If you are thinking "that's a stupidly over-simplified way of thinking about modern justice systems", then that's fine; a lot of what follows is precisely about the <em>finesse</em> around this simplified view of the world.</p>
<h3>The threat is stronger than its execution</h3>
<p>This aphorism comes from the world of chess (as far as I gather); it's somehow both obvious but also subtle at the same time.
Forgive the sidetrack, but it reminds me of the possible originator of this phrase, a controversial figure in the history of chess - Aron Nimzowitsch. One (apocryphal?) <a href="http://www.caissa.com/ext/bulletin/ms/tlda0000/fms1221935698008892000004-%22Why-must-I-lose-to-this-IDIOT-%22">story</a> of him features him pointing at his grandmaster opponent and loudly proclaiming "Why must I lose to this idiot?!". But to the matter in hand - Nimzowitsch wrote one of the most famous early-ish treatises on chess strategy called "My System".</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/aronsystem.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>in this book he popularised (amongst many other less controversial things) the idea of <strong>overprotection</strong> - so for example, you have a pawn on square e5, and he considered it good strategy to protect it with a knight on f3, a rook on e1 and a bishop on g3 etc. etc. Many players - indeed top grandmasters - today find this idea faintly ridiculous. What interests me is that when they deride the idea they essentially never give credence to the element of truth it surely contains, which is this: if N &gt; 1 pieces protect a key square, it means that <em>any</em> of them can move without losing protection of that square. In other words the <em>potential</em> for <em>any</em> piece to move is preserved (contrasted with a single protector, which is therefore bound and cannot move away from protection).</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/overprotection.png" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>The idea behind the phrase "the threat is stronger than its execution" - which sounds paradoxical at first - is similar. Potentiality is more difficult for the adversary to handle than actuality, mostly because the adversary may have to handle many potential actions, rather than the one that is actualised.</p>
<p>This can manifest psychologically - inducing <em>fear</em> in an enemy is often a very excellent strategy, rather than directly attacking them. But it's important to understand that it's not just mind games. It's a matter of economy, and a matter of abstraction. Just like in the development of quantitative disciplines (all the way from early mathematics to modern computer programming, and much modern science), the development of abstractions allows for economy, which maximally leverages resources, and even open up whole new dimensions that were previously inaccessible.</p>
<h3>The virtualization of violence</h3>
<p>This line of thinking naturally leads us to how violence as a concrete actualization of will tends to get abstracted away. This is seen across nature, <em>not</em> only in human societies. It's well understood how access to mating in social animals (various types of mammals) is "arbitrated" through combat, and importantly, the combat is rarely to-the-death. Even more strikingly, the "combat" is reduced to competition over attributes <em>which might allow for better success in combat</em>. The obvious example is the stag's antlers:</p>

<p>That's a lot of physical raw material, requiring a lot of nutrition, and with unclear direct utility (very inefficient!). These are only a quasi-abstraction from real horns designed to kill - they <em>can</em> kill other stags, but apparently it's very rare, but they have evolved to be very visually assessable by other stags, and their complex geometry allows for battles ("horns locked") which are more of an assessment of the ability to kill, than an attempt to do so. There are of course many further examples that are more obviously abstractions. Further, displays may not be of attributes designed to inflict violence, but attributes that display high levels of general fitness, which itself is an abstraction from "ability to gather a lot of resources". The peacock being the most famous visually striking example, albeit the exact mechanisms involved may not be a matter of settled science.</p>
<p>i<img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/peacock.jpg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>I will leave the biologists to extend this list further with more obscure examples...</p>
<p>A rather interesting summary of one perspective on these phenomena is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">the handicap principle</a> (which somehow I had not read before writing most of this document, and as you will understand from reading it, I now rather wish I had!).</p>
<p>Also, the two examples we've seen so far show how there are two sides to this phenomenon: show dominance by showing the <em>ability</em> to win a fight without fighting; show superior suitability by showing the <em>ability</em> to gather resources without actually gathering resources. They are clearly not <em>completely</em> distinct.</p>
<h3>The same in modern human society</h3>
<p>We can see both types of 'abstraction' very clearly even in modern society. The violence-competition is virtualized in sport, most obviously:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/gridiron.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>(It's probably not an accident that in many places, sportsmen are pretty much at the top of the mating hierarchy, at least to some females!). But lest we get <em>too</em> abstract, let's not forget that just generally, displays of violence <em>capability</em> are also a big part of human society, even at the nation-state level:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/militaryparadewithtanks.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>Once we start thinking about human behaviour this way, we can see it everywhere. Consider the engagement ring and ask yourself where this tradition might come from:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/engagementring.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>We are not so different from peacocks here ... and it's not of course "irrational" in any but the most inane sense. Look at the analogy between the peacock's display and the engagement ring more closely, both:</p>
<ul>
<li>are costly in resources to create</li>
<li>are visually appealing</li>
<li>are (visually) very distinct from the normal "stuff" in the environment</li>
<li>are very immediately and easily recognized <em>by any viewer, on their own</em></li>
<li>signal that the creator is part of a group (genetic, or cultural)</li>
</ul>
<p>Much less obvious I think is that the <em>permanence</em> of these displays is not central. Sometimes they are very delicate and fragile (think: flowers, think: sports displays with substantial risk of injury that would cause permanent inability to repeat them), and this is <em>almost</em> the point - to the receiver of the signal, what matters is that the signal was unambiguously difficult to create. What matters much less is the "substrate", i.e. what the signal is "made of". This is part of the insight in the "handicap principle":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>what matters is what you <em>couldn't</em> do, because you did this.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/smallbirdinjungle.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>Further, imagine yourself as a small bird in the jungle - to find mating partners in this <strong>extremely</strong> noisy environment, you are looking for a small signal - a patch of bright colour - in this high noise environment. You want the signal to be unambiguous - blue where everything is green, yellow, brown, red - and costly. You don't want to have to compare it to something else to check it's correct (is it the same color as something else on the other side of the jungle? sheesh!). You really don't care about semantics - you don't care what the signal "means", except specifically that it's in some sense pre-agreed (perhaps genetically? see the last bullet point); to an outsider the signal could be outlandish or ridiculous, and that doesn't matter.</p>
<h3>The court, the bank, and the abstraction of money</h3>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/bankofmontreal.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>You can see it in architecture; there is of course a very good reason why historically banks were built of extremely sturdy materials, at considerable cost. They were originally actually vaults for high concentrations of physical wealth, and had to protect well from direct frontal assault.</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/hongkong.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>Nowadays this is another abstraction of the type already mentioned; if an organization put <em>that</em> much money into building such an imposing building or flashy skyscraper, they're hardly likely to steal my pathetic little stash! Court buildings likewise represent an abstraction of the state's power, and so do government offices (this is particularly obvious in more authoritarian states like China, where the government buildings in smaller towns look almost absurd (this example is very typical, in Luxian):</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/luxian.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>The whole "virtualization" paradigm, taking concrete physical force and replacing it with "threats, stronger than executions" has entirely entered the realm of money too. Not to dip my toe into the various debates about the origin of money, I'll just talk about recent history: we moved from bearer instruments and certificates for bearer instruments, through to certificates representing pure "fiat" in the literal sense - fiat meaning the will of the governing power, essentially. So "fiat is backed by men with guns", the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWi8VUHUzk">Krugman</a> quote,</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/krugman.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>... is certainly right <em>in essence</em> even if you quibble over various details. In the same way that courts are "backed by men with guns".</p>
<p>But I think it's important to step back and consider what role money takes in a society - its purpose is always exactly abstraction. It solves the "double coincidence of wants" problem by creating an entirely new class of good that no one originally wanted (this is the counter intuitive about much mathematics - to solve a problem involving 2 or 3 things you add another thing, superficially making everything more complicated, but suddenly everything 'falls into place', creating a new structure with more symmetry. For example, if the general solution of polynomials is tortuous and even insoluble (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Galois</a>) for real numbers, by adding an apparent complexity: a new made-up solution to x^2=-1, you suddenly find that everything cleans itself up (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra">the fundamental theorem of algebra</a>). Money does something similar, because we replace an O(N^2) pricing problem with an O(N) problem - …</p></div></div>

  <p><i><time datetime="2020-12-30">Last edited: December 30, 2020</time></i></p>

  <p>
    By default, Android has a strong security model and incorporates <a href="https://source.android.com/security/selinux/">
    full system SELinux policies</a>, <a href="https://source.android.com/security/app-sandbox">strong app sandboxing</a>,
    <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot">full verified boot</a>, modern exploit mitigations like
    <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/cfi">fine-grained forward-edge Control-Flow Integrity</a> and
    <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/shadow-call-stack">ShadowCallStack</a>, widespread use of
    memory-safe languages (Java / Kotlin) and more. As such, this article explains common ways in which people worsen the
    security model rather than criticisms of the security model itself.
  </p>

  <h2 id="unlocking-the-bootloader"><a href="#unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    Unlocking the bootloader in Android is a large security risk. It disables <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">verified boot</a>, a fundamental part of the security
    model. Verified boot ensures the integrity of the base system and boot chain to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack">
    evil maid attacks</a> and malware persistence. </p><p>
    
    Contrary to common assumptions, verified boot is not just important for physical security — it prevents the persistence
    of <b>any</b> tampering with your system, be it from a physical attacker or a malicious application that has managed to
    hook itself into the operating system. For example, if a remote attacker has managed to exploit the system and gain high
    privileges, verified boot would revert their changes upon reboot and ensure that they cannot persist.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="rooting"><a href="#rooting">Rooting your device</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    Rooting your device allows an attacker to easily gain extremely high privileges. Android's architecture is built
    upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a>. By default,
    unrestricted root is found nowhere in the system due to the <a href="https://source.android.com/security/selinux">
    full system SELinux policy</a>. Even the init system does not have unrestricted root access. Exposing privileges far
    greater than any other part of the OS to the application layer is not a good idea. </p><p>
    
    It does not matter if you have to whitelist apps that have root. An attacker can fake user input by for example,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking">clickjacking</a> or they can exploit vulnerabilities in apps that
    you have granted root to. By rooting your device, you are breaking Android's security model and adding further layers
    of trust where it is inappropriate. </p><p>
    
    A common argument for rooting is that Linux allows root but this does not account for the fact that the average
    desktop Linux system does not have a security model like Android does. On the usual Linux system, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#root">gaining root is extremely easy</a>. This is why Linux hardening procedures often involve
    restricting access to the root account.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="custom-roms"><a href="#custom-roms">Custom ROMs</a></h2>

  <p>
    The majority of custom ROMs severely weaken the security model by disabling verified boot, using userdebug builds,
    disabling SELinux, and various other issues. Furthermore, you are also usually at the mercy of the maintainer to
    apply security updates properly. Certain ROMs often apply security patches late or sometimes not apply them at all,
    especially when it comes to firmware patches.
  </p>

  <h3 id="lineageos"><a href="#lineageos">LineageOS</a></h3>

  <p>
    A common ROM that has many of these issues is <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      LineageOS <a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/hudson/blob/master/lineage-build-targets">uses
      userdebug builds by default</a>. This <a href="https://source.android.com/setup/build/building#choose-a-target">
      adds many debugging features as additional attack surface</a>. It also weakens various SELinux polices and exposes
      root access via adb which <a href="#root">as discussed above</a>, is not a good idea.
    </li>

    <li>
      LineageOS requires an unlocked bootloader, therefore disabling verified boot which <a href="#unlocking-the-bootloader">
      is essential to verify the integrity of the operating system</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      It does not implement <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/verified-boot#rollback-protection">
      rollback protection</a>. This allows an attacker to downgrade the system to an older version and then exploit already
      patched vulnerabilities. The default updater even allows you to downgrade versions yourself.
    </li>

    <li>
      Most LineageOS builds also do not include firmware updates which prevents users from getting new patches to fix
      vulnerabilities. Instead, it gives a pop-up advising users to flash updates manually that most people will simply
      ignore.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is a non-exhaustive list. There are more issues than just those listed above. LineageOS (and most other custom
    ROMs) are focused on customizing the device and not privacy or security. Of course, you could build LineageOS yourself
    to fix many of these issues but most users will not be capable of doing so.
  </p>

  <h2 id="microg-signature-spoofing"><a href="#microg-signature-spoofing">MicroG / Signature Spoofing</a></h2>

  <div>
    <p><a href="https://microg.org/">MicroG</a> is a common alternative to Google Play Services. It is often used to get rid
    of Google's tracking but most people do not realise that this can potentially worsen security as it
    <a href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Signature-Spoofing">requires signature spoofing
    support</a> which allows apps to request to bypass signature verification. </p><p>
    
    Although, some signature spoofing implementations restrict it to make it less bad such as <a href="https://gitlab.com/calyxos/platform_frameworks_base/commit/dccce9d969f11c1739d19855ade9ccfbacf8ef76">CalyxOS'
    implementation</a> which allows only microG to spoof the Play Services signature and nothing else.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="firewalls"><a href="#firewalls">Firewalls</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    Firewalls such as <a href="https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/">AFWall+</a> or <a href="https://www.netguard.me/">
    Netguard</a> are regularly used on Android to attempt to block network access from a specific app but these
    do not reliably work — apps can use IPC to bypass the restrictions. If you cut off network access to an app, it
    will not prevent the app from sending an <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent">
    intent</a> to another app (such as the browser) to make it make the same connection. </p><p>
    
    Many apps already do this unintentionally whilst using APIs such as the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager">download manager</a>. </p><p>
    
    The most effective way to block network access is to revoke the <code>INTERNET</code> permission from the app
    like <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/5e2898e9d21dd6802bb0b0139e7e496c41e1cd80">
    GrapheneOS allows you to do</a>. This prevents abusing OS APIs to initiate network connections as they contain checks
    for that permission, one example of which is the aforementioned download manager. You should also run the app in its
    own user or work profile to ensure that it cannot abuse third party apps either.
  </p></div>

<p><em>by a literal banana</em></p>
<p>I have been trying to understand the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lexical hypothesis</a>” of personality, and its modern descendant, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five Factor Model of personality</a>, for <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/">several</a> <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/24/the-extended-sniff-test/">months</a>. In that time, I have said some provocative things about the Big Five, and even some unkind things that I admit were unbecoming to a banana. Here, I wish to situate the Five Factor Model in the context of its historical development and modern use, and to demonstrate to the reader the surprising accomplishment that it represents for the field of psychology.<span id="more-732"></span></p>
<p>In personality research, the “lexical hypothesis” refers to a hypothesis attributed to Francis Galton (1884). Galton supposed that each human language would reflect important realities of human character within that language and culture. In particular, he noted that the words used to evaluate character and personality are very numerous (he estimated over a thousand, using a thesaurus), and often overlap in meaning.</p>
<p>But Galton immediately left his thesaurus behind, readily admitting of the impossibility of <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/26/words-fail/">defining</a> any aspect of character. Rather, he turned to experimental means of testing the character in various ways, and insisted that <em>no particular map or model of personality is needed to start from</em>.</p>
<p>Nowhere in his essay does Galton propose surveys as a means for studying character. He would probably regard such methods as unscientific, as indicated in his final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>[C]haracter ought to be measured by carefully recorded acts, representative of the usual conduct. An ordinary generalisation is nothing more than a muddle of vague memories of inexact observations. It is an easy vice to generalise. We want lists of facts, every one of which may be separately verified, valued and revalued, and the whole accurately summed. It is the statistics of each man’s conduct in small every-day affairs, that will probably be found to give the simplest and most precise measure of his character.</p></blockquote>
<p>The methods that Galton proposed are exclusively non-linguistic. For instance, he commented that observing children involved in play quickly gives one an idea of each child’s emotional expression. Galton’s proposed methods prefigure both hidden camera prank shows and Goffman’s “breaching experiments:”</p>
<blockquote><p>I will not attempt to describe particular games of children or of others, nor to suggest experiments, more or less comic, that might be secretly made to elicit the manifestations we seek, as many such will occur to ingenious persons. They exist in abundance, and I feel sure that if two or three experimenters were to act zealously and judiciously together as secret accomplices, they would soon collect abundant statistics of conduct. They would gradually simplify their test conditions and extend their scope, learning to probe character more quickly and from more of its sides.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other methods Galton expressed enthusiasm for include heart rate measurement (he wore a home-brew heart-rate-measuring apparatus while he delivered the lecture that makes up the text) and methods discoverable from personal context (giving an example from Benjamin Franklin, of a man with one attractive and one deformed leg, who kept track of which leg his interlocutors paid attention to, as a gauge of their optimism or pessimism). Galton would be surprised, I think, to find that the most promising and scientific theory of personality in the twenty-first century is premised entirely on survey responses as its “facts.”</p>
<p>Early in the study of personality, there was a major shift of meaning in the lexical hypothesis. At first, the thesaurus and the word list were its tools of study (e.g., Allport &amp; Odbert, 1936); the idea was to find common factors of meaning in the words themselves. Of course, there is no particularly scientific way to decide how much the word “annoying” is the same as “obnoxious,” or how much either is the same as “low-status.” The major shift was to begin to measure the correlations of an entirely different construct: the correlations of the words <em>when used to describe a particular person</em>. That is, rather than trying to measure the underlying meaning of words, researchers began to measure the degree to which different words were applied to the same person. “Sameness” and “correlation” were no longer distinguishable concepts for the methods.</p>
<p>Initially, lists of adjectives, and eventually, short survey questions, were administered to subjects, who described either a person they knew or themselves. When the responses were subjected to factor analysis—a mathematical analysis to reveal the structure of correlations between responses—a varying number of factors emerged, depending on the methods and the researchers and the questions and the subjects, and these factors were given varying names. Since the early 1990s, the Five Factor Model has been dominant, although the names of the factors vary somewhat even today. The acronym OCEAN is used for the traits: Openness to experience (sometimes called “intellect” or “imagination” or “open-mindedness”), Conscientiousness, Extraversion (sometimes called “surgency”), Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes called “negative emotionality” or “emotional stability” reversed).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Today, the five traits are measured with various survey instruments, with five questions on the shortest version (one for each aspect) and sixty questions on a common long-form version (that used by Soto, 2019). Survey instruments are validated in a number of ways: how much their responses correlate between testings (test-retest reliability, with astrological sign as the gold standard), how much different raters agree using the criteria (inter-rater reliability), and a nebulous concept of construct validity, which sometimes includes scientific gestures designed to ensure that the instrument measures what it purports to measure. Many papers present elaborate numerical artifacts of validation, and I have found that some characterize the validity of their instruments as “good” without providing an indication of what would be “not good enough.” From a brief review of dozens of validated instruments in social psychology, it seems to me that it is relatively easy to “validate” meaningless instruments. As long as the mathematical bona fides are present, the construct need not be meaningful in other ways. (The reader who is rightly suspicious of my broad and unsourced claims may wish to search Google Scholar with variations of “scale,” “inventory,” and “survey instrument,” and examine the results critically. The naming of factors is often a particularly interesting step.)</p>
<p>The strong claim made by advocates of the Five Factor Model is that any set of questions describing a human being, administered to subjects and the responses subjected to factor analysis, will reveal the same five factors (paraphrasing Jordan Peterson in <a href="https://youtu.be/pCceO_D4AlY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a>, around 11:10-16:40). This strong claim, though dubious in a number of respects, is a major part of the basis for the scientific legitimacy of the Big Five. It is interesting to see which aspects of the strong claim are admitted to be false by advocates of the Big Five, and how much is excused on the grounds that <i>at least it’s something</i>. The Five Factor Model is not perfect, advocates grant, but it is better than nothing. It is not clear how they measure “better than nothing;” this is a potentially interesting hypothesis in need of precisification, perhaps.</p>
<p>The Big Five exist as a special, scientifically validated property of language and survey methods, and that is one basis for their legitimacy. The other basis for the legitimacy of the Five Factor Model is its <i>replicable correlation with consequential life outcomes</i>. We know that the Big Five are not merely phantoms that fall out of a certain analysis of a certain use of language in WEIRD college students, because these traits are reliably correlated with things we care about.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>One of the most interesting features of the Big Five is the nature of its scientific evidence. Observe what is held out as a “replication” of the theory, and you will discover the theory’s true nature. The most impressive aspect of the ongoing accomplishment of the Five Factor Model is the degree to which it <i>deflects curiosity </i>about its underlying meaning with <i>rituals of scientific validation</i>, regardless of the rituals’ appropriateness in context. Since “replication” is the scientific ritual most recently shown to detect poor science in psychology, being shown to reliably “replicate” is a huge boost to the credibility of a theory.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The interesting thing about the Five Factor Model is what it gets away with, in terms of being considered a theory, even though it is not causal, and makes no predictions. What counts as a “replication” of the Five Factor Model, as in Soto (2019), is the following: a correlation is found between one or more factors of the Five Factor Model and some other construct, and that correlation is found again in another sample, regardless of the size of the correlation. In almost all cases, and in 100% of Soto (2019)’s measures, the construct compared to a Big Five factor is derived from an online survey instrument.</p>
<p>What counts as a “consequential life outcome” is also fascinating. In most cases, the life outcome constructs are vague abstractions measured with survey instruments, much like the Big Five themselves. For instance, the life outcome “Inspiration” is measured with the Inspiration Scale, which asks the subject in four ways how often and how deeply inspired they are. Amazingly, this scale correlates a little bit with Extraversion and with Open-mindedness. Do these personality traits “predict” the life outcome of inspiration? Is “Inspiration” as instrumentalized here meaningfully different from the Big Five constructs, such that this correlation is meaningful?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Compare the items for the construct “Inspiration” with the items for Extraversion and Open-mindedness used in Soto (2019):</p>
<p><b>Inspiration Scale Items</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I experience inspiration.</li></ul></div></article></div>

<p>The <strong>real</strong> repository is located <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>The GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/unfrl/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a> is used for issues and stars <span aria-label="glowing star">🌟</span></p>
<p>A powerful global DNS progagation checker that can output in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>The goal of dug is to make it easy to check the propagation of DNS records. It is also capable of providing templated output that can be used in scripts for things like monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Until theres a wiki for this, the easiest way to explore dug is through the help.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dug help</code> -&gt; Get top level help explaining the different verbs</li>
<li><code>dug help run</code> or <code>dug run --help</code> -&gt; Get details about a specific verb (run, which is the default)</li>
<li><code>dug help update</code> or <code>dug update --help</code> -&gt; Get details about the update verb</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest way to get started is to just run a query against the domain whose DNS records you’re updating.
For example: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif1.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif1.gif" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You can also do complicated things like ask for specific record types, get the output as json, and pipe it into other applications: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com -q A --output-format JSON --output-template Ipaddress,city,value,responsetime | jq</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" alt=""></a></p>
<h2 id="user-content-installation">Installation</h2>
<h3 id="user-content-linux-deb-debian-ubuntu-mint-pop-os">Linux Deb (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!_os)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/releases" rel="nofollow">latest release</a> and download the .deb package.
<ul>
<li>It should look like <code>dug.&lt;version&gt;.linux-x64.deb</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On most distros double clicking the .deb package will allow you to install via a UI, alternatively it can be installed by running <code>sudo dpkg -i ./dug.&lt;version&gt;.linux-x64.deb</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="user-content-linux-rpm-rhel-centos-fedora">Linux RPM (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/releases" rel="nofollow">latest release</a> and download the .rpm package.

<ul>
<li>It should look like <code>dug-osx-x64</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should be able to download that, make is executable, and run it from the terminal. Then you can put it somewhere and update your path so you can execute it from anywhere.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="user-content-windows">Windows</h3>
<h4 id="user-content-chocolatey-choco-cli">Chocolatey (choco cli)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Waiting on chocolatey to approve my package, then I can publish there so this wont require a manual download. <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/releases" rel="nofollow">latest release</a> and download the .nupkg package.
<ul>

<h3 id="user-content-npm">NPM</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL! (Currently only supports linux-x64)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Run: <code>npm -g @unfrl/dug</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Idk why I wanted to publish it on npm as well, its really not a good way to distribute a binary...</p>
<h2 id="user-content-development">Development</h2>
<p>This is a .net 5 project, so as long as you have the dotnet cli, available <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0" rel="nofollow">here</a> you should be able to do the following: <code>dotnet build ./cli</code></p>
<p>The project was developed in VSCode so the debugger profiles that I have used are available if you’re also using VSCode.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-license">License</h2>
<p>The license used by dug, <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/src/branch/main/cli/LICENSE" rel="nofollow">here</a>, is very explicitly designed to try to keep capitalists from benefiting from this tool. This is not a traditional license but it is very simple, please read it.</p>
