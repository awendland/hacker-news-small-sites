<p>The importance of testing in modern software development is really hard to overstate. Delivering a successful product is not something you do once and forget about but is rather a continuous recurring process. With every line of code that changes, software must remain in a functional state, which implies the need for rigorous testing.</p>
<p>Over time, as the software industry evolved, testing practices have matured as well. Gradually moving towards automation, testing approaches have also influenced software design itself, spawning mantras like test-driven development, emphasizing patterns such as dependency inversion, and popularizing high-level architectures that are built around it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, automated testing is embedded so deeply within our perception of software development, it’s hard to imagine one without the other. And since that ultimately enables us to produce software quickly without sacrificing quality, it’s hard to argue that it’s not a good thing.</p>
<p>However, despite there being many different approaches, modern “best practices” primarily push developers specifically towards <em>unit testing</em>. Tests, whose scope lies higher on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid">Mike Cohn’s pyramid</a> are either written as part of a wider suite (often by completely different people) or even disregarded entirely.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is often supported by the argument that unit tests provide the most value during development because they’re able to catch errors quickly and help enforce design patterns that facilitate modularity. This idea has become so widely accepted that the term “unit testing” is now somewhat conflated with automated testing in general, losing part of its meaning and contributing to confusion.</p>
<p>When I was a less experienced developer, I believed in following these “best practices” to the letter, as I thought that would make my code better. I didn’t particularly enjoy writing unit tests because of all the ceremony involved with abstractions and mocking, but it was the recommended approach after all, so who am I to know better.</p>
<p>It was only later, as I’ve experimented more and built more projects, that I started to realize that there are much better ways to approach testing and that <strong>focusing on unit tests is</strong>, in most cases, <strong>a complete waste of time</strong>.</p>
<p>Aggressively popularized “best practices” often have a tendency of manifesting cargo cults around them, enticing developers to apply design patterns or use specific approaches without giving them a much needed second thought. In the context of automated testing, I find this prevalent when it comes to our industry’s unhealthy obsession with unit testing.</p>
<p>In this article I will share my observations about this testing technique and go over why I believe it to be inefficient. I’ll also explain which approaches I’m currently using instead to test my code, both in open source projects and day-to-day work.</p>
<p><em>Note: this article contains code examples which are written in C#, but the language itself is not (too) important to the points I’m making.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: I’ve come to realize that programming terms are completely useless at conveying meanings because everyone seems to understand them differently. In this article I will be relying on the “standard” definitions, where unit testing targets smallest separable parts of code, end-to-end testing targets software’s outermost entry points, while integration testing is for everything in-between.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 3: if you don’t feel like reading the entirety of the article, you can skip to the end for the summary.</em></p>
<h2>Fallacies of unit testing</h2>
<p>Unit tests, as evident by the name, revolve around the concept of a “unit”, which denotes a very small isolated part of a larger system. There is no formal definition of what a unit is or how small it should be, but it’s mostly accepted that it corresponds to an individual function of a module (or method of an object).</p>
<p>Normally, when the code isn’t written with unit tests in mind, it may be impossible to test some functions in complete isolation because they can have external dependencies. In order to <em>work around</em> this issue, we can apply the dependency inversion principle and replace concrete dependencies with abstractions. These abstractions can then be substituted with real or fake implementations, depending on whether the code is executing normally or as part of a test.</p>
<p>Besides that, unit tests are expected to be pure. For example, if a function contains code that writes data to the file system, that part needs to be abstracted away as well, otherwise the test that verifies such behavior will be considered an integration test instead, since its coverage extends to the unit’s integration with the file system.</p>
<p>Considering the factors mentioned above, we can reason that <strong>unit tests are only useful to verify pure business logic inside of a given function</strong>. Their scope does not extend to testing side-effects or other integrations because that belongs to the domain of integration testing.</p>
<p>To illustrate how these nuances affect design, let’s take a look at an example of a simple system that we want to test. Imagine we’re working on an application that calculates local sunrise and sunset times, which it does through the help of the following two classes:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDisposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HttpClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _httpClient<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDiposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> _locationProvider <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _locationProvider<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although the design above is perfectly valid in terms of OOP, neither of these classes are actually unit-testable. Because <code>LocationProvider</code> depends on its own instance of <code>HttpClient</code> and <code>SolarCalculator</code> in turn depends on <code>LocationProvider</code>, it’s impossible to isolate the business logic that may be contained within methods of these classes.</p>
<p>Let’s iterate on that code and replace concrete implementations with abstractions:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>HttpClient</span> httpClient<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _httpClient <span>=</span> httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span> _locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span><span>ILocationProvider</span> locationProvider<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _locationProvider <span>=</span> locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By doing so we were able to decouple <code>LocationProvider</code> from <code>SolarCalculator</code>, but in exchange our code nearly doubled in size. Also note that we had to drop <code>IDisposable</code> from both classes because they <strong>no longer own their dependencies</strong> and thus have no business taking responsibility for their lifecycle.</p>
<p>While these changes may seem as an improvement to some, it’s important to point out that the interfaces we’ve defined serve <strong>no practical purpose other than making unit testing possible</strong>. There’s no need for actual polymorphism in our design, so, as far as our code is concerned, these abstractions are <em>autotelic</em> (i.e. abstractions for the sake of abstractions).</p>
<p>Let’s try to reap the benefits of all that work and write a unit test for <code>SolarCalculator.GetSolarTimesAsync</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculatorTests</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>Fact</span><span>]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>Task</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync_ForKyiv_ReturnsCorrectSolarTimes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        <span>var</span> location <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Location</span><span>(</span><span>50.45</span><span>,</span> <span>30.52</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>var</span> date <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>DateTimeOffset</span><span>(</span><span>2019</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>04</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> TimeSpan<span>.</span><span>FromHours</span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> expectedSolarTimes <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarTimes</span><span>(</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>06</span><span>,</span> <span>55</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>29</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> locationProvider <span>=</span> Mock<span>.</span><span><span>Of</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ILocationProvider</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span>lp <span>=&gt;</span>
            lp<span>.</span><span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> Task<span>.</span><span>FromResult</span><span>(</span>location<span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> solarCalculator <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span>locationProvider<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        <span>var</span> solarTimes <span>=</span> <span>await</span> solarCalculator<span>.</span><span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        solarTimes<span>.</span><span>Should</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>BeEquivalentTo</span><span>(</span>expectedSolarTimes<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we have a basic test that verifies that <code>SolarCalculator</code> works correctly for a known location. Since unit tests and their units are tightly coupled, we’re following the recommended naming convention, where the test class is named after the class under test, and the name of the test method follows the <code>Method_Precondition_Result</code> pattern.</p>
<p>In order to simulate the desired precondition in the arrange phase, we have to inject corresponding behavior into the unit’s dependency, <code>ILocationProvider</code>. In this case we do that by substituting the return value of <code>GetLocationAsync()</code> with a location for which the correct solar times are already known ahead of time.</p>
<p>Note that although <code>ILocationProvider</code> exposes two different methods, from the contract perspective <strong>we have no way of knowing which one actually gets called</strong>. This means that by choosing to mock a specific one of these methods, we are making an <strong>assumption about the underlying implementation</strong> of the method we’re testing (which was deliberately hidden in the previous snippets).</p>
<p>All in all, the test does correctly verify that the business logic inside <code>GetSolarTimesAsync</code> works as expected. However, let’s expand on some of the observations we’ve made in the process.</p>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/motherboard-and-hands-320.jpg" alt="Motherboard and Hands" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->I think Covid-19 has re-emphasized the value of self-reliance
      to many of us.  During this pandemic, we have been through
      periods when we couldn't simply pick up a phone and call someone 
      to come to our home to make repairs.  We may also have been 
      unable to go to a local shop to get help.  Since so much of our 
      personal business must now be conducted on line, finding inexpensive 
      computers and making basic repairs to our own computers 
      are becoming important life skills.  Without them, we may be unable 
      to stay connected to the world, to attend school, to work, or even to 
      buy food without risking exposure to a potentially deadly disease.</p>

   <p>Fortunately, repairing a computer or buying a cheap used one is not as 
      difficult as many people seem to believe.  All that is needed is the 
      will to learn to do these things in a hands-on way.  Individuals must 
      be willing to take the risks associated with trying to repair 
      their own computers or buying used computers on line.  For most people, 
      I think this is the stumbling block that they never overcome.  
      What separates the people who can do these things from those who 
      cannot is not intelligence.  It is nothing more than need and 
      interest sufficient to get them past the stumbling block.  
      If you are willing to learn, you will win the battle for 
      computer self-reliance.  I will not tell you that you will not be 
      frustrated at times.  I will only say that, if you keep trying, you 
      will learn these skills.</p>

   <p>In this article, I will outline the knowledge and skills that are 
      necessary to solve most basic computer repair problems.  But first, I 
      will explain one simple step that you can take right now to have a 
      working computer in your home at all times.</p>

   <p>Have a working backup computer in your home to use in the event of 
      the death or loss of your primary 
      computer.  A backup computer need not be expensive.  In fact, you can 
      buy a useful, used computer on Ebay for around $50.  The role of this 
      computer is only to get you on line to do research or to buy parts or 
      other necessities until you can get your primary computer working 
      again, or until you can buy another computer.  A rather 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/surf-internet.html">old computer</a> is capable of meeting 
      these needs.  Some of you may want to use a cellphone for this, and 
      that will work if your cellphone service includes a data plan.  However, 
      for reasons that will become clear later, a fully-functioning computer 
      would be better.  I have written several articles on 
      cheapskatesguide.org that explain how to buy a cheap computer on 
      line.  For suggestions about multiple approaches to getting a cheap 
      laptop, read <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/how-to-get-a-cheap-laptop.html">this 
      article</a>.  For recommendations regarding the best used laptops to 
      buy for less than $100 in the year 2020, read 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/best-laptops-in-2020.html">this</a>.  To obtain a more 
      in-depth understanding of the art of buying a computer that meets your
      needs, go to the <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/helper/core-page.html">Core 
      Articles</a> page and read the articles there in chronological order.</p>

   <p>Now, let me talk about what you need to know to make basic computer 
      repairs.  If you take good care of your computer, the only computer 
      repair that you are likely to need that is not basic is the 
      replacement of your motherboard.  So, if your computer is completely 
      dead or stops booting at the BIOS screen (both symptoms of a bad 
      motherboard), it is most likely time to buy another computer.  If any 
      life at all remains in your computer--if you hear beep codes (beeping 
      sounds when you turn on your computer), see a repeating 
      pattern of flashing 
      lights, or see an error message on the monitor--you may be looking at 
      a computer that you can repair with basic skills.  Below, are the 
      skills that everyone can learn and then use to make basic computer 
      repairs.  Everyone should be able to:</p>
   <br>

   <div>
   <center><h2>Basic Computer Repair Skills Everyone should have</h2></center>
   <ul>
      <li>Diagnose basic computer problems</li>
      <li>Identify compatible parts for a computer</li>
      <li>Research repair methods on line</li>
      <li>Make basic changes to a computer's BIOS settings</li>
      <li>Create a bootable Linux USB drive</li>
      <li>Re-install software</li>
      <li>Replace a hard drive or solid state drive</li>
   </ul>
   </div>
   <p>When you think about it, that is a rather short list.  I think that a
      simple lack 
      of desire is the only thing that prevents most people from obtaining 
      these skills.  In this article, I will not teach you these skills.  I 
      will tell you what you need to know and a little about how to find 
      that knowledge.  I will tell you how to develop the skills.  And, in 
      some cases, I will outline basic repair procedures and tell you how 
      to fill in the details yourself.</p>
   <h2>Diagnosing Basic Computer Problems</h2>
   <p>Most symptoms of computer problems are pretty obvious.  Your keyboard 
      stops working.  A USB connector stops working.  Your computer's monitor 
      doesn't light up.  A message appears on your monitor saying that no 
      operating system was found.  Your computer's sound stops working.  
      The question is not whether a problem exists but whether it is 
      a software problem or a hardware problem.</p><p>The easiest way to rule out a hardware problem is to boot your 
      computer from a reliable, bootable Linux USB flash drive.  If the 
      problem does not go away, then you most likely have a hardware 
      problem.  One obvious exception is that the problem will go away if 
      your hard drive is bad.  I recommend creating a bootable Linux Mint 
      USB flash drive, making sure it works with every piece of hardware on 
      your computer, and setting it aside for when you need it.  Another
      benefit of having a Linux USB flash drive is that if your hard
      drive dies, you will still be able to use your computer to get online.</p>

   <p>If the problem is caused by software, an online search will give you 
      possible sources and procedures to follow to narrow down the problem 
      to one source.  If an error message appears, use an online search 
      engine to search for that exact error message with quotes around it.  
      If you have no error message, you may have more difficulty finding 
      information about the exact source of your problem.  This process can 
      sometimes take several hours, but you are likely to eventually find 
      hints that will lead you to solutions for most computer software 
      problems, especially if the software is common.</p><h2>Identifying Compatible Parts for Your Computer</h2>
   <p>On a modern laptop computer, the battery and hard drive are the only 
      parts that are likely to fail that you can replace with basic 
      skills.  In over 30 years of owning computers, I have never had a 
      single stick of RAM fail.  I have had RAM sticks that have become 
      unseated from their connectors and needed to be pushed back into 
      place.  Beep codes or flashing lights can give you a hint that RAM 
      has become unseated.  Search on line for "computer beep codes" to find 
      the specific beep codes for your computer.</p> 

   <p>You generally only need to know three things to locate a 
      hard drive or Solid State Drive (SSD) that is compatible with your 
      computer: the hard drive's width, its thickness, and the type of 
      connector to which it connects.  You need to buy a replacement hard 
      drive that will physically fit into the space in your computer, and  
      the connector of the hard drive must connect to the connector on your 
      computer's motherboard.  These days, all spinning hard drives are 
      either 2.5 or 3.5 inches wide with SATA connectors.  Most 
      regular-sized desktop computers have 3.5 inch hard drives, but a 
      laptop will never have a 3.5 inch hard drive.  Laptops have either 2.5 
      inch spinning hard drives or some kind of SSD.  If your computer has 
      an SSD, you will have to open up your computer and look at the SSD's
      connector.  Unfortunately, these days, there are a small number of 
      solid state drive connector types that have the same physical 
      connections but are different electrically.  In my opinion, this was 
      a very poor design decision.  Luckily, these SSD's are the only 
      example in the computer industry of which I am aware of this being 
      allowed to occur.  Find a picture of your SSD's connector online and see 
      what type of connector the online source says it is.  Wikipedia is 
      a good place to look for this type of information.  Once you have 
      identified the type of connector on your SSD, see what Wikipedia says 
      about its electrical arrangement.  Do not try to use an SSD with a 
      different type of electrical arrangement, because this is likely to 
      damage the replacement SSD and your computer.</p>
   <h2>Researching Computer Repair Methods on Line</h2>
   <p>When your computer develops a problem, you can almost always find a 
      procedure on line for solving it.  First, you need to know <i>what</i> to 
      do to repair a generic computer with the specific problem you are 
      seeing.  You can read on line about <i>what</i> to do to repair the 
      problem on a generic Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.  Then, if the 
      problem is a hardware problem, you need to know <i>how</i> to 
      physically accomplish the repair of your specific model of computer.  
      A Youtube video can be beneficial for this.  An example of 
      what I mean by "<i>how</i> to physically repair" is the following.  When 
      you open the back of your laptop, what screws do you have to unscrew 
      to release the hard drive?  Do you pull the hard drive straight out 
      perpendicularly from the back of the laptop?  Or, do you slide it 
      parallel to the back of the laptop …</p></div></div>

                 <p>Cinema Saturdays: Independence Day</p>
<p>Today's July 4th, and around this house that means we re-watch the movie "Independence Day" I'm not sure why we do this. It's not that great of a movie, although it was good enough to watch a couple of times. I think it's the rousing speech by the President at the end of the movie, played by Bill Pullman.</p>
<p>As a hacker (I mean that in a good sense), Independence Day was great. Who knew? When the aliens show up, we can hack into their computer system! I sure hope those guys aren't using something outdated, like CICS or VAX/VMS. I'm not up to speed on my Big Endian assembly skills.</p>
<p>So let's quickly review our success with fictional aliens.</p>
<p>H.G. Wells in War Of The Worlds  had tripods that showed up and zapped everything, only to be killed by bugs, microbes. Flash forward to The Day The Earth Stood Still, and our neighbors get pissed and send Klaatu to tell us to stop being such assholes. We generally agree, so he leaves,  but only after making...</p>            </div>

</table>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Each feed is <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhnrss.org%2Fnewest">valid RSS</a> served over <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=hnrss.org">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<h3 id="firehose-feeds">Firehose Feeds</h3>
<p>The “firehose” feeds contain all new posts and comments as they appear on Hacker News:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest
https://hnrss.org/newcomments
</pre>
<p>For just the posts that have appeared on the front page:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/frontpage
</pre>
<p>If the firehose feeds are a bit too noisy for you, <a href="#activity-parameters">read below</a> on filtering them with the <code>points</code> and/or <code>comments</code> parameters.</p>
<h3 id="search-feeds">Search Feeds</h3>
<p>You can get a feed of new posts and/or comments containing keywords by using the <code>q=KEYWORD</code> parameter. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?q=Django
https://hnrss.org/newcomments?q=WordPress
</pre>
<p>If you want a single search feed but multiple keywords, separate the keywords with " OR ":</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?q=git+OR+linux
</pre>
<h3 id="reply-feeds">Reply Feeds <sup>new</sup></h3>
<p>Keep an eye on replies to your comments:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/replies?id=jerf
</pre>
<p>Use a comment ID to follow replies to a particular comment:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/replies?id=17752464
</pre>
<h3 id="self-post-feeds">Self Post Feeds</h3>
<p>Ask HN, Show HN, and polls are available:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/ask
https://hnrss.org/show
https://hnrss.org/polls
</pre>
<h3 id="job-feeds">Job Feeds</h3>
<p>Job opportunities from YC funded startups:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/jobs
</pre>
<p>Top level comments in threads created by the whoishiring bot:</p>
<pre># Comments from "Who is hiring?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs

# Comments from "Who wants to be hired?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/hired

# Comments from "Freelancer? Seeking freelancer?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/freelance

# All of the above
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring
</pre>
<p><span>new</span> If you’re interested in something in particular, you can apply a <code>q=KEYWORD</code> parameter to only return relevant comments. For example, filter the top-level “Who is hiring?” comments to only those containing “React Native”:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs?q=React+Native
</pre>
<h3 id="user-feeds">User Feeds</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to miss a post or comment by a given user, you can subscribe to that user’s feed:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/submitted?id=USERNAME # posts
https://hnrss.org/threads?id=USERNAME   # comments
https://hnrss.org/user?id=USERNAME      # everything
</pre>
<h3 id="thread-feeds">Thread Feeds</h3>
<p>A feed of new comments on a particular post can be found at:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/item?id=THREAD_ID
</pre>
<p>With <code>THREAD_ID</code> the numerical ID found in the URL when viewing the comments page.</p>
<h3 id="feed-options">Feed Options</h3>
<p>You can modify any feed’s output using URL parameters. Multiple parameters can be applied at the same time by joining them with an ampersand.</p>
<h4 id="activity-parameters">Activity Parameters</h4>
<p>You can apply a <code>points=N</code> or <code>comments=N</code> parameter to any feed to filter the results so only entries with more than N points or comments are shown:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?points=100
https://hnrss.org/ask?comments=25
</pre>
<p>You can also combine both parameters:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/show?points=100&amp;comments=25
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>/newcomments</code> <a href="https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/issues/55#issuecomment-73599729">does not work</a> with a <code>points=N</code> parameter.</p>
<h4 id="search-parameter">Search Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, searches on posts only look at titles. If you want to search against the submitted URLs themselves, use the <code>search_attrs</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre># Search for posts with "WordPress" in the title only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the URL only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=url

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the title or URL
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=title,url

# Don't restrict search attributes at all. This searches for posts
# containing 'WordPress' in all attributes indexed by Algolia. This was
# the behavior of searches prior to June 3, 2015
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=default
</pre>
<h4 id="link-parameter">Link Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, the RSS <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element points to the submitted article’s URL. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element can be changed to point to the Hacker News comment page by appending <code>link=comments</code> to the end of the URL. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?link=comments</pre>
<h4 id="description-parameter">Description Parameter</h4>
<p>You can disable the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> element entirely by passing the <code>description=0</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?description=0</pre>
<h4 id="count-parameter">Count Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, feeds return 20 RSS items. This can be increased via the <code>count=N</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?count=50</pre>
<p>There is a hardcoded limit of 100 entries, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h4 id="feed-formats">Feed Formats <sup>new</sup></h4>
<p>By default, feeds come back as RSS. But if you add “.atom” or “.jsonfeed” to any endpoint you’ll receive the contents in <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">Atom</a> or <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>, respectively.</p>
<pre># The front page as Atom
https://hnrss.org/frontpage.atom

# "Ask HN" with 10 or more comments as JSON Feed
https://hnrss.org/ask.jsonfeed?comments=10
</pre>
<p>Note: These formats are a lot less battle-tested than the RSS format. If you see any wonkiness or they don’t play nicely with your feed reader, please <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss/issues/new">open an issue</a> with as much information as possible. Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
<p>hnrss.org is served by nginx on DigitalOcean. HTTPS is provided by Let’s Encrypt. DNS is provided by Namecheap.</p>
<p>As of September 2018, the feeds are generated using the <a href="https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/">Gin</a> web framework. From May 2014 to August 2018, the feeds were generated using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework.</p>
<h2 id="repositories">Repositories</h2>
<p>A brief primer on the various repositories that make up hnrss.org:</p>
<p>When hnrss.org was created in May 2014, code and documentation lived inside the <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> repository.</p>
<p>In April 2017, the documentation was revamped, migrated into Hugo, and was given its own repository at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The built assets were copied into the <code>docs/</code> folder on <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> and published at <a href="https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/">https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/</a>.</p>
<p>In August/September 2018, hnrss.org underwent a rewrite from Flask to Gin. This new code lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p>So, as of September 2018, that’s the state of play. The documentation source lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The Gin source that powers hnrss.org lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> contains the Flask code that powered the site from May 2014 to August 2018 as well as the <code>docs/</code> folder that contains the built HTML copied from <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>.</p>
<p>At some point I’d like to simplify all of this and run everything out of one repository, but it’ll do for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>February 2015</h3><p>I was working for a startup based in Jerusalem called Curiyo. Back then I had a nice routine: I wake up around 6 am, go to the gym with my buddy, come back to my room to take a shower, eat a bowl of salad and then leave for work. I get to work around 9 am, leave around 5 to meet friends, hang out, or do whatever activity I was planning for that evening.</p><p>In September of the same year, I went on my first trip abroad. I went with my best friend from high school on a 2-week trip to Italy. And as they say, I caught the travel bug. After that trip, all I could think about was planning the next ones and when I could fly again. And since then, I started traveling literally every month.</p><p>One day, I found a blog post about digital nomads and remote work. "This is it, this is what I want!", I said to myself, and the race began to figure out how I could make that happen. A couple of months later, I landed my first remote job with Toptal and signed up for a 3-month trip around southeast Asia (SEA). And in September 2016 -a year after my first trip- I was in Thailand working remotely, enjoying the beach, drinking fresh coconut water, and calling myself a digital nomad.</p><p>"Work hard, play harder": that is the digital nomad slogan. Each day’s schedule looked different from the day before, depending on what I felt like doing or what the group I’m with is planning. In other words, it’s impossible to have a fixed routine, you have to be flexible and dynamic. Otherwise, you will either have to choose between FOMO or doing a shitty job at your work so you don’t miss whatever fun others are having.</p><h3>February 2017</h3><p>After my 3-month trip to SEA, it was time to go back to Jerusalem to see my family and plan the next move. I wasn’t excited to go back, I grew up in Jerusalem and till that point, it’s where I spent all my life. It was so hard and boring after what I’ve experienced, I just came back after spending 3 months in heaven.</p><p>Suddenly there were no more beaches, no more parties, or random strangers to hang out with. There was a lot of free time thatI had no idea what to do with. All I was doing every day was leaving my parents’ house, go to the university campus where I spent five years getting my computer engineering degree, and work till it’s so hard to keep my eyes open.</p><p>I filled all the free time I had with work. I created an outsource web development company with a friend and worked 14h a day 7 days a week, I became a workaholic. I was hoping that by creating a successful business I will have the means to escape my city and move elsewhere to go back to the heavenly life I had for a short period.</p><p>After 3 months of long days and restless nights mishmash, I realized that wasn’t what I wanted. Of course, I still wanted to build my own business, but I didn’t like the path I was taking. And one day I found myself writing this:</p><p>I woke up late, as usual, tried to open my exhausted eyelids. I had skipped the usual question “What’s the plan for today?” and left my bed. It has been almost 3 months since the last time I answered that question, after the first week of going back to Jerusalem it was the same day repeating itself over and over again. Wake up, go to the university campus, meet the same people, and work for 12-14 hours.</p><p>Everything was the same that day except one thing, one thought. When suddenly I found myself shouting out loud to myself “Oh shit, I’m not happy, FUCK!” after a voice inside my head asked: “Are you happy?”. The answer was obviously no. I just realized I was on auto-pilot and forgot to ask myself such a trivial question. “If you are not happy, what is the point?” I kept asking myself for the rest of the day.</p><p>Work was just my way to escape reality and fill my free time. All that made me wonder: do I have to bury myself in work and live miserably now so that my future self can be happy?&nbsp;</p><p>Probably many of you will say “yes”, or maybe you will hesitate a bit before saying “no”. But that doesn’t change the fact that it is actually what we all do somehow. All of us work hard today hoping that tomorrow, next week, next month, or a year from now we will be happy, satisfied, and fulfilled.</p><p>This led me to another question that has changed everything: <strong>what is the point of chasing big dreams and goals if I'm not enjoying the way to get there?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I didn’t have a clear answer to this question so, in a way or another, my answer was <strong>procrastination</strong>. On one side, I wanted to build a business and create great things. On the other side, I didn’t want to work (hard) on anything as long as I don’t know how to be happy while doing it!</p><h3>June 2017</h3><p>After several months and hustling paperwork, I moved to Germany, and my digital nomad life was on again. Since then, I’ve spent the last 3+ years, traveling around the world, exploring, having fun, and creating memories. I was living the dream that many people dream of. A was living a life with no routine whatsoever, wake up whenever I want, work whenever I want, and tomorrow is always an unplanned adventure.</p><p>You can say everything was perfect, but still, the old dream was bugging me, I want to build and create a successful business, my own business. I never liked the idea of working for someone and trading my time for money. And between fun and procrastination, I was trying to build stuff and bootstrap ideas, but things were always falling between the cracks. With a lifestyle like that, it’s really hard to say no to the sunny beach outside and go work 10 hours on a side project. So as a result, procrastination became my new lifestyle.</p><h3>March 2020</h3><p>I left Mexico for a 2-week trip to San Francisco, I had a lot of traveling planned for this year. Things would have stayed on the same path as before for at least another couple of years if it wasn’t for COVID-19.<br></p><p>Two weeks into the pandemic, I found myself without work and without anything else to do. No travel, no friends around, nothing. This time, I didn’t only have a lot of free time, but all my time became free time. History got a chance to repeat itself, and I had a decision to make. Do I want to re-live 2017 all over again? Do I want to keep myself busy with side projects and endless work?&nbsp;<br></p><p>The feeling from 3 years ago was still fresh in my memory that I didn’t want to fall into that trap again. That was an opportunity I had to take advantage of. I was living alone with no distraction of any kind, It was a chance to rediscover myself and what I really want.</p><p>My goal was to bootstrap a business while having a work life balance. I didn’t want to spend 14 hours on my laptop and feel like it was sucking the life out of me. I believed it was possible to bootstrap without falling into the workaholism swamp.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0eb03257a01af20a5e4_iZLNJNTTrlnhbqu6GYvnavIObyReSuyqU1-_DJxGfOeSpFmF8hzwy3AryXXXt0pxgt7dn0EkcqU2AAEDMG8i5AS7HAfEUP0GlsyIOdpqtN07TOSJopLFwNzxQ3HwUjMJw5YSN36s.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Earlier this year I was somewhere on the bottom left side. To shift toward the right I had to deal with my procrastination problem. Since nothing I’ve tried before worked for me, I decided to learn everything I can about the subject and challenge myself to write a book about it, this book! I’m trying to prove to myself (and others) that it’s possible to live in the middle, a place where you can be productive and happy.</p><p><strong>“A bird in the hand is worth t̶w̶o̶ ten in the bush”</strong></p><p>My best friend, who is running an online business with ~$300k ARR, is on the opposite side of the curve. He is the most dedicated hard working person I know, but he’s not happy. When I asked him about it, he said he doesn’t believe it’s possible to have that balance. For him, you can’t be productive (grow fast enough) and happy at the same time. His goal is to have a big stable business by age 40 so he can relax and enjoy life then.</p><p>I don’t want that, I don't want to build a business if my happiness is the price. I don't want to live on 30% happiness for the promise that my future self will be 100% in five or ten years. It's not only that 100% happiness is not realistic, but I also believe my future self will still be stuck on the same hamster wheel convincing himself that he needs another 5 years to get to the imaginary perfect happiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0edf9a94c0bc0e6cd9f_Ngrb7PW6OqzpCoN3VZ8zAT8vHN_BKz_ZRkF_1Ze-89S6gTlwS6qyz89AWZIy-r5M6aleCzSf5xq-qp0OG1qkgdq14HcQdSlY1F6TkBny8CtjNETh2sdP4f0dgcuKCAnqFIVf3wiu.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Workaholism will blind you, you no longer see the big picture, you have no time to think and re-think, and you work for the sake of the work itself. And without a proper system and regular stops where you pause to double-check where you are heading, the wheel will just spin faster and faster until it eventually spits you out and throws you against the wall.</p><p>I know, sometimes you have something you are so excited about and it doesn’t feel like work. But pure excitement doesn’t last forever. Eventually, you will have to work on other boring and less exciting parts of your project. And once that initial excitement fades away, you either quit or close your eyes and hit the gas pedal to become a workaholic zombie.</p><p>However, life is not easy and you can’t always accomplish things while relaxing and taking it easy. Sometimes you have no other option but to push so hard, for days, weeks, or even months. The problem starts when you have no idea when you are going to lift your foot off the gas pedal to look around and see where you are going and check if you should make a turn and change directions.</p><p>So let’s glue all pieces together. A Procrastinator has this <strong>Instant Gratification Monkey (1)</strong> who wants immediate rewards, to have fun, and enjoy the moment without giving a shit about the future. A workaholic has a <strong>Panic Monster (2)</strong> who wants to work so hard and sacrifice everything today so you can be happy tomorrow.</p><p>The answer to the question: “How do you chase big dreams and without depriving yourself happiness?” is the same answer to the question: “Where could your instant gratification monkey meet your panic monster?” You need both.The monkey is as important as the monster, we’ll see that in the chapter “The Productive Procrastinator”. While in other chapters, we try to find that meeting point, as the sole purpose of this book is not to help you just be a productive person but a <strong>happy</strong> productive person.</p><p>1,2:&nbsp;originally presented in Tim Urban's <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html">blog post</a></p><p>‍<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5ef900053c15adf3558a9fb8_1*Bx1xIfh3q-_hY0LzmbLePg.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>📕 This chapter is …</p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Once you start working with international clients you'll run into many issues you will never experience when contracting for clients in the same country.</p><p>Language barriers, time zone differences or different cultures which could lead to different styles of communicating or different expectations to name just a few. </p><p>But the biggest one might be accepting payments. Cross-border payments are usually costly (both in fees and unfavorable exchange rates), take a long time to be processed and are sometimes even just hard to make as it's not a very common use case for most business owners. There's also different laws, taxes and payment methods.</p><p>The pandemic has made remote work a lot more common and many freelancers now have to deal with this new set of problems.</p><p>I have been working remotely since 2016 and worked for clients all over the world, used dozens of payment methods and dealt with both major and smaller currencies and want to share what I've learned over this period in terms of accepting payments.</p><p>Before we start, it's important to know there's no single best option as each situation is different. Payment frequency, invoice size, where each party is incorporated and many other variables might play a role in which payment method is best for your situation.</p><p>That being said, in every situation we want the same things. Make it easy for the client to pay you, make it easy for yourself to receive the money and do both of these in a timely and inexpensive way.</p><h2 id="international-bank-transfers">International Bank Transfers</h2><p>By far the most common payment method for domestic payments is to use a wire transfer. This works well for domestic payments but is very expensive and slow for cross-border payments.</p><p>Most banks charge a flat fee for processing international transfers but will also convert the money from the client's currency to yours at an exchange rate that is more expensive for you than the actual current exchange rate. My post about <a href="https://blog.jurn.io/international-payments-freelancers/">international transfers</a> explains the hidden costs of these payments more in-depth.</p><p>So before you ask your clients to transfer the money to your account, check with your bank what fees and exchange rates they use for the transfer. Some banks also give you the option to open a foreign currency account, if you regularly take payments in the same currency this could save you a lot in currency exchange fees.</p><h3 id="transferwise">TransferWise</h3><p>One of the best alternatives I found is to use <a href="https://transferwise.com/invite/u/joernv2">TransferWise</a>. TransferWise allows you to hold and accept multiple currencies and have local bank details in many different countries. You can then transfer the money you received at the mid-market exchange rate into your own currency and pay it out to your own bank account with low fixed fees.</p><p>Your client can thus transfer the payment to a local bank account like they would normally do for domestic payments. You can exchange this at a much better rate than banks would offer you and withdraw it to your own bank account for a low and transparent fixed fee.</p><p>This method offers the advantages of bank transfers without the downsides and has in my experience been both the cheapest and best way to accept payments for most situations.</p><p>If you are your client are in a country that is not supported by TransferWise you can also use <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/">Payoneer</a> which works in a very similar way and supports more countries around the world, albeit with higher fees than TW offers.</p><h2 id="credit-cards">Credit Cards</h2><p>Another very common payment method and one that is incredibly easy to pay with for your clients, credit cards.</p><p>Using online payment processors like Stripe, you can easily create an invoice along with a payment link where you client can pay using their credit card. The fees are pretty high, 3.4%+$0.50 per successful card charge and an additional 2% fee is applied if currency conversion is required so you have to be willing to accept high fees for speed and convenience.</p><p>Accepting credit cards is usually only worth it if you sent lots of small invoices and want a convenient way for you clients to pay these. </p><h2 id="paypal">PayPal</h2><p>PayPal was one of the pioneers in the payments industry but I'd strongly recommend using another option whenever possible. </p><p>Accepting payments via PayPal is easy. You can quickly generate a payment link for the client to sent with your invoice and you can easily create a PayPal account, no matter what country you are located in.</p><p>Unfortunately, their fees are very high (both the fixed fees and the currency conversion cost) and they are known for arbitrarily holding funds without good reason. Which they are allowed to do under their own ToC for up to 6 months(!).</p><p>If some of the better payment methods aren't available to you, PayPal might be the best option you have available but for most people it's probably better to steer clear of them. Even banks usually offer a better exchange rate than PayPal does.</p><h2 id="checks">Checks</h2><p>Most people outside of the US probably have never used a check to receive or make a payment so this could be quite a shock when your US client offers you to pay you using one.</p><p>My advice is to avoid these at all costs and talk to your client about setting up an alternative payment method. </p><p>Most non-US banks do not even have the option to cash these out and if they do it's very expensive. Checks, especially international ones, take a long time to arrive after they are mailed to you, they might get lost in the mail or sent to the wrong address, you (likely) need to mail these to your bank once you receive the check to cash it out and you still have to pay the unfavorable exchange rate.</p><p>In my personal experience, it will take around 4-6 weeks in total before the money from the client arrives in your account and you'll pay a very high fee for it.</p><p>Luckily these are becoming less common and I've head the good fortune of not having to deal with one of these for 2 years already.</p><h2 id="escrow">Escrow</h2><p>Escrow transfers are usually only worth it for selling big-ticket items where you need to transfer digital assets such as a domain. The fees are very high but it removes a lot of the risk when you work with a client that you haven't built up any trust with. </p><p>You should view Escrow as taking out an insurance, you accept a higher fee for less risk.</p><h2 id="cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</h2><p>Last time I wrote an article about cross-border payments <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22854120">some people commented</a> that crypto was the obvious solution here as there is no currency conversion and the transfer fees are very low. </p><p>I'd figure it's best to address this head-on this time; Although I love the concept of cryptocurrency, it's just not practical to use it for most freelancers. </p><p>Unless you work for a very high-tech startup, it's extremely unlikely someone in the company knows how to use one of these cryptocurrencies or will get permission to buy crypto and transfer it.</p><p>They are also extremely volatile, even though the transfer fees or currency exchange fees of conventional payment methods will cost you more, I have also never lost 10% of my company's liquid assets in a few minutes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>As remote freelancers we are spoiled for choice nowadays and we have many different options to use depending on what situation we find ourselves in.</p><p>I have used every single option I discussed in the article and they all have their own pros and cons. There is no "one size fits all" solution here and you'll need to do some research to see what works best for the type of business that you run.</p><p>I've found that for my situation I most often end up using TransferWise to accept payment, convert the currency and deposit it to the bank account where my company is incorporated. </p><p>Whether this works best for you is something you will need to research for yourself based on your company and location.</p>

<p>Hello! 👋 My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>In short, I am a company of one. I answer the customer support emails and I code and deploy new features. I also manage the <a href="https://developers.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">API docs</a> and <a href="https://support.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>, poke around the logs when there are issues, write the <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/sample_newsletter" target="_blank">bi-monthly newsletters</a> and I designed the logo!</p>

<p>As the company scales, so too must all aspects of my work which I break down into 4 parts: customer support, engineering, product and marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Finding opportunities for process optimization is honestly one of the more fun parts of running a business</strong>. I greatly attribute these to how I’ve been able to stay both solo &amp; sane up until now, currently with 600+ users and $45,000 ARR. In this post, I’m excited to share some of my most successful strategies along with anecdotes from my experience working on Lunch Money.</p>



<p>In the last 14 days, here’s what I got done across all departments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Launched an internal beta testers program and two sets of new features to test</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wrapped up a 2-week long refactor of some core components on the client-side</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Launched a major feature: advanced transaction filters</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Closed 13 tickets related to feature improvements and bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Sent out a newsletter outlining the latest new features</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This blog post</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Added new pages to the marketing site (<a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/collaboration">Collaboration</a>) and updated the icons in <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features">Features</a></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Received 239 inbound support tickets and sent out 358 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes all this work bearable for me is the fact that there is so much variety (which, of course, is the spice of life!). I love being able to switch between tasks to keep the job interesting and my mind refreshed while still being productive overall.</p>

<p><em>Case in point: I just finished a major refactor and pushed out 2 major features to beta, so writing this blog post right now feels like a vacation for my brain.</em></p>

<p>To state the obvious, I enjoy being hyper-efficient (without burning myself out, of course). Even though I am a single person, I can still automate, optimize and parallelize processes.</p>



<h2 id="implement-safeguards">Implement safeguards</h2>

<p><i>Ah, the blissful beginnings of Lunch Money when I’d push code directly to production several times a day.</i></p>

<p>At 500+ users now, those days are long gone and I’ve since needed to adopt the more boring but responsible approach of implementing safeguards to prevent shipping faulty code.</p>

<p>For one, <b>I’ve been thoroughly reviewing my own code before every change</b>. Every major feature, improvement and bug fix lives in a feature branch that I still, by habit from the corporate days, prepend with <code>jen/</code>. After verifying everything works great locally, I make sure to take a break first, whether that’s working on a completely unrelated task, going for a meal or going to bed. The point of this is to ensure that I’m code reviewing with a clear head.</p>

<p>While adhering to these standards of code reviewing myself may add extra time to my overall process, it potentially saves hours of bug-fixing, answering related support tickets and self-loathing (I’m half-kidding here) down the line if I accidentally ship bad code.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New phase of Lunch Money– no more pushing major features straight to production 🤯😂 <a href="https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L">https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L</a></p>— Jen (@lunchbag) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchbag/status/1256987437600927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2020</a></blockquote> </center>

<p><b>I also recently implemented an internal beta-testing program open to Lunch Money subscribers.</b> With more users accessing my app on a regular basis, the stakes are higher to ship a version that’s as bug-free as possible.</p>

<p>As an engineering team of one, it’s nearly impossible to always get it right the first time, despite having tests (what if I missed an edge case?) or testing locally extensively (how I think my users will use a feature is not always so).</p>

<p>The beta-testing program has provided some additional benefits. It’s nice to have a cohort of users with whom I can have a more candid conversation about Lunch Money and it’s also a great way to show users that their feedback is valued!</p>

<h2 id="automate-later-than-you-need-to">Automate later than you need to</h2>

<p>While automating tasks can save a lot of time in the long-term, it doesn’t always make sense to automate right off the bat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"><span>Obligatory XKCD comic (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/" target="_blank">link</a>)</span></p>

<p>Automating too late is not a bad thing. I’ll have done the manual work enough times to understand how to eventually automate the task and what edge cases to look out for. I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someone– it’s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who you’ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).</p>

<p>I manually triggered the emails for bi-monthly account summaries for months because I wasn’t confident the sending cadence was reasonable. After observing open rates and collecting user feedback, these are now automated to go out on the 5th &amp; 25th of every month.</p>

<p>Something that I’m glad I didn’t spend the time to automate at all was the referral program. If an existing user refers a new user and the new user subscribes to a plan, then both users will receive credit for 1 month.</p>

<p>In the end, the referral program only brought on 11 extra users. It was not a pain at all to manually process rewards for those who did. If I had spent time conjuring up all the edge cases and automating this process, it would not have been worth the time investment.</p>

<h2 id="keep-low-hanging-fruits-in-the-back-pocket">Keep low-hanging fruits in the back pocket</h2>

<p>In my task management system, I use a tag (🍏) to denote which tasks are low-hanging fruits. For the uninitiated, low-hanging fruits are quick tasks that are easy to knock out, such as one-liners or 5-minute fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YP1Jb0JNc7kqFDbdjm/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>I find that keeping these around and tackling them on days when you feel generally unmotivated can really help raise spirits. Still being able to get something completed and shipped is a great way to get out of a slump.</p>



<h2 id="timing-marketing-pushes">Timing marketing pushes</h2>

<p>At Lunch Money, a big part of the business is using the services of Plaid for bank syncing. Plaid charges on a monthly basis which means that if a user signs up on April 30, connects a bank account immediately and doesn’t end up subscribing at the end of their 14-day trial, they will charge me for this user in both April &amp; May’s invoices.</p>

<p>This realization coupled with my intense aversion to paying more than I need to has shaped a lot of practices at Lunch Money.</p>

<p>For one, the data retention policy used to be 30 days which means if your trial ends and you didn’t put in your billing information, your data will be deleted in 30 days. This certainly guarantees that I’ll be overpaying for churned users and is the reason why the data retention policy has since been revised to 5 days.</p>

<p>In total, a user who does not end up subscribing can spend up to 26 days in the Lunch Money system. This comprises of a 14-day trial, the potential for a 1 week trial extension and a 5 day grace period. Assuming enough users connect their bank accounts, the best way to minimize my costs for churned users is to ensure their lifetimes are within one calendar month.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/calendar-1.png"></p>

<p>As a result, I always schedule marketing pushes such as blog posts and product launches in the first few days of the month. When I came to this realization, my next Plaid bill went down for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="merging-marketing-and-engineering-for-a-combo-win">Merging marketing and engineering for a combo win</h2>

<p>Taking this a step further, the perk of having a spike in new users is that their trial periods more-or-less overlap. Usually when a new user signs up, they will poke around the product and maybe send in a bug report, a feature request or another piece of feedback. If I reply and address their feedback by putting in a fix or shipping their requested feature within days, more often than not, they end up converting into a happy customer.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore identified the following cycle to maximize potential conversions from spikes in user signups:</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/gantt-2.png"></p>

<p>After a marketing push, let’s say a product launch, I will see an immediate increase in signups lasting about 3 days and then slowly trailing off.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll start hearing from these new users via support tickets. I prioritize responding to them and I get to work. Showing these users that I’m committed to improving Lunch Money based on their feedback is a great and honest sales tactic.</p>

<p>About 3 days before the initial wave of user trials ends, I wrap up my engineering sprint and send out a newsletter detailing the latest features and improvements. This re-enforces to new users that the product is under continuous development.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a drip campaign that automatically notifies users a few days before their trial expires and on the actual date of expiry. This period of time is when I typically see most users convert 🤞.</p>



<p>I used to think that if I were to hire someone, it would first be a customer support agent but I’ve since been moving away from that idea. Users are constantly surprised (in a good way!) when they realize the founder is responding to their bug reports or feature requests directly.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently providing great customer support is a long-term investment for Lunch Money</strong> as it is undoubtedly a great way to turn customers into champions. As I receive and respond to support tickets, I’m also able to identify and overhaul the common sources of trouble for users.</p>

<p>I’ve always believed that customer support would be the most important and the hardest part of the business to scale, especially if I have the goal of staying a company of one.</p>

<p>Corroborating data from <a href="https://emailmeter.com/">EmailMeter</a> and my database, it seems my changes are making a difference. Despite a growing user base, inbound support emails remain fairly steady!</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/screen-shot-2020-05-21-at-4-20-15-pm.png"><span>Handling support on my own should be sustainable at least for the foreseeable future!</span></p>

                    <p><em>This post is the second in a four-part blog series by Peter Zaitsev, Percona Chief Executive Officer.</em></p>
<p>In this series, we are talking about Linux performance measurement, how to measure it right. Linux performance is a very broad topic, so we’ll focus on the four primary resources which are typically going to drive your system performance – obviously CPU, memory, disk storage, and network.</p>

</ul>
<p>In terms of the disk, there are actually two things you have to take care of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk space</strong> – simple, right? You don’t want to run out of disk space.</li>
<li>And disk as <strong>I/O performance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disk-space">Disk Space</h2>
<p>Starting from the simple tool – disk space.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people who do not understand the difference between size, the file length, and the disk usage. So, in this case, I created a test file of 16 gigabytes, but if you look at <code>du</code>, it only takes 4 kilobytes, because that is a sparse file, which is one giant 16-gigabyte hole.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image1.jpg" alt="Example of disk size/filesize" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Of course, you’re not likely to see this kind of a difference in the real world but you can, because there are a number of systems using sparse files for different things.</p>
<p>For example, in MySQL, due to some of the table compression that is used there may be a big difference between disk space used vs. file length that may be substantially different.</p>
<h2 id="io-performance">I/O performance</h2>
<p>Now when you speak about the disk I/O performance standpoint, you need to consider a number of things here.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is <strong>IOPS</strong> - how much it can do in the bandwidth. They are not quite replaceable, both can be the bottleneck, especially when it comes to the network-attached storage or slower buses. For example, it can be noticed that all SATA SSDs exactly deliver 500 megabytes a second because the SSDs are so fast, but SATA buses are so slow in this case, so that is the limit out there.</p>
<p>You also need to understand <strong>the different types of loads the disk reads, writes, or fsyncs</strong> , because we do have different latency and load implication.</p>
<p>In addition, your load concurrency is often referred to as a <strong>Queue Depth</strong> when it comes to the disk because concurrency is how many requests the system can process in parallel when big throughput is achieved that it is actually typical.</p>
<p>So, from typical mistakes: <em>“My Iostat Disk Utilization number has reached 100%"</em>. I have seen so many times this kind of being so much scared about this 100% when <em>“there is no way to go! Oh my gosh!"</em></p>
<p>The reality is that your <code>iostat</code> utilization number <strong>means the percent of the time when at least one I/O request was outstanding</strong>. It may make sense again for a single spinning drive in the last decade or last millennia, but it doesn’t really make sense for common storage we use those days.</p>
<p>It does not make sense for SSDs, it doesn’t make sense for RAIDs, it doesn’t make sense for NAS, it doesn’t make sense for cloud storage because they are very good at processing multiple requests at a time.</p>
<p>Performance, the latency at least, would not be impacted.</p>
<p>The points that should be highlighted here:</p>
<h3 id="1-separating-read-and-write-latency">1. Separating read and write latency</h3>
<p>Depending on your system, the difference between read and write latency may be very significant. Some systems actually have varied read latency, some have better write latency. In this case, what I do is compare their current latency to their kind of average latency, which you’ve seen on this system over the last period of time, so I can understand relatively easily that it’s abnormal.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image2.png" alt="Disk I/O latency" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p><em>Comparing Current Latency to Historic Latency can help to see when the latency is abnormal</em></p>
<h3 id="2-the-disk-load-that-also-can-be-the-average-disk-use">2. The disk load, that also can be the average disk use</h3>
<p>It means how many requests are going on at the same time. Because if you’re really saturating your disks, queuing happens, and when this thing typically becomes quite high you should know what exactly your storage is expected to be able to optimally handle.</p>
<p>The problem is of course if you think about cloud storage, you don’t really know what the optimal concurrency is. They don’t tell you and that’s going to be implementation-dependent, which can change at any point any time.</p>
<p>

<p><em>Graph from Percona Monitoring and Management (</em><a href="https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management"><em>PMM</em></a><em>)</em></p>
<h3 id="3-biolatency-block-device-latency">3. Biolatency: Block Device Latency</h3>
<p>The next thing is a biolatency, which again you can get from eBPF. You do not need to look at just the average latency, you can look at the distribution which can be done on an I/O device.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image4.png" alt="Block device latency distribution" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>eBPF also has some tools where you can look at that on a file system level that is more interesting because that is where you can also see your cache efficiency as well as you can look at some more of the outliers.</p>
<p>So, this is the tool for ext4 and also one for XFS and some other common file systems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<h2>1. "Man is a naturally political animal." - Aristotle (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1253a">Politics, Book 1</a>)</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>1. People are drawn to "political associations to satisfy their social needs." (<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/164">source</a>), or...</p>
<p>2. People enjoy engaging in the ugly parts of politics, or...</p>
<p>3. People are meant to live in cities. (closest to the actual meaning)</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>To Aristotle, the words "natural" and "political" held special meanings that are not equivalent to what we mean today. The result is that this quote is closer in meaning to:</p>

<blockquote>"Human beings have an internal principle that necessarily leads us to collaboration rather than to independence, and as a result we are meant to live in cities."</blockquote>

<p>When we say "natural" today, we typically mean something that is not man-made. To Aristotle, "natural" refers to things that have a "nature":</p>

<blockquote>"within itself a principle of motion and stability in place, in growth and decay, or in alteration" (Aristotle 192b13)</blockquote>

<p>So when Aristotle says that something is "naturally" the case, through a modern lens he's saying something closer to it being the result of the laws of nature.</p>

<p>Second, by "a political animal," it's tempting to conclude that Aristotle simply means "suited for life in a polis" (city) or "conducive to starting a polis." But he goes on to say that "a human being is <span>more of a</span> political animal than is any bee or any gregarious animal [i.e., an animal that lives in a group]" (1253a8, emphasis mine). So Aristotle thinks that some gregarious animals are political animals, but not to the extent that human beings are. It seems unlikely that Aristotle would suggest that bees or gregarious animals are "suited for lives in a polis" to any degree. More likely, by "political," Aristotle means "working toward a common goal" or "collaborative."</p>

<p>Secular, modern readers would likely disagree with Aristotle's next passage. He argues that nature has "given us" the ability to speak and make moral judgments, and nature "does nothing pointlessly," so we are <span>meant</span> to collaborate on our moral judgments. With our modern understanding of evolution, nature doesn't "give us" features, and nature does sometimes do things "pointlessly." However, this is what Aristotle meant when he said we are "naturally political animals." So even if you agree with the actual meaning of the quote, you probably don't agree with Aristotle's reasoning.</p>

<h2>2. "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>When I hear this quote today, I find that people often use it to mean that even if no one observes a fact, it is still true. So it's used as a rhetorical question, with the answer being "of course it makes a sound!"</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>This quote is not directly from any philosophical text, but the question is derived from "A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge" by the Anglican bishop George Berkeley (namesake of UC Berkeley!). Here's the closest section, where Berkeley explains a counterargument and his response:</p>

<blockquote>"But say you, surely there is nothing easier than to imagine Trees, for instance, in a Park... and no Body by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it: But what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your Mind certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees, and the same time omitting to frame the Idea of any one that may perceive them? But do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while?" (<a href="https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/Berkeley/HumanKnowledge/1734/HumKno.pdf">source</a>, pg. 18)</blockquote>

<p>I know that's confusing. Let's break it down. For context, Berkeley's famous phrase "esse est percipi" ("to be is to be perceived") is a summary of his philosophical position that objects as we know them cannot exist without the existence of minds to perceive them. (The gist is that everything we know about the object is known through our minds, so when you remove those characteristics, there's nothing left.)</p>

<p>In the first sentence, Berkeley is paraphrasing an objector who claims they are able to imagine trees that no one is perceiving. But Berkeley points out that the objector is simply thinking of the idea of trees ("certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees"), which only exist because the objector is thinking about them.</p>

<p>Since Berkeley believed in a Christian God, it's not clear whether he thought real objects could possibly exist without any perceiver at all, since God might always be watching. But to a secular reader of Berkeley's arguments, the consequence is that <span>the tree does not make a sound</span>, since sound is a perception, and the existence of a perception depends on the existence of a mind to perceive it.</p>

<h2>3. "God is Dead." (The Gay Science) - Nietzsche</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>This quote might be interpreted as a proclamation of atheism.</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>Nietzsche presented this phrase to a group of atheists, claiming that it was new information for them. So it can't be a statement about atheism.</p>

<p>In this section of "The Gay Science", Nietzsche discusses how many of the underpinnings of Western society, particularly our moral philosophy, implicitly rely on the concept of God. With the rise of philosophical secularism that came with the Enlightenment, we can no longer rely on God to give life meaning and value, and everything that was built on the Christian faith is destined to "collapse" (GS 343). This is what it means for God to be "dead."</p>

			<p><span>I discovered the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/no/book/show/38714658-the-order-of-time">The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli</a> a few years ago and it reignited my interest in Quantum Physics. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/24/carlo-rovelli-the-order-of-time-review">This is the original review that reeled me in. </a>The title caught my attention initially because the focus was on the concept of time. Time is a mysterious topic. It changes in unexpected circumstances, it’s perceived in different ways and scientists still ponder what it actually is. It turns out that time and quantum physics go hand in hand. The book is in three sections; the understanding of time in modern physics, what happens without time and finally the latest theories on time including Rovelli’s own research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity#:~:text=Quantum%20gravity%20(QG)%20is%20a,effects%20of%20gravity%20are%20strong.">Quantum Gravity</a> which present some of the most recent theories in the field. </span></p>
<p><span>One of the intriguing things was the link between time and heat. As things heat up, thermal agitation increases, which leads to entropy and disorder. This can distinguish the past and the future. There are many surprising assertions about time (at least for me) that I won’t spoil for you.</span></p>
<p><span>The tone of this book is poetic. It’s always in awe of the amazing world we live in. The best part is that it simplifies very difficult concepts into something most people could understand, allowing for greater access. This can only be a good thing for technology research overall. </span></p>
<p><span>As much information as there is about the concept of time and the theories that exist, there are still many open questions. It leaves you feeling small, knowing there is so much we don’t know about our world. And finally, unlike most other science books, there’s only one equation mentioned (good news for some).</span></p>
<p><span>I’ll leave you with <a href="https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/wellbeing/carlo-rovelli-coronavirus-italy-life-death-psychology-419679">something recent by Carlo Rovelli talking about the pandemic reminding us we are only human and encouraging collaboration and science to overcome it.</a></span></p>

<p>Thread dump files tend to span for several hundreds of lines (sometimes a few thousands of lines). It is hard to conceive and assimilate all the information in the thread dump due to its verbosity. Flame Graph generated by <span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fastthread.io/" target="_blank">fastThread</a></span> tool condenses all the information into one single compact flame graph format. It facilitates you to identify hot code paths quickly. In this article, let us learn how to use flame graphs generated by fastThread tool for effective debugging/troubleshooting purposes.</p>



<pre>If you would like to learn how to generate flame graph from java thread dumps, you can refer <a href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2020/06/23/flame-graph-from-java-thread-dump/">to this article</a></pre>



<h2>fastThread Flame graph features</h2>

<p><span><iframe width="736" height="414" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLVOzy3gERM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>Here are key features of the flame graph generated by fastThread application:</p>



<h3>1. Information on Mouse Hover:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Stack traces are represented as a column of boxes, where each box represents a function (a stack frame). On mouse-over of boxes, a tooltip will be displayed. It will show the class name, method name, and line of the code that has been executed. More importantly, it will show the number of threads that are executing this line of code.</p>

<h3>2. Flame Graph Color</h3>



<p>The background color for each box is not significant and is picked at random to be a warm hue. This randomness helps the eye to differentiate boxes, especially for adjacent thin “towers”.</p>



<h3>3. Box width</h3>



<p>The width of each box depends on the thread count. If the width of the box is sufficient, it displays the full function name. If not, either a truncated function name with an ellipsis is shown, or nothing.</p>



<h3>4. Click to zoom</h3>



<p>When a box is clicked, the flame graph zooms horizontally. This reveals more detail and often function names for the child functions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sum of matched stack traces is also shown at the left- bottom of the Flame Graph, as shown in the above image.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The flame graph is a powerful yet simple way to visualize and analyze your thread dumps. We hope it will be useful to debug your production problems.</p>

July 8, 2020 | https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently decided to switch the engine of
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> from TypeScript
to Rust. The application itself is an SPA written in Svelte.
I only switched the logic that updates the game state to Rust.
Here is a summary of my experience with the transition:</p><h2>Isomorphic Architecture</h2><p>One of the advantages of using JavaScript or TypeScript is
that you can run the same code on both client and server.
For <a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a>, this means
that the game state can be updated independently on both sides.
This results in a lag-free experience on the client
while still using the server as the authoritative source of
data.</p><p>With <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> taking off, you can get the same advantage
writing Rust. Instead of pushing client-side code to the server, we push server-side code to the client by compiling Rust
to WebAssembly.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust">Rollup</a>
plugin allows you to import a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file into your
TypeScript codebase, allowing a seamless integration between
Rust and TypeScript code. The dev experience is almost as smooth
as writing TypeScript itself (for example, the browser refreshes
automatically when you change a line of Rust code).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a>
facilitates serialization of Rust structs into JSON objects
and vice-versa.</p><h2>Limitations of TypeScript</h2><p>Coding in TypeScript has been a largely pleasant experience,
but switching to Rust immediately brought to light some of the
limitations of TypeScript.</p><h4>Strict Typing</h4><p>TypeScript is more of a type-hinter than a type-checker.
It primarily ensures that you’re not accessing fields that
you aren’t declaring via the type system (which is quite expressive). It also enables nicer autocomplete for your IDE.</p><p>However, it does not actually ensure that the data you are
manipulating corresponds to the type that you have declared
to represent it. For example, the data might contain <strong>additional fields</strong> or
even <strong>incorrect</strong> values for declared types.</p><h4>Data Validation</h4><p>You have to write data validation code to ensure that you’re
operating on correct data in TypeScript. You get this for
free in Rust, which will throw an error if you parse data
that doesn’t line up with the struct that is to hold it in
memory.</p><h4>Error Handling</h4><p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html">pattern matching</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">error handling</a> make it easy to
handle every code path that could result in an error, leading
to very robust code.</p><p>This leads to a great degree of confidence that if it compiles,
it’s probably not going to throw an error at runtime.</p><h2>Performance</h2><h4>WebAssembly is faster than JavaScript</h4><p>The initial rewrite without any performance optimizations
is already faster than the previous TypeScript codebase.
This doesn’t matter too much yet, but
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> will eventually
ship with bots, so the performance will matter once
game trees need to be searched.</p><h4>The Rust server is leaner</h4><p>The multiplayer server receives updates from clients via
WebSockets and then:</p><ul><li>Updates its copy of the game state.</li><li>Broadcasts the client update to other clients.</li></ul><p>The previous server used <a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws">ws</a>, a popular library for NodeJS. The new version uses <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> (Rust), which uses less memory
under the same load.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the switch. I haven’t really
encountered much resistance from the borrow checker despite
being fairly new to Rust (I come from a C++ background, so
maybe that helps).</p></div></div>]]>

<p><img height="501" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/fc9b27d1ce9c1a803fe76b3cfc1a34f3_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In a palm-fringed, sunny bay in Panama, a revolution is taking place. This is the location of the first SeaPod manufacturing facility, where around 30 single family SeaPods are being pieced together from 3D-printed molds and lifted onto their foundations just over a kilometre from the shoreline.</p>
<p>The plan is that these will be self-sufficient homes that power themselves, produce their own hydroponic food and electricity, handle their own wastewater treatment, and even be fitted with an underwater coral nursery to support marine life. Air and water drones will courier trash, recycling, packages, food delivery and emergency medical support like defibrillators and medicine.</p>
<p>This is not science-fiction. If all goes ahead, by late Fall this year, Linton Bay Marina in Panama will house the first residential seasteading community in the world. </p>
<p>Seasteading, the concept of creating permanent dwellings at sea outside the territory claimed by any government, is not new, but some examples more credible than others. For instance, in the 1960's the founder of The Church of Scientology based much of the group's executive leadership on seasteads, before moving them back to land in the 1970's. In his 1992 book <em>The Millennial Project; Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps,</em> <a title="Marshall Savage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Savage">Marshall Savage</a> discussed building tethered <a title="Artificial island" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_island">artificial islands.</a>  </p>
<p> <img height="501" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/86199cf33beb4e1e21cb4a752200ef37_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Artisanopolis concept for the Seasteading Institute (c) Gabriel Scheare, Luke Lourdes Crowley and Patrick White</p>
<p>But recently the concept has gained traction with a more serious school of thought. In April 2019, the concept of floating cities as a way to cope with rising oceans was included in a presentation by the United Nations program UN-Habitat. In addition, a Dutch pro-choice non-profit named <a href="https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/">Women on Waves</a> uses seasteading as a way to circumnavigate abortion laws, using a commissioned ship that contains a specially constructed mobile clinic, the A-Portable. When WoW visits a country, women make appointments for an abortion or other reproductive health service, and are taken on board the ship. The ship then sails out approximately 12 miles to international waters where Dutch laws are in effect on board ships registered in the Netherlands.<sup id="cite_ref-5"></sup></p>
<p>This particular seastead in Panama is the brainchild of <a href="https://ocean.builders/about/">Ocean Builders</a>, a company co-founded by Silicon Valley bitcoin entrepreneur Chad Elwartowski, former Navy aeronautical engineer Rüdiger Koch and software developer Grant Romundt. This is not the first attempt at creating a long-term residential community. It came close, last year, when Elwartowski and his partner Supranee Thepdet moved into the first floating, octagonal seastead 12 miles off the coast of Phuket, Thailand.</p>
<p>They lived there for around two months, but after a video of them drinking champagne and inviting others to "join their ocean community" was published online, the Royal Thai Navy sent out a crew to remove their seastead as "a threat to Thai sovereignty". Elwartowski and his partner had already fled after a tip-off from a friend. </p>
<p>Two years prior, a floating island building company called <a href="https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/">Blue Frontiers,</a> had signed a memorandum of understanding with French Polynesia to create the first semi-autonomous "seazone" for a prototype in 2017, not least on the grounds of fast-rising sea-levels as a potential life-line to hedge against global warming. But the project was later shelved indefinitely after local protests. </p>
<p><img height="593" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/decd3a2ab1d05af8f8461db5097bbe83_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The seastead that was home to Chad Elwartowski and his partner Supranee Thepdet</p>
<p>This time, in Panama, they have the full support of the government, says Ocean Builders CEO Grant Romundt, over a Zoom call. "We will be working closely with Panama to identify any legal matters related to our floating homes. We wish to pursue a flagging system so that owners of the homes can hold a title and claim ownership of their new home fully backed by the legal system of Panama."</p>
<p>An advertisement on the Ocean Builders website is recruiting people to join the growing community, “entrepreneurs, aquapreneurs, technology enthusiasts, electronics hackers, marine biologists and other people that are passionate about developing new products and services that a city on the ocean would need.” </p>
<p>The 3D printer they are using to create the molds for the homes is huge, 20 feet by 16 feet, to build details down to the millimeter. The current pod design is engineered for 5 meter waves as the pods float about 2.5 meters above the waves, similar to an oil rig. The design for the SeaPods came from Dutch architect Koen Olthuis of Water Studio, an established designer of floating homes. </p>
<p>"We really don't feel waves like a normal boat would which is floating in the turbulent surface of the water, and when we go further out to sea we can scale our designs to withstand larger waves," says Romundt. Ocean Builders is working towards 3D printing the entire floating home which may take years of research and development. In the meantime, SeaPods are molded from 3D printed molds in a combination of plastic and foam and then covered with fiberglass. The Pods have an outer shell made of a white gel coat. On the interior, owners can choose between gel coat or a Corian artificial stone surface from Dupont.</p>
<p>During the first phase of sales, according to Romundt, the primary focus will be on tourism and businesses, through 'SeaBnBs', time shares and rentals. "We want as many people to experience our new homes as possible," he adds. </p>
<p><img height="501" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/86199cf33beb4e1e21cb4a752200ef37_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Legalities</strong></p>
<p>Every land-based country has their own rules on how long they consider a person needs to be in their country to be deemed a resident of their country, either for legal, tax, health insurance or other purposes. But seasteading countries would be free of that obligation, said Romundt. "There is no requirement for how long someone would need to live on a seastead to be deemed a resident of that community." </p>
<p>To be considered as a country, a seasteading community would likely fly a maritime flag of a country similar to how boats are flagged under a country. This would give them some legal protections as they would theoretically be seen as a part of the country they are flagged under, explained Romundt. To be completely outside of a governments' jurisdiction a seasteading community would need to be 200 miles from land.</p>
<p>According to the non-profit think tank, the Seasteading Institute, many seasteading proponents are fed up with their country's outdated laws and welcome the idea to rewrite the rulebook for the 21st Century. </p>
<p>"The challenge with old governments is that obsolete laws don’t go away as fast as new laws are created. For instance, <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/A9999/5169_I1.HTM" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">a law that all horses on the highway must wear sleigh bells was not repealed in New Jersey until 2017</a>," said President of the Seasteading Institute, Joe Quirk.</p>
<p>"We need legal systems to evolve as rapidly as the cultures and technologies they govern, and Seasteading is a technology to accelerate the process by which smart laws are developed and dumb laws are deleted. Special Economic Zones are areas within existing countries that are given unique regulatory systems to increase prosperity. Think of them as legal islands created on land. <a href="https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2019_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">There are more than 4000 around the world, including more than 250 in the US</a>," he added. </p>
<p>Tom W. Bell, a professor of law at Chapman University, wrote a book proposing a new kind of Special Economic Zone known as a SeaZone, which will take the lessons learned from land-based zones and apply them in a floating zone. He said in the book, "Governments across the globe have begun evolving from lumbering bureaucracies into smaller, more agile special jurisdictions - common-interest developments, special economic zones, and proprietary cites. Private providers increasingly deliver services that political authorities formerly monopolized, inspiring greater competition and efficiency, to the satisfaction of citizens-qua-consumers. These trends suggest that new networks of special jurisdictions will soon surpass nation states in the same way that networked computers replaced mainframes."</p>
<p>While this is all good in an ideal, libertarian world, argues Emma Lindsay, a New York-based partner at international law firm Withers, escaping the nation state is difficult, even on the high seas, and in fact the laws of several countries could apply.  </p>
<p>She adds: "<span lang="EN-US">Individuals are subject to the laws of their state(s) of nationality no matter where they are. While not all of a state’s laws apply outside its territory, many do. The laws of the flag state of the seastead also apply.  All seagoing vessels are registered or licensed in a flag state which is deemed the nationality of the vessel. Panama is the world’s largest flag state by far.  Seasteaders also could be subject to the laws of any state that is harmed by their activities at sea, such as by pollution of surrounding waters. The current negotiation of a new UN treaty on conservation and sustainable use of the high seas has increased attention globally on this issue."</span></p>
<p>Withers is advising High Seas Alliance in its advocacy with states and other stakeholders negotiating the new treaty in New York.</p>

<p> <strong>Life In A Tax Haven</strong></p>
<p>The homes in Panama will be located in an anchorage close to a marina in calm, protected waters, as part of a trial run for a community further away in future. This allows for getting accustomed to living on the water while still being able to travel on land having easy access to groceries, supplies and the airport. Each home will be fitted with solar panels, a water filtration system and hydroponic farming to aim for as much self-sufficiency as possible.</p>
<p>One reason for trialling the concept in Panama is that it is a pure tax haven, meaning that it imposes no income, corporate, …</p></div></div>

Who’s the winner there? For starters, it’s the company that sold me the candle. And as winners, they’re inclined to preserve the conditions that let them win. So the immense supply chain that turned crude oil, glass, and paper into a delightful candle (probably clearcutting a rainforest along the way) is deliberately made opaque to regulators and consumers like me. In other words, the <em>box</em> is kept <em>black</em>. With diminished visibility, the loser — the rainforest — is subject to further disadvantage. Thus, <strong>the black box preserves the existing divide between winners and losers.</strong></p><p id="viewer-fq9n4">But if you look a little closer, the winner-loser divide isn’t so black and white. Obviously I, as the owner of the candle, benefit from its black-boxedness. I can fill my living room with citrus blossom fragrances, blissfully ignorant of the polluted air it sends into the lungs of people and animals closer to the candle’s production. And though I may claim to support ecological policy reform, thereby aligning with the loser, my consumption choices say otherwise.</p><div id="viewer-602v0"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_83100eafdb1a4ead944746138bb13165~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_600,h_316,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_83100eafdb1a4ead944746138bb13165~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9pmb0"><a href="http://www.joehollier.com/fiveonthat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><h2 id="viewer-amq0v">Defense mechanisms</h2><p id="viewer-blqmb">Cognitive dissonance is inescapable in a world of black boxes. While they’re often vital to societal functioning — like the black box of democracy, as discussed in <a href="https://vujadeworld.substack.com/p/tangled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part two</a> — they’re not necessarily moral. Underneath their murky surfaces, we know, are plenty of things we don’t want to see. But since our very lifestyles have molded around them, exposing their inner workings would threaten the way we live. To ward off anxiety and guilt, we construct defense mechanisms (on individual <em>and</em> societal scales).</p><p id="viewer-4nhpg">Take, for example, the moment you dispose of a piece of trash. From the moment it hits the bottom of the bin, a massive system comes to life — of garbage trucks, dumpsters, street cleaners, sanitation centers, and landfills — to whisk it out of your life as quickly as it came in. Or, it just lands on the side of the road…</p><p id="viewer-7h8d">In any case, our products <em>come from</em> and <em>return to</em> a sort of <strong>mental nowhereland</strong>; a cavity for unspoken thoughts to fester: “<em>this doesn’t exist after I’m done with it</em>,” or taken further, “<em>the Earth is abundant</em>.” Of course, these aren’t explicit views in our minds; they occupy the <em>negative space</em> — like shadows, or lies.</p><div id="viewer-a3v8v"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ac3ced2b99534923a938a3d3c2c9b5e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1418,h_1418,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ac3ced2b99534923a938a3d3c2c9b5e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-b0mtt"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhA8Dhejk9l/?igshid=18a1vwb87761x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><p id="viewer-eued3">And this is just for lifeless products.

They are institutional voids, which perpetuate the same invisibilities that produced them. In the process, they carve out a negative space of shadows, lies, and unasked questions.

That they’re <em>dangerous</em>? Well, sort of. <strong>Stories are most dangerous when they’re</strong> <em><strong>invisible</strong></em>.</p><p id="viewer-dfbfb">In their refined, packaged-up formats, stories are relatively benign. The danger in Disney fairy tales, for instance, stems from the societal narratives surrounding them — which they subtly reinforce. <em>Cinderella</em>, the movie, isn’t the problem; it’s the broader story of femininity, and the impossible challenge of fitting into the “glass slipper” of male expectations.</p><p id="viewer-63p5o">The symbols and mythology of a story, while potential tools for relaying the real issues at hand, also run the risk of obscuring those same issues. As a result, a story itself can be a sort of glass slipper.

And the protective shell of narrative too often lets injustice off the hook. <strong>If the&nbsp;<em>content</em>&nbsp;of a story doesn’t adequately address its</strong> <strong><em>context</em>, a black box has been formed.</strong> These narrative black boxes, like the prison and the landfill, only reaffirm the conditions that produced them in the first place.</p><p id="viewer-9n9s0">Mark Zuckerberg famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Facebook_Effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>: “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.” Albeit tone-deaf rhetorically (such as his default to <em>dying</em> and <em>Africa</em>), this is, in fact, a <em>story</em>. And it’s not actually about squirrels, nor people in Africa.</p><p id="viewer-9csne">On the surface-level, it seems reminiscent of the candle/rainforest analogy — illustrating how we naturally prioritize what’s <em>visible</em> over what’s <em>important</em>. But Zuckerberg’s subtext is covertly self-reflexive. Visibility, according to the story, sits outside his locus of control. By focusing on a narrowly-defined “relevance” to our “interests,” he implies that all Facebook does is reflect our own natural tendencies. In a sly erasure of context, the squirrel analogy obscures Facebook’s troll-under-the-bridge role: how levied allotment of visibility is their entire profit model.</p><p id="viewer-dg8pl">If history is written by the victors, then <strong>stories are told by the winners</strong>. So behind every story, and thus behind every black box, there’s a winner. And the BIG winners — like Facebook, Google, and Amazon — not only tell stories, but they run the bidding wars for visibility itself. Space, whether on a shelf or a timeline, is fought for exclusively by those on the <em>outside</em> of the black box.</p><div id="viewer-9pui"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ddef68de436249d8b3a7f9f9b4ab7580~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1382,h_1382,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ddef68de436249d8b3a7f9f9b4ab7580~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><h6 id="viewer-9h5iv"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5n1R8XJr83/?igshid=uzunevirh3bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></h6><p id="viewer-i4hr">But now, the black boxes that have cocooned us for so long are beginning to crack.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Online abuse of trust is one of the topics I’ve studied deeply, including significant work toward an unfinished <a href="https://levien.com/thesis/thesis.pdf">PhD</a>, and over two years working on a spam and abuse team at Google. These days my main work is on 2D graphics, but seeing patterns of misinformation about Covid-19 is bringing back interest and motivation to think about these topics.</p>

<p>As Covid-19 has been unfolding, I’ve spent significant time and energy trying to understand it, as I tend to do with threats in general. In so doing, I’ve developed some insight on how to tune media consumption patterns towards more truthful content and less misinformation.</p>

<h2 id="america-is-broken">America is broken</h2>

<p>The astonishingly poor national response to Covid-19 is heartbreaking. Given our incredible richness of resources, it is surprising that many of the failure modes resemble those from low-income countries: superstition, cult of personality, suppression of science, and straight up corruption. A common thread is misinformation and disinformation.</p>

<p>Our response to Covid-19 has been very much like driving a car with poorly-maintained brakes. We’ve done the equivalent of neglecting regular maintenance, ignoring the brake light on the dashboard, and choosing to not to pay attention to the squishy feeling of the brake pedal. It’s as if there’s a devil on our shoulder saying, “oh no, don’t get the brakes fixed, it might cost hundreds of dollars.”</p>

<p>I think it’s worth trying to understand <em>why</em> we’re in that position, but it’s beyond the scope of this blog post. Mass behavior of humans is pretty predictable, but individual choices can probably make some difference. I have no answers for those who <em>want</em> to listen to that devil (a big challenge in and of itself), but for those would prefer to listen to the angel instead, I have some tips.</p>

<h2 id="it-is-a-partisan-issue">It is a partisan issue</h2>

<p>I often see the plea “it is not a partisan issue” attached to factual arguments. I think this represents an aspiration: it <em>should</em> not be partisan. In 2020 America, the reality is that there is a powerful anti-science, anti-truth faction, and that faction makes up a large part of the composition of one of the political parties. It’s not 100% alignment, and I want to give credit where credit is due: for example, the moderate Republican governor of Massachusetts has embraced science and investment in public health, and the results in that state are one of the best in the country.</p>

<p>But in general, any factual argument that has bearing on a political question such as “should we invest in public health” or “should we restructure the economy away from carbon consumption” is now inherently partisan.</p>

<p>Much of the partisan content in media is around issues that are not very consequential, either pure entertainment, or (at least traditionally) between candidates or parties that have comparable ability to govern. I was hopeful that the life or death nature of Covid-19 would motivate the people who decide what appears in media to higher standards. But apparently, it’s just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog">nature of the scorpion</a>, they either can’t help themselves or just don’t care. Almost certainly, the media organization with the most blood on its hands is Fox News, which actively promotes an anti-health, pro-infection agenda. I don’t understand how they sleep at night.</p>

<p>Truth threatens a lot of existing power structures. If everybody woke up tomorrow and decided they were tired of being lied to, there would be seismic shifts of power. It’s worth thinking about who might be most affected by such a thing, and the kinds of things they do to keep it from happening.</p>

<h2 id="high-end-science-journalism">High-end science journalism</h2>

<p>I’m going to cover a range of information sources in this post, but there is a tl;dr: read up on actual science journalism by people who know what they’re talking about. Coverage by Science, Nature, and STAT News has been uniformly excellent. Good journalism is always teamwork, but I’ll also raise up the voices of particularly insightful individuals: <a href="https://twitter.com/sciencecohen">Jon Cohen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kakape">Kai Kupferschmidt</a> of Science, <a href="https://twitter.com/amymaxmen">Amy Maxmen</a> of Nature, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell">Helen Branswell</a> of STAT News. These are science journalists who have invested years in honing their craft.</p>

<p>I’ve also been impressed by coverage in The Atlantic. Their science content is quite good (thanks to top-notch contributors such as <a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209">Ed Yong</a>), but they also put the science in the context of American culture and politics. It is for this reason, I believe, that our President has <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/05/27/the-atlantic-saw-subscriptions-surge-after-trump-tweet/">singled them out</a> for criticism.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that these sources tend to be publications that have been around for a while (STAT News is a brand of the Boston Globe media group). It’s not exactly rocket science how to do this, you just need to find experienced, capable writers and pay them to do journalism, with editorial and institutional support. But in today’s hyper-capitalist society, sustaining such efforts is a struggle. If you can, try to support publications that do good work by subscribing, or donating in the case of non-profits.</p>

<p>For someone with a limited budget of time and attention, good science journalism is absolutely the best bang for the buck. The other recommendations in this post are for people who want to spend a little more effort to gain, hopefully, a little more insight.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>By far the most interesting experience I’ve had has been Twitter. What makes Twitter unique is its extremely wide dynamic range of information quality: both the worst of the worst and the best of the best are well represented. (An example of an information source of low dynamic range is an encyclopedia: almost every article is pretty good, garbage and brilliance both being rare)</p>

<p>A well-curated Twitter feed is one of the best information sources available today, and following random people on Twitter is one of the worst.</p>

<p>Even though it has no formal structure such as subreddits, Twitter functions as a set of overlapping communities, often described as “X Twitter” or “Y Twitter” (incidentally, a good explanation of how communities work on Twitter can be had in Jeff Jarvis’ <a href="https://buzzmachine.com/2020/05/11/a-conversation-with-nathan-allebach-steak-umms-voice/">interview of the voice behind Steak-umm</a>). There are many experts who generously share their knowledge and thoughts with us, and I’ve found that with a modest investment of time, it’s possible to follow along.</p>

<p>In one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCud8VIawWp17jKl2Lp0VvlQ">Jeff Jarvis interviews</a>, they jokingly referred to “idiot Twitter,” and, though it was a joke, the concept has stuck with me. Twitter, like all social media properties, works by engaging very large numbers of people with content that appeals emotionally. The expert communities are far too small a fraction of Twitter’s traffic to be profitable for them, but they support them as a way to maintain the prestige of the platform. The replies of any popular post are filled with all manner of conspiracy theory, miracle cure, denial, blame, and, I think at least sometimes, active disinformation by those who would do us harm (it’s hard to tell the difference and the outcome is the same). I think of all that as “idiot Twitter” and just do my best to avoid it. I also see it everywhere, of course, not just Twitter, and the quantity of it is a good measure of the value in a social media platform.</p>

<p>Twitter has a delicate balance to maintain, as there are many aspects of the site design that push you toward “idiot Twitter” even when you’re trying to curate your experience to avoid it. One example that consistently frustrates me is the trending panel, as that seems to be about half composed of idiot Twitter. It’s addictive, even so, because it tempts you with the thrill of discovering things early. I’ve also found that it’s easier to avoid junk on the desktop site than the mobile app. I’m worried the experience will degrade; Quora stands as a cautionary tale of what can happen to a relatively respectable site when they pursue clicks at the cost of all else.</p>

<p>Whether it would be viable to develop a social network designed for quality of discussion is another topic beyond this blog. I’m not especially hopeful on this front, as it’s hard to see how it would be profitable. In any case, there’s not much value in wishing for the possibly impossible, as somebody seeking quality information can find it even today.</p>

<h3 id="list-curation">List curation</h3>

<p>One of the interesting features of Twitter is that people will curate and share lists of people they feel are worth following. My <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1239639611694911489">covid-19 list</a> is one such, and a lot of thought went into it: I’ve intentionally included people with a wide range of expertise (including, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/j_g_allen">Joseph Allen</a> for his insight into healthy buildings and <a href="https://twitter.com/uche_blackstock">Dr. Uché Blackstock</a> for expertise on health equity). I’ve also deliberately excluded people from this list who express strong political views or often use an emotional tone. Because of the latter criterion, it’s missing people I personally feel are worth listening to, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/gregggonsalves">Gregg Gonsalves</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyKonyndyk">Jeremy Konyndyk</a>. As always, your mileage may vary. The goal of this particular list is not to be comprehensive, it’s to select a set of voices that have excellent signal to noise ratio; for a much more comprehensive list, see <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1237834151694303234">this one curated by Jeff Jarvis</a>.</p>

<p>One phenomenon I’ve noticed is that people at the top of these lists tend to recommend each other. I wouldn’t be surprised if some automated evaluation (perhaps based on eigenvalues) could yield a good curated list. That said, in my past research, I’ve found that any automatic metric with an incentive will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">gamed</a>, and invariably will lift up self-promoters over quiet, thoughtful voices.</p>

<p>Speaking of self-promoters, two names do not belong on lists of top experts, but are often found there: Eric Feigl-Ding &amp; Laurie Garrett. Both are good communicators, but are also sloppy enough with their science to get called out regularly. Inclusion of these names is a sign that a list of experts is not especially carefully curated.</p>

<p>Another important warning sign is lack of inclusion of women and people of color; mainstream media is often guilty of this. Health equity is an especially important part of the …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><em><center>Neil Postman (March 27, 1998)</center></em></p><hr>
      <p>Good morning your Eminences and Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen. 
      </p><p>The theme of this conference, "The New Technologies and the Human 
      Person: Communicating the Faith in the New Millennium," suggests, of 
      course, that you are concerned about what might happen to faith in the new 
      millennium, as well you should be. In addition to our computers, which are 
      close to having a nervous breakdown in anticipation of the year 2000, 
      there is a great deal of frantic talk about the 21st century and how it 
      will pose for us unique problems of which we know very little but for 
      which, nonetheless, we are supposed to carefully prepare. Everyone seems 
      to worry about this--business people, politicians, educators, as well as 
      theologians. 
      </p><p>At the risk of sounding patronizing, may I try to put everyone's mind 
      at ease? I doubt that the 21st century will pose for us problems that are 
      more stunning, disorienting or complex than those we faced in this 
      century, or the 19th, 18th, 17th, or for that matter, many of the 
      centuries before that. But for those who are excessively nervous about the 
      new millennium, I can provide, right at the start, some good advice about 
      how to confront it. The advice comes from people whom we can trust, and 
      whose thoughtfulness, it's safe to say, exceeds that of President Clinton, 
      Newt Gingrich, or even Bill Gates. Here is what Henry David Thoreau told 
      us: "All our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end." Here 
      is what Goethe told us: "One should, each day, try to hear a little song, 
      read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if possible, speak a few 
      reasonable words." Socrates told us: "The unexamined life is not worth 
      living." Rabbi Hillel told us: "What is hateful to thee, do not do to 
      another." And here is the prophet Micah: "What does the Lord require of 
      thee but to do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God." And 
      I could say, if we had the time, (although you know it well enough) what 
      Jesus, Isaiah, Mohammad, Spinoza, and Shakespeare told us. It is all the 
      same: There is no escaping from ourselves. The human dilemma is as it has 
      always been, and it is a delusion to believe that the technological 
      changes of our era have rendered irrelevant the wisdom of the ages and the 
      sages. 
      </p><p>Nonetheless, having said this, I know perfectly well that because we do 
      live in a technological age, we have some special problems that Jesus, 
      Hillel, Socrates, and Micah did not and could not speak of. I do not have 
      the wisdom to say what we ought to do about such problems, and so my 
      contribution must confine itself to some things we need to know in order 
      to address the problems. I call my talk <i>Five Things We Need to Know 
      About Technological Change</i>. I base these ideas on my thirty years of 
      studying the history of technological change but I do not think these are 
      academic or esoteric ideas. They are to the sort of things everyone who is 
      concerned with cultural stability and balance should know and I offer them 
      to you in the hope that you will find them useful in thinking about the 
      effects of technology on religious faith. 
      </p><p><b>First Idea</b> 
      </p><p>The first idea is that all technological change is a trade-off. I like 
      to call it a Faustian bargain. Technology giveth and technology taketh 
      away. This means that for every advantage a new technology offers, there 
      is always a corresponding disadvantage. The disadvantage may exceed in 
      importance the advantage, or the advantage may well be worth the cost. 
      Now, this may seem to be a rather obvious idea, but you would be surprised 
      at how many people believe that new technologies are unmixed blessings. 
      You need only think of the enthusiasms with which most people approach 
      their understanding of computers. Ask anyone who knows something about 
      computers to talk about them, and you will find that they will, 
      unabashedly and relentlessly, extol the wonders of computers. You will 
      also find that in most cases they will completely neglect to mention any 
      of the liabilities of computers. This is a dangerous imbalance, since the 
      greater the wonders of a technology, the greater will be its negative 
      consequences. 
      </p><p>Think of the automobile, which for all of its obvious advantages, has 
      poisoned our air, choked our cities, and degraded the beauty of our 
      natural landscape. Or you might reflect on the paradox of medical 
      technology which brings wondrous cures but is, at the same time, a 
      demonstrable cause of certain diseases and disabilities, and has played a 
      significant role in reducing the diagnostic skills of physicians. It is 
      also well to recall that for all of the intellectual and social benefits 
      provided by the printing press, its costs were equally monumental. The 
      printing press gave the Western world prose, but it made poetry into an 
      exotic and elitist form of communication. It gave us inductive science, 
      but it reduced religious sensibility to a form of fanciful superstition. 
      Printing gave us the modern conception of nationhood, but in so doing 
      turned patriotism into a sordid if not lethal emotion. We might even say 
      that the printing of the Bible in vernacular languages introduced the 
      impression that God was an Englishman or a German or a Frenchman--that is 
      to say, printing reduced God to the dimensions of a local potentate. 
      </p><p>Perhaps the best way I can express this idea is to say that the 
      question, "What will a new technology do?" is no more important than the 
      question, "What will a new technology undo?" Indeed, the latter question 
      is more important, precisely because it is asked so infrequently. One 
      might say, then, that a sophisticated perspective on technological change 
      includes one's being skeptical of Utopian and Messianic visions drawn by 
      those who have no sense of history or of the precarious balances on which 
      culture depends. In fact, if it were up to me, I would forbid anyone from 
      talking about the new information technologies unless the person can 
      demonstrate that he or she knows something about the social and psychic 
      effects of the alphabet, the mechanical clock, the printing press, and 
      telegraphy. In other words, knows something about the costs of great 
      technologies. 
      </p><p>Idea Number One, then, is that culture always pays a price for 
      technology. 
      </p><p><b>Second Idea</b> 
      </p><p>This leads to the second idea, which is that the advantages and 
      disadvantages of new technologies are never distributed evenly among the 
      population. This means that every new technology benefits some and harms 
      others. There are even some who are not affected at all. Consider again 
      the case of the printing press in the 16th century, of which Martin Luther 
      said it was "God's highest and extremest act of grace, whereby the 
      business of the gospel is driven forward." By placing the word of God on 
      every Christian's kitchen table, the mass-produced book undermined the 
      authority of the church hierarchy, and hastened the breakup of the Holy 
      Roman See. The Protestants of that time cheered this development. The 
      Catholics were enraged and distraught. Since I am a Jew, had I lived at 
      that time, I probably wouldn't have given a damn one way or another, since 
      it would make no difference whether a pogrom was inspired by Martin Luther 
      or Pope Leo X. Some gain, some lose, a few remain as they were. 
      </p><p>Let us take as another example, television, although here I should add 
      at once that in the case of television there are very few indeed who are 
      not affected in one way or another. In America, where television has taken 
      hold more deeply than anywhere else, there are many people who find it a 
      blessing, not least those who have achieved high-paying, gratifying 
      careers in television as executives, technicians, directors, newscasters 
      and entertainers. On the other hand, and in the long run, television may 
      bring an end to the careers of school teachers since school was an 
      invention of the printing press and must stand or fall on the issue of how 
      much importance the printed word will have in the future. There is no 
      chance, of course, that television will go away but school teachers who 
      are enthusiastic about its presence always call to my mind an image of 
      some turn-of-the-century blacksmith who not only is singing the praises of 
      the automobile but who also believes that his business will be enhanced by 
      it. We know now that his business was not enhanced by it; it was rendered 
      obsolete by it, as perhaps an intelligent blacksmith would have known. 
      </p><p>The questions, then, that are never far from the mind of a person who 
      is knowledgeable about technological change are these: Who specifically 
      benefits from the development of a new technology? Which groups, what type 
      of person, what kind of industry will be favored? And, of course, which 
      groups of people will thereby be harmed? 
      </p><p>These questions should certainly be on our minds when we think about 
      computer technology. There is no doubt that the computer has been and will 
      continue to be advantageous to large-scale organizations like the military 
      or airline companies or banks or tax collecting institutions. And it is 
      equally clear that the computer is now indispensable to high-level </p></div></div>

<p>It’s often said that you can tell a lot about a person by observing their living space. In a similar vein, I believe we can glean a lot about society by observing our own minds – where we store the individual thoughts, beliefs and values that form society’s collective structures. Unsurprisingly our headspace is often a product of our mind’s state, sitting somewhere along a spectrum of fulfilment to boredom at any one time. In this article I want to focus more on the latter, more specifically, how boredom as a pervasive state of mind has shaped our consumption habits. What we feed our minds for entertainment and why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I get into that though we have to clarify the relationship between boredom and consumption, or rather dispel a popular myth. Boredom isn’t resolved by quick, easy stimulation of the mind, instead boredom feeds off of it to grow even larger. You can think of it as drinking alcohol to quench thirst, in the immediate term you will feel hydrated only to realise it will leave you even more parched than before. Now that we’ve acknowledged this, bear in mind that today’s pace of life and technology has ensured that we do exactly that. Boredom is met with quick stimulus leaving an even larger craving in its wake, only to be met by quicker and easier stimulation, and so goes the cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s entertainment economy has adjusted to this fundamental transformation in our consumption habits – I call it a transformation because it has happened slowly but surely over several decades. And while the link isn’t obvious yet, it’s a large part of the reason you’ve been walking out of cinemas thinking “is it just me or were movies better a few years ago”. While I can’t surely say movies were better a few years ago, why, in an increasingly creative, technologically advanced society would viewers be left feeling this way post a movie experience?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The explanation for this lies in, you guessed it, boredom. Also to an extent, discovery and recommender systems but we won’t get into that now. To solve for boredom at scale, we have to appeal to the lowest threshold for stimulation. This objective to appeal to the lowest common denominator for stimulation quickly becomes a defining factor of our consumption habits. When Youtube launched in 2006 later to be acquired by Google, it signalled the start of a shift in consumable entertainment. User-generated entertainment was never before a comparable form of media for the masses. People didn’t watch vlogs and live streams while they ate dinner, they watched old school Tv shows and movies. But Youtube was successful because it was one of the first to address the quantity of entertainment required to “quench” boredom at scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Youtube and subsequent platforms like TikTok are naturally able to provide the lowest common denominator across the board – “there is something for everyone” – with the sheer quantity and diversity of user generated content (UGC) on these platforms. Hollywood movies though, don’t work on the function of quantity. Rather they work on high-quality production and creative output. Hollywood had to address the challenge of vying for eyeball time in an increasingly saturated ‘boredom market’. To do this, Hollywood had to begin considering what platforms like Youtube were doing, providing a quick dopamine hit whilst servicing the lowest common denominators that would attract the most people. Hollywood’s take on this has manifested into today’s mainstream film industry. This takes the form of ‘PG’ movies appealing to younger, broader audiences, through to the one-liners in marvel movies that seem to hit just right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One other clear example of this is the influx of reboots over the last few years. Here, nostalgia is the common denominator these movies are targeting instead of focusing on the creation of new content. <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens </em>is probably a good example of this, basically a play by play of <em>A New Hope</em> – the first movie in the Star Wars franchise to release in the 1970s.</p>



<h3>How Quibi failed to read the room</h3>



<p>Quibi, Hollywood’s poster child for short-form video content, has been created for a mobile-only audience. It claims it competes with “free” forms of video like Youtube and TikTok that target viewers with time and attention constraints. This offering rests upon the assumption that viewers on current UGC platforms would prefer higher quality production.</p>



<p>If I Imagine the pitch-room for Quibi seed round investment – the pitch would have gone something like this. “We’re time poor/attention-deficit and addicted to the drip-drip release of dopamine that our smart-phones deliver unto us. As our consumption patterns arc away from the past – we are ever in search of easier to consume, easier to enjoy doses that slot into the (apparently) smaller spaces of discretionary time in our lives or minds – Youtube/TikTok have shown how hungry the people are for these short bursts of escape – but user-generated content can’t fill that gap at the scale and quality we can”</p>



<p>What QuiBi failed to understand is that the transformation in our consumption pattern wasn’t about short-form content with high-quality production but about fulfilling the need for stimulus created by boredom. In actual fact, our consumption patterns had fragmented into two formats. The first is “Hollywood” style productions, high-quality story driven content that requires greater cognitive participation (immersion). The second is lower quality production or user-generated content that we equate with easy, effortless consumption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anecdotally, you can abandon a YouTube video halfway and not feel dissatisfied for having wasted five minutes on it – a perk of non-immersive content. Comparatively, it would be difficult to abandon the type of high production content found on Quibi – where you’ve already committed to participating cognitively and are anticipating immersion – without feeling a little cheated of time and effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Immersion requires the cognitive expense of dedicating a set amount of time and a certain mindset to consume that content. This cognitive expense is at odds with the youtube or TikTok model, where spontaneous discovery and consumption also equate to spontaneous abandonment of that content without dissatisfaction. If Quibi wanted to replicate the spontaneous discovery and consumption, their focus should have been on scaling quantity that allows for spontaneity rather than spending 100,000 USD per minute of video. Imagine if there were 80,000 or 800,000 pieces of content rather than 8,000?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So then the absurdity of the following statement is apparent:</p>



<p>“We’re competing against free,” Jeffrey Katzenberg says referring to the likes of youtube and social media platforms like TikTok. “We have to offer something that is meaningfully, measurably, quantifiably, creatively different. They don’t know how to do what we do, with all due respect,…”</p>



<h3>Hollywood: Where tried and tested formulas often outweigh the cost of creative risks</h3>



<p>The lowest common denominator is easier to identify on YouTube where stimulus is dictated and served by ‘market’ forces, basically the consumption demands of users. On the other hand, Hollywood relies more heavily on a commercial push strategy informed by the smaller sample set of feedback available in audience scores. The cost of identifying the nature of demand is significantly larger in the latter compared to the throwaway cost of a YouTube production. Producers can easily move from one youtube video to the next without losing an arm and a leg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high cost of production in Hollywood doesn’t afford the same luxury, the same applies for Quibi’s production value. This then exacerbates a reliance on more obviously popular tropes, reboots are an easy out given that the particular world, plot or characters are already loved by audiences. This pushes production towards tried and tested formulas which are replicated year on year, where funny one-liners from marvel movies are a hallmark of Hollywood production now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where optionality was limited in the 90s, early 2000s or any time before to the TV and Cinema, taking punts on new formats, stories or original productions seemed a less risky endeavour. In today’s world, there is far too much optionality and much slimmer margin for error.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I know, I know, at this point you want "Just Ship It" to be an actual person so you could punch it in the face. As an Indie Maker, that sentence can be super frustrating because it's tired, it's cliche, and your response is always "HEY! You don't understand... it's not that easy".  </p>&nbsp;<p>I agree, it's not easy, but it's always the right thing to do. </p>&nbsp;<p>Here's why.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started building an app on 01.01.2018. It was New Year's Eve and we just had the crappiest night ever. Yes, imagine a night <em>so bad</em> that at midnight you decide "you know what, fuck it, I'm gonna work on WEB DEVELOPMENT".<br>That bad.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The MVP was ready in a few days. I'm not that good of a coder, it's just a simple app. The 0.0.1 alpha version was more than ready. I could've released it, share it with a couple of people, and call it a day. I could've done that with every single version that I made, at any point from 2018 until now. I just wanted to add one more thing. One more feature. Just this one more thing and people will like it. One more screen and everything is gonna make sense. I swear, just this one last thing and it's ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>BAM, last moment decision from the world's biggest dumbass:
"People wouldn't use this if it doesn't have a proper native mobile app for it. Time to learn React Native and spend a few months on that 🤦️"   </p>&nbsp;<p>God, if time machines were real, past-Kitze would be shoved in a toilet so hard right now. </p>&nbsp;<p>After 2 years of development, juggling between the fucking horror that's the web platform, React Native, Expo, GraphQL, bitching about how there's no ideal tech stack, the good old jQuery and Filezilla days, switching to other projects, releasing <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other apps</a>, losing passion, finding passion, coming back to the app, etc. etc. etc...  </p>&nbsp;<p>I just dropped it.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was still using it but I stopped developing it and just dropped the idea of releasing the app, ever.</p>&nbsp;<p>After a while, I was using it, but I realized that I'm missing a lot of features, so I'd either have to go back to developing it, or I'd have to find an alternative.   </p>&nbsp;<p>And boy did I find one.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was scrolling their landing page and I was happy and furious at the same time. Someone solved the problem that I was solving. It was like someone literally read my mind and started coding. WHAT.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I have previously sent a video of my app to a couple of people (closest I came to shipping it) so I started getting suspicious if someone actually shared the video of my app with these people because they were solving literally the same problem, and they most of the features that I had.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started getting this overwhelming happy, sad, and panicky feeling. I literally cannot explain how I felt while scrolling their page.</p>&nbsp;<p>One moment I am scrolling their list of features giggling like a little kid with a 48$ bill in a candy store (yea I know 48$ bills don't make sense, but JavaScript doesn't make sense and you're still using it), one moment I want to find these people and THROW THEM IN A PIT OF LIONS.   </p>&nbsp;<p>FUCK.    </p>&nbsp;<p>It's not their fault. I was just slow. I didn't ship on time. I'm gonna go ahead and tattoo "JUST SHIP IT" on my forehead. Nah I wouldn't be able to see it there. On my arm maybe. Nvm, let me go back to scrolling their landing page.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Fuck. They have solved everything that I wanted to solve, and WAY more. Hey, maybe I should be happy? I don't have to code anymore. Yay!? No more web platform? BLISS. Oh crap... the world is never gonna see my app though. But at least I don't have to see React Native anymore. NICE! Wait... BUT I WASTED SO MUCH TIME ON IT. FUCK.  A bunch of mixed feelings.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Here comes the saddest part, so grab a pack of tissues.   </p>&nbsp;<p>After a little bit of hesitation, I made an account. I watched the videos in their help center. Every time I caught myself smiling about a clever way they implemented something I slapped myself. NO. Bad Kitze. You shouldn't like this. THEY'RE COMPETITORS. <em>sigh</em> Sure buddy, whatever you tell yourself. Competitors to a shitty codebase sitting on your hard drive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>For 2 frickin' years, I thought it's too early to release my app because it's clunky, buggy, it's missing features, blah, blah, blah. No one would ever use it, right? I was so wrong.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started using their app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Even though they were working on it for the past few years it's still slow, buggy, and super unpolished, it doesn't matter, because they shipped.   </p>&nbsp;<p>Their mobile app is terrible and it needs 10 seconds to sync. It doesn't matter, they shipped. And I'm looking forward to every single update they release.</p>&nbsp;<p>Their backlog of things to do is huge, but it doesn't matter, they ship every single week, and the app is growing along with the community.  </p>&nbsp;<p>"But Kitze, even though tHeY sHiPpEd no one would pay for something unpolished and broken, right?"  </p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, Indie Hackers. So clever, yet so naive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Today my 30-day trial has expired. A tear rolled down my cheek for every single digit of my credit card that I entered in their app. I am officially not only a subscriber, but also a fan. Every time I'll get a payment notification it's gonna feel like stepping on a lego ... glued to a knife. My bank might as well change the notification from "You have paid 5$ to ThatCompany" to "You never shipped, loser".   </p>&nbsp;<p>My app is officially dead.  </p>&nbsp;<p>99% of you are in the same boat right now, but hopefully just a few weeks into your project. Don't be a dumbass like me. Take a breath, roll your eyes at the cliche saying, but please...  </p>&nbsp;<p>Just Ship It.  </p>&nbsp;<p>P.S I would totally release and show you my app but ... it's not ready yet.  </p>&nbsp;<hr><p>Thanks for reading this! I wrote another article about <a href="https://kitze.io/posts/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my successful shipping story</a>, so I'd appreciate if you give it a read!</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

This pop-up was appearing on all pages, even on pages with no audio or video. To find out, I did a bunch of source code analysis and found out.</p><p>Reddit’s source code uses bundling and minification, but I was able to infer that in <code>./src/reddit/index.tsx</code>, a script was conditionally loaded into the page. If the <code>show_white_ops</code> A/B test flag was set, then it loaded another script: <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js</a>. That script loads <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js</a> (although it appears to test for a browser bug involving running JSON.parse with null bytes, and sometimes loads <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/JSON-main.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/JSON-main.js</a> instead, but I haven’t analyzed this file (it looks fairly similar though), and also does nothing if due to <em>another</em> browser bug, <code>!("a" == "a"[0])</code> evaluates to true).</p><p>The purpose of all of this appears to be both fingerprinting and preventing ad fraud. I’ve determined that <code>udkcrj.com</code> belongs to <a href="https://www.whiteops.com/">White Ops</a>. I have infered this from the name of Reddit’s feature flag, and mentions of White Ops which is a “global leader in bot mitigation, bot prevention, and fraud protection”. They appear to do this by collecting <strong>tons</strong> of data about the browser, and analyzing it. I must say, their system is quite impressive.</p><p>Back to the DRM issue, it appears that the script is checking what DRM solutions are available, but not actually using them. However, just checking is enough to trigger Firefox into displaying the DRM popup. Specfically, it looks for Widevine, PlayReady, Clearkey, and Adobe Primetime.</p><p><code>main.js</code> does a bunch of other interesting things, but there’s so many that I’ve written <a href="https://smitop.com/post/whiteops-data">a whole seperate blog post</a> about all of the ones I found.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170810"><em>The World in Which IPv6 was a Good
Design</em></a>. I’m still
pretty proud of that article, but I thought I should update it a bit.</p>
<p>No, I’m not switching sides. IPv6 is just as far away from universal
adoption, or being a “good design” for our world, as it was three
years ago. But since then I co-founded a company that turned out to be
accidentally based on the principles I outlined in that article. Or
rather, from turning those principles upside-down.</p>
<p>In that article, I explored the overall history of networking and the
considerations that led to IPv6. I’m not going to cover that ground
again. Instead, I want to talk about attitude.</p>
<h3 id="internets-interoperability-and-postels-law">Internets, Interoperability, and Postel’s Law</h3>
<p>Did you ever wonder why “Internet” is capitalized?</p>
<p>When I first joined the Internet in the 1990s, I found some
now-long-lost introductory tutorial. It talked about the difference
between an internet (lowercase i) and the Internet (capital I). An
internet is “any network that connects smaller networks together.” The
Internet is… well… it turns out that you don’t need more than one
internet. If you have two internets, it is nearly unavoidable that
someone will soon figure out how to connect them together. All you need
is one person to build that one link, and your two internets become one.
By induction then, the Internet is the end result when you make it easy
enough for a single motivated individual to join one internet to
another, however badly.</p>
<p>Internets are fundamentally sloppy. No matter how many committees you
might form, ultimately connections are made by individuals plugging
things together. Those things might follow the specs, or not. They might
follow those specs well, or badly. They might violate the specs because
everybody else is also violating the specs and that’s the only way to
make anything work. The connections themselves might be fast or slow, or
flakey, or only functional for a few minutes each day, or subject to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPRNet">amateur radio regulations</a>, or
worse. The endpoints might be high-powered servers, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/industries/little-known-story-first-iot-device/">vending machines</a>,
toasters, or satellites, running any imaginable operating system. Only
one thing’s for sure: they all have bugs.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Postel’s Law, which I always bring up when I write
about networks. When I do, invariably there’s a slew of responses
trying to debate whether Postel’s Law is “right,” or “a good idea,”
as if it were just an idea and not a force of nature.</p>
<p>Postel’s Law says simply this: be conservative in what you send, and
liberal in what you accept. Try your best to correctly handle the bugs
produced by the other end. The most successful network node is one that
plans for every “impossible” corruption there might be in the input
and does something sensible when it happens. (Sometimes, yes,
“something sensible” is to throw an error.)</p>
<p>[Side note: Postel’s Law doesn’t apply in every situation. You
probably don’t want your compiler to auto-fix your syntax errors,
unless your compiler is javascript or HTML, which, kidding aside,
actually were designed to do this sort of auto-correction for Postel’s
Law reasons. But the law does apply in virtually every complex situation
where you need to communicate effectively, including human
conversations. The way I like to say it is, “It takes two to
miscommunicate.” A great listener, <em>or</em> a skilled speaker, can resolve
a lot of conflicts.]</p>
<p>Postel’s Law is the principle the Internet is based on. Not because Jon
Postel was such a great salesperson and talked everyone into it, but
because that is the only winning evolutionary strategy when internets
are competing. Nature doesn’t care what you think about Postel’s Law,
because the only Internet that happens will be the one that follows
Postel’s Law. Every other internet will, without exception, eventually
be joined to The Internet by some goofball who does it wrong, but just
well enough that it adds value, so that eventually nobody will be
willing to break the connection. And then to maintain that connection
will require further application of Postel’s Law.</p>
<h3 id="ipv6-a-different-attitude">IPv6: a different attitude</h3>
<p>If you’ve followed my writing, you might have seen me refer to IPv6 as
“a second internet that not everyone is connected to.” There’s a lot
wrapped up in that claim. Let’s back up a bit.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170810"><em>The World in Which IPv6 was a Good Design</em></a>,
I talked about the lofty design goals leading to IPv6: eliminate bus networks,
get rid of MAC addresses, no more switches and hubs, no NATs, and so on.
What I didn’t realize at the time, which I now think is essential, is that
these goals were a <em>fundamental attitude shift</em> compared to what went
into IPv4 (and the earlier protocols that led to v4).</p>
<p>IPv4 evolved as a pragmatic way to build <em>an internet</em> out of a bunch of
networks and machines that existed already. Postel’s Law says you’d
best deal with reality as it is, not as you wish it were, and so they
did. When something didn’t connect, someone hacked on it until it
worked. Sloppy. Fits and starts, twine and duct tape. But most
importantly, nobody really thought this whole mess would work as well as
it turned out to work, or last as long as it turned out to last. Nobody
knew, at the time, that whenever you start building internets, they
always lead inexorably to The Internet.</p>
<p>These (mostly) same people, when they started to realize the monster
they had created, got worried. They realized that 32-bit addresses,
which they had originally thought would easily last for the lifetime of
their little internet, were not even enough for one address per person
in the world. They found out, not really to anyone’s surprise, that
Postel’s Law, unyielding as it may be, is absolutely a maintenance
nightmare. They thought they’d better hurry up and fix it all, before
this very popular Internet they had created, which had become a
valuable, global, essential service, suddenly came crashing down and it
would all be their fault.</p>
<p>[Spoiler: it never did come crashing down. Well, not permanently. There
were and are still short-lived flare-ups every now and then, but a few
dedicated souls hack it back together, and so it goes.]</p>
<p>IPv6 was created in a new environment of fear, scalability concerns, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">Second System
Effect</a>.
As we covered last time, its goal was to replace The Internet with a New
Internet — one that wouldn’t make all the same mistakes. It would have
fewer hacks. And we’d upgrade to it incrementally over a few years,
just as we did when upgrading to newer versions of IP and TCP back in
the old days.</p>
<p>We can hardly blame people for believing this would work. Even the term
“Second System Effect” was only about 20 years old at the time, and
not universally known. Every previous Internet upgrade had gone fine.
Nobody had built such a big internet before, with so much Postel’s Law,
with such a variety of users, vendors, and systems, so nobody knew it
would be different.</p>
<p>Well, here we are 25 years later, and not much has changed. If we were
feeling snarky, we could perhaps describe IPv6 as “the String Theory of
networking”: a decades-long boondoggle that attracts True Believers,
gets you flamed intensely if you question the doctrine, and which is
notable mainly for how much progress it has held back.</p>
<p>Luckily we are not feeling snarky.</p>
<h3 id="two-internets">Two Internets?</h3>
<p>There are, of course, still no exceptions to the rule that if you build
any internet, it will inevitably (and usually quickly) become connected
to The Internet.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sitting there when it happened, but it’s likely the very
first IPv6 node ran on a machine that was also connected to IPv4, if
only so someone could telnet to it for debugging. Today, even “pure
IPv6” nodes are almost certainly connected to a network that, if
configured correctly, can find a way to any IPv4 node, and vice versa.
It might not be pretty, it might involve a lot of proxies, NATs,
bridges, and firewalls. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently">it’s all
connected</a>.</p>
<p>In that sense, there is still just one Internet. It’s the big one.
Since day 1, The Internet has never spoken just one protocol; it has
always been a hairy mess of routers, bridges, and gateways, running many
protocols at many layers. IPv6 is one of them.</p>
<p>What makes IPv6 special is that its proponents are not content for it to
be <em>an internet</em> that connects to The Internet. No! It’s the chosen
one. Its destiny is to be The Internet. As a result, we don’t <em>only</em>
have bridges and gateways to join the IPv6 internets and the IPv4
internet (although we do).</p>
<p>Instead, IPv6 wants to eventually run directly on every node. End users
have been, uh, <em>rather unwilling</em> to give up IPv4, so for now, every
node has that too. As a result, machines are often joined directly to
what I call “two competing internets” — the IPv4 one and the IPv6
one.</p>
<p>Okay, at this point our terminology has become very confusing. Sorry.
But all this leads to the question I know you want me to answer: Which
internet is better!?</p>
<h3 id="combinatorics">Combinatorics</h3>
<p>I’ll get to that, but first we need to revisit what I bravely called
<a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170704">Avery’s Laws of Wifi Reliability</a>, which are
not laws, were surely invented by someone else (since they’re mostly a
paraphrasing of a trivial subset of CAP theorem), and as it turns out,
apply to more than just wifi. Oops. I guess the name is wrong in almost
every possible way. Still, they’re pretty good guidelines.</p>
<p>Let’s refresh:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rule #1: if you have two wifi router brands that work with 90% of client
devices, and your device has a problem with one of them, replacing the wifi
router brand will fix the problem 90% of the time. Thus, an ISP offering both
wifi routers has a [1 - (10% x 10%)] = 99% chance of eventual success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule #2: if you’re running two wifi routers at once (say, a primary router and
an extender), and both of them work “correctly” for about 90% of the time each
day, the chance that your network has no problems all day is 81%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Rule #1, which I call “a OR b”, success compounds and failure
rates drop.</p>
<p>In Rule #2, which I call “a AND b”, failure compounds and success
drops.</p>
<p>But wait, didn’t we add redundancy in both cases?</p>
<p>Depending …</p></div></div>

<p>I see Tailwind being used by a lot of people. I totally get why it’s so popular. It looks great, the design choices are sensible, and you have copy-pastable code that reliably renders in the same way.</p>



<p>It nets you results quickly which feels nice and rewarding. I think Tailwind is a perfect framework for two kinds of situations:</p>



<ol><li> people who don’t want to learn CSS</li><li>people who want a standardized look and want to copy paste from an external library (i.e. Tailwind UI)</li></ol>



<p>I mostly wanted to shut up about Tailwind, and I hoped that people would realize it should be avoided after a while. But that doesn’t seem to be happening. So I think I have to fight the fight and talk about why you should not use Tailwind.</p>



<p>I have had a lot of thoughts about Tailwind, and most of these thoughts come from a place of being the code maintainer of a large scale web application codebase. So mind you, when I am talking about regret in the title, I am talking about a <strong>big web app context</strong> where your code is <strong>going to be maintained for years to come</strong>.</p>



<p>I am not talking about your Sunday side project. I am talking about real, big work® projects here. I am talking about maintaining something that has a lot of complexity that many people will work on for years to come.</p>



<p>You might be tasked with choosing a CSS architecture for that. And you might have heard about this framework called Tailwind. It’s popular right now and it seems to be the 2020 choice.</p>



<p>You look at the website and you see this nice framework that promises you that things are going to be cool in Tailwind land. And you might be thinking: cool, let’s try that.</p>



<p>I urge you to reconsider your options. I would advise you <strong>to not use it.</strong></p>



<p>I really don’t know why Tailwind got so popular over the last year. I think it’s because it does a <strong>lot</strong> of things right. Surely if the authors can make $1.8M in preorders for Tailwind UI, something must be up. But at a fundamental level, I think its ideas are wrong and lead to problems, and I am going to explain why.</p>



<p>The main problem is that the kind of code you are creating with Tailwind, especially on large scale applications, is the kind of code that you’re going to have to swap out in a few years. Why? Because it’s unmaintainable at best. I will explain below.</p>



<h3>An API on top of an API</h3>



<p>Tailwind is a framework that heavily relies on utility classes. Utility classes are classes that typically do one single thing e.g. <code>.flex</code> makes a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> have <code>display: flex</code>. Utility classes create an API on top of what is already a declarative API (CSS itself).</p>



<p>This can lead to problems when</p>



<ol><li>the original API (CSS itself) might change in the process, so now you have a mapping problem</li><li>the mapping itself is not that great, and has bugs on its own</li></ol>



<p>To dive into situation 1, let’s think about how maybe CSS grid will have an evolution in its syntax. Now you don’t just have to update your code, but also the in-between framework (Tailwind).</p>



<p>To dive into an example of situation 2: I was on a project a while ago where somebody mapped Flexbox to utility classes <em>wrongly </em>(i.e. the mapping contained obvious mistakes) and that code had made into production, was versioned, and we couldn’t change it. I thought that was very painful.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Tailwind’s coding style creates its own problems, which you then have to solve</h3>



<p>There’s also a deeper problem: because you are essentially recreating the CSS API with utility classes, you end up with a huge file. The current Tailwind utilities.css file is 1.8 megabyte and contains 80 000 lines of code.</p>



<p>Tailwind proponents will tell you that you can remove unused CSS with Tailwind’s tooling. And this is exactly the problem that I want to talk about: now you have to solve a problem that’s inherent to the framework, adding complexity to your project.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://routify.dev/">Routify</a> and Svelte Discord channels I routinely see people struggling to get the toolchain around Tailwind working. So many people struggling with a toolchain that is totally unnecessary is a real problem. Removing code that shouldn’t be there in the first place should not be necessary.</p>



<h3>Sidenote: I’m not against utility classes</h3>



<p>Surely it feels nice to be able to quickly write flexbox things in a declarative way, and it has it’s uses. I’ve happily wrote declarative flexbox code in the past to quickly set up layouts. I am not against utility classes at all. It’s quite handy to set up layouts quickly with utility classes. I can also totally relate to the idea of designing in the browser with a set of utility classes.</p>



<p>When I do web app layouts we typically have a lot of different panes and panels going on in your app with varied logic about how they should resize. In a prototyping or an early app phase it’s super handy to not have to write a specific (BEM) component for everything and just build things out with utility classes.</p>



<p>But you have to be careful with utility classes. Because what you’re essentially doing is building a complication on top of CSS itself.</p>



<p>When you use a utility classes, for example declaring a flex utility on a div, you are doing it in HTML instead of declaring it in CSS this can quickly lead to unmaintainable code.</p>



<p>I use utility classes in one-off situations. Tailwind style code uses utility classes for <strong>everything</strong>. Tailwind lovers will now come back to me with arguments about <code>@apply</code> but this is just throwing more complexity on something that is already complex.</p>



<h3><strong>Adding complexity to complexity</strong></h3>



<p>Tailwind’s HTML code is fine for very simple projects (which will now have the drag of a whole toolchain to purge unused selectors but OK).</p>



<p>But let’s just imagine you have a bit of a bigger project, with a basic app layout that is working, with a few panels and a few buttons.</p>



<p>You now have to update the code for the next requirement – a bit of responsiveness. The UI has to change according to a breakpoint. So you add some Tailwind breakpoint classes to the thing you are making.</p>



<p>You realize your specific situation requires a very specific breakpoint. So you change your Tailwind config to add this breakpoint. You kind of realize it would be easier to just write the breakpoint directly in CSS, but you want to do things the Tailwind way.</p>



<p>If you would do things the regular CSS way, your media queries list basically lives in two worlds: the tailwind config and a local CSS file. And now you’ve lost your breakpoint structure. So you have to adhere to the Tailwind style.</p>



<p>And then let’s say you have a new situation: dark mode has to be supported. So suddenly your colors all have to change according to the dark mode logic. So now you add a bunch of classes to whatever you are creating again… you look at your button code and you see that the color of the button is directly in the HTML (<code>gray-100</code>). And the opposed color is actually called <code>gray-900</code> in your design system. So now you add a class to the button for the dark situations. And you now realize that there are 7 variants of your button in your codebase and they all have different class combinations.</p>



<p>Now, with the previous responsive example, and this dark thing piled on top of it, you have a sorry mess.</p>



<p>And then you realize that some aspects of what you’re doing would be way easier to handle directly in (S)CSS, using contextual media queries and proper use of the cascade.</p>



<p>Maybe your web app is never going to see the complexity I am talking about. Maybe your apps are not responsive or they don’t support dark mode. But most of my work supports some form of skinnability, is as responsive as possible and needs to be maintained over several yerars.</p>



<p>Putting values on the same class level in HTML is basically destroying the cascade for you. So don’t do it.</p>



<h3><strong>Complexity overload and no proper way to manage it</strong></h3>



<p>The problem with Tailwind is that you end up with an overload of classes in your HTML and no way to manage these.</p>



<p>Tailwind’s creator says it’s not a problem because your code can essentially lives in deep presentational components and it can be abstracted away. But this kind of coding strategy leads to its own problems (e.g. prop drilling)</p>



<p>I’m especially wary of this situation where you have one button that has 6 HTML classes, and then another button that has 5 HTML classes, and another one that has 7 HTML classes. And they’re all different combinations. Now you have to do some serious digging through the codebase to try and bring everything in line, and you’re going to be comparing which of the three buttons have class overlap. Nobody is waiting for that task. And frankly, it’s probably just nog going to happen.</p>



<p>It’s code rot that’s going to happen as soon as you have a few people working on a project with moderate complexity.</p>



<h3>I fear for a Tailwind future</h3>



<p>I already see Tailwind popping up all the time in Javascript articles that have nothing to do with CSS. The authors use it because it’s a quick way to style their tutorial. In the process they’re halving the shelf life of whatever they’re writing, and dirtying up their examples with a boatload of HTML classes.</p>



<p>I fear for the general codebases of web apps when too many people decide that Tailwind is the way to go. Now, on the other hand, this means I’ll have an infinite stream of work to refactor bad codebases to better ones. So I guess I’m not complaining.</p>



<p>Just do yourself a favor and stop using Tailwind.</p>

<p>Historically, US Presidents have entered the White House at a <a href="https://t.co/v8DD3uCI85?amp=1">median age of 55</a>. </p>



<p>Trump was the oldest ever to become president. If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day. </p>



<p>We are going the wrong way.</p>



<p>Bernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn’t it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidate’s are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.</p>



<p>In terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614567339?casa_token=L29u1CmuY6gAAAAA%3AHwbJVxHMdjeQxoe1A1UcjnE-sTEy1YhbSyhlQic62On1RpUMpAd0JKWh7H2IvB3tj5dmN8nw2g4x&amp;journalCode=pssa">study </a>in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).</p>

<p>There are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person’s 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.</p>



<p>Politics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).</p>



<p>It is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.</p>



<p>Here are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:</p>



<ul><li>Microsoft’s Satya Nadella (52) </li><li>Apple’s Tim Cook (59) </li><li>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (56) </li><li>Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai (47) </li><li>Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang  (48) </li><li>Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (36) </li><li>Tencent’s Ma Huateng (48) </li></ul>



<p>The median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading bothing of those efforts.</p>



<p>The point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team’s quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn’t mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40’s to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America. </p>

            <p>PARIS -- 
	Potentially fatal COVID-19 complications in the brain including delirium, nerve damage and stroke may be more common than initially thought, a team of British-based doctors warned Wednesday.</p>
<p>
	Severe COVID-19 infections are known to put patients at risk of neurological complications, but <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/doi/10.1093/brain/awaa240/5868408" target="_blank">research led by University College London</a> suggests serious problems can occur even in individuals with mild cases of the virus.</p>
<p>
	The team looked at the neurological symptoms of 43 patients hospitalised with either confirmed or suspected COVID-19.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank">Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
	They found 10 cases of temporary brain dysfunction, 12 cases of brain inflammation, eight strokes and eight cases of nerve damage.</p>
<p>
	Most of those patients with inflammation were diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) -- a rare condition typically seen in children after viral infections.</p>
<p>
	"We identified a higher than expected number of people with neurological conditions such as&nbsp;brain inflammation, which did not always correlate with the severity of respiratory symptoms," said Michael Zandi, of UCL's Queen Square Institute of Neurology and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
<p>
	The research, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/doi/10.1093/brain/awaa240/5868408" target="_blank">published in the journal Brain</a>, showed that none of patients diagnosed with neurological problems had COVID-19 in their cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that the virus did not directly attack their brains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Perhaps crucially, the team found that ADEM diagnoses "not related to the severity of the respiratory COVID-19 disease".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"Given that the disease has only been around for a matter of months, we might not yet know what long-term damage COVID-19 can cause," said Ross Paterson from UCL's Queen Square Institute of Neurology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"Doctors need to be aware of possible neurological effects, as early diagnosis can improve patient outcomes."</p>
<p>
	With more than 11 million confirmed infections worldwide, COVID-19 is known to cause a variety of health complications in addition to lung infection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	While the results of the study suggest that brain complications could be more common among virus patients than first thought, experts said it didn't mean that brain damage cases were widespread.</p>
<p>
	"The scrutiny that the pandemic attracts means it would be very unlikely that there is a large parallel pandemic of unusual brain damage linked to COVID-19," said Anthony David, director of UCL's Institute of Mental Health.</p>

<p>If you see the letters GNU in a systems design, and that system intersects with cryptography, I can almost guarantee that it will be badly designed to an alarming degree.</p>



<p>This is as <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">true of GnuPG (and PGP in general)</a> as it is of designs like the proposed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html">GNU Name System</a> (IETF draft) and cryptographic libraries like GnuTLS and libgcrypt. In fact, I cannot recall single GNU-branded cryptography project that isn’t a roaring dumpster fire.</p>



<p>I will elaborate.</p>



<h2>Problems with the GNU Name System’s Cryptography</h2>



<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNS (GNU Name System) uses an unconventional construction for zones:</p>



<blockquote><p>A zone in GNS is defined by a public/private ECDSA key pair (d,zk), where d is the private key and zk the corresponding public key. GNS employs the curve parameters of the twisted edwards representation of Curve25519 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>] (a.k.a. edwards25519) with the ECDSA scheme ([<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC6979">RFC6979</a>]).</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-zones">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 2</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This is beyond weird: Going out of your way to use the edwards25519 curve from RFC 7748, but not use the Ed25519 signature algorithm, but still choosing to use deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979).</p>



<p>(If you’re lost, I wrote about digital signature algorithms in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/26/a-furrys-guide-to-digital-signature-algorithms/">a previous blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>The authors acknowledge the unconventional nature of their design choice in section 9.1 of the RFC draft:</p>



<blockquote><p>GNS uses ECDSA over Curve25519. This is an unconventional choice, as ECDSA is usually used with other curves. However, traditional ECDSA curves are problematic for a range of reasons described in the Curve25519 and EdDSA papers. <strong>Using EdDSA directly is also not possible, as a hash function is used on the private key which destroys the linearity that the GNU Name System depends upon.</strong> We are not aware of anyone suggesting that using Curve25519 instead of another common curve of similar size would lower the security of ECDSA. GNS uses 256-bit curves because that way the encoded (public) keys fit into a single DNS label, which is good for usability.</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-cryptography">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 9.1</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><s>The bold statement (my emphasis) is nonsense: In any design that uses digital signature algorithms, your system should map a private key (some opaque byte string) to a public key (some other opaque byte string) and signatures should also be opaque byte strings. The inclusion of a hash function under the hood of the signature algorithm is a moot point, especially since RFC 6979 also uses HMAC-SHA2 to generate deterministic nonces, thereby rendering their choice of RFC 6979 a contradiction of their stated goal.</s> Edit: <a href="#update-2020-07-09">see below</a>.</p>



<p>Using Ed25519 with a 32-byte private key (instead of a 64-byte private key) is also trivial. To wit: Libsodium offers <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#key-pair-generation">crypto_sign_seed_keypair()</a> for this purpose.</p>



<p>But even worse: ECDSA is less secure and slower than EdDSA, even when you use the same curves, due to how the algorithms are implemented. The authors of the RFC do not defend this design choice beyond this hash function non sequitur.</p>

<h4 id="update-2020-07-09">(Update) “But They Need Hierarchical Keys”</h4>



<p>After I initially posted this, Redditor Steve132 informed me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hnlyp1/gnu_a_heuristic_for_bad_cryptography/fxdbez4/">I overlooked the reason they made this design decision</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Take a look at Section 6.1&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion</a></p><blockquote><p>From here, the following steps are recursively executed, in order: Extract the right-most label from the name to look up. Calculate q using the label and zk as defined in Section 4.1.</p></blockquote><p>So then if you go to section 4.1, they do h=H(&lt;address string&gt;), (r,R) is some root keypair, then they do C (a child public key), C=hR, then q=H(C).</p><p>the idea behind the calculation of q is to use the root public key to derive a child public key from ONLY the root public key, exploiting the linearity property that in elliptic curves, if bG=B, then (b+s)G=(sG+B)</p><p>This allows a third party to derive child public keys without any knowledge of the private keys for the root. This technique is also used in bitcoin’s bip32 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032</a>) for ‘unhardened’ derivation scheme.</p><cite>Part of Steve132’s correction</cite></blockquote>



<p>I fully admit, I didn’t absorb this detail in my first pass of the RFC draft. It wasn’t clearly spelled out in Section 9 (which aims to justify their cryptography decisions), and I didn’t read the other sections as carefully. This was my mistake.</p>



<p>However, even with this explanation in mind, my original point that this design choice is both unconventional and unnecessary still stands, because <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967?section=abstract">BIP32-Ed25519</a> already exists (albeit, it still needs <a href="https://forum.web3.foundation/t/key-recovery-attack-on-bip32-ed25519/44">a carefully designed implementation</a> to be secure against active attackers). </p>



<p>Therefore, the GNU Name System developers didn’t need to roll their own design, they could have used one that’s already seen real-world deployment instead. Why take on unnecessary risk?</p>



<p>Furthermore, trying to push through an implementation of ECDSA over edwards25519 isn’t just unnecessary and weird, it’s also probably dangerous, as Thai Duong noted:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I don't agree that ECDSA is worse than Ed25519 – both have pros and cons — it takes courage to implement ECDSA over Edward25519. Do you know if they published any code?  This unfortunate marriage may introduce fun and unique bugs</p>— thaidn (@XorNinja) <a href="https://twitter.com/XorNinja/status/1281041946538938368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>Thai Duong–author of the BEAST attack against SSL/TLS, among <a href="https://github.com/google/tink">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/google/wycheproof">things</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, all cryptography development can be said to be dangerous, but there are other problems fundamental to the GNU Name System design that makes any departure from a well-tread path very suspect.</p>



<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNU Name System project doesn’t stop there. It further throws <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">IND-CCA2 security</a> out the window and specifies encrypting with AES and TwoFish in a cipher cascade, using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.</p>



<p>The authors do not even attempt to defend this decision. Typically this happens when the authors do not understand the risks involved. I sincerely doubt they’ve heard the words “adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack” in the course of their self-study.</p>



<p>(Because, y’know, attackers will surely never be able to replay UDP traffic if a runtime exception occurs because of corrupted data.)</p>



<h4>“Why Is This Bad?”</h4>



<p>Cipher cascades are usually the result of “we want to defend against a backdoored or broken cipher”. Bear in mind, the cipher itself is rarely the first part of a cryptosystem to be broken.</p>



<p>On that note, TwoFish isn’t <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/09/so-you-want-to-use-alternative-cipher/">the worst choice</a> of a cascade partner for AES, but I’d prefer a design that employed a different paradigm (since AES is a SPN permutation block cipher, an ARX-based stream cipher like Salsa20 or ChaCha seems reasonable).</p>



<p>AES is a boring choice, because it’s the industry standard. I’m not <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">particularly fond of AES</a> (due to it not being fast and constant-time in pure software implementations), but if you use it in an authenticated mode (AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-EAX, AES-OCB3, … I dunno, Poly1305-AES? Just use an AEAD mode!), it’s fine.</p>



<p><strong>Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is not an authenticated mode.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re publishing a cryptography design in 2020 that fails the <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>, you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>



<h4>“But They Use Digital Signatures”</h4>



<p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/">Cough.</a></p>







<h2>Other GNU Projects</h2>



<p>If you want to learn about why GnuPG (and the PGP ecosystem in general) is terrible, I recommend <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">Latacora’s takedown</a>.</p>



<p>GnuTLS is an SSL/TLS library created by the same people who created (and then abandoned) libmcrypt, which was the scourge of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions">bad cryptography in the PHP ecosystem</a> for many years (until it was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral">finally excised in PHP 7.2</a>). Consequently, the project’s <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html">CVE history</a> should be no surprise.</p>



<p><strong>Quick story:</strong> Many years ago, a few timing attacks were discovered in libgcrypt by regular chatters in Freenode’s ##crypto channel. This led a lot of us <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gcrypt-devel/2015-November/003618.html">to look at libgcrypt for more bugs</a>.</p>



<p>The general consensus of the ensuing IRC discussion was, roughly, “We probably shouldn’t try to fix them all, because a) that’s way too much effort because there’s too much badness and b) this library will be a ripe target for upcoming cryptanalysis researchers to get their first papers published for many years”. And, indeed, the attack papers that have come out over the years that affect libgcrypt <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432">haven’t disappointed</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, at the time this happened, I was garbage at writing C (and somehow even less confident than capable) and barely making ends meet, so “drop everything and volunteer to fix all the libgcrypt badness” wasn’t a tenable option for me. And since the world is largely moving away from GnuPG and libgcrypt, it honestly isn’t worth the effort trying to fix all the bad when an easier fix is “use something good instead”.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>If you see the letters GNU anywhere in a project that intersects with cryptography–except for its public license–it’s almost certainly an error-prone cryptographic design.</p>



<p>Or, as my friend Kye calls it:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The Dunning-GNUger Effect.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What To Use Instead?</h2>



<p>To replace GPG, you want <a href="https://age-encryption.org/">age</a> and <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>.</p>



<p>To replace GnuTLS or libgcrypt, depending on what you’re using it for, you want one of the following: s2n, OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or Libsodium.</p>



<p>For embedded systems, BearSSL is a good options today and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hdc4o6/new_results_on_gimli_fullpermutation/fvmpnym/">libhydrogen v2</a> will be an attractive choice when it’s released.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>If you are responsible for managing a bunch of your organization’s AWS
resources, you probably know how annoying it is to debug various
deployment-related issues, only to learn that someone accidentally messed with
your setup, yet again. Which you probably resolved by navigating your
command-line history like a maniac (because you don’t use Ansible and have to
<code>Ctrl+R</code>, as you also forgot to put down the setup instructions ;)). We’ve
been there, too. And this is what we learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should use Ansible and deploy your environment with a playbook, and</li>
<li>You should make the most of it by taking advantage of both Ansible’s
built-in mechanisms and the modules that allow you to detect
configuration drift, and correct it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our dear sysadmins and DevOps engineers, this post is for you. Stay with
us and read along!</p>
<h2 id="ansible-and-compliance-how">Ansible and compliance? How?</h2>
<p>According to Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, compliance is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact of obeying a particular law or rule, or of acting according to an
agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see what the above definition has got to do with Ansible and the AWS
Ansible Collection, let’s briefly descend to the world of Ansible playbooks
and modules.</p>
<h3 id="its-all-about-state">It’s all about state</h3>
<p>Ideally, playbook tasks describe the <strong>desired final state</strong> of a managed
system - for example, configuration of an AWS EC2 instance. An Ansible module
takes that description and performs the necessary steps to ensure that state.</p>
<p>It’s important to emphasize that it’s easy to write playbook tasks describing
the final state of a managed system when Ansible modules adopt <strong>declarative
APIs</strong>. As a consequence, we can treat playbook tasks as “the rule”, “the
policy”, or simply as something we need to be <em>compliant with</em>. Perhaps even
more importantly, we can treat Ansible playbooks as simple diagnostic tools to
help us detect when we are not compliant anymore, so that we can mitigate the
situation.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Ansible, all of this probably rings a bell to you
already. Was your first thought the value of the <code>changed</code> variable that you
see every time you run your playbooks? Or perhaps even Ansible’s
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_checkmode.html" title="Official check mode documetation"><code>--diff</code> and <code>--check</code> modes</a>? Indeed, this post is about all of
them!</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a practical example demonstrating how you can use the
modules from the AWS Ansible Collection to <strong>detect and resolve configuration
drift</strong>.</p>
<p>To follow along easier, make sure you have completed the tutorial about the
basic usage of the collection in <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/aws-ansible-collection-basic-usage/" title="Intro post about AWS Ansible Collection">Getting Started with the AWS Ansible
Collection</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure you have Steampunk AWS Ansible Collection version 0.8.3 installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="set-up-the-desired-state">Set up the desired state</h2>
<p>Let’s start by creating a simple AWS enviromnent that will support running an
imaginary app.  The environment will comprise:</p>
<ul>
<li>an EC2 instance named <em>steamy-server</em>;</li>
<li>a network interface named <em>steamy-eni</em> to attach to the EC2 instance,
which we secure with the VPC’s default security group.</li>
</ul>
<p>We created a playbook called <a href="https://github.com/xlab-si/steampunk-aws-examples/blob/master/enforcing-compliance/setup.yaml" title="Ansible playbook for setting up a demo environment">setup.yaml</a> for spinning up this
environment. And then, we run</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook setup.yaml --diff
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We can see two <code>changed</code> tasks, corresponding to the two newly created AWS
resources. Thanks to the <code>--diff</code> flag which instructs the modules to report
the differences they made, we also get a nice visual indication of what
exactly the modules changed. The red-colored lines show the previous state of
the AWS resource  (before a specific task ran), while the green ones show the
current state, i.e. after the task ran.</p>
<p>We can interpret the diff output above as “the instance and network interface
didn’t exist before, so we created them, and they are now configured as
shown”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically, we can’t take support for diff mode for granted, as it is up to
individual modules to implement it. This is why some tasks make changes but
report no differences despite running <code>ansible-playbook</code> with <code>--diff</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a-word-about-idempotence">A word about idempotence</h3>
<p>Can you guess what will happen if we run the same command again? Let’s try it
out!</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook setup.yaml --diff
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>PLAY [localhost] ************************************************************

TASK [Create the steamy-server instance for running a simple app] ***********

</code></pre><p>This time around, we see that there was nothing to be done - the Ansible
modules already did all the hard work when they were invoked the first time.
So no changed tasks, no updates done, and no diff output shown. With other
words, the current state of our managed AWS resources is compliant with the
state described by the tasks in our <code>setup.yaml</code> playbook. This demonstrates
another important aspect related to Ansible’s declarative approach, which is
that playbook tasks should ideally be idempotent.  If the state of the managed
resource is aligned with the desired state as described by the playbook tasks,
running the playbook again will not affect its state.</p>
<p>But how can all of this be useful to me, you wonder? Glad you asked, time to
spice things up a bit!</p>
<h2 id="deviate-from-the-initial-state">Deviate from the initial state</h2>
<p>Now, let’s put ourselves in the shoes of an adversary that wants to tweak the
state of our AWS resources to their taste. In practice, this could be done
accidentally, or worse - with malicious intent. But we’ll be doing it solely
for the purpose of demonstration. Disclaimer: we won’t actually be doing
anything dangerous, we’ll only make some simple configuration changes that
should indicate that configuration has drifted if we take <a href="https://github.com/xlab-si/steampunk-aws-examples/blob/master/enforcing-compliance/setup.yaml" title="Ansible playbook for setting up a demo environment">setup.yaml</a>
as our baseline for compliance.</p>
<p>To make the changes, we could open the AWS Management Console and manually
modify some properties of the EC2 instance or the network interface that we
created with [setup.yaml][setup` earlier. But since we’re all about
automation, let’s put the tweaks in an Ansible playbook called
<a href="https://github.com/xlab-si/steampunk-aws-examples/blob/master/enforcing-compliance/tweaked-setup.yaml" title="Playbook simulating an adversary">tweaked-setup.yaml</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a recap of what we’ll be tweaking with this playbook:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll downgrade our <em>steamy-server</em>’s CloudWatch monitoring to the
basic level and modify it’s shutdown behavior;</li>
<li>We’ll update the value of <em>steamy-server</em>’s <code>env</code> tag.</li>
<li>We’ll create a new security group called <em>dangerous-secgroup</em> with
some suspicious permissions;</li>
<li>We’ll associate this <em>dangerous-secgroup</em> with the network interface
attached to the <em>steamy-server</em> instance, and we’ll also disable
source/destination checking for the network interface;</li>
</ul>
<p>Sneaky, right? ;)</p>
<p>If we ran <code>ansible-playbook tweaked-setup.yaml</code> now, we would end up with
three changed tasks. But since we’re learning about Ansible diff mode, let’s
do:</p>
<pre><code>$  ansible-playbook tweaked-setup.yaml --diff
</code></pre>
<p>and we end up with three changed tasks, plus the diff output consistent with
the tweaks described above:</p>

<p>I love using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>. At my previous job, we managed our infrastructure entirely with Terraform: tens of thousands of resources spread across several cloud providers. The benefits of infrastructure-as-code and Terraform, in particular, are massive, but well known. While I still consider Terraform the best tool of its kind, this article describes some pain points that my team and I encountered as power users. I hope it can lead to some discussion about ways to improve.</p>

<p>All of these are relevant as recently as Terraform v0.13.0-beta3, July 2020.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="#code-reuse-is-limited">Code reuse is limited</a></li>
<li><a href="#type-system-is-too-rigid">Type system is too rigid</a></li>
<li><a href="#upstream-development-frustrating-priorities">Upstream development: frustrating priorities</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is part one in a series about Terraform. Part two, detailing some Terraform practices that we found effective, will be up shortly.</p>

<h2 id="refactoring-is-difficult">Refactoring is difficult</h2>

<p>Terraform code is unwieldy to refactor. Even giving a resource a new <em>internal</em> name is a hassle. Here’s our simple Terraform definition:</p>

<pre><code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "images.bigco.com"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now it’s a month later, and we’re adding our second bucket, so let’s change our Terraform code to use a more specific name:</p>

<pre><code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "images_bucket" {
  bucket = "images.bigco.com"
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we naively try to make this innocuous-looking change, Terraform will want to delete and recreate the bucket. We probably all understand why that’s the case, and it helps us appreciate how wonderful the concept of <code>terraform plan</code> is, but it’s ludicrous to have no serious facility for doing this smoothly. <code>terraform state mv</code> exists, but you need to run that separately, outside the plan/apply lifecycle. If you need to do this for ten environments, it’s a lot of work.</p>

<p>And that’s the easy case. Moving across module boundaries is harder, especially if you want to move the resources from the module into the root of the state (spoiler: <code>state mv</code> can’t do it). Moving across state boundaries is harder still. While the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/mv.html">documentation</a> mentions moving to a different state file, there’s no support for hooking it up to an already-existing state in S3 (for example). The tool is not at all user friendly or convenient.</p>

<p>The silver lining is that Terraform state is a simple JSON file, so it’s easy to write your own tooling around it. My team had occasion to do several refactors where we pulled individual projects’ resources out of a monolithic state and into their own states, once for each of our environments. Trying to orchestrate that with <code>state mv</code> would have been an awkward mess, but writing a simple Python script to pull state from S3, modify it, and push it back, was not too bad (if you do this, you’ll also want to remove the state checksum from DynamoDB).</p>

<p>You’re never going to nail the module and state boundaries correctly on your first pass (or ever?). Refactoring is inescapable. It needs to be more convenient. It would be great if there was some way to signal to Terraform “hey, this resource used to have a different address”. Something like this seems reasonable:</p>

<pre><code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "images_bucket" {
  bucket = "images.bigco.com"

  lifecycle {
    old_addresses = [
      "aws_s3_bucket.bucket",
      "module.images_bucket.aws_s3_bucket.bucket",
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="code-reuse-is-limited">Code reuse is limited</h2>

<p>Terraform’s main tool for code reuse (i.e. a chunk of resource definitions that can be reused with different inputs) is the <code>module</code> (symlinks may also be useful in some situations, but I haven’t used them for this). Modules are limited in some ways.</p>

<h4 id="it-s-awkward-to-pin-module-versions">It’s awkward to pin module versions</h4>

<p>You <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1439">can’t do interpolation in a module’s <code>source</code> parameter</a>. So if a dozen modules should all be pointing at the same revision of your <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-create-reusable-infrastructure-with-terraform-modules-25526d65f73d">modules git repository</a>, there’s no clean way to update all those references in one place. My team had a Makefile target, which we ran manually, that used <code>find</code> and <code>sed</code> to update all the references.</p>

<p>Leaving the module source unpinned is not an option I’d be comfortable with because it’s a vector for un-source-controlled drift that can be easily avoided.</p>

<h4 id="can-t-partially-apply-modules">Can’t partially apply modules</h4>

<p>The biggest problem we’ve faced with the module system is the inability to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial application</a> (in the computer science sense). In essence, it would be nice to simplify a module’s interface by binding a bunch of common parameters. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>module "service_a" {
  source = "..."

  name = "service_a"

  environment_variables = merge(
    local.environment_variable_defaults,
    {
      THING = "1",
    },
  )

  vpc_id     = local.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = local.subnet_ids
  ...
}

module "service_b" {
  source = "..."

  name = "service_b"

  environment_variables = merge(
    local.environment_variable_defaults,
    {
      THING = "2",
    },
  )

  vpc_id     = local.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = local.subnet_ids
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>These services have, say, fifteen parameters being passed in, and they only differ in one or two. There should be some more expressive way of writing them so that only those two unique values are prominent. Instead, you’re stuck copy/pasting a bunch of boilerplate, and editing in the unique values. That’s error-prone and a maintenance burden.</p>

<p>There’s an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/locals.html">analogy</a> between Terraform definitions and a conventional programming language: a set of Terraform definitions (a module) is like a function, with TF variables being inputs to the function, TF locals being local variables, and TF outputs being return values. The extension of that analogy to this use case is partial application, where you give a module some of its inputs, it binds those values and you get back a module with only the rest of the inputs. Terraform doesn’t support it.</p>

<p>Ideally, we’d be able to define some sort of a “submodule” like this:</p>

<pre><code>submodule "service" {
  source = "..."

  environment_variables = merge(
    local.environment_variable_defaults,
    ?
  )

  vpc_id     = local.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = local.subnet_ids
}

module "service_a" {
  source = submodule.service

  name = "service_a"

  environment_variable_overrides = {
    THING = "1",
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can’t use a proper module for this, because it doesn’t have access to its parent’s locals (which seems right). Notice the unsolved problem here of how to refer to those environment variable overrides in the submodule. This isn’t a fully-formed proposal.</p>

<p>Here are some ways we’ve dealt with this.</p>

<h5 id="code-reuse-workaround-1-big-map-of-config">Code reuse workaround 1: big map of config</h5>

<p>You can pass a big map of config as input to the module, rather than individual variables. That map can be defined as a local, and can include all the common values. Each service can merge on top of it to provide its overrides.</p>

<p>It’s a hack, but it works to reduce boilerplate. There are a couple of serious drawbacks, though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Terraform’s <code>merge()</code> only performs a shallow merge. This is surprising behavior, and can lead to subtle bugs. You can work around it if you know about it, but the workarounds are often awkward. There’s an <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/25032">open PR</a> adding a <code>deepmerge()</code> function.</p></li>

<li><p>When anything in the map is “not known until after apply” (e.g. an attribute of a resource that hasn’t been created yet), the entire map is considered “not known until after apply”. For example, if our config map looks like</p>

<pre><code>config = {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc.id,
  thing_enabled = true,
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the module does something like</p>

<pre><code>resource ... {
  count = var.config.thing_enabled ? 1 : 0

  ...
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>then this will fail to plan if the VPC doesn’t already exist because <code>var.config</code> contains something (the VPC id) which isn’t known yet, and so <code>var.config.thing_enabled</code> is not known until after apply. This is subtle and unexpected, and the error messages you’ll see from it are cryptic. But it’s very easy to do by accident once some resources are created already. Then the next time you try to bootstrap a new state (e.g. a new environment), you’ll find that it won’t plan successfully.</p>

<h5 id="code-reuse-workaround-2-generate-terraform-definitions-from-templates">Code reuse workaround 2: generate Terraform definitions from templates</h5>

<p>In some instances, it can make sense to generate Terraform code from templates. On my team, there were a few places that we did this, and we checked those generated files in to git as regular <code>*.tf</code> files (their names started with <code>generated.</code> to make it obvious). This can work well, but adds some process overhead (pre-processing, knowing which files to not edit, CI validation that the files haven’t been edited).</p>

<p>There are also some TF preprocessors, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/terraformpy/">terraformpy</a>, but I haven’t tried any.</p>

<h2 id="type-system-is-too-rigid">Type system is too rigid</h2>

<p>In Terraform before 0.12, everything was a string, and that was ugly (<code>count = "${var.enabled ? 1 : 0}"</code>). Terraform 0.12 added proper booleans, numbers, even some data structures like sets and maps. That was an improvement. However:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When defining a module’s contract (i.e. specifying the types for its input variables), it’s not currently practical to use <code>map</code> or <code>object</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>map</code> type requires all values in the map to have the same type, which can be useful in a some cases (environment variable values are always strings), but not very often, in my experience.</p>

<p>The <code>object</code> type is a map without that restriction on value types, but if you’re going to say a variable’s type is <code>object</code>, you need to specify all the names of the keys and the types of their values. Okay… that doesn’t sound so bad. And <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19898">all of the keys are mandatory</a>. What!? This makes <code>object</code> useless as a variable type, where you’ll often want to just pass in one value as an override and leave some set of defaults.</p>

<p>If you put these types on your variables, you’ll fail to plan in all sorts of surprising ways. You’ll try to pass <code>alarm_config = { enabled = true, threshold_seconds = 30 }</code> to your <code>map</code> variable and fail to plan because the value types aren’t uniform. So you’ll change it to an object, then realize that you can’t omit the <code>period_seconds</code> parameter which was supposed to optionally merge on top of a default. It’s an uphill battle. These types, in this context, are so rigid that they cause a lot of …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

Check out the previous post to understand the problem/solution because this post examines its implications, particularly in the
modern dating world.</p><hr><h2>Modern Times</h2><p>A fascinating consequence of the internet is how much closer it has brought the problem of finding your soulmate, as well as how
much closer the assumptions in the original Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) are true in reality. The <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/galeshapley.pdf">original paper</a>
from 1962 has assumptions that neither worked then nor now, but it started the discussion on how to best pair people for marriage and any entities for any purpose in general.</p><p>The original SMP assumes that everybody knows everybody so that each person can rank everyone in the opposite gender.
This was a clearly unrealistic assumption back in 1962, however, nothing has been a more unifying resource
in the history of humanity than the interent.</p><p>While the SMP may have been an interesting experiment to replicate in a small closed off town 25 years ago, people are finding other people
at a much greater rate and from a larger and more diverse group, allowing the SMP to simulate real life more accurately.</p><p>The table below shows the top three ways people have met their partner by decade in the past 50 years:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decade / Rank</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1960’s</td><td>Through Friend (19%)</td><td>Through Family (13%)</td><td>Primary / Secondary School (12%)</td></tr><tr><td>1970’s</td><td>Through Friend (21%)</td><td>Through Family (13%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (10%)</td></tr><tr><td>1980’s</td><td>Through Friend (18%)</td><td>Through Coworker (16%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (14%)</td></tr><tr><td>1990’s</td><td>Through Friend (18%)</td><td>Through Coworker (15%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (12%)</td></tr><tr><td>2000’s</td><td>Through Friend (19%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (11%)</td><td>Through Coworker (10%)</td></tr><tr><td>2010’s</td><td>Met Online (19%)</td><td>Through Friend (17%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (15%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href="https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst2017">Source</a></p><p>The 2010’s showed a monumental rise in online dating, and the number of people who have met their significant other online is only
going to continue to grow. Online dating is interesting in particular because it provides us with a breadth of
information on dating patterns in the modern age.</p><p>I wanted to see how the SMP actually worked when run through some simulations, and how well it actually models real life.</p><p>In order to benchmark some variants of the SMP that model real life more accurately, let's start off by simulating the classic problem scenario
proposed over 50 years ago.</p><h2>Simulations</h2><h3>Classic</h3><p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/Arvind-Arik/stable-marriage-problem/blob/master/classic/stable_marriage_problem_classic.py">Python implementation</a>
of the classic SMP solution in order to calculate some initial results on what a 'perfect' world would be like.</p><p>The assumptions in the classic SMP scenario is that everybody knows each other and people's preference towards the opposite
group is randomly and uniformly distributed. This basically means that everybody has an equal chance to be liked by someone of the opposite gender.</p><p>The standard algorithm was run with different population levels and the number of iterations to find a stable
matching as well as the preference rank each person matched with on average was recorded.</p><p>The latter point is shown in the second graph
and is portrayed as the difference between the rank of what every girl got, minus the rank of what every guy got (notice
the title indicates an advantage for men, this is because in pretty much all scenarios the man came out higher in the matching, a.k.a

by a small amount, the amount of iterations it takes to solve the matching problem grows exponentially.</p><ul><li>It shows how the difficulty of finding a stable matching between two people grows at a disproportionate rate when population
of the community increases. </li></ul></li><li><p>The second graph shows the difference in preference ranks for each group of people. It is calculated by examining each
matching and seeing where the woman lies on the man's preference rank and where the man lies on the woman's preference rank.</p><ul><li><p>Since the only difference between the two groups is which group 'proposes' first, we see as an outcome that men have an
advantage in this scenario in that, compared to women, they end up with a partner higher on their preference list.</p></li><li><p>The advantage starts off high, and seems to converge at around 13-14% advantage for men</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Preference Manipulated by Dating Pattern</h3><p>There are some pretty large assumptions being thrown around in the classic SMP scenario.</p><p>In my opinion, the biggest
assumption made is that preference sets are randomly assigned and uniformly distributed. This means that everyone's preference
is not correlated with one another's, and that for large enough populations everyone's attractivness is roughly the same
(based on how the opposite gender ranks).</p><p>I don't know about you, but I certainly don't have an online following of girls gushing over me like Timothée Chalamet does.</p><hr><p>As mentioned before, one of the interesting ramifications of the rise in online dating is the amount of data we can aggregate from it.</p><p>OkCupid periodically releases dating information in <a href="https://theblog.okcupid.com/">their blog</a>, and some time ago they released
some interesting numbers in how men perceive attractiveness of the opposite sex versus women. The following charts outline the discrepancy:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/okcupid-inbox-attractive/">Source</a></p><p>From the data (specifically the dotted lines) we can see two things:</p><ul><li><p>Men's ranking of women pretty closely resembles a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>.
This is easy to conceptualize as essentially half of women in mens eyes are above average and half are below.</p></li><li><p>Women's ranking of men is more closely related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto distribution</a>, also known as the 80-20 distribution.
With respect to this problem, it means that if we could quantify attractiveness for every guy, the top 20% of men hold 80% of cumulative attractiveness
in the eyes of women. In an unrelated note, Bernie seems a lot more appealing right about now.</p></li></ul><h3>So how do we change our problem?</h3><p>We can tweak our original code so that each gender's preference rankings are more aligned with their respective distribution of opposite
sex attractiveness.</p><p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/Arvind-Arik/stable-marriage-problem/blob/master/distribution/stable_marriage_problem_distribution.py">updated code</a>. Take a
look in particular about the shuffling code for preference lists. The new shuffling code applies the normal distribution for guys
and pareto distribution for girls.</p><p>I ran the same simulations again with the updated code and it produced the following results: </p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="SMP Distribution" title="SMP Distribution" src="https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ff59c/smp_distribution.png" srcset="https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/5243c/smp_distribution.png 240w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ab158/smp_distribution.png 480w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ff59c/smp_distribution.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>This is the same type of data analyzed from the previous simulation, but with much different results:</p><ul><li><p>The first graph shows a similar <code>O(n²)</code> complexity of the algorithm, but the constant value for the graph's equation is much higher</p><ul><li><p>The standard SMP for 1000 pairings took around 7,000 iterations to complete - with the new simulations, the SMP algorithm
runs in about 21,000 iterations, or 3 times as much</p></li><li><p>This makes sense in terms of the distributions. Since more women now have the same few men in the top 20% of their preference lists, the number
of conflicts increases when running the algorithm and causes a lot more men to be dumped and subsequently resume their search for a better soulmate</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The second graph is particularly interesting and shows a marked increase in the 'advantage' men have simply for being the proposers</p><ul><li><p>The increase here stabilizes at around 38-39% and is again around 3 times larger than the advantage men had in the classic SMP scenario</p></li><li><p>This increase also makes sense because of the discrepancies in preferences between men and women. If the average man was paired with the average woman,
the OkCupid data shows that the man would see the woman as average in attractiveness while the woman would see the man as below average attractiveness</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>What Did We Learn From This?</h2><p>There's obviously many gross inaccuaries when trying to reasonably model the dating world, but the SMP offers an initial glimpse as to why dating is so difficult
and why certain tropes exist.</p><h3>Why it's always better to be the initiator</h3><p>A clear callout from the analysis is that men end up having the advantage when everyone is paired. There's two main reason for this:</p><p><strong>1) Societal Expectations:</strong></p><p>Men are traditionally assumed to be the first group to make a move and it is why the men in the code simulations make the first move.
Because men make the first move, the algorithm benefits men as it works in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy behavior</a> to get them the
best possible partner.</p><p>With respect to the problem, any gender can theoretically be the one to make the first move and reap the benefits demonstrated by the SMP simulations.</p><p><span>

    </span> <em>⠀From WikiHow, I can't really draw this well</em></p><p><strong>2) Preferences of Men vs Women:</strong></p><p>The discrepancy in preferences for the opposite sex between men and women is what caused the stable pairing advantage for men to jump from 13% to 39%. While
all other things are held constant, it was the preferences that caused this jump because it all ends up relating to how people <em>perceive</em> attractiveness.</p><p>The OkCupid data shows that women have higher standards for men than men have for women, and this is the main driver for why there is a larger male advantage
when the SMP algorithm incorporated the gender attractiveness distributions.</p><p>I am in no way concluding that women are unhappier with men in their relationships - there are a million other factors including personality, status and chemistry

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      
      <p>“What would you say if I asked you to design me a service capable of responding to millions of user requests every second and latency was critical?”</p>

<p>“Umm…that you have to solve this problem at work. But you’re out of ideas, and are looking to interviewees for suggestions”</p>

<p>That’s the actual response I gave the interviewer the first time I was asked a design question. He had a good laugh. But then still made me design the service.</p>

<p>In the decade since I’ve lost track of how many hours I’ve spent in the interview room, on both sides of the table. I’ve worked at Microsoft, Google, and Stripe, and received offers from many other companies. As I interviewed, I realized one thing: standard interviewing advice falls woefully short.</p>

<p>What good does it do to practice coding problems for weeks if your mind goes blank in an interview room? How can you show your “best self” if you’re too afraid to let it out? Everyone says to be wary of the recruiters, but what if you weren’t?</p>

<p>I tested the answers to these questions multiple times (sometimes by accident). Turns out conventional wisdom gets you conventional results. But you can do better. Interviewing is a skill and anyone can learn it.</p>

<p>For some reason no one talks about these challenges with interviewing. But I’ve found some principles that help me over and over again:</p>

<p>We’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using recruiters to your advantage</li>
  <li>Going to real interviews for practice</li>
  <li>Being open to learning during interviews</li>
  <li>Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting</li>
</ul>



<p>Their voice sounds so friendly and helpful when you chat with them on the phone. “Zain, I’m looking forward to seeing you when you come for your interview!” Clearly it’s all an act, past-me assumed. I was sure they were secretly judging me, deciding if I was good enough to work at the company.</p>

<p>And they do judge. But not in the way I was expecting.</p>

<p>Recruiters aren’t evaluating you technically, not by the time you pick up the phone anyways. Their decision on whether you have the technical chops to be worth interviewing was made well before that call. If you’re being offered an interview: Congratulations, you’ve already passed that bar</p>

<p>Now the recruiter wants to work with you. Their whole job is to, you know, recruit. They know that you statistically have poor interview prep skills, and they’re happy to help fix that flaw. Why discard a strong candidate who can’t interview well? They’ll level the playing field by helping everyone show their best selves when interviewing.</p>

<p><strong>How can you take advantage of this?</strong></p>

<p>Ask them questions! Things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“What are the company values that would be good to highlight during the interview?”</li>
  <li>“I’m interested in X, Y, &amp; Z. What other companies are hiring?” (Only try this if the recruiter reached out to you first, they work for a recruiting agency, and you haven’t had your interview yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>And you can be forthright about any problems you run into:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you get sick the day before the interview, call up the recruiter and ask to reschedule. They want to test you when you’re at your best!</li>
  <li>Work pressures left you with no time to prepare? You can still try rescheduling. At worst they’ll say “sorry, we can’t do that”. It will not hurt your chances of getting in</li>
</ul>

<p>Your mad technical skills no longer matter to them. If anything, humility and an openness to learning will show you in the best light.</p>



<p>You need to build up your interview skills. LeetCode is great, but it doesn’t come close to the real thing. Try to interview at actual companies as much as possible. And don’t limit yourself to the companies you care about.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to deal with pressure</strong></p>

<p>When you’re in a real interview the world changes: You’re locked in a cage with a lion. Every heartbeat is a gorilla bashing to break free. Your mental gears gunk up as your body goes into fight or flight mode. Your clammy hands struggle to write half legible code on the white board. A threat hides behind every shadow. Even an innocuous “Would you like something to drink?” is a nefarious test: do I pick coke or coffee?</p>

<p>You only get that experience in a real interview. And only real interviews teach you how to deal with it. The first interview will kick your ass. So will the second. But once you get a few under your belt you’ll get used to the adrenaline rush. Perhaps enjoy it even. You’ll become a bullfighter, confidently facing down the charging bull. That’s how you get over the fear.</p>

<p>You may even find that these practice interviews are much easier! When the stakes are low that lion doesn’t look so fierce. I’ve found that I perform the best in the interviews where I don’t care about the outcome. I’m much more relaxed and at ease. I can think faster, my brain reaches out to more possibilities. Now, even in important interviews I try to convince myself that I don’t really care. That mindset shift is only possible because I got to experience it in the low stakes games first.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to answer the more ambiguous questions</strong></p>

<p>And what about the questions? After each interview write down all the questions you were asked. The same evening look over the questions while they’re still fresh in your mind. Focus especially on ones which have no clear right answer, such as behavioral and design questions. Think about how you could have responded better. Are there stories from your life you could have referenced? Wait a few days and look at them again. You’ll find better answers.</p>

<p>Each answer you prepare this way becomes a blob of paint on your pallet. Chances are high that you’ll come across similar questions in future interviews. Over time you’ll be able to mix the answers from your pallet to paint a picture demonstrating just how valuable an asset you can be to their company.</p>

<p><strong>Stay open to serendipity</strong></p>

<p>As you do these interviews, you may discover that the “practice” company is actually interesting after all. Recruiters count on that. I’ve had recruiters suggest I interview even when I told them I didn’t care for the company. “Maybe you’ll change your mind after seeing us up close”, they’d suggest.</p>

<p>And I did. More than once.</p>



<p>I learned this one by accident, but boy does it pay off.</p>

<p>I was wandering around the booths with my bag full of swag. My eyes caught a pile of rubik’s cubes being given away by some company I’d never heard of. I wanted one! Of course I couldn’t just go up and ask for it directly, so I went and chatted with the guy manning the booth. His name was Vince. A few minutes later I walked away with my prized rubik’s cube in hand. That evening Vince called me up offering to conduct a full interview loop on campus. I already had a job offer from a company I liked, but I thought “Sure, why not? I could use the experience”</p>

<p>I had no intention of joining the company, they were some boring finance business. There was nothing to lose. So during the interview I felt free to ask any question I wanted. When I thought I got the answer to an interview question wrong, I’d ask “I don’t think I did so great here. What’s the right answer to this problem?” (I wanted to learn the answer for future interviews!). When asked a challenging question I could grin and delight in the problem solving aspect instead of worrying about how badly it would reflect on me. (Remember my smart aleck remark in the intro? That was this interview.)</p>

<p>Turns out they liked that: the next day I had a second job offer. At a significantly higher salary than my first one. Oh, and they wanted to fly me to New York in two weeks for an introduction to the company. I still didn’t want to join, but a free trip to New York? Sign me up! The company’s name: Bloomberg</p>

<p>Bloomberg was a practiced hand at recruiting. They had a full two days of events to leave us starry eyed about the company (I came thiiiiis close to accepting their offer). While there, Vince told me I’d made a great impression by fearlessly asking questions, even when I was stumped.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve stopped hesitating before asking any question in an interview. Let your curiosity run free! Don’t cage it! And as an interviewer, I can attest: sincere interest is always a good sign.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/docjamesw">James Whittaker</a> recommends trying to get a job offer every year, just to make sure you can.</p>

<p>It’s an extremely liberating feeling knowing that even if you lose your job you’ll be able to find another one quickly. That’s a huge stress off your back.</p>

<p>I haven’t been very good about this myself, but every once in a while I’ll accept an invitation from a recruiter (it helps to set up your LinkedIn account). I don’t bother doing any prep for these interviews, at least not initially. Those interviews show me the areas I need to brush up on or where the industry practices are changing.</p>

<p>For example, in a tech screen I did last summer there was some miscommunication and I didn’t realize they expected actual working code. Instead of the usual pseudo code written in a google doc, the interviewer told me to select my language of choice on an online IDE. Now, I don’t have a particular language I consider myself super proficient in. I touch many different tools at work and end up having to use a different language about every 5 months. So even basic things like “create an array” tends to require googling the syntax. Given that, what’s my favorite language of choice? C#, hands down. So I selected that.</p>

<p>What hadn’t occurred to me at the time is that C# is a very verbose language which Visual Studio beautifully automates away the tedious parts of. This online IDE automated nothing. Even for a basic task like creating an array I had to spend precious interview minutes looking up the right package to import and the exact syntax to use. Needless to say, I ran out of time. I crashed and burned there, but it opened my eyes to the way interviews are changing and how I needed to prepare in the future.</p>

<p>Four months later a company called Stripe reached out to me. They also expect you to write working code and even let you use your own IDE. This time I was ready. And …</p></div></div>

        <p>Automated firmware testing on real embedded hardware is what every hardware
company strives to build. The mission is to repeatedly verify that changes to
firmware being merged into master and shipped to customers will not cause
catastrophic failures like power regressions or bootloops.</p>

<p>The problem with automated firmware testing with real hardware is that it’s
<strong>hard</strong>. Not only does the system require a stable firmware to build on top of,
but it will also require extra hardware, like flashers and power supplies, and
software to orchestrate the tests and capture results.</p>

<p>An alternative to building a complicated orchestration system for automated
tests is to use the popular hardware emulator project, Renode, and its built-in
Robot Framework integration. By using Renode in conjunction with GitHub Actions,
we can ensure that every pull-request and commit to master passes all our tests.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, I cover what it takes to build a simple firmware for use with
Renode, how to build and administer tests with Robot Framework, and how to run
these tests within GitHub’s continuous integration system.</p>

<h2 id="automation-testing-for-firmware">Automation Testing for Firmware</h2>

<p>Test automation is the practice of testing software and/or hardware in a
repeatable and scalable way where expected values are compared against actual
values.</p>

<p>There are various forms of test automation, and they are usually run under a
continuous integration system, such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software Unit Tests - Isolated tests that exercise a single module. Usually
run on the host machine and sometimes on an emulator or real device.</li>
  <li>Integration Tests - Tests that exercise a collection of modules that interact
with each other</li>
  <li>End-to-end Tests - Tests that exercise an entire technical stack end-to-end.
These tests would usually communicate with some sort of backend in the cloud
or a mobile phone.</li>
</ul>

<p>These testing approaches are not limited entirely to software, as hardware can
be tested in similar ways. “Hardware unit testing” is a concept where individual
pieces of the larger hardware board are put under test to ensure the chip itself
behaves correctly. Integration tests and end-to-end tests can also be performed
on hardware, but the complexity increases exponentially as more hardware is
thrown into the mix.</p>

<p>A middle ground between host-run tests and hardware tests is testing on an
emulator which emulates the real hardware as much as possible. Renode, by
Antmicro, has become our favorite emulator at Memfault, and its list of support
boards is continually growing<sup id="fnref:renode_boards"><a href="#fn:renode_boards">1</a></sup>. Renode emulates many peripherals
of the board, including the UART, SPI, I2C, RAM, ROM, and GPIO’s.</p>

<p>Renode has a built-in integration with the open-source testing framework called
Robot Framework<sup id="fnref:robot_framework"><a href="#fn:robot_framework">2</a></sup>. Robot Framework is most popular in the web
world, but it is generic and powerful enough to be used for many more use-cases.
It provides the glue between various test scripts, test reporting, and multiple
machines under test.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-shell-for-testing">Using a Shell for Testing</h2>

<p>Whether tests are being run within Renode or on real hardware, there should be a
way to easily run tests on a device.</p>

<p>A common approach is to use a CLI-based shell over serial, which we wrote about
in our post <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell#integration--automated-tests">Building a Tiny CLI Shell for Tiny
Firmware</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is relatively simple.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a test that will execute a series of shell commands on a device.</li>
  <li>After each command or series of commands, the results will be compared
against expected values.</li>
  <li>At the end of the test run, the harness determines whether the test was
successful or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thankfully for us, Renode has several utilities and helpers built-in that we can
take advantage of.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<h3 id="example-repo">Example Repo</h3>

<p>All the code in this post was written for the STM32F429 MCU by ST Micro. While
the examples run fine on the STM32F429i discovery board, they were developed in
Renode, a popular MCU emulation platform.</p>

<p>You can find the complete code example for this blog post in a separate
<a href="https://github.com/memfault/interrupt-renode-test-automation">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/memfault/interrupt-renode-test-automation.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="toolchain">Toolchain</h3>

<p>I used the following tools to build my firmware:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GCC 8.3.1 / GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain as our compiler<sup id="fnref:gnu_toolchain"><a href="#fn:gnu_toolchain">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>GNU Make 4.2.1 as the build system</li>
</ul>

<p>Running automated tests with Renode, unfortunately, requires Python 2.7. To keep
things simple for me, I decided to use a Conda environment to keep this entire
environment isolated.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ conda create -n renode
$ conda activate renode
$ conda install -c conda-forge -c memfault \
      python=2.7 gcc-arm-none-eabi make=4.2.1

$ which arm-none-eabi-gcc
/Users/tyler/miniconda3/envs/renode/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perfect, I now have <code>arm-none-eabi-gcc</code> and <code>python2.7</code> in my path.</p>

<blockquote>

environments for embedded &gt;
development</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out the Renode team packages the application in a
<a href="https://anaconda.org/antmicro/renode">Renode Conda package</a>, but at the time of
writing this post, not all platforms had the latest version released (v1.9,
released in March). For that reason, I chose to install it locally for this
post.</p>

<h3 id="renode--robot-framework">Renode &amp; Robot Framework</h3>

<p>To install Renode, I’ve found the best instructions to be on the
<a href="https://github.com/renode/renode#installation">Renode GitHub Page</a>. In the
example repo, I’ve created a <code>start.sh</code> script which points to my local Renode
installation on my Mac. If you are using another platform, you’ll have to update
this script to point to your own Renode start script.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

sh /Applications/Renode.app/Contents/MacOS/macos_run.command renode-config.resc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To run Robot Framework alongside Renode, we’ll also need to clone the Renode
repository and all of its submodules, as well as install all of the required
Python dependencies.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:renode/renode.git
$ cd renode

# Install Robot Framework and other dependencies
$ pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="docker">Docker</h3>

<p>To use Renode with Robot Framework in CI, it’s best to use the official
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/antmicro/renode">Renode Docker image</a> for running the
tests. If you haven’t already, you’ll want to install
<a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker</a>.</p>

<h2 id="example-firmware-overview">Example Firmware Overview</h2>

<p>This post builds upon previous ideas and examples written on Interrupt. If you
find yourself missing some context, the following posts would be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/intro-to-renode">Cortex-M MCU Emulation with
Renode</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell">Building a Tiny CLI Shell for Tiny Firmware</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than the STM32Cube HAL, I used an open-source MCU HAL called <code>libopencm3</code>
with excellent support for the STM32. It is included as a submodule in the repo.</p>

<p>The primary way we’ll control the firmware is through a CLI shell written
previously and linked above.</p>

<p>With the shell in place, this means that our main loop of the firmware is
simply:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>clock_setup</span><span>();</span>
    <span>gpio_setup</span><span>();</span>
    <span>usart_setup</span><span>();</span>

    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"App STARTED</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// Configure shell</span>
    <span>sShellImpl</span> <span>shell_impl</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>.</span><span>send_char</span> <span>=</span> <span>usart_putc</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>
    <span>shell_boot</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>shell_impl</span><span>);</span>

    <span>char</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>usart_getc</span><span>();</span>
        <span>shell_receive_char</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The supporting <code>*_setup()</code> calls and their implementations can be found in the
other <code>.c</code> files in
<a href="https://github.com/memfault/interrupt-renode-test-automation/tree/master/src"><code>src/</code></a>.</p>

<p>We can build our example firmware by invoking Make.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ make -j4
Building libopencm3
  GENHDR  include/libopencm3/stm32/f4/irq.json
  [...]
  AR      libopencm3_stm32f4.a
  LD    build/renode-example.elf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have our <code>renode-example.elf</code> file which we can load into Renode.</p>



<p>And then we see our firmware’s shell in the UART window of Renode.</p>

<p>
  <img width="700" src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/test-automation-renode/renode-start.png">
</p>

<p>We can interact with it exactly as if it was connected to our computer over USB
serial! This would have made writing and testing the firmware for my <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell">Tiny
Shell</a> post <strong>much</strong> easier. I’m glad
I took the time now to learn Renode for the next time.</p>

<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-robot-framework-test">Anatomy of a Robot Framework Test</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve verified that the firmware works within Renode, it’s time to
think about how we are going to test our firmware. We have two shell commands,
<code>help</code> and <code>ping</code> which are probably useful “sanity” checks that we can test, so
let’s start with those.</p>

<p>If we write <code>ping</code> as a command into our shell, the following is printed:</p>



<p>It makes logical sense to test that this exact text is printed. Although
incredibly basic, this is the code that we are testing within our firmware:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>cli_command_ping</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>argv</span><span>[])</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>shell_put_line</span><span>(</span><span>"PONG"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following is a Robot Framework test file that calls the <code>ping</code> shell command
and expects that <code>PONG</code> is printed.</p>

            <section>
                <p>Encoding URIs* has always been a tough job. What exactly do we need to encode? Why are there sometimes <code>%20</code> and <code>+</code> signs in the URI? Why do we need to encode anyway? The answers to these questions are written in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target="_blank">RFC3986</a>. This article is a practical summary of the RFC.</p>
<p>* Note that URI is just a collective name for both URL and URN</p>

                <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
                <p>These are the summarized steps that need to be taken when encoding and decoding a URI. An extended explanation can be found below this section.</p>
                <h3 id="encoding-and-decoding-uris">Encoding and decoding URIs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Split the URI into its components, based on the <a href="#generic-delimiters">generic delimiters</a>.
                    </li><li>2. Are there scheme-specific (e.g. http, ftp, file) or implementation-specific (a browser or web application) delimiters that need to be used for this URI? *
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Yes, split the components into subcomponents based on the <a href="#subcomponent-delimiters">subcomponent delimiters</a>. 
                            </li><li>b. No, leave it.
                        </li></ul>
                    </li><li>3. Is there a protocol used that subscribes the encoding?
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Yes, use the subscribed encoding by the protocol 
                            </li><li>b. No, use the same encoding as the surrounding text
                        </li></ul>
                    </li><li>4a. <strong>ENCODING</strong>: Encode every component and/or subcomponent with the chosen encoding (i.e. transform it into its percent-encoded hexadecimal pair). Use the <a href="#what-characters-to-encode-and-decode?">table</a> to encode all characters except the "never encode" and (depending on your subcomponent delimiters) the "sometimes encode" characters.
                    </li><li>4b. <strong>DECODING</strong>: Decode every component and/or subcomponent, convert all the percent-encoded octets to their decoded value by using the chosen encoding. 
                </li></ul>

                <p>* The RFC only describes the generic syntax of a URI. All URIs should follow that syntax, but every scheme-specific (e.g. http, ftp, file) or implementation-specific (a browser or web application that handles URIs) syntax can have additional rules about which characters are delimiters. It is therefor always necessary to know the additional delimiting rules to 100% correctly encode and decode.</p>

                <h2 id="the-long-read">The long read</h2>
                <h2 id="breaking-the-uri-into-pieces">Breaking the URI into pieces</h2>

<p>
A URI can be divided into components by certain characters that are used as delimiters. The RFC distinguishes generic delimiters and subcomponent delimiters.
</p>

<h3 id="generic-delimiters">Generic delimiters</h3>
<p>
The RFC reserves certain characters to be used as generic delimiters. Those are: <code>:</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>@</code>. These might seem familiar if we take a look at a simple URI.</p>

<code>
  foo://alice@example.com:8042/over/there?search=bar#nose
  \_/   \___/ \_________/ \__/ \________/ \________/ \__/
   |	  |        |       |        |         |       |
 scheme userinfo  host    port     path     query  fragment

</code>

<p>* In practice it is also possible to have an IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) instead of a registered host name, but for simplicity's sake we leave those out.<br>
** Old URIs can also contain a password in the userinfo <code>alice:password</code>, but that has been deprecated because of security.
</p> 


<p>When processing a URI into its components, a URI should be delimited using the generic delimiters based on a "first-match-wins" algorithm. The first <code>?</code> that is encountered after the path or host indicates the start of the query part. Other <code>?</code> that come after the first occurence, are not considered generic delimiters anymore, but data. This means that the following URI should be processed like this:</p>

<code>
 foo://alice@example.com:8042/ove@r/there;color=red;height=200?name?color=brown&amp;height=300#nose?
 \_/   \___/ \_________/ \__/ \______________________________/ \_________________________/ \___/
  |      |        |       |                  |                               |               |
scheme userinfo  host    port               path                           query         fragment

</code>

<p>Note that the second <code>@</code> (in the path) is treated as data in a path and not as a delimiter between userinfo and host. Same goes for the second and third <code>?</code> in the query and fragment parts.</p>

<h3 id="subcomponent-delimiters">Subcomponent delimiters</h3>
<p>In every component there are possible subcomponent delimiters defined. All the reserved subcomponent delimiters are: <code>!</code> <code>$</code> <code>&amp;</code> <code>'</code> <code>(</code> <code>)</code> <code>*</code> <code>+</code> <code>,</code> <code>;</code> <code>=</code>.</p>

<p>An implementation-specific entity (e.g. an API of a web application) can have additional delimitation rules with characters from the reserved subcomponent set. But this is only a rule of the implementation-specific entity itself. The RFC doesn't specify anything about which characters to use when, it only shows the allowed characters to be chosen as subcomponent delimiters.</p>

<p>Let's say that an API has two additional subcomponent rules. </p>
<ol>
<li>In the path, we distinguish key-value pairs coupled with the <code>=</code> character and delimited by the <code>;</code> character (back in the day the so called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html">Matrix URIs</a>).<br>
</li><li>In the query, we distinguish key-value pairs coupled with the <code>=</code> character and delimited by the <code>&amp;</code> character (used for handling web forms).</li></ol>

<p> Further processing of the path and query component would give us:</p>

<code>
foo://alice@example.com:8042/ove@r/there;color=red;height=200?name?color=brown&amp;height=300#nose?
                                         \___/ \_/ \____/ \_/ \________/ \___/ \____/ \_/
                                           |    |    |     |      |        |     |     |
                                           k1   v1   k2    v2     k1       v1    k2    v2
                             \______________________________/ \_________________________/
                                             |                             |
                                            path                         query

</code>

<p>For processing of URIs it is always necessary to know the components of the URI (determined by the generic delimiters) and the subcomponents if there are any specified (determined by the subcomponent delimiters) by an API for example. Only then can the right semantics be determined.</p>


<h2 id="why-to-encode?">Why to encode?</h2>
<div><p>We would like to express as many characters of every language in URIs, so the whole world can use URIs. This is powerful. But not all applications that need to display URIs and their characters want to implement the complete <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/" target="_blank">Unicode Character Set</a>.</p><p>
Next to that, we've seen that the URI has a certain structure delimited by special characters. We still would like the possibility to use those special characters in a URI as data. In that case, we need to encode them.</p></div>

<h2 id="different-encoding-format">Different encoding formats</h2>
<p>When we determine that a character should be encoded, we should encode it in a percent-encoded hexadecimal pair (a so called percent-encoded octet). There are multiple encoding formats which encode characters from the UCS into 8-bit octets. A few examples are "UTF-8", "UTF-16" or "ISO-8859-1" (not all of them cover the whole UCS). When we want to transform the character <code>æ</code> to the percent-encoded octet in UTF-8, we see in <a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/charset/UTF-8/list.htm" target="_blank">this table</a> that it has two hexadecimal pairs: <code>C3A6</code>. This would result in an encoding of the form <code>%C3%A6</code>.
When we would transform the same letter <code>æ</code> to the percent-encoded octet in "ISO-8859-1", we see in <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/miles/iso8859.html#ISO" target="_blank">this table</a> that it has one hexadecimal pair: <code>E6</code>. The resulting encoding would look like this <code>%E6</code>.</p>

<p>Different encoding formats will generate different percent-encoded octets. Therefor it is always necessary to determine the encoding that is used to encode or decode.</p>

<h2 id="which-encoding-to-use?">Which encoding to use?</h2>
<p>It could be that a scheme or certain protocol enforces the use of a certain encoding. In that case that encoding is used. When there is nothing subscribed, the same encoding should be used as the surrounding text of the URI.</p> 
                    
<h2 id="what-characters-to-encode-and-decode?">What characters to encode and decode?</h2>
<p>When a URI is split into the right components we are ready to encode! For every component there is a defined list of which characters should never be encoded, which characters should sometimes be encoded because of the implementation and which characters should sometimes be encoded because of their special use in certain parts of the URI. In the following table all the characters from the RFC are summarized and separated.</p>

<div><p><strong>How should we read this table?</strong><br>
Column 2: For every component there are certain characters always allowed and should never be encoded.</p><p>
Column 3: If some of the implementation-specific characters are delimiters and you also want to use those characters as data, you should encode those characters. If none of the implementation-specific characters are delimiters, you can use all characters as data and don't have to encode anything. </p><p>
Column 4: There are some characters that have special meaning within a component and should always be encoded when used as data.</p><p>
Column 5: Indicates if encoding into a percent-encoded octet is even allowed within that component. If not, encoding is never done.
</p></div>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>
Let's take a look at an example. We have a UTF-8 encoded website <code>http://foo.com</code> where the HTTP protocol doesn't subscribe any implementation-specific delimiters. We have a page on our website with the name <code>bar&amp;fuz</code> (path), a subpage called <code>(fux*)</code> (path) and a query with the name <code>crux&amp;crux</code>. The URI should be displayed like this:<br>
</p>
<code>
http://foo.com/bar&amp;fuz/(fux*)?crux&amp;crux

          <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/">data</a> over the
          last four and a half years to estimate the rankings of tech companies,

            The accusations of treason stemmed from Google's 2018 release of its

            <a href="https://ai.google/principles">AI Principles</a>;
            because one of the principles involved a commitment to not building
            weapons systems, Google promised to not renew its contract
            providing custom-built drone object tracking AI for a
            <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/23/the-pentagons-joint-ai-center-wants-to-be-like-silicon-valley/">Joint Artificial Intelligence Center</a>
            (JAIC) pathfinder project (Maven).

            <span data-tooltip-content="#footnote_clarafai_maven">8</span>]&nbsp;
            Months later, the company cited potential conflicts with their AI
            Principles, along with their <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-heres-why-were-pulling-out-of-pentagons-10bn-jedi-cloud-race/">missing</a>
            government certifications, as their motivations for walking away

            Defense Infrastructure</a>
            cloud competition. The missing certifications, as well as the
            near-certainty that the award would go to Amazon or Microsoft,
            indicated that Google was not so much
            exiting federal cloud contracting as limiting embarrassment from a
            loss.

This hacker is responsible for stealing sensitive data from governments and companies totaling over 300 in number and across 44 countries. About $1.5 million was realized from this cyber attack.</p><p>The invisible god hacker, also known as Fxmsp has been revealed to be a 37-year old citizen of Kazakhstan, Andrey Turchin.&nbsp; Sometime in 2019, Andrey Turchin ran adverts of source and access codes of top digital companies that he had stolen online.</p><p>Among the advertised companies were Trend Micro, McAfee, and Symantec – this drew the attention of many and that was how he became popular. The invisible god sold these source and access codes for $300,000 – $1 million. Millions of dollars were lost due to this.

Contained in his criminal charges are five felony charges which date back to 2018. It was also around that time that his true identity was discovered.</p><p>Following a ruling by a judge in the Western District of Washington, his charges were unsealed. This was provoked by Group-IB, a cybersecurity company. Last month, Group-IB released a report which revealed the identity of the invisible god hacker, Andrey Turchin.</p><p>Group-IB traced his first appearance on the web to be in 2016. He was tagged as a hacker with so much technical know-how but less business knowledge. By 2017, the invisible god hacker started his advertising with data of hotels and banks.</p><p>Dmitry Volkov from Group-IB described Andrey Turchin as “one of the most prolific sellers of access to corporate networks in the history of the Russian-speaking cybercriminal underground”.

I've thought a lot about dependency management, systems configuration, programming languages, and compilers.</p><p>Again and again, I saw the same fundamental data structure underpinning these technologies: the <strong>directed acyclic graph</strong>. The most frustrating part was modeling graph-based configuration in languages that optimized for hierarchical data structures. That's why I created Virgo.</p><p>Virgo is a graph-based configuration language. It has two main features: edge definitions and vertex definitions. The Virgo configuration file then parses into an adjacency list. You can clearly achieve similar results from adding additional conventions and restrictions on YAML or JSON. Much like YAML optimized for human readability, Virgo optimizes for natural graph readability, editability, and representation. </p><pre><code>// config.vgo

Please open up an issue to start a discussion at </em><a href="https://github.com/r2d4/virgo">https://github.com/r2d4/virgo</a><em>.</em></p><p>Graphs are everywhere in configuration management. One graph that engineers may be familiar with is the <code>Makefile</code> target graph. The <code>make</code> tool topologically sorts the targets that it resolves which lets it build the files in order. Virgo's CLI or Go library allow developers to replicate this feature easily.</p><figure><pre><code>clean -&gt; parser, lexer -&gt; "src files" -&gt; test

test   = `go test-v`
"src files"  = `go build ./...`</code></pre><figcaption>A simple example to build the Virgo CLI tool with the language itself.</figcaption></figure><p>There are two entrypoints to parsing the Virgo file. You can use the Go library found in the same repository to parse the file into a native Go struct. There is also a published CLI binary that exposes the parsing function for other environments.</p><figure><pre><code>package main

<p>SQL is one of the most in-demand technical skills in the workplace today. Developed back in the 1970s, it is still the way we interface most of our data systems today. Regardless of what drag and drop tools come around or what new query paradigms try to overtake it, it has remained.</p>
<p>Many modern database technologies we will talk about today in this article are constantly having to comply with SQL policies vs. SQL needs to be updated.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t to say the SQL landscape hasn’t changed a lot in the past few decades and doesn’t continue to evolve. This is one reason SQL has stuck around so much. It grows and evolves with the times.</p>
<p>This article will summarize some of the major trends currently occurring in the SQL and data analytics world that are impacting teams across the world.</p>
<p>We will be discussing how SQL is becoming more collaborative and open. How the majority of databases our world continues to operate on are open source or switching to open source. As well as bringing up a few technologies you may not have heard of but should watch out for.</p>
<p>With so much going on in the technical world, this will help provide a clear picture of some of the more important changes in the SQL and data world.</p>
<h3><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#sql-is-not-just-for-data-engineers-and-analysts-in-datadriven-companies" name="sql-is-not-just-for-data-engineers-and-analysts-in-datadriven-companies"></a>SQL Is Not Just For Data Engineers And Analysts In Data-Driven Companies</h3>
<p>If you have ever worked at a FAANG or even technology-driven start-up like Instacart, then you have probably realized that data drives everything.</p>
<p>To the point that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-analyst-skills/">analysts</a>, PMs, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.departmentofproduct.com/blog/sql-skills-for-product-managers/">product managers</a>&nbsp;are starting to understand SQL out of necessity. SQL is the language of data and if you want to interact with data, you need to know it.</p>
<p>Do you want to easily figure out the average amount of time a user spends on your product, but don’t want to wait for an analyst? You better figure out how to run a query.</p>
<p>This ability to run queries easily is also driven by the fact that SQL editors no longer need to be installed. With cloud-based data, warehouses come SaaS SQL editors. We will talk about a SaaS SQL editor more in the next section.</p>
<p>However, the importance here is you don’t have to wait 30 minutes to install and editor and deal with all the hassle of managing it.</p>
<p>Now you can just go to a URL and access your team’s data warehouse. This has allowed anyone in the company easy access to their data.</p>
<p>We know both from anecdotal experience as well as the fact that indeed.com’s tracking in 2019 has shown a steady requirement for SQL skill sets for the past 5 years.</p>
<p>Overall, we foresee a future where not just big tech companies are using SQL and analytics to drive good decisions. For that, we will need tools that make it easier for anyone to access their companies data.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#sql-and-analytics-are-becoming-more-collaborative%C2%A0" name="sql-and-analytics-are-becoming-more-collaborative%C2%A0"></a>SQL and Analytics Are Becoming More Collaborative</h2>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TsiJN7mv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bie8pm39rvfcno20u7a8.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TsiJN7mv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bie8pm39rvfcno20u7a8.png?w=3840&amp;ssl=1" alt="Alt Text" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>SQL and analytics are becoming more collaborative. As discussed earlier, getting insights from data is becoming more prolific. That means more people are getting involved in creating queries, analytics, and metrics.</p>
<p>Collaborative work started with products like Google Sheets. The trend has continued to expand into SaaS products like Figma which is collaborative design and&nbsp;<a href="https://popsql.com/?utm_source=seattledataguy">PopSQL</a>&nbsp;which is collaborative SQL.</p>
<p>Technologies like PopSQL offer the ability for your team to collaborate and track your work on queries easily through folders and version control.</p>
<p>Now you don’t have to worry about someone accidentally changing your query on a report or dashboard. Version control, allows you to revert what the query was at a previously saved state. This ensures that your team is constantly on the same page as far as SQL and the logic you are using to calculate your metrics.</p>
<p>You also can easily share queries, update them, fork them, and visualize data.</p>
<p>Also, tools like Figma, Google Sheets, and PopSQL integrate easily with other collaborative tools like Slack. These integrations further allow your team to share charts, queries, designs, and insights with ease.</p>
<p>Your team can easily see what work everyone else is doing, the changes they are making, and understanding why they are making the changes.</p>
<p>With the concept of remote work becoming more and more of a reality for many companies, having tools that make it easy to collaborate will be important.</p>
<p>In the end, technologies like PopSQL are a great step in the direction of self-service analytics because they put the power of querying data outside of just the analysts and the data engineers’ hands.</p>
<h3><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#open-source-remains-the-most-popular-database" name="open-source-remains-the-most-popular-database"></a>Open Source Remains The Most popular Database</h3>

<p>Paid licensed database management systems like Oracle and MSSQL might seem like very popular options for teams to develop upon. However, MySQL and Postgres, two open-source database management systems are currently the most popular options for developers to use.</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eversql.com/most-popular-databases-in-2018-according-to-stackoverflow-survey/">2018</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eversql.com/most-popular-databases-in-2020/">2020</a>&nbsp;by EverSQL, MySQL continues to be the most popular database management system to develop on. Also, Postgres has recently surpassed MSSQL as the second most popular database according to Stackoverflow.</p>
<p>Postgres is what is called the object-relational database management system or (ORDBMS). This takes on similar properties as object-oriented programming where you can have classes and inheritance. Also, some other nifty features about Postgres are that it allows for arrays and has some PubSub abilities.</p>
<p>This shift to open source isn’t new. However, the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migration-complete-amazons-consumer-business-just-turned-off-its-final-oracle-database/">fact is that many companies are starting to drop the Oracles and Microsofts&nbsp;</a>for the free option. They are opting into paying cloud costs vs. paying licensing cost.</p>
<p>Overall, we are seeing a lot of shifts in the choice of database developers are picking.</p>

<p>Although Postgres has often been a common choice for companies choosing to switch from Oracle to an Open Source solution, Postgres was not developed with Cloud infrastructure and complexities in mind.</p>
<p>This forces teams to develop complex cloud infrastructure to manage applications that are being used all across the world.</p>
<p>But, there are other open-source solutions.&nbsp;<a href="https://thenewstack.io/yugabyte-new-database-solve-sql-vs-nosql-dilemma/">In July 2019 YugabyteDB went 100% open source</a>. Now many of you are probably asking(especially if you are in the US), what is YugabyteDB?</p>
<p>YugaByte’s proprietary document-oriented storage format — a heavily customized form of&nbsp;<a href="http://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB</a>, which provides for low-latency access and a high density of data. It runs on popular and known APIs.</p>
<p>YugaByte aim’s to fill in all the gaps. You want a NoSQL database that also is ACID, then Yugabyte is looking to take over that market.</p>
<p>It is looking to solve the problems that developers have when deploying SQL databases like MySQL that require sharding and complex infrastructure to run multi-region systems.</p>
<p>YugaByteDB does so by auto-sharding and loading balancing as well as several other features that take advantage of the cloud’s first approach.</p>
<p>So why is YugaByte in this update if it has been around since 2016?</p>
<p>This is because Wipro ventures invested 30 million in Yugabyte earlier this month. Also, Wipro plans to take Yugabyte’s open-source SQL database to its clients. There are 1000 new possible companies that could be using Yugabyte.</p>
<p>Although Yugabyte is not on EverSQL’s survey results. In a couple of years, with more traction and users it may be. Now, truth be told, a database that solves all the problems of both NoSQL and standard relational databases would be a miracle. So in many ways, we are surprised there isn’t larger adoption.</p>
<p>We will be curious to see if in the next few years Yugabyte is like many of the other miracle technologies promised to solve all of your organization’s problems or if it will disappear like so many others.</p>

<p>In the tech world, there are two main uses of databases: applications, and analytics.</p>
<p>These two major use cases benefit from different database systems as well as different database designs.</p>
<p>In particular, analytical databases that run millions of calculations for thousands of analysts, data scientists, and data engineers at a single company often benefit from having some form of distributed or parallel component. Think Redshift and how it relies on MPP(massively parallel processing).</p>
<p>But there are a lot of new SQL and NoSQL technologies coming into this space.</p>
<p>For example, Starburst, a fork of Facebook’s Presto, received an<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/starburst-collects-42m-in-funding-as-big-data-startup-ramps-up-product-development-channel-expansion">&nbsp;additional $42 million of funding.</a>&nbsp;Starburst is a spin-off of a Facebook open-source project(Presto). Starburst’s goal is to create an enterprise version of Presto since Presto in itself does not have access management, connectors to enterprise systems like Teradata, Snowflake, and DB2, or a management console where users can configure the cluster to auto-scale, for example.</p>
<p>This makes utilizing Presto on its own difficult if not impossible for most companies. This is a shame because Presto allows you to easily run queries across databases without loading the data into a data warehouse.</p>
<p>So the recent funding in Starbursts is great to see. We look forward to seeing where this technology will go and hope that more companies can take advantage of Presto without all the hassle of having to manage all of presto’s complexities.</p>
<p>While we are talking about distributed database systems like Presto, another interesting development this month&nbsp;<a href="http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-0-0.html">was the release of Spark 3.0</a>. With this new version of Spark comes many enhancements. Many of these enhancements have been geared to allow Spark SQL to become more ANSI SQL compliant.</p>
<p>This is an important note. One pattern that seems to remain true is that you can’t get rid of SQL as is. Many tools and technologies have tried to develop their query languages. However, at the end of the day, SQL remains. Unlike many programming languages that have died out.</p>
<p>SQL remains the language of data.</p>

<p>A diff algorithm outputs the set of differences between two inputs. These algorithms are the basis of a number of commonly used developer tools. Yet understanding the inner workings of diff algorithms is rarely necessary to use said tools. Git is one example where a developer can read, commit, pull, and merge diffs without ever understanding the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-repack">underlying diff algorithm</a>. Having said that there is very limited knowledge on the subject across the developer community.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is not to detail how <a href="https://ably.com/">Ably</a> programmatically implemented a diff algorithm across its distributed <a href="https://ably.com/platform">pub/sub messaging platform</a>, but rather to share our research and provide systematic knowledge on the subject of diff algorithms that could be useful to implementers of diff/delta/patch functionality.</p>

<p>For Ably customers like Tennis Australia or HubSpot, <a href="https://ably.com/blog/message-delta-compression">Message Delta Compression</a> reduces the bandwidth required to transmit realtime messages by sending only the diff of a message. This means subscribers receive only the changes since the last update instead of the entire stream. &nbsp;Sending fewer bits is more bandwidth-efficient and reduces overall costs and latencies for our customers. To develop this feature we needed to implement a diff algorithm that supported binary encoding and didn’t sacrifice latency when generating deltas.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-savings-1.png"><figcaption>The benefits of providing deltas for realtime messaging</figcaption></figure><h2 id="diff-algorithms">Diff algorithms</h2>
<h3 id="purpose-and-usage">Purpose and usage</h3>
<p>The output of a diff algorithm is called <em>patch</em> or <em>delta</em>. The delta format might be human readable (text) or only machine readable (binary). Human readable format is usually employed for tracking and reconciling changes to human readable text like source code. Binary format is usually space optimized and used in order to save bandwidth. It transfers only the set of changes to an old version of the data already available to a recipient as opposed to transferring all the new data. The formal term for this is <em>delta encoding</em>.</p>
<h3 id="binary-vs-text">Binary vs. text</h3>
<div><p>There seems to be a common misconception that diff algorithms are specialized based on the type of input. The truth is, <strong>diff algorithms are omnivorous and can handle any input</strong>, as long as the input can simply be treated as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-2.2.2">string of bytes</a>. That string might consist of the English alphabet or opaque binary data. Any diff algorithm will generate a correct delta given two input strings in the same alphabet.</p><p>The misconception that a different algorithm is required to handle binary data arises from commonly used diff/merge tools treating text and binary as if they were actually different. These tools generally aim to provide a human-readable delta, and as such focus on human-readable input to the exclusion of binary data. The assumption is that binary data is not human-readable so the delta between two binary data inputs will also not be human readable, and thus rendering it human-readable is deemed to be too much effort. Equality is the only relevant output in the case of binary diffs, and as such, a simple bit-by-bit comparison is considered to be the fastest and most appropriate solution. &nbsp;This categorization of algorithms by the efficiency of solution causes a partitioning of inputs into different types.</p><p>Another aspect that adds to the confusion is the line-based, word-based, and character-based classification of textual diff outputs produced by diff/merge tools. A diff algorithm that is described as “line-based” gives the impression that it produces “text-only” output, and that this means that it accepts only text input and never binary data inputs. &nbsp;However, line/word/character-based is not a characteristic of a diff algorithm itself; rather, it is an optimization applied to the input before feeding it to the actual diff algorithm. </p><p>Because new lines and spaces have meaning as separators in human-readable text, the diff tool can segment the string based on the hashes of the lines or words in the text. This hash string is much shorter than the original text thus saving time at the cost of reduced granularity of the diff. &nbsp;Additionally, line-based granularity might actually even increase human readability of the diff in some cases.</p><p>However, if the input is known to be opaque binary data, there are no meaningful separators nor human-readable diff to display, so this optimization cannot be applied. &nbsp;Algorithms <em>capable</em> of optimizing human-readable data before it becomes an input are thus prone to getting miscast as wholly <em>incapable</em> of processing binary data. &nbsp;The truth remains, however: apart from pre-processing optimization, both binary and human-readable data can be treated as strings-of-bytes inputs and easily processed.</p></div>
<h2 id="three-generations-of-diff-algorithms">Three generations of diff algorithms</h2>
<p>The notion of how a diff should be generated has evolved over time.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-arrow-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="string-to-string-correction-or-insert-delete">String-to-string Correction or Insert/Delete</h3>
<p>The first generation of diff algorithms solved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-to-string_correction_problem">string-to-string correction problem</a> and emerged in the 60s and 70s. Each of the two inputs is interpreted as a string composed of characters in some alphabet. The output is a sequence of character edits, most commonly insert/delete operations, that could be applied to one of the inputs to transform it to the other input. That makes this class of algorithms particularly suitable for generating human readable diffs on human readable inputs, e.g. different versions of the same text/source code resulting from actual edits being made over time. What helps even further is that in theory, and more often than not in practice, there is more than one minimal length sequence of edit operations that gets the job done. Various heuristics can be used to pick the edit sequences that most closely resembles actual human made edits.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145%2F321796.321811">Wagner-Fischer algorithm</a> set the foundation for this generation of diff algorithms. The <a href="http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf">Myers Algorithm</a> is the latest improvement and the de facto standard for the generation and is currently used in multiple diff tools including the GNU diff utility.This generation of algorithms usually finds either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem">longest common subsequence</a> or the minimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance#Common_algorithm">edit distance</a> (usually that would be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a>) and uses these to generate the sequence of edits needed to transform one input into the other.</p>
<h2 id="block-move-or-copy-insert">Block move or copy/insert</h2>
<h3 id="pure-block-move">Pure block move</h3>
<p>The next generation of diff algorithms was based on seemingly small optimizations over the previous generation. The character edits were upgraded to block-of-characters edits. That is, instead of expressing the diff as operations on single characters, the diff would be expressed as operations on blocks of characters. The operations are usually copy and insert where blocks of data that appear in both inputs are recorded in the delta as copied from one input to the other. The blocks unique to one of the inputs are recorded as insertions. This approach was first proposed by <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.9110&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Walter Tichy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="compression-based-block-move">Compression based block move</h3>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-messages-5.png"><figcaption>How Ably generates deltas in its pub/sub messaging platform using the block move approach</figcaption></figure><p>At first glance, the block move approach seems like a minor optimization. However, it has significant impact once you take into account the possibility that some block(s) of characters can repeat in some or both of the inputs. Thinking about diff generation in terms of copying blocks of data and keeping an eye out for the same block repeating more than once opens the door to using compression algorithms to generate a diff and delta file.</p>
<p>Compression algorithms do just that: find the biggest possible repeating blocks of data and replace each consecutive occurrence with a reference to the first occurrence. Blocks of data that never repeat are copied straight to the output. Compression algorithms are in essence block move algorithms.</p>
<p>If the block move analysis done by a compression algorithm is performed on both inputs of a diff algorithm, it will easily identify the common parts of both inputs. It will also point out which blocks of data are unique, that is different in both of the inputs. Once you have this data, it is straightforward to come up with a sequence of block copy/delete operations that will convert one of the inputs to the other one.</p>
<p>The major benefit of using compression algorithms is the greatly reduced size of the delta. A block of data will never appear more than once in the delta. It might be referred to multiple times but the actual data of the block will be contained in the delta only once. That is a major difference from the preceding approaches. It should also be mentioned that the delta size is reduced at the cost of reduced human readability.</p>
<p><strong>xDelta</strong>, <strong>zDelta</strong>, <strong>Bentley/McIlroy</strong> are widely used de-facto standard implementations of diff algorithms of this generation.</p>
<h3 id="latest-upgrades">Latest Upgrades</h3>
<p>This would be the latest generation of diff algorithms. Most of its members exist only in research papers and don’t have any commercial implementations yet. They are largely based on the block move approach but offer substantial implementation optimizations, which result in claims of double-digit factor improvements in speed over the previous generation.</p>
<p>These optimizations are mostly focused on efficiently finding matching blocks of data in the two inputs. Various incremental hashing or compression-like techniques (such as suffix-trees) are used to achieve this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>edelta</strong>, <strong>ddelta</strong>, <strong>bsdiff</strong> could be assigned to this generation of diff algorithms</p>
<h2 id="delta-generation-algorithms-currently-in-use"><strong>Delta generation algorithms currently in use</strong></h2>
<p>This is a short overview of the tools and libraries focused on efficient delta/patch file generation and available at the time of writing (June 2019). Various other existing implementations of general purpose diff algorithms in different languages are omitted here for brevity’s sake.</p>

    <p>After watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> I wanted to experience bending the elements just like in the show.
Of course actually doing this is impossible but could a game give that feeling?</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/katara_waterbend.gif" alt="GIF of katara water bending." title="See the smooth movement of the water."></p>

<p><a href="https://coronalabs.com/">Corona Labs</a> lets you make 2D cross-platform games and it comes with a realistic particle simulator.</p>

<p>It comes with this demo below, <strong>click below</strong> to try it!</p>

<!--  -->
<figure>
    
</figure>
<!--  -->

<p>This gives some interaction with particles but doesn’t create the smooth flows of water you see in the show.</p>

<p>It works by making all particles within the orange box match the box’s velocity.
This is done by repeatedly running <a href="https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/type/ParticleSystem/queryRegion.html"><code>queryRegion</code></a> which sets particle velocity is a given region.
It allows not just setting particle velocity but incrimenting it as well.</p>

<p>Lets picture the first GIF but with imagined forces on the water drawn as arrows.</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/katara_waterbend_arrows.gif" alt="Katara water bending." title="The arrows denote forces on the water."></p>

<p>Now to get a bending effect we can recreate the above GIF it with multiple <code>queryRegion</code> boxes.</p>

<p>Using the grid above, when a user taps the screen a ring of cells are updated with each pointing to the cursor.
To ensure the cursor is always in the middle of a grid cell the whole grid is shifted as the cursor moves between cells.</p>

<p>For cell values I make the magnitude’s greater for further out cells as I found this better holds the particles together.
To get long streams of water I gradually decrease old cell values.</p>

<p>Below I show the cell values with white arrows (longer for greator velocity incriments).</p>

<p><strong>Try water bending below.</strong></p>

    <figcaption>Note that the web version can be slow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<!--  -->

<p>Then by making particles with different physical properties you get different materials.
Ice is a solid group of particles, green acid mixes colour with the blue water, slime is a sticky group of particles while mud is viscous.</p>

    <figcaption>Bending different materials.</figcaption>

<p>For fire particles I use the same bending system as before but now particles are created while you bend.
They also have a slightly negative gravity and self-destruct after a few seconds.</p>

<p>This could be part of a really great game, I hope to work on it more but I’m not sure I have the time.
For now I’m releasing the <a href="https://github.com/Fraser-Greenlee/benders">code</a> and hoping someone is inspired by this mechanic to make a great game.</p>

				<p>Whatever programming language you use, sooner or later you will want to find out what happens in your program at runtime. The objectives of obtaining such information may differ from developer to developer and from user to user, but whatever the objective one thing remains consistent - you will need the logs of your program to achieve it. Like many before us, we experienced this need.</p><p>Considering the fact that all of our almost-monolithic applications run inside docker containers, at first, work was organized to collect logs from these containers.</p><p>A critical requirement for collecting logs was the need for <strong>an aggregate</strong> search when responding to incidents - ddos ​​attacks, abnormal user behavior, error spikes given to mobile applications, and research on penetration attempts. What free solution can beautifully display our logs at consecutive intervals? We settled on ElasticSearch along with Kibana, which provides out-of-the-box fast aggregate searches within consecutive time intervals.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/aggregation-2.png" alt=""></figure><p>When inserting non-single records in ElasticSearch, ElasticSearch insists on inserting data with a large set of records (batches) in the format that ElasticSearch defines.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc0-1.svg" alt=""></figure><p>As you can see in the picture above, we know the sending point and the destination point of our structured messages (logs). And we want to minimize the number of programs that will convert message formats - from docker-container to the message set format that ElasticSearch requires.</p><p>Elasticsearch for such cases has a special solution - Logstash, thus forming the famous ELK abbreviation (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).</p><p>Among the possible solutions for integrating Logstash together with docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gelf/">in the documentation</a> we can find the GELF (graylog extended format logging) message format. Let's look at the final log transfer stream.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc1.0-1.svg" alt=""><figcaption>initial application logs dataflow</figcaption></figure><p>Inside the docker containers there is a web application written in ruby ​​(best language in the world, btw) that processes each request in a separate thread. To prevent slow clients from slowing down application threads, we, like many, use nginx. Therefore, we would also like to receive request logs from nginx.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc1.1-1.svg" alt=""><figcaption>application logs dataflow</figcaption></figure><p>This stack is relatively quick to configure, without blocking the continuous improvements that are still required.</p><hr><h2 id="logging-2-0">Logging 2.0</h2><p>There were several issues with configured logging 1.0.:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>when reconfiguring Logstash, we lost logs</li>
<li>when reconfiguring ElasticSearch, we lost logs</li>
<li>during abnormal work of ElasticSearch, we lost logs</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The need for long-term storage of logs while maintaining the <strong>highest possible availability</strong> forced us to search for the ideal application logging scheme.</p><h2 id="gathering-requirements">Gathering requirements</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>availability in case of emergency<br>
In any emergency mode, it is important for us to be able to find the cause of the problem. It's impossible to do this without the logs.</li>
<li>reliability in normal operation<br>
in normal mode, we would like to have reliable log delivery, so that looking at the logs according to certain criteria, we can always easily find them and not think why they disappeared, and sometimes they disappeared.</li>
<li>short time management<br>
On average, we have 1M active users per backend developer, and it is more profitable for a business to spend our time developing user features than supporting infrastructure (for example, restoring a cluster after unexpected error)</li>
<li>business doesn't like vendor-locks</li>
<li>cost</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="system-architecture">System architecture</h2><p>The first reflex thought that appears in the head when required to provide maximum availability.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-availability.svg" alt=""></figure><p>We put a balancer in front of Logstash (haproxy or a ready-made aws solution if you are inside aws), instead of a single elasticsearch instance, we make an elasticsearch cluster. But in this scenario, we begin to pay at least x2 for processing logs, and this comes on top of our reconfiguration and maintenance efforts. So, we increase availability, but somehow it is rapidly becoming very expensive. What do we do?</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/images.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>Maybe we should look at ready-made solutions? Here is the list of tools we considered at least in passing:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Riemann</li>
<li>SaaS log management
<ul>
<li>cloudwatch(AWS)</li>
<li>kinesis(AWS)</li>
<li>DataDog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fluentd</li>
<li>heka, logstash</li>
<li>rsyslog, syslog-ng</li>
<li>there was probably something else</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>And this the moment when one realises the value of having very smart colleagues who are there to challenge and to help you. The proposed solution turned out to be so concise, simple and amazing that one doesn't immediately realize all of its beauty.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.0pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>Let's just write to files, then we can ensure the availability of logs at critical moments, with the advantages of the existing solution.</p><p>You can write to files on the local instance and send all the information to a remote machine at the same time. Therefore, the "Magic Solution" in the general case, we had as follows.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.1pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>In emergency situations, we can always make 'grep' and find the source of an emergency, even if the main log collector stops working for us (we provide availability).</p><p>But here we recall that Logstash can take logs from files, watching for changes in them. Thus, we can do this and, at a minimum, get rid of the need for a balancer and Elasticearch cluster (the cost criteria is still important for us).</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.2pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>And then the question arose: did people really not solve such problems with centralizing file logs before, because we all know that on Linux all logs are in /var/log. This means that earlier developers and administrators had problems collecting and sending them to a centralized log server.</p><p>After an extended study of probably the longest-lasting open source project in logging systems - rsyslog, it became clear that it could easily replace Logstash and our logging system could be made exceptionally simple. But for a start, we had a smooth transition to logging 2.0</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2-transition-2.svg" alt=""></figure><p><strong>So we got to the architecture, where on each instance there will be a local rsyslog log collector that sends logs to the central rsyslog server, which in the future can write logs to files and Elasticsearch at the same time. And it seems that this satisfies all our requirements that we set for the logging system.</strong></p><p>To test the solution’s health, we decided to test rsyslog to collect all the logs from our instances, and we have up to 150 of them. It looked like enough to test the health of the whole solution. If the solution justifies itself, then at the same time we will still be able to centralize the collection of logs from instances so that it is possible to resolve incidents during the upcoming <a href="https://dev.sweatco.in/aws-autoscaling-with-ease/">autoscaling</a>.</p><p>After testing and the final transition, our log collection system was completely transformed and met all the requirements that we presented to it.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.0-final.svg" alt=""></figure><p>In further articles I will talk about why rsyslog satisfies our reliability requirement, about rsyslog inter-server communication, and also look at how logs are transferred inside Linux from byte to byte and, of course, configuration of rsyslog.</p><p>I hope that after reading a series of articles on centralizing logs, you can do it faster, cheaper, more reliable, and without losing availability.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>After reading the article, it may seem that at some point I picked up the logging system and did everything alone, but this is far from the case.</p><p>In the process of moving to our ideal logging system, we constantly discussed the pros and cons of different solutions, and each of us defended the requirement close to them or changed the configuration parameters they needed, asked intriguing questions or sent us back to the original set of requirements.</p><p>In conclusion, I want to thank my colleagues for a creative atmosphere and for their advice and hand-on help which allowed us to create such a system together.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/06/alex.f201381a-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Alex - for brilliant ideas and creative atmosphere</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/vlad.d6652863-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Vlad - because we sleep peacefully at night</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/alexander.710cffd7-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Alexandr - for general assistance in improving logging</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/ilya.24ad6b15-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Ilya - for the promotion of important tasks</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/06/oleg.80ee4ad7-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>and our founder Oleg for making this article more friendly to you</figcaption></figure>

<p>I recently left my high-paying job as a restaurant manager with the intent on creating my own destiny. </p>



<p>But why? Being in charge of such a large organization had all the trappings anyone might want: money, power, status, a comfortable two-bedroom top-floor apartment, and all that comes with such a lifestyle.</p>



<p>I really thought I found the key to success.  I was living the life. And yet, I wasn’t happy. </p>



<p>Not even close.</p>



<p><em>(NOTE: This post, being available for public consumption, may render me totally unemployable. That is my goal. You might ask ‘why?’ By the end you’ll be asking ‘why not?’)</em></p>







<p>Beginning in the early months of 2018, I spent two years as the general manager of a brand new restaurant on the edge of a college campus. The place was huge, and the challenge was immense: 9,000 sq ft, 80+ employees, $4 million+ in revenue per year. The owner of the restaurant rarely spent time there, so from day one I felt it was solely my responsibility to make it a success. </p>



<p>I was in charge of everything, from setting up the new restaurant, to hiring and training hundreds of employees. From daily inventory and ordering, to developing an atmosphere and a community that would set the business on a trajectory to be the hottest thing in the region. </p>



<p>The work was hard, and at times, soul-crushing. But the process of building something meaningful had always appealed to me, and this was my big chance to make my mark. </p>



<p>I felt that I would work there for a long time. I could pay off my student loan debt, save money for my own restaurant one day, and I would never have to worry about money ever again. <em>This path was my destiny</em> …is what I kept telling myself.</p>



<h4>Origins of my “Destiny”</h4>



<p>I had come a long way. In 2017, only a year prior to joining the restaurant business, I was living an aimless life, doing mindless work at a payroll company. I had spent three of the most capable years of my life at the company <em>not pursuing my dreams</em>, and <em>not knowing what my dreams even were</em>. Eventually I decided I wasn’t cut out for shuffling papers for 40 hours a week, and <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/08/12-lessons/">I left the 9-5 cubicle life behind</a>. </p>



<p>In the months to follow, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery that would change the trajectory of my life. I <span><a href="http://santiago-compostela.net/">walked 500 miles across northern Spain</a></span> on the fabled Camino de Santiago. And when I returned, I started my own fidget spinner side-hustle during the height of the craze.</p>



<p>The overarching goal of my self-imposed sabbatical was to stretch and redefine my comfort zone every single day. Over that time, I learned what it means to work for myself and I explored the edges of comfort more than I ever could in a cloistered paycheck-to-paycheck cubicle environment. </p>



<p><em><strong>I discovered I had been unconsciously limiting myself my entire life. </strong></em></p>



<h4>Movin’ On Up</h4>



<p>By early 2018, through leveraging my experiences, utilizing my network, and <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/06/stand-out-at-work/">solving the principal-agent problem</a>, I had been hired to run the restaurant. With no prior restaurant experience besides dining in them, I was tasked with building and managing this brand new multi-million dollar project from the ground up. </p>



<p>This location would be the largest in the restaurant group, which has dozens of locations in the Philadelphia area. Despite my blatant lack of experience, the owner of the company saw enough character and potential to hand me the keys. Through many long days, hard work, and consistency, I was projected to someday be “the best manager the company has ever seen” by one of the owner’s top lieutenants.</p>



<p>My admiration within the restaurant empire grew rapidly.  I was soon looked to as the standard-bearer of principled leadership within an otherwise ethically-challenged organization. </p>



<p>The team of employees I put together was outstanding. The camaraderie and the energy within the team was remarkable. Employees felt that working at the restaurant was often the best part of their day. In essence, I had cultivated a work environment I was never able to find on my own. </p>



<p>The mayor, local government officials, business owners, and even some professional sports stars began dining there on a regular basis.  And within a large college community, the restaurant achieved success almost instantly.</p>

<p>I was making a comfortable living, I had a fun and engaging job, I had the status, and I had the respect. What more could I want?</p>



<h4>The Inevitable Turn of Events</h4>



<p>The learning curve, after so long in a particular role, inevitably stumbles into unsavory territory. The owner had an inner-circle of lieutenants who he trusted to be his eyes and ears throughout the organization. But there was a catch–he only admitted “yes-men” into this exclusive group, or people who would only tell him what he wanted to hear. By now, I’m sure you can think of one or more leaders with this quality. They’re on TV every day. And you might even deal with them at your job on a daily basis. </p>



<p>I began, by default, as an unofficial member of this inner-circle, but I quickly chose to find my way out. I have never been one to tell people only what they want to hear. With this being in diametric opposition of what the owner liked, it set the stage for a challenging relationship. Put simply, he was always more interested in his way of doing things rather than the best way. It was his company, after all.</p>



<p>Often, he didn’t take kindly to hard truths I would present to him about many of the unfortunate realities within the organization. And as the sole owner of the company, his attitude of denial would ultimately enable such issues to persist. I had eventually lost the ability to convince him of the truth.</p>



<p>But do you know the beautiful thing about <strong>truth</strong>? Truth doesn’t care about what anyone thinks of it. It cannot be molded into something it is not. This powerlessness over truth causes many to avoid it at all costs. Many are scared of the consequences truth brings along. The all-powerful owner of this organization was no different. So be it.</p>



<h4>The Writing on the Wall</h4>



<p>As I grew to learn the inner workings of the power structure within the company, I began to sense that one way or another, I was not going to stay there long-term. </p>



<p>My principles and values would be tested on many occasions, but they were never broken. I did my best to<a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/05/02/keep-your-soul/"><span> </span><span>keep</span><span> </span><span>my soul</span></a> through it all.</p>



<p>It had been almost two years with the organization, but by late 2019, the writing was on the wall. It became increasingly challenging to work with the owner. All the money and status wasn’t enough to keep me motivated. All the cheese wasn’t enough to keep me in the trap. </p>



<p>I became indifferent to the non-sense and to “playing politics.” I was chronically over-stressed and everyone around me felt it. By the time my (“keep it short”) August vacation came around, I decided I needed to make a change. </p>



<p>Shortly after I returned, I sat down with the owner and made the decision to resign. I had reached the point of no return. I had to move on for the sake of my health and my sanity. The <em>destiny</em> I had envisioned for myself was little more than an illusion. I knew that working for someone else would never be the answer to my ambitions. </p>



<p>I needed to take matters into my own hands and create my own destiny.</p>



<h4>That Which You Cannot Buy</h4>



<p>During my time at the restaurant, I learned, firsthand, that money doesn’t solve all your problems, just your money problems. Money doesn’t make you happy, but can buy things that make you happy (momentarily). </p>



<p>I also learned that status is a fleeting concept. You are not your status.  You can enjoy it briefly, but it tends to only bring you more problems, which money cannot solve. </p>



<p>What I was missing was that which you cannot point to, put a finger on, or buy: </p>



<h6><strong>Time</strong></h6>



<p>I was always at the restaurant. 60, 70, 80 hours a week. After all, my top-floor apartment was literally across the street. I could roll out of bed and into work. The downside? Obvious. As the single point of authority and communication of a multi-million dollar restaurant, I constantly lacked the most precious resource of all: <em>time</em>. </p>



<h6><strong>Freedom</strong></h6>



<p>If time is the bathwater, then freedom is the baby. Managing a restaurant will throw both out in a hurry. <em>Want a vacation? Wait until August when it’s slow. Remember, keep it short.</em> <em>Want a second day off? “You have banker’s hours.”</em> <em>Want to take an early day? Go ahead, but you’d better keep your phone with you.</em> I was nothing more than a well-paid tiger in a cage. </p>



<p><em>Everyone wants money and status. Until they know the price for it.</em></p>







<h4><strong><em>Want</em> Makes You a Servant</strong></h4>



<p>I was free! Well, almost. I went from 14-hour days to…</p>



<p>…nothing.</p>



<p>Soon after, out of boredom and recognition of what I thought was another promising opportunity, I began working at a marketing company. Although I learned a lot of skills (many of which I am putting to use now), the company was spinning its wheels. My long-term goals and the short-term discipline of the company were not aligned,  so I decided to leave after two months.</p>



<p>The problem I was having was letting my desires and my wants drive my decisions. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb says “The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary.” I’ve done fairly well steering clear of the first two, but my addiction to a steady paycheck has always led me to unhappiness.</p>

  <p>Modern OpenGL, and by extension WebGL, is very different from the legacy OpenGL I learned in the past. I understand how rasterization works, so I’m comfortable with the concepts. However, every tutorial I’ve read introduced abstractions and helper functions that make it harder for me to understand which parts are truly core to the OpenGL APIs.</p>

<p>To be clear, abstractions like separating positional data and rendering functionality into separate classes is important in a real-world application. But, these abstractions spread code across multiple areas, and introduce overhead due to boilerplate and passing around data between logical units. The way I <em>learn</em> best is a linear flow of code where every line is core to the subject at hand.</p>

<p>First, credit goes to <a href="https://www.toptal.com/javascript/3d-graphics-a-webgl-tutorial">the tutorial I used</a>. Starting from this base, I stripped down all the abstractions until I had a “minimal viable program”. Hopefully, this will help you get off the ground with modern OpenGL. Here’s what we’re making:</p>

<h2 id="initialization">Initialization</h2>

<p>With WebGL, we need a <code>canvas</code> to paint on. You’ll definitely want to include all the usual HTML boilerplate, some styling, etc., but the canvas is the most crucial. Once the DOM has loaded, we’ll be able to access the canvas using Javascript.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;canvas</span> <span>id=</span><span>"container"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"500"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"500"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
  <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>DOMContentLoaded</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// All the Javascript code below goes here</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the canvas accessible, we can get the WebGL rendering context, and initialize its clear color. Colors in the OpenGL world are RGBA, with each component between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. The clear color is the one used to paint the canvas at the beginning of any frame that redraws the scene.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>canvas</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>container</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>gl</span> <span>=</span> <span>canvas</span><span>.</span><span>getContext</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>webgl</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>clearColor</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s more initialization that can, and in real programs should, be done. Of particular note is enabling the <em>depth buffer</em>, which would allow sorting geometry based on the Z coordinates. We’ll avoid that for this basic program consisting of only one triangle.</p>

<h2 id="compile-shaders">Compile shaders</h2>

<p>OpenGL is at its core a rasterization framework, where <em>we</em> get to decide how to implement everything but the rasterization. This entails running at minimum two pieces of code on the GPU:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A vertex shader that runs for each piece of input, outputting one 3D (really, 4D in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneous coordinates</a>) positions per input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fragment shader that runs for each pixel on the screen, outputting what color that pixel should be.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In between these two steps, OpenGL takes the geometry from the vertex shader and determines which pixels on the screen are actually covered by that geometry. This is the rasterization part.</p>

<p>Both shaders are typically written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which is then compiled down to machine code for the GPU. The machine code is then sent to the GPU, so it can be run during the rendering process. I won’t spend much time on GLSL, as I’m only trying to show the basics, but the language is sufficiently close to C to be familiar to most programmers.</p>

<p>First, we compile and send a vertex shader to the GPU. Here, the source code for the shader is stored in a string, but it can be loaded from other places. Ultimately, the string is sent to the WebGL APIs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>sourceV</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
  attribute vec3 position;
  varying vec4 color;

  void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(position, 1);
    color = gl_Position * 0.5 + 0.5;
  }
`</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>shaderV</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createShader</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>VERTEX_SHADER</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>shaderSource</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>,</span> <span>sourceV</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>compileShader</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderParameter</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COMPILE_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to compile vertex shader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, there are a few variables in the GLSL code worth calling out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>An <em>attribute</em> called <code>position</code>. An attribute is essentially an input, and the shader is called for each such input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>varying</em> called <code>color</code>. This is an output from the vertex shader (one per input), and an input to the fragment shader. By the time the value is passed to the fragment shader, the value will be interpolated based on the properties of the rasterization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>gl_Position</code> value. Essentially an output from the vertex shader, like any varying value. This one is special because it’s used to determine which pixels need to be drawn at all.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There’s also a variable type called <em>uniform</em>, which is will be constant across multiple invocations of the vertex shader. These uniforms are used for properties like the transformation matrix, which will be constant for all vertices on a single piece of geometry.</p>

<p>Next, we do the same thing with fragment shader, compiling and sending it to the GPU. Notice the <code>color</code> variable from the vertex shader is now read by the fragment shader.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>sourceF</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
  precision mediump float;
  varying vec4 color;

  void main() {
    gl_FragColor = color;
  }
`</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>shaderF</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createShader</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>FRAGMENT_SHADER</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderParameter</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COMPILE_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to compile fragment shader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, both the vertex and fragment shader are linked into a single OpenGL program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>program</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createProgram</span><span>();</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>attachShader</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>shaderV</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>attachShader</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>shaderF</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>linkProgram</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getProgramParameter</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>LINK_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getProgramInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to link program</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>useProgram</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We tell the GPU that the shaders we defined above are the ones we want to run. So, now what’s left is to create the inputs and let the GPU loose on those inputs.</p>

<h2 id="send-the-input-data-to-the-gpu">Send the input data to the GPU</h2>

<p>The input data will be stored in the GPU’s memory and processed from there. Instead of making separate draw calls for each piece of input, which would transfer the relevant data one piece at a time, the entire input is transferred to the GPU and read from there. (Legacy OpenGL would transfer data one piece at at time, leading to worse performance.)</p>

<p>OpenGL provides an abstraction known as a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO). I’m still figuring out how all of this works, but ultimately, we’ll do the following using the abstraction:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Store a sequence of bytes in the CPU’s memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transfer the bytes to the GPU’s memory using a unique buffer created using <code>gl.createBuffer()</code> and a <em>binding point</em> of <code>gl.ARRAY_BUFFER</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll have one VBO per input variable (attribute) in the vertex shader, though it’s possible to use a single VBO for multiple inputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>positionsData</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Float32Array</span><span>([</span>
  <span>-</span><span>0.75</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>0.75</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>0</span>   <span>,</span>  <span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
<span>]);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createBuffer</span><span>();</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bindBuffer</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>ARRAY_BUFFER</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bufferData</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>ARRAY_BUFFER</span><span>,</span> <span>positionsData</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>STATIC_DRAW</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Typically, you’ll specify your geometry with whatever coordinates are meaningful to your application, then use a series of transformations in the vertex shader to get them into OpenGL’s <em>clip space</em>. I won’t go into the details of clip space (they have to do with homogeneous coordinates), but for now, X and Y vary from -1 to +1. Because our vertex shader just passes along the input data as is, we can specify our coordinates directly in clip space.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll also associate the buffer with one of the variables in the vertex shader. Here, we:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get a handle to the <code>position</code> variable from the program we created above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tell OpenGL to read data from the <code>gl.ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding point, in batches of 3, with particular parameters like an offset and stride of zero.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>attribute</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getAttribLocation</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>position</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>enableVertexAttribArray</span><span>(</span><span>attribute</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>vertexAttribPointer</span><span>(</span><span>attribute</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>FLOAT</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we can create the VBO and associate it with the vertex shader attribute this way because we do both one after another. If we separated these two functions (for example creating all the VBOs in one go, then associating them to individual attributes), we would need to call <code>gl.bindBuffer(...)</code> before associating each VBO with its corresponding attribute.</p>

<h2 id="draw">Draw!</h2>

<p>Finally, with all the data in the GPU’s memory set up the way we want, we can tell OpenGL to clear the screen and run the program on the arrays we set up. As part of the rasterization (determining which pixels are covered by the vertices), we tell OpenGL to treat the vertices in groups of 3 as triangles.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>clear</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>drawArrays</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TRIANGLES</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The way we’ve set this up in a linear fashion does mean the program runs in one shot. In any practical application, we’d store the data in a structured way, send it to the GPU whenever it changes, and perform the drawing every frame.</p>

<hr>

<p>Putting everything together, the diagram below shows the minimal set of concepts that go into showing your first triangle on the screen. Even then, the diagram is heavily simplified, so your best bet is to put together the 75 lines of code presented in this article and study that.</p>

  <figcaption>The final, though heavily simplified, sequence of steps needed to show the coveted triangle</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The hard part of learning OpenGL for me has been the sheer amount of boilerplate needed to get the most basic image on the screen. Because the rasterization framework requires us to provide 3D rendering functionality, and communicating with the GPU is verbose, there are many concepts to learn right up front. I hope this article shows the basics are simpler than other tutorials make them out to be!</p>

        <p>The JVM’s garbage collectors make use of Thread-Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs) to improve allocation performance. In this article we’re going to understand what TLABs are, how they affect the code generated by the JIT for allocation and what the resulting effect on performance is. Along the way we’ll learn about the organisation of CPU caches and how multiple CPU cores keep their contents coherent and how you can use this knowledge to avoid multithreaded scalability bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by discussing what TLABs are and why they’re necessary. TLABs are blocks of the Java heap that each JVM thread has into which it can allocate. They are exclusive to one thread for the purposes of allocation but as they are part of the Java heap any other thread may reference or access objects within them. Exclusivity for allocation means an individual thread can allocate efficiently into its TLAB without needing to coordinate or synchronise with any other threads. When a thread runs out of space in its TLAB it requests a new buffer from the JVM’s Garbage Collector. We cover how allocation happens in a TLAB in our related blog post on <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/jvms-allocateprefetch-options/">JVM Allocation Prefetching</a> but in summary, it boils down to incrementing a pointer.</p>
<h2>CPU Cache Coherency</h2>
<p>Why are we trying to avoid incrementing the allocation pointer from multiple threads? To understand this we need to look at how caches are organised amongst multiple cores in a multicore processor. Memory in caches is organised in <em>cache lines</em>. These are sequential blocks of normally a fixed size that depends on the CPU architecture and model, on modern AMD/Intel x86 cores this is 64 bytes. There are multiple levels of caches with two or three being usual and with some caches shared between groups or all cores whilst others are exclusive to an individual core. The configuration depends very much on the architecture and specific model of processor. As an example, the AMD’s “Zen 2” Ryzen 7 3700X has 8 cores each of which has a 64kb L1 cache (half for instructions, half for data) and a 512kb L2 cache. The Ryzen 7 cores are in two groups of four, each group of four share a 16MB L3 cache.</p>
<p><img alt="Ryzen 7 3700X cache configuration" src="https://www.opsian.com/images/jvm_tlabs/ryzen_7_caches.png" title="Ryzen 7 3700X cache configuration"></p>
<p>AMD’s Zen 2 cache configuration (taken from <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AMD/the-path-to-zen-2">https://www.slideshare.net/AMD/the-path-to-zen-2</a>)</p>
<p>Keeping all of these caches in sync is what’s called a <em>cache coherency</em> protocol. It specifies a set of states that each cache line can be in and the valid transitions between those states. The most common protocol on x86 is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESI_protocol">MESI</a> and both Intel and AMD use variants of it. For each cache, their cache lines can be in one of the following states under MESI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modified (M)</strong> - this contents of the cache line have been modified and this cache has the only copy. All other caches corresponding lines are marked <strong>Invalid</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusive (E)</strong> - this cache has the only copy of this cache line and it matches main memory. All other caches corresponding lines are marked <strong>Invalid.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shared (S)</strong> - this cache line matches memory and is present in other caches, other caches may have this line marked <strong>Shared</strong> too.</li>
<li><strong>Invalid (I)</strong> - this cache line is empty.</li>
</ul>
<p>AMD and Intel’s variants (MOESI and MESIF respectively) add additional states that can reduce writes to main memory and also optimise traffic in NUMA environments.</p>
<p>At a very high level, a memory write under MESI goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the cache line is in present in our cache<ul>
<li>If <strong>Exclusive</strong> then modify and transition the line to <strong>Modified</strong></li>
<li>If <strong>Modified </strong>then modify and leave in <strong>Modified</strong></li>
<li>If <strong>Shared</strong> then make other caches invalidate their copies, modify and move to <strong>Modified</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the cache line is not present in our cache<ul>
<li>If another cache has the line in <strong>Modified</strong> they send the line contents to this cache and also to main memory, marking their line <strong>Invalid</strong></li>
<li>If other caches have the line in <strong>Exclusive</strong> or <strong>Shared</strong> state they send their contents and mark their lines <strong>Invalid</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, concurrent memory writes to the same location from multiple cores can involve cache lines being invalidated and changing state fairly rapidly. The term often used for this effect is called cache line ping-pong.</p>
<h2>Why caches matter for allocation</h2>
<p>The main takeaways from the above steps is that if we have a cache line exclusively or in the modified state then we don’t need to force other caches to do work. If the cache line is shared with other caches we need them to invalidate. Invalidating means those cache lines are now no longer present in other cores’ caches. Subsequent reads could involve cores stalling to re-acquire the data from other caches (50+ cycles depending on which cache and the topology) or worse hitting main memory itself (100s of cycles). This is in contrast with a L1 cache hit which, on the i7 4770k (Haswell) we’ll use later on for benchmarking, is in the region of <a href="https://www.7-cpu.com/cpu/Haswell.html">4-5 cycles</a>.</p>
<p>Put into the context of memory allocation, every thread competing to read and write a single allocation pointer would lead to each core cache repeatedly needing to take ownership of the allocation pointer’s cache line and all other cores invalidating their copies. In comparison, with TLABs each thread has its own local allocation pointer into its buffer which is not visible to other cores and avoids the need to synchronise with other caches.</p>
<h2>Testing allocation with and without TLABs</h2>
<p>That’s the theory, let’s see how well it applies in practise. To test this we’re going to conduct some multithreaded benchmarks using Java’s Parallel Garbage Collector on JDK 13.0.2 with and without TLABs. </p>
<p>We’re using the Parallel GC because for all our benchmarks the instructions for manipulating the allocation pointer get inlined into generated code by the JIT. Other collectors like G1 and CMS actually call in to the collectors themselves on allocation which makes things a little harder to demonstrate. Both G1 and CMS also serialize allocations in the non-TLAB case by taking a lock.</p>
<p>For this we will use the excellent <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">JMH</a> and the benchmarks themselves are:</p>

</pre></div>


<p>It’s worth noting that we’re using <em>Object</em> here which is the smallest allocation we can actually do. This is unrealistic because nobody really allocates like this (if you do, please let me know) but magnifies the effect of the allocation machinery so we can clearly see what effect TLABs have. We’ll look at some benchmarks which allocate larger objects near the end of this post.</p>
<p>We run the benchmarks with the <em>-prof perfasm</em> option so we can dump out the assembly for the two benchmarks. We have simplified and rearranged the assembly below a little to make it easier to read.</p>
<p>For <em>allocateWithTLABOneThread</em> we have:</p>
<pre>try_allocation:
<b>// Load the current thread-local allocation pointer</b>
mov     0x118(%r15),%rax

<b>// Compute new global allocation pointer by adding allocation size (16 bytes)</b>
mov     %rax,%r10
add     $0x10,%r10

<b>// Check that this doesn't go beyond the TLAB limit, if it does call in to the GC to refill</b>
cmp     0x128(%r15),%r10 // check this is not over our buffer
jb      continue_allocation
.. call in to GC and deal with refilling buffer ..

<b>// Allocation was inside TLAB limit, so update limit</b>
continue_allocation:
mov     %r10,0x118(%r15)

<b>// Prefetch for next allocation</b>
prefetchnta 0xc0(%r10) // prefetch for future allocations
.. initialise object with mark word and klass pointer ..
.. benchmark loop logic ..
</pre>

<p>For <em>allocateWithoutTLABOneThread</em> we have:</p>
<pre>try_allocation:
<b>// Load the current global allocation limit into %r10</b>
movabs  $0x7f764804d2d0,%r10
mov     (%r10),%r10

increment_allocation_pointer:
<b>// Load the current global allocation pointer into %r11 and %rax</b>
movabs  $0x7f764804d2f8,%r11 
mov     (%r11),%rax
mov     %rax,%r11

<b>// Compute new global allocation pointer by adding allocation size (16 bytes)</b>
add     $0x10,%r11

<b>// Is the new pointer over the limit? If so call in to the GC</b>
cmp     %r10,%r11
jnb     call_gc

<b>// Atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) global allocation pointer (address in %r9). Old expected value is in %rax, new value is in %r11</b>
movabs  $0x7f764804d2f8,%r9
lock cmpxchg %r11,(%r9)

<b>// If the CAS succeeded continue to initialise the object - otherwise retry</b>
je      continue_allocation // success we can go initialise the object
jmp     increment_allocation_pointer // failure we need to try again

continue_allocation:
<b>// New object address in %r11. Increment thread allocations stats and prefetch for the next allocation, then continue with initialisation.</b>
addq    $0x10,0x190(%r15) // bump thread allocated bytes stats
prefetchnta 0xc0(%r11) // prefetch for future allocations
.. initialise object with mark word and klass pointer ..
.. benchmark loop logic ..
</pre>

<p>As you can see the case without TLABs is a little more involved and also explicitly needs to deal with contention amongst threads, where one thread might be incrementing the allocation pointer in between another thread having loaded it and attempting to increment it.</p>
<h2>The single threaded case</h2>
<p>Let’s see how the two single threaded cases stack up on a Intel Core i7-4770 CPU:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>Test
   </td>
   <td>Op/s (throughput)
   </td>
   <td>Error (for 99.9% CI)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>allocateWithTLABOneThread
   </td>
   <td>279,772,768
   </td>
   <td>± 4,153,915
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>allocateWithoutTLABOneThread
   </td>
   <td>101,167,412
   </td>
   <td>± 128,394
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>So even with one thread where we’re sure there’s no contention, we’re only seeing half the performance when compared to using a TLAB. This is because the Atomic Compare-And-Swap (CAS) instruction required when not using a TLAB (<code>lock cmpxchg</code> in the above assembly snippet) is more expensive than the normal load and store combination used in the TLAB test.</p>
<h2>Digging deeper on Atomic CASes</h2>
<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. The first is that, on modern x86 cores, a normal store doesn’t immediately …</p></div></div>

Also called, “Ethio-jazz”, it blends traditional Ethiopian sounds/melodies with jazz, funk, and even Latin influences.  If that sounds confusing, let me reassure you that it is a dynamite combination.  <em>To Know Without Knowing</em> has all of these great Ethio-jazz sounds, plus hip-hop.  This is what happens when you combine Mulata Astatke (commonly known as the father of Ethio-jazz) with Black Jesus Experience - Astatke’s hip-hop influenced backing band.  Many of the tracks flow nicely, with trumpet, saxophone, piano, and other jazz rhythmic instruments.  But then, Black Jesus Experience lays down smooth, timely rhymes overtop, and it just sounds meant to be.  This album will be a part of my working playlist for a long time, it is perfect to have on while powering through something.</p><p><span>Release date: </span>May 15, 2020</p><p><span>Similar artist(s): </span>The Heliocentrics</p><p><span>Top tracks: </span>A Chance to Give, Mulata, Kulun Mankwaleshi</p></div></div>]]>

<p>At user groups and in online communities they keep talking about Vim and how cool it is to use this text editor. Let’s explore what all the Fuzz is about.</p>



<h3>What is Vim?</h3>



<p>Vim is a text editor that operates within the terminal and works with keyboard shortcuts only. It is known for the editing speed you can achieve and therefore increased productivity.</p>



<h3>Why is Vim so popular?</h3>



<p>Despite its age (at the time of writing, 28 years) it’s still popular among a lot of software developers. Vim is available on almost any operating system. It comes preinstalled on Linux Distributions and macOS, and there are packages available for Windows as well. Once you mastered the keyboard shortcuts, you can edit files very quickly. </p>



<h3>How does Vim look like?</h3>

<h3>How can I get started with Vim?</h3>



<p>If you’re on Linux or macOS, open a terminal and type in <code>vim</code>. This will open the editor and it’s ready to open a file. On Windows, you might need to <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.vim.org/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">install it first</a>.</p>



<h3>Vim Foundations</h3>



<p>If you have used other editors such as Notepad++, Sublime, TextMate or Visual Studio Code, Vim will seem quite obscure. In these other editors, you use keyboard shortcuts as well as the mouse to open, save and edit files. <br>Since Vim is keyboard-only, it comes with shortcuts for all operations (also those you’d use a mouse for otherwise). <br>The main difference to other editors is its two different modes. Vim has a Normal and Insert Mode. </p>



<h4>Normal Mode</h4>



<p>In Normal Mode you execute commands such as open or save file but also navigating across the file. </p>



<p>Vim is already in Normal Mode once it opens. Some commands consist of a single letter such as <code>i</code>, <code>p</code> or <code>w</code>. Others require a colon, such as <code>:w</code>, <code>:q</code> or <code>:e</code>. (More on those commands below.)</p>



<h4>Insert Mode</h4>



<p>Once in Insert Mode, every key you hit will result in a character in your file as you’re used to it in other editors. </p>



<h4>Switching Between Modes</h4>



<p>When you open Vim, it’s in Normal mode already. To get into Insert Mode, press <code>i</code>. You will see <code>-- INSERT --</code> in the bottom left corner. </p>

<p>Once you’re done adding / changing characters, hit the <code>&lt;ESC&gt;</code> key to switch back to Normal mode. You will notice, that <code>-- INSERT --</code> will disappear again. </p>



<p>When you edit a file, you will constantly change between both modes, with Normal as the default mode. When you navigate through a file, copy or delete characters, you do all of that in Normal Mode. Insert Mode is for character manipulation (Insert and Delete) only.</p>



<h3>Vim Commands</h3>



<p>The list of Vim Commands is pretty long, but you won’t need to know all of them to get started.<br>In fact, only a handful commands will do in the beginning:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><code>&lt;ESC&gt;</code></td><td>Switch into Normal Mode</td></tr><tr><td><code>i</code></td><td>Switch into Insert Mode</td></tr><tr><td><code>:w</code></td><td>Save file</td></tr><tr><td><code>:q</code></td><td>Close Vim</td></tr><tr><td><code>:wq</code></td><td>Save file and Close Vim</td></tr><tr><td><code>:e &lt;filename&gt;</code></td><td>Open a file</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Vim Commands you need to know to get started</figcaption></figure>



<p>These six commands will get you quite far already, allowing you to open, manipulate and save files, as well as closing Vim. </p>



<p>Additionally, download the Cheat Sheet below with additional commands that build on top of the foundational commands above.</p>







<p>It will take time to pick up speed and come back to a productivity level you’re used to. Start with the commands in the table above and focus your effort on switching between Normal and Insert Mode. <br>Once you’re comfortable with that, add one command at a time from the Cheat Sheet to your repertoire. You will notice over time how your muscle memory will build up. That will also be the time to install additional plugins. </p>



<p>Let’s get started with learning! I’m curious about your learning experience. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ganzefolge" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/ganzefolge" target="_blank">Follow me on Twitter </a>and share your progress with me!</p>

The promise of blockchain is huge. And large companies are continuing to hire and expand their blockchain teams, incl. Facebook, Amazon, Microsft, EY, Deloitte, IBM, and Oracle, to name a few. So, it should be well worth the effort to become familiar with how blockchain works, what its perceived benefits are, and as a developer starting building on top of them. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, I’ve been helping and on-boarding new team members and developers into the blockchain space. This helped me to collect blogs, links, materials, and resources and see which worked well for everyone’s learning journey. It’s time to share that with a broader audience. This guide provides a starting point for developers who’re keen to learn more about blockchain and development on top of Ethereum. It will be opinionated and not contain a full list of everything available. But rather, a concise list of highly recommended options, from my own experiences. </p>

<p>Once you’ve gone through all (or at least most) of the above, you should have a solid grasp of all the concepts. So now we can finally move on to the fun part: actually building stuff! </p>

</ul>
<p>The Ethereum portal covers sections per programming language, to help you filter out what’s relevant for you. Though JavaScript is most commonly used, I’d start with something that you’re already familiar with, to flatten the learning curve. Use the above only for future reference. As mentioned previously, I’m trying to keep it simple and offer a few recommended options, from my own experiences. Feel free to discover, try, and learn everything from the developer portals, once you’ve covered these.</p>
<h2>Courses</h2>
<ul>

<p>Above should cover everything you need to write your own smart contracts and build decentralized applications on top of Ethereum. </p>

<p>The goal of this guide is mainly to help new developers to enter the space and I won’t go into much depth on advanced topics, such as design &amp; architecture, scalability, privacy, etc.</p>
<p>But a few pointers, for those who feel up to it. </p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The following diagram is a stack representation of the enterprise Ethereum architecture. While this is aimed towards enterprises, it gives a good overview of the relationship between components and can be part of any implementation. </p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.wslyvh.com/static/1b23770e7ae9817bc9854bcd0dda76eb/5a190/eth-architecture.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="Enterprise Ethereum architecture stack" title="Enterprise Ethereum architecture stack" src="https://www.wslyvh.com/static/1b23770e7ae9817bc9854bcd0dda76eb/fcda8/eth-architecture.png" srcset="https://www.wslyvh.com/static/1b23770e7ae9817bc9854bcd0dda76eb/12f09/eth-architecture.png 148w,
https://www.wslyvh.com/static/1b23770e7ae9817bc9854bcd0dda76eb/e4a3f/eth-architecture.png 295w,
https://www.wslyvh.com/static/1b23770e7ae9817bc9854bcd0dda76eb/fcda8/eth-architecture.png 590w,
https://www.wslyvh.com/static/1b23770e7ae9817bc9854bcd0dda76eb/5a190/eth-architecture.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" loading="lazy">
  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>For more details check out the <a href="https://entethalliance.github.io/client-spec/spec.html#sec-smart-contract-tools-sublayer">specification</a> or <a href="https://entethalliance.org/resources/">Ethereum Enterprise Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see in the diagram, we’ve covered most from the application layer to the tooling, core blockchain, and networking layer. What’s missing really are the Enterprise 3 P’s.</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Permissioning</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this does not only apply to enterprise but applies to any Ethereum application. I’ll leave these for a future blog post.</p>
<h2>Security &amp; best practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/">Ethereum &amp; Smart contract security best practices</a>, ConsenSys Diligence</li>
<li><a href="https://yos.io/2019/11/10/smart-contract-development-best-practices/">Best Practices for Smart Contract Development</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For those of you who can’t get enough and have covered all of above. Here are a few more links that are often posting new updates and video-/blog series.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ethereumdev.io/">EthereumDev.io</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dappuniversity.com/">Dapp University</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/eattheblocks">Eat the blocks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.chainshot.com/">Ethereum Developer Bootcamp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, the best way to learn is by doing. So I’d recommend to go out, try to apply these skills in practice, engage with the community, and start contributing…</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute to open-source projects. Check out <a href="https://buidl-explorer.herokuapp.com/">BUIDL explorer</a> or find bounties to work on at <a href="https://gitcoin.co/explorer">Gitcoin</a></li>
<li>Join hackathons, such as <a href="https://www.ethglobal.co/">ETHGlobal</a> or <a href="http://gitcoin.co/hackathon">Gitcoin</a>. Make sure to <a href="https://medium.com/@wslyvh/preparing-for-a-blockchain-hackathon-38f27d2468b5">prepare yourself for a hackathon</a></li>
<li>Connect and engage with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/community/">global Ethereum community</a> or find a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/topics/ethereum/">local meetup group</a></li>
<li>A lot of companies are still hiring (remotely).  Jobs are posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://angel.co/jobs">AngelList</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://linkedin.com/jobs">LinkedIn</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptojobslist.com/">Crypto Jobs List</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://blocktribe.com/">Blocktribe</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Final note:</strong> I’ll try to keep this list updated, with the latest tools and developments. If there’s anything that you miss, any suggestions, or find any broken links, please feel free to reach out! That also includes questions that you might have, or feel stuck with any of the above.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>You've worked remotely, and you've worked in an office. You like both. You're not alone—there are countless people missing the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/never-go-back-office/611830/" rel="noopener">perks of going into an office</a>.</p><p>You know it’s not an either-or question. Legions of workers like you are all too aware that it's less about the location, and more about creating the proper mind space and vibe to get into your <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/flow-at-work/" rel="noopener">flow</a>. That's how you and your team get things done. </p><p>Just being able to work from home without this mixed in is a recipe for chaos and <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/how-to-prevent-workplace-burnout-on-your-team">burnout</a>. Not to mention being forced to work from home due to a pandemic is not the same as intentional remote work.</p><p>For a long, long time, research has shown that <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/07/to-be-happier-at-work-invest-more-in-your-relationships" rel="noopener">social connection inspires purpose, well-being, effectiveness</a>, and overall happiness in the workplace. And it’s very, very good for business in a number of ways. </p><p>While building these relationships is possible via video chat, it takes more effort and intention—something not all teams are taking into account. Get this: a whopping <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90433799/want-a-happy-employee-give-them-an-office" rel="noopener">77%</a> of people who work in open offices reported being happy in their jobs. The numbers remain more or less the same when private office spaces and cubicles come into the picture. People just like going into the office (even if they suppose they want to work from home).</p><p>So why all the fuss about remote-only? You don't want to choose between the two—you're not ready to cross that bridge yet. Just because the buzzword 'remote work' has put a stranglehold on the zeitgeist, doesn't mean you have to get on board.</p><p>I hear you: working from home exclusively, FOREVER actually doesn't sound that rad. But how do you put it into words? Hear me out.</p><p><strong>1. The office is not your enemy! It's poor work practices</strong></p><p>Think about the last time you wanted to storm out of a meeting or your office. What caused you to want to do this? Was it the neat whiteboard where you jot down all of your best ideas for new products or campaigns? Was it the coffee maker that gave you life some mornings when you couldn't even? Maybe it was the sweet lounge area where you have inspiring chats or a good laugh with Bob from IT?</p><p>I'm willing to bet it was none of the above. It was probably someone who talked over you in a meeting or booked a session that you didn't need to be in over your deep focus time. So, why does the office get all the flack? Your office was a destination that actually offered a lot. I’m just saying, I think the hate on the actual physical spaces must stop.</p><p>Instead, we should focus on building a stronger work culture and address the issues creating a bad one.</p><p><em>P.s. Could you imagine storming out of your own house? It would be so awkward and anti-climatic because you'd have to go back at some point that night.</em></p><p><strong>2. Not everyone has a sprawling home to work from</strong></p><p>Some people (maybe even most people these days) live in tiny studio apartments or share a flat with roommates who are also working from home. There's no space to roam, no areas to spread your wings or change the scenery up, and indeed, no rooms to have productive meetings free of children playing or your roommate's lousy taste in music.</p><p>Sure, there are ways to get around this at home. You could come up with a schedule for who gets what common area, when—or duel to the death. The point is, a team of expert designers probably crafted your office space to encourage movement and inspire creativity. It's difficult to mimic this at home where you just want to chill, wear flowy pants, and not care about anything other than <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-news-streaming-increase-during-office-hours-netflix/" rel="noopener">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185114/twitch-youtube-livestreaming-streamelements-coronavirus-quarantine-viewership-numbers" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, or reading a good book. Also, you probably don't have a degree in interior design, so there's that.</p><p><strong>3. Say it with me: Communication!</strong></p><p>We speak to one another through body language as much as we do with our words. So when it comes to communicating with coworkers, it's easy to see why being in an office makes it a little easier to get your message across without confusion. Every time we greet each other in the morning, we renew belonging cues. They help us feel connected to the environment and to each other. We add little deposits of trust to the relationships we share, helping to maintain them.</p><p>That's not to say office communication is perfect and that issues work themselves out without internal communications processes for support. It just means that you don't have the same handicap working in an office that you do when trying to express your ideas over a video call or <a href="https://slack.com/apps/A938TS1QS-range" rel="noopener">Slack</a>. You could gesticulate like a madman, but I'm not sure that will get you where you need to go. You're free to give it a try, though!</p><p>In any case, it's another +1 for being in an office.</p><p><strong>4.Taking your office perks for granted</strong></p><p>Who doesn't love a fully stocked snack wrack or a fridge with the latest dairy-free milk craze for your coffee obsession or bourgie flavored water with hard-to-pronounce names that spark loud conversations with coworkers, none of which you have to pay for out of pocket? As they say, talk is cheap, and so is not paying for your snacks.</p><p>If you're one of the few people still clinging to their New Years' resolution to nibble less and eat healthier, you may think working from home is a blessing in disguise. But then you look at your cupboard and find oreo cookies, hot Cheetos, and a ton of other crap that you had to get because you need emotional support after working way too many hours. Alternatively, in the last few years, office snacks have gotten healthier and healthier (mostly).</p><p>Plus, being at home is the ultimate cheat day excuse. Admit it: the office has just the right amount of social pressure to keep you accountable for those health goals you broadcasted to everyone in a two-mile radius. I'm just saying.</p><p><strong>5. The hidden fees of working from home</strong></p><p>On top of buying snacks out of your hard-earned moola (lame sauce), you may have noticed that your electricity bill and Amazon spending have skyrocketed. Who's paying for that?! You are my friend. You and you alone!</p><p>At that moment, you realize that your company was paying for a ton of stuff this whole time (who knew). Paying for it yourself is just less desirable. Some companies that get how much a home workspace and services matter let you expense part of your internet bill, desk purchase, office chair, and even gourmet coffee (you should ask!). But this isn't universal. Part of the point I'm making here is that not all home offices are created equal.</p><p><strong>6. (Work) is where the heart is</strong></p><p>But seriously, we need to separate productivity and work from the physical space we do it in. What's more important is being able to form bonds and connections with your team and establish practices that help you become a highly tuned working machine.</p><p>The hard truth is that for some—heck, maybe even most—this happens in a well-designed office that takes all of these ideas into account. There are distractions that you cannot control for when everyone is at home. It's one of the reasons why Range CEO, Dan, advocates for <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/collaboration-productivity/why-flexible-working-will-be-the-new-normal/?utm_source=cmswire.com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=cm&amp;utm_content=all-articles-rss" rel="noopener">flexible and windowed work</a>, which gives people and teams permission to create the schedules and environments that work best for their productivity and sense of belonging. It could mean working exclusively at home for some, and in the office for others. Or maybe it's a little of both. The point is that 9-5 work is outdated and outmoded, and runs counter to the way modern work life functions.</p><p>While this is a rant about the joys of the office, this is a +1 for anywhere you want to be!</p><p><strong>7. It's okay to step away from your desk (ICYMI while working from home)</strong></p><p>There have been reports recently about how people are <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/remote-work-challenges/" rel="noopener">overworking themselves</a> during this critical time when they should be finding balance. They figure they don't have a commute now so they can just work more and later. Not only is sitting non-stop in front of your computer terrible for your physical health, it's bad for your mental health as well.</p><p>Traditionally, going into the office and coming home was a nifty marker to wind down one part of your life and engage with another. Eliminate the office, and you need to create new ways to do this. Unfortunately, this is tricky and will look different for everyone and their situation. And not enough teams are thinking critically about this. The result is burnout and complete obliteration of productivity. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydmPh4MXT3g" rel="noopener">Sweet Brown</a> has infamously remarked, "ain't nobody got time for that!"</p><p>The office is a super useful shorthand for this type of switching that helps us maintain a sense of balance and happiness.</p><p><strong>8. I promise, you're not an alien for wanting human contact outside of your living unit</strong></p><p>Last, but certainly not least, being in the office means you interact with real-life humans, not just digital, video versions of them.</p><p>While you can schedule social time, and it can work well, there's just no way to replace the spontaneity of running into people and sparking up a great conversation. This style of connecting isn't for everyone. But, remotely-only offices and cultures take this popular, age-old way of building relationships off the table from those who value it. Not so good. You have to be much more intentional about how you build and maintain relationships, which can feel like, well, work.</p><p>Remote work certainly has its perks: no commutes, more time with people close to you, family and friends, and privacy. But it doesn't mean that the office has no value.</p><p>There are countless reasons to miss the office that are quite specific to you, your workplace, and the community you've built. It's about more than singing the praises of remote work—it's about acknowledging what makes people productive.</p><p>Oh! And before I let you go, be sure to checkout, <a href="https://www.range.co/product/check-ins">Range</a>! It's seriously an excellent way to keep up with your team, in the office, or remote, and we've baked building relationships with your coworkers into the cake.

<p>This is particularly frustrating as the Concorde ‘B’ model was already designed and the engines were available for incorporation into the next airframe number 217.</p>



<p>This was the aircraft the airlines really needed and the aircraft the manufacturers wanted to build. Unfortunately political pressure intervened and the will to proceed with it simply evaporated.</p>



<p>The new engine (the Olympus 610 +25%) had, as its name suggests, more thrust and eliminated noisy, fuel-guzzling afterburners.</p>



<p>The wing was redesigned, had leading edge ‘droop’ and carried more fuel. With better lift/drag, specific fuel consumption and more fuel the range of the Concorde Model ‘B’ increased over the original Concorde ‘A’ Model.</p>
</div><div data-packed="false" data-vertical-text="false" id="i2kylena"><p>Just four months after Concorde began her scheduled services in 1976, a Concorde ‘B’ model was first discussed and designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds.</p>

<p>It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy reheat. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.This would have given 500&nbsp;mi (805 km) additional range even with greater payload, and would have made new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.</p>



<p>During 1976 Jacques Mitterrand, the Chairman and Managing Director of Aerospatiale, submitted a proposal to investigate an improved version of Concorde – the “Version B” to Mr. Cavaille, French Secretary of State to Transport a similar letter was submitted to the British government at that time.</p>



<p>The letter that he sent elaborated on the quality of the work which had been carried out and the know-how that had now been acquired by the four French and British engineering companies (Aerospatiale, BAe, Rolls Royce and SNECMA). In this letter he also stressed the importance of the role that the manufacturers of Concorde could have in the development of a second-generation supersonic aircraft, that would be foreseeable during the 1990’s, could lead to probably in some form of a collaboration between Europe and the United States.</p>



<p>An exploratory study was actually already underway during this time, looking into upgrading the capabilities of the current Concorde design for the early 1980’s. The letter submitted also gave the official go ahead for this exploratory study and proposed a full feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.</p>



<p>Due to the manufactures having great difficulty selling the remaining five Concorde airframes that were built during the initial production run, Concorde 216 (G-BOAF) was to be the last Concorde ‘A’ built, and 217 was planned to be a Concorde ‘B’ version. Had Concorde ‘B’ been built, what type of future would we be living in now? If the additional range and performance had been available then many more airlines might have purchased Concorde and passenger air travel as we know it today might have been completely different.</p>



<p>She was planned to have a range approaching and even exceeding 5000 miles. But it is easy to imagine the potential range of Concorde ‘B’ design, when you consider that the Concorde “A” model used by British Airways had a design specification range of 3690 miles, had to regularly fly 4250 miles on a route between London Heathrow and Barbados. This was made possible due to operational improvements that pushed the range of Concorde ‘A’ to nearly 4500 miles. The improvements have included small changes to the aerodynamics of the original model’s specifications. One interesting fact is that the take-off weight was made very low and close to the figures estimated for the Concorde ‘B’ design.</p>



<p>The Concorde ‘B’ design would of also benefited from increased subsonic performance and reduced noise emissions.</p>

<p>The cost of the Concorde Project was massive and with the poor sales of Concorde, and cancelled options from airlines, adding to that the rising cost of aviation fuel during the 1970s, the development of the Model ‘B’ version was considered too expensive and cancelled. Although the study carried out was a pretty comprehensive one and could of given Concorde a real future in during the years to come right into the 1990s and even on into the 2000s, after this time it was generally expected that a new generation SST with a new type of variable cycle engines would enter into service (BAe AST3 or Aerospatiale Alliance)</p>



<h3>Exploratory and feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.</h3>



<p>The study into a Concorde ‘B’ design had two aims:</p>



<p>1. To ensure the expansion and future demand for supersonic transport (SST), where the Anglo-French group was now and into the future as the main and only player,</p>



<p>2. To maintain the high knowledge level gained by the manufacturers in Britain and France, and to provide a solid position for the participation in a future program of a second-generation SST.</p>





<p>This feasibility study, was planned to last 9 months and was estimated to cost 9 million French francs, it was to comprise three areas:</p>



<p>1. Engineering</p>



<p>2. Development costs</p>



<p>3. Markets</p>



<p>If this exploratory and feasibility study was to confirmed an economic interest for the manufacturers, and then led to the decision of the launch of an improved version of Concorde, such an improved version (allowing for a 5 year development programme) could be ready by spring 1982 for the 17th production Concorde 217</p>



<p>Civil aviation history shows that almost all new aircraft constituted a base point for the start of improved versions (The Boeing 747-100 evolved into today’s 747-400) and at this stage this was the plan for the Concorde program.</p>



<p>The interest in this development process would have been beneficial to both the airlines and the manufacturers of Concorde:</p>



<p>1. For the airlines, it would have offered performance improvements (lower direct operation costs, extension of the operating range, and reduction of environmental effects) while conserving the existing investments in crew training, maintenance procedures, etc.</p>



<p>2. For the manufacturers, it would have made it possible to carry out these improvements at a minimum capital cost. Indeed the development of the initial production version generally revealed aerodynamic areas where gains could be made along with structural margins, but these could not be exploited due to the time constraints in getting Concorde into passenger service successfully.</p>



<p>3. If the decision to build the B model would have been taken, the modifications would have been relatively inexpensive as they were just some minor changes to the existing production process, allowing the majority of the tooling to be maintained. The high level of knowledge that was gained during the certification of the current model would have greatly reduced time and costs during the certification of the B model.</p>



<p>These considerations should have applied particularly to the case of Concorde, considering the exceptional degree of innovation obtained and the great amount of technical knowledge accumulated during the twelve years of development of the initial production version.</p>



<p>The broad objectives of the Concorde ‘B’ version were to ensure the expansion of the network of routes that supersonic aircraft could use.</p>



<p>The following improvements were considered to be necessary:</p>



<h3>The Reduction of&nbsp; harmful acoustic effects on the airport environment:</h3>



<p>Although the level of noise produced by Concorde at takeoff and landing is equivalent to that of the first generation long haul aircraft in service (B 707, DC8), only the second generation of long haul aircraft (B747, DC10, L1011) equipped with high-bypass jet engines satisfied the new international noise rules. With the reaction of the United States, which had at the start of scheduled Concorde services not accepted the use of Concorde on their territory, it would be important to reduce the level of noise generated by the aircraft.</p>

<p>Poor cache utilization can cripple your performance and limit your ability to optimize elsewhere. This makes optimizing your cache one of the most impactful changes you can make. This piece will provide some tips on optimizing your cache and help you avoid some common pitfalls that can tank your performance. By looking at examples of what isn’t cache friendly, we will learn what is.</p>

<p>This post is aimed at developers familiar with lower-level languages like C++ and assumes some exposure to concepts like dynamic memory allocation and pointers.</p>

<p>As with everything performance related, there is no one-size-fits-all solution that will work for every problem, so always profile before and after changes. Likewise, I’m a human first and programmer second so apologies if I got something wrong here, this is a very complex topic!</p>

<p>Part one of this extended piece will cover the basics such as how much cache you have, the granularity of the cache and the limits of the compiler's ability to help you.</p>
									
<h2>Cache sizes &amp; cache lines</h2>

<p>Memory gets increasingly more expensive the faster you need to access it. The amount of cache you have is tied to your specific CPU and has no relation to the amount of RAM you have. Even if you have 16GB of RAM, your CPU likely has less than 16MB of cache; and unless you have server or workstation grade CPU, less than 1mb of L1 cache split across all cores.</p>

<p>CPU-Z says the following about my CPU:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://www.inorris.com/Blog/CacheCrashCourse/cpuz.png" alt="Output from CPU-Z for the author's CPU">
	<figcaption>A high end desktop CPU with 32KB of cache per core.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The “cache line” on a modern processor is typically 64 bytes. The cache line is the minimum granularity of a fetch from main memory into any cache. Only need 10 bytes? Tough! The processor is fetching 64. Want 65 bytes? The CPU is now fetching you 128! Those 64 byte blocks are “aligned”, so if your data structure falls across a boundary, you may pay the cost for several cache lines.</p>

<p>When data is fetched from main memory you pay a penalty called a cache miss. If you’re loading a lot of data sequentially, the CPU may be able to predict what you’ll need next by loading it in advance. If you’re reading a large data structure but the data you need is spread out or accessed erratically, you might have several cache misses until all the data is loaded.   In this scenario you’re paying a high cost for every byte read. Some cache misses are unavoidable, our goal is to eliminate the avoidable ones.</p>

<h2>Compiler optimizations</h2>

<p>Compilers are fantastic at identifying dead code and reorganizing to maximize the CPU pipeline, hiding cache latency and much more. However, there’s one thing compilers won’t do – optimise your structures.</p>

<p>It is up to the programmer to identify dead data within structures and classes. The compiler can’t know if you’re going to use the structure for something later (like reading from disk), or if the programmer knows something about memory layout that the compiler doesn’t (for example embedded hardware). As a result, it won’t change your layout beyond the alignment rules we discuss later.</p>

<p>Note, this applies to classes and structures only and not local variables, function parameters and so on. The compiler will happily eliminate those for you, and all the code associated with it if it knows the value is never used.</p>

<h2>Big N, Big :O</h2>

<p>The saying goes that you shouldn’t prematurely optimize, however the larger your N, the more care you need to take with the design of a system. Some design consideration now can pay dividends later when system designs are harder to optimize for performance.</p>

<p>Here are a few rules to make your life easier:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Design your external interface to be agnostic of the internal data organization. Avoid exposing internal structures.</li>
	<li>If your system can take ownership (or control creation of) for data it inherits, this will give you more flexibility.</li>
	<li>The fewer places you are allocating the better. Less allocations means less indirection.</li>
	<li>Minimize inheritance and prefer composition. A lot of interfaces on an object means it is over-generalized and will suffer from poor data locality.</li>
	<li>Your classes and structures should do as few things as possible with as little data as possible.</li>
</ul>

    <section>

        <div>
          <div>

              
    <div>
      
            
      <p>June 19th 2020 EU introduced the new <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf" target="_blank">Cyber Security standard</a> for Consumer Internet of Things products. Following the rapid growth in connected devices combined with the increased risks associated with insecure devices, the EU hopes the new standard will lead to better security practises and more vendors adopting a security by design principle when developing new connected consumer products.</p>

<h3>Why this new standard?</h3>
<p>The IoT market behaves like the wild-west. The lack of regulation, abundance of cheap technology and the promise of enormous markets and profits have evolved into a scary and unfortunate reality.  Vendors of connected devices have little to no incentive to make their products secure. Technologically illiterate consumers who barely know how to configure their home router fail to use their purchasing power to command security in the products. The result is a marketplace where neither the demand nor the supply side value security. Hence, a world of highly insecure and fragile connected devices have emerged.</p>
<p>For some years, the EU realized potential risks following the digital revolution, and therefore decided to put forward standards to set the bar with regards to what is to be expected from connected devices. A standard is the first important step towards eventual regulation.</p>
<h3>The new standard in brief</h3>
<p>The EU sought to make the standard outcome oriented, as opposed to prescriptive. This allows vendors to comply without any stifling of innovation. The bar was set to establish a baseline of minimum security measures to protect against the most fundamental and elementary cyber security attacks.</p>
<p>The standard consists of 13 provisions. We are happy to report that our own Mender product comes with so many security features that almost half of these provisions will be covered if Mender is being used to secure an IoT device.</p>
<p>The 13 provisions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>No universal default passwords </li>
<li>Implement a means to manage reports of vulnerabilities </li>
<li>Keep software updated </li>
<li>Securely store sensitive security parameters </li>
<li>Communicate securely </li>
<li>Minimize exposed attack surfaces</li>
<li>Ensure software integrity</li>
<li>Ensure that personal data is secure </li>
<li>Make systems resilient to outages</li>
<li>Examine system telemetry data</li>
<li>Make it easy for users to delete user data </li>
<li>Make installation and maintenance of devices easy </li>
<li>Validate input data </li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these provisions have easy to understand and tangible sub provisions. An example would be: <em>“Provision 5.3-1: All software components in consumer IoT devices should be securely updateable”</em>. </p>
<p>Further, each sub provision comes with examples equally easy to understand and tangible. An example would be:<em> “The first stage boot loader on a device is written once to device storage and from then on is immutable.”</em></p>
<p>Jump to <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf" target="_blank">page 13</a> in the standard to read more about each of the provisions and its sub provisions and examples.</p>
<h3>Expected implications of the new standard</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this standard does not address the fundamental marketplace problem (illiterate consumers and profit seeking vendors). Consumers will remain ignorant to their insecure devices and the vendors continue to push for profit and view security as an extra unnecessary cost. Only naive politicians should expect a change in behavior following a standard like this.</p>
<p>The main implication of the new standard lies in its referenceable value. The EU finally has a recommended way to secure the world’s connected devices. </p>
<p>This standard already serves as the basis for UK’s law to require security labelling on connected devices (read more about that <a href="https://mender.io/blog/united-kingdom-to-introduce-security-labelling-on-connected-devices" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>
<p>Security auditing and consulting companies now possess a practical check-list to use in client work. By complying with the EU standard, devices will be orders of magnitude more secure than the typical IoT product of today.</p>
<p>If we don’t see a drastic improvement in the security of connected devices, the EU will impose regulations. When this happens this standard can be expected to form the basis for such regulation.</p>
<h3>GDPR for IoT is one big disaster away</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, a standard will not fix the fundamental demand-supply problem related to the security of IoT products. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems like a big disaster following insecure IoT devices must occur before politicians step up and use their legislation sledge hammer. </p>
<p>Hopefully, such a big disaster comes in the form of geopolitical defense/military realizations that will not impact the life or health of humans. Worse case, somewhere in the world, we will witness some sort of critical infrastructure blow-up. Such an incident will serve as a huge wake-up call for everyone. When it happens, in the same way Facebook and social media brought us GDPR, such disaster will bring us strict IoT regulations.</p>

They allow you to link a remote database to PostgreSQL and represent it as a set of foreign tables that behave like normal ones.</p><p>Imagine being able to run SQL on a MongoDB collection or querying MySQL data from your PostgreSQL instance. Or, imagine running a <code>JOIN</code> between an SQLite file and an Oracle cluster without having to write and maintain an ETL job.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss PostgreSQL foreign data wrappers and how <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/">Splitgraph</a> makes it much easier for anyone to use them.</p></section><section><h2 id="using-a-custom-fdw-with-splitgraph">Using a custom FDW with Splitgraph</h2><p>This example (<a href="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw" as="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw">source code on GitHub</a>) will show you how to write a custom <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">foreign data wrapper</a> using Multicorn. <a href="https://github.com/Segfault-Inc/Multicorn" as="https://github.com/Segfault-Inc/Multicorn">Multicorn</a> is a PostgreSQL extension that makes it possible to write foreign data wrappers in Python.</p><p>We will then integrate it with Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command. This will make it queryable from the Splitgraph engine and allow Splitgraph to use it in <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/splitfiles" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/splitfiles">Splitfiles</a>.</p><p>In particular, we will be running a foreign data wrapper that queries the <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API" as="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">Firebase Hacker News API</a>. This will let us run SQL queries on the top, best and new stories from Hacker News, as well as Show HNs and Ask HNs.</p><p>This foreign data wrapper returns a list of rows from the remote database without performing any filtering. However, Multicorn also passes qualifiers and sort keys to the Python extension. This allows filtering to happen on the remote database as well, if it supports it.</p><p>To run this demo, you will need to have <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started" as="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" as="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</a>.</p><section><h3 id="clone-the-repository">Clone the repository</h3><p>Clone Splitgraph and go to the <a href="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw" as="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw">example project</a>:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span><span>$</span> <span><span>git</span> clone https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.git</span></span>

</span></code></pre></section></section><section><h2 id="what-are-foreign-data-wrappers">What are foreign data wrappers?</h2><p>The easiest way to describe foreign data wrappers is by considering UNIX files. A UNIX file isn't always pointing to a local file on your disk. It could be a file stored on NFS, in a remote S3 bucket or even a shim that lets you manipulate a device on your machine.</p><p>In UNIX, a file is a pretty strong abstraction that doesn't get broken. An IDE doesn't need to know that the file it's editing is on a remote filesystem. It can work with it by issuing the same ordinary read and write calls. Someone who writes a new filesystem doesn't need to make sure that it's compatible with all existing tools. Instead, they can write a driver that mounts the filesystem to a mountpoint.</p><p>PostgreSQL FDWs resemble mounting in that respect. Foreign tables mostly behave like normal tables and can receive the same <code>SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE</code> queries. Behind the scenes, the wrapper's only job is to emit tuples.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-should-i-use-fdws">Why should I use FDWs?</h2><p>Foreign data wrappers are a great alternative to ETL. Instead of loading data into your warehouse that you might never use, you can mount the remote database and query it on demand.</p><p>Because they integrate with the PostgreSQL query planner, FDWs have a decent performance. The FDW can push down qualifiers and even aggregations to the remote database. FDWs can report the rough costs of starting a scan and fetching a tuple back to the query planner. This lets the query planner choose, for example, whether running multiple small single scans or one big one is a better strategy for satisfying a JOIN.</p><p>It's straightforward to write your own FDW and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html" as="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a> covers it extensively. The <a href="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/" as="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/">hello-world FDW</a> that returns "Hello, World" in a table is only a couple hundred lines of C code. If you prefer to focus on development simplicity, you can use Multicorn instead of raw C.</p><p>There are plenty of open-source foreign data wrappers available. They let you query other RDBMSs, NoSQL databases, CSV files or column stores. The <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers" as="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">PostgreSQL wiki</a> lists some of them.</p><p>Using a foreign data wrapper for your database or data source gives you access to a huge ecosystem of software that works with PostgreSQL. We can almost call this a network effect. A new data source that is accessible via an FDW enhances everything that works with PostgreSQL.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-use-fdws-with-splitgraph">Why use FDWs with Splitgraph?</h2><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">Foreign data wrappers</a> are one of the ways that Splitgraph aims to make data engineers' and data scientists' work easier.</p><p>Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command handles the boilerplate around FDW initialization.

People can’t work together effectively if they don’t understand each other; and the traditional “directory” of names, titles, and contact information doesn’t provide the context people need in today’s fast-paced, cross-functional, increasingly remote workplace.</span></p><p><span>We believe that everyone should be empowered to find and understand their colleagues, and also the teams and projects at their organization. In Rimeto, each person has a profile that represents them holistically and authentically at work - an insightful and automatically-generated picture of their experience, affiliations, skills, focus areas, and much more.</span></p><p><span>Like Rimeto, Slack transforms the way organizations collaborate. Joining Slack is a special opportunity to accelerate Rimeto’s mission and impact with greater reach, expanded resources, and the support of Slack’s impressive global team. As part of Slack, we will be working to ensure that Slack is the place people find and learn about the people they work with - both inside their organization and beyond.</span></p><p><span>We’re proud that many prominent organizations have deployed Rimeto to their global workforces.</span><strong> </strong><span>To our customers: we deeply appreciate your trust in us. We will continue to deliver the great experience you value. And we’re excited to bring new capabilities to the 750,000 organizations using Slack, including 65 of the Fortune 100. We look forward to sharing our product roadmap over the coming months. If you're interested in Rimeto for your organization,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://slack.com/rimeto"><u>click here</u></a><span>&nbsp;to contact our team.</span></p><p><span>And there would be no Rimeto without our tremendously talented team. Thank you for your passion, creativity, and customer obsession. </span></p><p><span>We’re also grateful to our investors, who’ve been exceptional partners, especially </span><a href="https://www.usvp.com/team/rick-lewis/"><u>Rick Lewis</u></a><span> (</span><a href="https://www.usvp.com/"><u>U.S. Venture Partners</u></a><span>), </span><a href="https://bowcapital.com/team/grady-burnett/"><u>Grady Burnett</u></a><span> (</span><a href="https://bowcapital.com/"><u>Bow Capital</u></a><span>), </span><a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/people/ray-dalio"><u>Ray Dalio</u></a><span> and the team at </span><a href="https://floodgate.com/"><u>Floodgate</u></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Finally, our deepest thanks to our family, friends, and advisors who have supported us on this journey.</span></p><p><span>It’s been an honor, and we’ll aim to make you all proud in the next chapter at Slack.</span></p><h4><span>Ted Zagat, Neville Bowers &amp; Maxwell Hayman</span></h4><p><span>Please read Slack’s </span><a href="https://slackhq.com/slack-acquisition-connecting-employees"><u>post about the acquisition here</u></a><span></span></p><p><span>For press inquiries, contact </span><a href="mailto:ssharpe@slack-corp.com"><u>ssharpe@slack-corp.com</u></a><span></span></p><h4><span>Interested in Rimeto for your organization?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Newsletters are great, but too much of a distraction if they end up straight in your inbox with no predictable schedule.</p>
<p><a href="https://hey.com/">Hey</a> — the email service by the Basecamp folks — solves this by creating a separate space for newsletters, "The Feed". Here newsletters are shown in a timeline UI without read states. You can casually scroll through newsletters whenever you feel like it, and you do not see them in your main inbox. For most newsletters, this is a great experience.</p>
<p>I liked this concept so much that I decided to integrate it in <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a>, my SaaS that lets people receive an email digest from their favorite sources (even DHH himself <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1214356945932435457?s=20">uses it</a>).</p>
<p>My implementation works like this: when signing up for Mailbrew, you get your own email address to receive newsletters: <code>&lt;username&gt;@inbox.mailbrew.com</code>. </p>
<p>All emails sent to that address end up in daily digest with the schedule you decided. We also created a Hey-style feed browsable at <code>app.mailbrew.com/inbox</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://frankdilo.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/mailbrew-inbox.gif" alt="Mailbrew Inbox in action"></p>
<p>We built all of this in a couple of weeks and it was easier to setup than I originally predicted. The tooling around email is great these days.</p>
<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>Amazon SES handles our inbound emails with some help from Lambda.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an email arrives at an <code>@inbox.mailbrew.com</code> address, SES uploads the raw email message to S3 and launches a lambda function. Configuring this from the AWS console was 5-10 minutes work.</li>
<li>The lambda function calls Mailbrew's backend (a majestic Django monolith), webhook-style, with recipient address, sender address, and message id.</li>
<li>If we don't recognize the recipient address (no user with that username) we send a special response to the lambda that causes the email to bounce.</li>
<li>If the recipient address matches, then we use the message id to retrieve the raw message content from S3 and process it.</li>
<li>Processing the message consists in extracting the <code>text/html</code> version of the email, applying some basic CSS styles, uploading this processed version to S3 and saving the message metadata in Postgres for easy retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>In the frontend, emails are presented in a CRA React app. We embed the content of each email in a dedicated <code>iframe</code>. </p>
<p>A cool trick that we used was to create the <code>iframe</code> in JavaScript and set its content programmatically instead of settings its <code>src</code> property. This granted us an higher degree of customization and allowed us to do things like having all links inside newsletters open in new tabs.</p>
<p>The HTML of the emails in the S3 bucket is private, so we generate signed urls backend-side to show them. </p>
<p>One last cool thing we wanted to do was to have a link that allowed to read a single newsletter without the hassle of authentication. When opening a newsletter from the links in the daily email digest that we send users, we didn't want them to have to authenticate each time (almost a certainty with multiple devices and the in-app browsers of email clients).</p>
<p>We achieved this by using JSON Web Tokens. Each linked newsletter email in the digest has a token in the URL allowing read-only access to just that message. These links don't look great, but they work, are sharable, and don't require me to keep any state in the backend.</p>
<hr>
<p>This update brings the product closer to my vision of <strong>the single email you read everyday</strong> to stay on top of your game without wasting time. </p>
<p>You can now create a daily digest with Newsletters, Hacker News posts, RSS feeds, Reddit links, <a href="http://dev.to/">Dev.to</a> posts, YouTube videos and much more. The best part is that you receive this just once per day, on your own schedule. </p>
<p>Mailbrew is how I have stayed informed for the past 6 months and here is my <a href="https://app.mailbrew.com/frankdilo/morning-brew-fsKPZhXeFabm">daily digest</a> if you want to check out what the product is capable of.</p>
<p>I am <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo">@frankdilo</a> on Twitter if you have any feedback about Mailbrew or this post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<p>Bashing the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seems to have become one of American activists’ favourite hobbies in the tech field. Some criticism is entirely justified. But many claims that the GDPR is “counterproductive” or “misses the point” are based on misconceptions, rather than an accurate understanding of European data protection laws.</p>
<p>As a result, several US privacy advocates have therefore suggested alternative principles or rules… many of which, actually, have been part of EU data protection law since 1995.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://twitter.com/hugoroyd/status/1246024493144911873">as promised</a>, here is:</p>
<p><strong>The GDPR as accidentally explained by people in the US who criticize the GDPR for its pitfalls, while calling for what’s actually in the GDPR</strong></p>
<p>If you have other examples to illustrate this, let me know so I can add them to this post. I may update this post from time to time, so <a href="https://hroy.eu/tags/gdprExplainedByUS/index.atom">subscribe to the feed</a> to get notified!</p>
<p><em>A short note:</em> My intention with this post is to help you, my reader from the US or elsewhere, understand better what’s actually in the GDPR. I have great respect for many of the people mentioned below (some of whom I consider or have considered personal heroes). I hope they are fine with a bit of teasing ;-)</p>
<h2 id="collection">1. The problem starts not with “data use” but with “data collection”</h2>
<h3 id="snowdenwu">Edward Snowden and Tim Wu (November 2019)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Snowden also directed some criticism at data privacy authorities that have tried to step up regulation on companies over how they handle user data. He said the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation […] “misplaces the problem.”</p>
<p>“The problem isn’t data protection, the problem is data collection,” Snowden said. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/04/edward-snowden-warns-about-data-collection-surveillance-at-web-summit.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Edward Snowden said this at the Web Summit: “I think GDPR is not the solution, but the problem is with data collection not data use. It gives a false sensation of reassurance.” What are your thoughts on this?</em></p>
<p>[Tim Wu:] I think he has a point…that’s what my criticism of GDPR is. It doesn’t actually stop anyone from doing anything. Collect all you want…and I think that’s where the problem starts. I think he’s onto something. <a href="https://gdpr.report/news/2019/11/18/privsecny-tim-wu-on-gdpr-and-data-privacy-practices-in-the-us/">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edward Snowden and Tim Wu argue that regulations on data use are not sufficient to protect people. For them, a good regulation should start with data collection.</p>
<p>That is why, since 1995<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, EU data protection law regulates not only data use, but also the collection of personal data.</p>
<p>More specifically, the GDPR covers the processing of personal data. Processing is defined in the GDPR as “<em>any operation</em>” performed on personal data. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1489-1-1">Article 4(2) of the GDPR</a> includes data “<em>collection</em>” explicitly.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)</a> sets the principle of “<em>data minimisation</em>”, and also provides that personal data must be “<em>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</em>.”</p>
<p>If personal data is collected in breach of these rules, the company responsible for the infringement may be fined up to 4 % of their global annual turnover (or EUR 20,000,000 if higher). Authorities may also order the company to destroy the data collected in breach – regardless of whether the data was ever used or not.</p>
<h3 id="richard-stallman-april-2018-or-december-2019">Richard Stallman (April 2018 or December 2019)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many ways to use data to hurt people that the only safe database is the one that was never collected. Thus, instead of the EU’s approach (in the GDPR) of mainly regulating how personal data may be used, I propose a law to stop systems from collecting personal data.</p>
<p>The robust way to do that, the way that can’t be set aside at the whim of a government, is to require systems to be built so as not to collect data about persons. The basic principle is that a system must be designed not to collect certain data, if its basic function can be carried out without that data. Improving efficiency must explicitly not count as a justification for collecting more data. <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/real-privacy-laws.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Stallman argues that laws must prohibit data collection if it is not necessary or not justified, and that systems must be designed not to collect certain data.</p>
<p>That is why, since 1995, EU data protection law regulates not only data use, but also the collection of personal data (see <a href="#snowdenwu">above</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, since 2018, the GDPR has extended the set of rules with the principles of data protection “by design” and “by default”.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e3063-1-1">Article 25</a> provides, specifically, that systems must be designed to implement data minimisation effectively. In addition, technical and organisational measures must by default ensure that “<em>only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected […].</em>”</p>
<p>One last bit: Richard Stallman argues that “improving efficiency” of a system must not be a justification for collecting personal data.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)</a> already provides that personal data must be “<em>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</em>.” Therefore, it seems that Richard Stallman’s interpretation of this principle means that “improving efficiency” may never be considered legitimate. Do you agree?</p>
<h2 id="consent">2. Individuals’ consent is not the right approach for privacy</h2>
<h3 id="maciej">Maciej Cegłowski (April 2020)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The European approach to privacy legislation has been to add layers of complexity, based on a kabuki dance of individual consent, where all that is needed are some strong legal limits on what data can be collected and how long it can be stored. <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1245699326522712064">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maciej argues that basing privacy legislation on individual consent is not the right approach and, instead, regulations should provide strong legal limits on data collection and data retention.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That is why, since 1995, individual consent is only <em>one</em> among six legal bases that allow lawful collection of personal data. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1">Article 6</a> of the GDPR requires at least one of six legal bases to be applicable. In many circumstances, “consent” is not considered as an adequate basis (e.g.&nbsp;in employee-employer relationships).</p>
<p><span id="consent-conditions">Even where consent may be considered adequate, it must fulfil strong conditions: to be a “<em>freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication</em>” of agreement expressed “<em>by a statement or by a clear affirmative action.</em>” (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1489-1-1">Article 4(11)</a>)</span></p>
<p>If you thought that it’s sufficient to obtain consent to anything by checking a box to read and agree to the terms of service, or that merely browsing a website meant accepting cookies — you’ve been misled by the kabuki dance of people who wished the GDPR was centered around weak individual consent. In spite of GDPR strengthening conditions for consent, the online ad and tracking industry is still trying with their complex cookie banners and settings!</p>
<p>And, where sensitive data is concerned:</p>
<ul>
<li>collection is prohibited as a general rule,</li>
<li>unless explicit consent has been obtained and no EU or national laws rule out consent<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, or</li>
<li>unless one of the nine other exemptions listed in Article 9(2) applies (many of which require a EU or national law).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the GDPR provides the principle of “<em>storage limitation</em>” in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)(c)</a>.</p>
<p>Pursuant to this principle, personal data must be “<em>kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed</em>” i.e.&nbsp;when data is not necessary any more, it must be destroyed or anonymized.</p>
<p>The GDPR allows, however, for retaining data longer, in particular for archival, research or statistical purposes - subject to certain conditions (see Article 5 and Article 89 among others).</p></li>
<li><p>For the argument on data <a href="#collection">collection</a>, see above.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><small>To be entirely fair, and exhaustive — specific regulations may provide otherwise. The GDPR as its title suggests, is a “general” body of law. In certain circumstances, specific rules may contravene the general principles stated above. For instance, since 2009, the “EU cookie directive” (which modifies the “ePrivacy Directive” of 2002) requires consent as the <em>only</em> available basis for storing information or identifiers on a user’s device, or for accessing such stored information. There are, however, some exceptions, i.e.&nbsp;if necessary to provide services expressly requested…</small></p>
<h3 id="richard-stallman-april-2018-or-december-2019-1">Richard Stallman (April 2018 or December 2019)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The EU’s GDPR regulation is well-meant, but does not go very far. It will not deliver much privacy because its rules are too lax. They permit collecting any data if it is somehow useful to the system, and it is easy to come up with a way to make any particular data useful for something.</p>
<p>The GDPR makes much of requiring users (in some cases) to give consent for collection of their data, but that doesn’t do much good. System designers have become expert at manufacturing consent (to repurpose Chomsky’s phrase). Most users consent to a site’s terms without reading them; a company that required users to trade their first-born child got consent from plenty of users. Then again, when a system is crucial for modern life, like buses and trains, users ignore the terms because refusal of consent is too painful to consider.</p>
<p>To restore privacy, we must stop surveillance before it even asks for consent. <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/real-privacy-laws.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Stallman argues that it is too easy to trick users into consenting to the collection of their data, and that is it too easy to claim that data is “somehow useful”. Instead, we should stop surveillance before it even asks for consent.</p>
<p>That is why, under EU data protection laws:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where individual consent is an adequate legal basis (which is not always the case), the GDPR puts strong legal conditions on what valid consent requires (see <a href="#consent-conditions">above</a>), so it cannot be considered “easy” to trick people into giving consent.</p></li>
<li><p>Where data is collected and used in connection with a contract (e.g.&nbsp;terms and conditions of an online service), only data that is “<em>necessary</em>” may be lawfully processed.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1">Article 6</a> provides that processing in that context must be “<em>necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract</em>” — it is, therefore, not sufficient to consider that the data is “somehow useful”.</p></li>

Inspired by Docker and Git, it works on top of PostgreSQL and integrates seamlessly with anything that uses PostgreSQL. Our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/explore" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/explore">data catalog</a> already includes over 40,000 datasets from government open data portals, all queryable via SQL.</p><p>The Splitgraph catalog classifies these datasets as <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/external-repositories">external repositories</a>. These are different from the default <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/repositories">Splitgraph repositories</a>, which are collections of <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/images">Splitgraph images</a>. Yet Splitgraph allows you to query them in the same way as you do Splitgraph images. For example, you can use SQL to query any repository or <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#using-metabase-to-join-and-plot-data-from-multiple-data-portals" as="/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#using-metabase-to-join-and-plot-data-from-multiple-data-portals"><code>JOIN</code> between multiple of them</a>. Or you can use Splitfiles to <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#splitfile" as="/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#splitfile">build reproducible datasets</a> from them. And every external repository includes an <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/publish-rest-api">auto-generated PostgREST API</a>.</p><p>External repositories allow Splitgraph Cloud to index live data without actually ingesting it. This way, you can use the catalog to discover live data. But you only need to ingest it when you're ready to query it, or snapshot it as part of a Splitgraph image.</p></section><section><h2 id="data-should-be-discoverable-and-composable">Data should be discoverable and composable</h2><p>Many services exist for cataloging data and making it discoverable. For example, <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/" as="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/">Google Dataset Search</a> provides a nice interface for searching and discovering datasets (in fact, <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?query=opd%20crimes&amp;docid=jrM9a8yTUXMZaY1QAAAAAA%3D%3D" as="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?query=opd%20crimes&amp;docid=jrM9a8yTUXMZaY1QAAAAAA%3D%3D">it even includes Splitgraph repositories</a>). The problem is, the data is fragmented and siloed across different data portals. It's nice to be able to search for data and download a CSV file. But most datasets are uninteresting in isolation. The real power comes from the ability to combine datasets and query them together.</p><p>Splitgraph does not only provide an index for discovering open data. It also provides the tools for composing open datasets together. For example, mounting the data from the <a href="https://data.cambridgema.gov/" as="https://data.cambridgema.gov">Cambridge</a> and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/" as="https://data.cityofchicago.org">Chicago</a> data portals is as simple as running two commands:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span><span>$</span> <span>sgr <span>mount</span> socrata chicago -o <span>'{"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org"}'</span></span></span>

The same semantics of "mounting" data in Splitgraph apply.</p></section><section><h2 id="mounting-vs-cloning-data">Mounting vs. Cloning Data</h2><p>With Splitgraph, there are two primary ways to ingest data: cloning it or mounting it.</p><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/working-with-data/clone-vs-checkout">"Cloning" (and checking-out)</a> an image means downloading a versioned data image, which is a snapshot of a database comprised of delta-compressed diffs. For example, the result of running a Splitfile is an image.</p><p>"Mounting" means establishing a connection to a live data source. The term comes from the idea of "mounting" a filesystem. A mounted table uses a <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">foreign data wrapper</a> (FDW), and you don't ingest data from it until you query it. For example, the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata">Socrata FDW</a> translates SQL queries to <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/" as="https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/">SoQL queries</a> and forwards them to the Socrata server.</p><p>(For more details on mounting data, FDWs and custom mount handlers, read our recent <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/foreign-data-wrappers">"foreign data wrappers" blog post</a>.)</p></section><section><h2 id="mounting-data-in-splitgraph-cloud">Mounting data in Splitgraph Cloud</h2><p>Mounting is the key abstraction that allows Splitgraph Cloud to index external repositories with features like an auto-generated REST API. On the backend, the "query API" (a subject for a later post) uses the Splitgraph library and Socrata mount handler to mount repositories on demand. Then it exposes the mounted schemata to a customized version of <a href="http://postgrest.org/" as="http://postgrest.org/">PostgREST</a> which creates the API.</p><p>Separately, a periodic Airflow task queries the Socrata metadata API to discover and index over 40,000 repositories. Conveniently, the same Socrata software powers over 200 government open-data portals, so one mount handler provides a large catalog of useful live data.</p></section><section><h2 id="avoiding-the-pull-of-data-gravity">Avoiding the pull of Data Gravity</h2><p>Mounting is a powerful abstraction because it allows you to interact directly with upstream data sources, avoiding the need for ETL. In 2010, GE Engineer Dave McCrory coined the term "<a href="https://datagravitas.com/2010/12/07/data-gravity-in-the-clouds/" as="https://datagravitas.com/2010/12/07/data-gravity-in-the-clouds/">data gravity</a>." In his blog post, he observed that "data if large enough can be virtually impossible to move."</p><p>Splitgraph, as a data versioning solution, should work with all your data, not just the subsets of it that you can move. Traditional ETL tools force you to ingest or duplicate your data before you can interact with it. With Splitgraph, you only need to pull upstream data into your images at query time. This allows incremental adoption and quick experimentation; there is no need to move your data warehouse to start using Splitgraph. Instead, you only need to setup an FDW.</p><p>Note that the idea of data gravity applies to versioned data images (which you clone) as much as it does to upstream, live data (which you mount). What if you want to import only a subset of data from a large image? This is the use case for <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/large-datasets/layered-querying">layered querying</a>, which allows you to "check out" an image without downloading it. Instead, Splitgraph creates an FDW that queries only the "layers" of the image necessary to satisfy the query. You can think of layered querying like a mount handler for Splitgraph images.</p></section><section><h2 id="looking-to-the-future">Looking to the future</h2><p>At the moment, Splitgraph Cloud only uses the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata">Socrata FDW</a> as a mount handler for external repositories, since the <a href="https://www.tylertech.com/products/socrata" as="https://www.tylertech.com/products/socrata">Socrata data platform</a> powers most government open-data portals.  In the future, it could use additional mount handlers to provide access to a wider array of upstream sources. To create an external repository, Splitgraph just needs a suitable FDW and a way to index the upstream data. For example, it's easy to imagine indexing Google BigQuery datasets. More interestingly, an on-premise version of Splitgraph could index private databases or data warehouses behind a firewall.</p><p>Our goal for Splitgraph is to make tools for data science as easy and pleasurable to use as tools for coding. That's why our main philosophy is to "stay out of the way." Mounting data is a great example of this philosophy in action. Why force your data warehouse to talk to Splitgraph, when Splitgraph can talk to your data warehouse?</p><p>In the meantime, make sure to <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/explore">explore data</a> on Splitgraph. If you know SQL, you can <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/getting-started/five-minute-demo">get started</a> in less than 10 minutes.</p></section></div></article></section></div>]]>

<h3><span id="Https_Redirection_middleware"></span>Https Redirection middleware<span></span></h3>



<p>In asp.net core <a href="https://pradeeploganathan.com/http/https/">https </a>is enabled by default. The <a aria-label="HttpsRedirection middleware class  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/354cb18d6304b24063d460e0a41c6c1d51ea4000/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy/HttpsRedirectionMiddleware.cs#L139" target="_blank">HttpsRedirection middleware class </a>provides the necessary functionality to enforce redirection from http to https. The UseHttpsRedirection extension method in startup is used to enforce this. This extension method issues a 307 temporary redirect response by default. It then uses the configured https port to specify the redirection endpoint. If the https port is not specified in code, this class will get the https port from HTTPS_PORT environment variable or the IServerAddress feature. If either of them is not specified, then the middleware will log a warning and will not redirect. The code below shows an example of adding the https redirection middleware to the services collection and using it. The code below checks the environment and sets a permanent redirect to the HTTPS endpoint in production and a temporary redirect in development environment.</p>



<p><figcaption>Adding HTTPRedirection</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="Development_certificates"></span>Development certificates<span></span></h3>



<p>To enable the use of HTTPS in the development environment, .net core provides a global tool that creates a self-signed certificate on the local environment. The following command can install this tool</p>



<blockquote><p>dotnet tool install –global dotnet-dev-certs</p></blockquote>



<p>The tool can now be used to generate self-signed certificates with the following command. The -ep flag signifies the export path where the certificate will be exported and the -p flag signifies the password required to generate the certificate. We can use the –trust option to trust the certificate generated.</p>



<blockquote><p>dotnet dev-certs https -ep &lt;path_to_certficate&gt;/certificate.pfx -p &lt;certificate_password&gt; </p><p>dotnet dev-certs https –trust</p></blockquote>



<p>On Linux/Mac OS we can use OpenSSL to generate the certificate for the local environment. Trusting the certificate is however a much more involved process depending on the version and flavor of the Linux OS.</p>



<blockquote><p>openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout dev-certificate.key -out dev-certificate.cer -days 365 -subj /CN=localhost<br>openssl pkcs12 -export -out dev-certificate.pfx -inkey dev-certificate.key -in dev-certificate.cer</p></blockquote>



<p>The certificate path can be specified using the environmental variable  ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path   &amp; the password using environment variable ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password </p>



<h3><span id="Kestrel_as_edge_server"></span>Kestrel as edge server<span></span></h3>



<p>Kestrel can be deployed either as an edge server or with a reverse proxy such as IIS, NGINIX or Apache.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png" alt="" srcset="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png 657w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-300x115.png 300w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-610x234.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" data-lazy-srcset="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png 657w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-300x115.png 300w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-610x234.png 610w" data-lazy-src="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Kestrel deployment scenarios</figcaption></figure>



<p>When Kestrel is deployed as a public facing edge server it can be configured to use https and a specific certificate and port using the below code</p>



<p><figcaption>Configuring Kestrel as edge server</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="Terminating_TLS_at_a_Reverse_proxy"></span>Terminating TLS at a Reverse proxy<span></span></h3>



<p>If a reverse proxy such as Apache or NGNIX is used, then the forwarded headers middleware should be configured and setup before calling the Https redirection middleware. The forwarded headers middleware should set the X-Forwarded-Proto to https. This will enable https offloading at the proxy and a plain http call to the web application with a guarantee that the original call was made over a secure https channel. This is critical especially in non-IIS scenarios such as NGINIX or Apache.  See the code below to configure the forwarded headers middleware</p>



<p><figcaption>Forwarded headers from a reverse proxy</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="HTTPS_in_containerized_environment"></span>HTTPS in containerized environment<span></span></h3>



<p>In a containerized environment an option is to generate the certificates as part of container creation or startup and specify the same in the docker compose file. The environment files can then be used to configure the necessary environment variables as below</p>



<p><figcaption>Using certificates in a docker volume </figcaption></p>



<p>The corresponding environment files to specify the necessary environment variables are below</p>



<p><figcaption>using environment variables in docker to specify certificate path</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="HTTPS_strict_transport_security_(HSTS)"></span>HTTPS strict transport security (HSTS)<span></span></h3>



<p>Using HTTPS redirection still presents a minor security risk as the user can make an initial request using HTTP before being redirected to a secure HTTPS connection. To overcome this the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Protocol adds a header in responses indicating that only HTTPS should be used when sending requests to the web endpoint. Once an HSTS header has been received, clients that support the HSTS protocol will always send requests to the application using HTTPS even if the user specifies an HTTP URL. In .NET Core 3.1, We can add the HSTS middleware to the pipeline as below.</p>



<p><figcaption>Adding HSTS</figcaption></p>



<p>In the above code we are specifying HSTS preload to be set to true. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.chromium.org/hsts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HSTS preloading</a> is a function built into the browser whereby a global list of hosts enforces the use of HTTPS ONLY on their site. The domains are hard coded into the browser, which avoids the initial insecure request and ensures that only HTTPS is used. Another crucial point that trips up a lot of folks is that the HSTS header is not set even if you specify the use of HSTS middleware for localhost and the loopback address for IPV6 and IPV4. This is because the ExcludeHosts parameter by default excludes these addresses.</p>



<p>In summary .NET core provides a lot of ways to configure https for web applications with Kestrel as an edge server or through SSL offloading/TLS termination. It also provides for options to configure the same through code or through configuration or using a docker compose file.</p>

<div>
<p>… or it took a while to get here 😀</p>
<h4>Origins</h4>
<p>This project is fully lead by Willy/Lamers with my minor participation.</p>
<p>It all started with an idea to create the most convenient modern USB mouse adapter for as many retro machines as possible.</p>
<p>Willy started working on it in his spare-time six years ago. The project goals were simple.</p>
<ul><li>small, smooth and not expensive design</li><li>reliable</li><li>quadrature encoder mouse support</li><li>easy to use and maintain</li><li>easy to personalize/configure</li><li>quick firmware upgrade</li></ul>
<p>The project came about quite quickly and Willy ordered the first batch. Unfortunately, It met almost all conditions but one – reliability. The design was based on the FTDI Vinculum2 chip. Although the layout is not bad, the toolchain is terribly underdeveloped (at least it was at that time). There were memory leaks all over the place, debugging was almost impossible, mainly due to the processor for which there is no documentation. In addition, the configuration saved from time to time destroyed the config itself …<br>It was too much. The project has been abandoned. If you are a strong-willed person you can try it yourself. All work that was done on it, is accessible <a href="http://jil.guru/16bit/projects/abbannddonnedd/hid2st.rar">HERE</a>. You can view or use it if you have the energy to break through the unfinished, wrong and undocumented code</p>
<h4>The new hope</h4>
<p>In the meantime, the design was repeatedly unearthed from a drawer, but unfortunately without much effect. Some of the original goals turned out to be impossible to fulfill.</p>
<p>Up to <a href="http://sillyventure.eu/pl/">Silly Venture 2019</a> which turned out to be a breakthrough. the demand for a functional Atari ST adapter turned out to be quite large. The mouSTer project was born.</p>
<p>The project received a new name “The mouSTer” and <a href="http://www.ha.art.pl/wydawnictwo/autorzy/5334-piotr-kroll-mietniowski.html">Kroll</a> (translator required) became its godfather. I hope he doesn’t mind :). Kroll is the best tester of an Atari equipment around.</p>
<p>The project has gained a new shape and new strengths.</p>
<p>Some early prototype pics:</p>

<p>At the moment, the current size has been reduced to a minimum – DB9 plug size + USB-A socket</p>
<p>Below some highlights:</p>
<ul><li>it works with every mouse and with every Game USB pad</li><li>PS4 pad support – USB </li><li>config via USB flash drive – INI file + default config</li><li>config transfer via USB flash drive</li><li>firmware upgrade via USB flash drive (takes 3 seconds, of which 2 seconds is the time the bootloader needs to recognize the flash drive)</li><li>tested with flash drives from 32MB to 32GB</li><li>mouse emulation mode defaults – Amiga, Atari ST, joystick/gamepad</li></ul>
<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>Finally, after a few months of testing in laboratory conditions, everything works rock-solid. Changing the firmware and configuration works confidently and is trouble-free.</p>

		<p>I have a confession to make: I can’t eat spicy food.</p>
<p>As a person of South Asian descent, it’s incongruous, I know. I’m left adrift with the certain type of person who orders food Indian spicy. While my dining companions make an effort to signal their identity as capsaicin-consuming, I wonder if I should order my food white-guy mild. It’s not like I don’t enjoy the stinging heat or the bleary-eyed trip of something made extra hot—it’s just that I can’t digest it.</p>
<div id="attachment_69825"><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMAGE03.jpg?resize=771%2C1124&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="771" height="1124" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMAGE03-scaled.jpg?resize=771%2C1124&amp;ssl=1 771w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMAGE03-scaled.jpg?resize=336%2C490&amp;ssl=1 336w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMAGE03-scaled.jpg?w=1756&amp;ssl=1 1756w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMAGE03-scaled.jpg?w=1542&amp;ssl=1 1542w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Sir Joseph Paxton, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paxton%27s_Magazine_of_Botany_and_Register_of_Flowering_Plants_(1838)_(14764888245).jpg">“Capsicum ustulatum,”</a> Paxton’s Magazine of Botany and Register of Flowering Plants, 1838.</p></div>
<p>I blame dysentery. A bout of it when I was three left two lasting effects on my life: it introduced me to my oldest friendship through a circuitous game of chance (a story for another time), and it rendered my digestive system subject to pains that feel like someone is reaching into me to wring out my guts like wet laundry.</p>
<p>I’m often told by well-meaning people how much they love Indian food, and then asked if I cook it at home. I never know quite how to respond. Does roti count—especially if it’s the buss-up shut <i>parāthā</i> of Trinidad? Where do Bihari staples like <i>sattū</i> (ground-up roasted gram) or <i>chōkha</i> (mashed and roasted eggplant) fit into this understanding? But their question isn’t an interrogation of the narrowness of national cuisines. Their question isn’t a question at all—it’s a chance to share. The woman who loves her corner Indian restaurant. The man who just took an Indian-cooking class through adult education. The reasons are usually the same: they love the heat, the fieriness, the spice.</p>
<p>All the things I’m doomed to avoid.</p>

<p>This all had me wondering: what’s Indian food without the heat? The historian in me has an answer: spiciness is historically contingent. In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and the entire world changed: slavery, war, disease, colonization, and an immense transfer of wealth to Europe. And with that wealth too came New World nightshades—potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, peppers of all kinds. It took some time for these fruits and vegetables to plant themselves into European cuisine. The tomato, for example, wasn’t widely used in Italian cuisine until the eighteenth century.<span id="easy-footnote-1-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-69820" title="David Gentilecore, <i>Pomodoro! A History of the Tomato in Italy</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), 45–68."><sup>1</sup></a></span> But what about food further out from Europe? What about India?</p>
<p>Soon after Columbus’ first expedition, the treaties of Tordesillas and Saragossa divided the oceans of the newly-known world. The Portuguese effectively took the Atlantic and Indian oceans, while the Spanish took the Pacific. With that, the Portuguese established forts and trading posts along India’s Malabar coast. In time, <i>aloo</i> (potato), <i>tamātar</i> (tomato), and <i>mirchī</i> (chilies) were available on the western coast of the Indian subcontinent. Later, the English set up their first trading posts in India in the eastern Gangetic plain, bringing these same staples into North India.<span id="easy-footnote-2-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-69820" title="K.T. Achaya, <i>Indian Food: A Historical Companion</i> (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998), 225–27."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>So what was curry like before Columbus? Well, <i>curry</i> didn’t exist.</p>
<p>In these cases, I find it useful to consult my <i>Hobson-Jobson</i>, the nineteenth-century dictionary of Anglo-Indian loan words. According to that source, curry comes from the Portuguese word <i>karil (caril)</i> via the Tamil word <i>kari</i> (sauce, relish for rice). In the sixteenth century, this was transliterated into English as caril, but by the 1680s entered English as <i>carrees</i>, perhaps from <i>caris</i>, an Anglicized plural form of the Portuguese.<span id="easy-footnote-3-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-69820" title="Sir Henry Yule, “Curry,” in <a href=&quot;https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/hobsonjobson_query.py?page=281&quot;><i>Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive</i></a>, ed. William Crooke, B.A (London: J Murray, 1903), 281."><sup>3</sup></a></span> It’s a circle: I’m back to Tordesillas and Saragossa.</p>
<p>It looks like the curry too came after Columbus. And not only that: it’s a meaningless word in the context of daily life. Indian food is cipher, built upon a matrix of regionalism, religion, and caste. A Dalit from Mararashtra’s Marathwada region might mix bovine blood with <i>yesur</i> (a local spice mix) to make <i>lakuti</i>, while a Tamil Brahmin might mix eight spices with <i>tur dāl</i> and onions to make a <i>sambar</i>.<span id="easy-footnote-4-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-69820" title="Shahu Patole, <a href=&quot;http://www.expressfoodie.com/main-course/why-i-wrote-a-book-on-dalit-food/&quot;>“Why I Wrote a Book on Dalit Food,”</a> <i>Express Foodie</i>, September 10, 2016."><sup>4</sup></a></span> Beyond the hyper-regionalism is a blunt truth as well: there are actual words for the plethora of regional dishes that can be reduced to a curry.</p>
<p>Still, curry can be a somewhat useful concept. It’s an outsider’s perspective, a shorthand glossing over an entire subcontinent’s worth of food. It’s the type of concept that takes what it wants from the original, and mixes in whatever else is ready-to-hand.</p>
<p>I went to the source: the first example of a curry recipe found in a Western cookbook. Hannah Glasse’s 1747 <i>The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</i> featured a recipe “To make a Currey the Indian way” alongside one “To make a Pellow the Indian way.”<span id="easy-footnote-5-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-69820" title="Hannah Glasse, <i>The Art of Cookery, New</i> (London: L. Wangford, 1777), 74."><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=771%2C372&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="771" height="372" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=771%2C372&amp;ssl=1 771w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=336%2C162&amp;ssl=1 336w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=768%2C370&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=1536%2C741&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=2048%2C987&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=1170%2C564&amp;ssl=1 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Upon first glance, I can’t tell how this recipe differs from a fricasseed chicken. But it’s there: “an ounce of Turmerick [turmeric], a large spoonful of ginger and beaten pepper.” What makes this curry in an Indian way is not the chicken or the cream, but these three spices taken mixed together and served.</p>
<p>Before spicy came spice: the history of curry before Columbus is a history of spice. And so I wonder: what spices were used? In what quantities?</p>
<p>The best spice to help answer these questions might be asafetida (also spelled asafetida). Known in Hindi as <i>hīng</i>, it’s the dried resin taken from the root of the Ferula herb, and is used throughout Indian cuisine in nearly all Indian regions. When fried in oil, it adds a lovely umami flavor to any dish, one reminiscent of garlic or onions.</p>
<p>I’ve also known it as an extremely smelly spice.</p>

<p>I had never heard of it until I was an adult. Family lore says that my father hated the smell so much, he told my mother early in their marriage to keep it out of the spice cabinet forever. But it wasn’t just him—the smell has a noxious reputation across the world, going back centuries. The Portuguese physician and naturalist Garcia de Orta wrote in his sixteenth-century <i>Colóquios</i> that “the nastiest smell in the world for me is Assa-fetida [sic].” But he also wrote that “the thing most used throughout India, and in all parts of it, is that Assa-fetida.”<span id="easy-footnote-6-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-69820" title="Garcia da Orta, <i>Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India</i>, ed. Conde de Ficalho, trans. Sir Clements Markham, New Lisbon Edition (London: Henry Sotheran and Co, 1913), 44–45."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This was as true in the twelfth century as it was in the sixteenth. One of the earliest South Asian texts that featured non-medicinal recipes was the Sanskrit <i>Mānasollāsa</i>. Written in 1129 CE by Someshvara III, king of the Western Chalukya Empire in the western Deccan and South India, the book is an encyclopedic treatise on all aspects of life in his kingdom. One of those most common ingredients found in its chapter on the enjoyment of food is asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-7-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-69820" title="Colleen Taylor Sen, <i>Feasts and Fasts: A History of Food in India</i>, Overdrive (eBook) edition (London: Reaktion Books, 2015), chap. 7."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
<p>For example, his general practices or preparing meat dishes called for the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>For getting good smell, dry coriander seeds, jeera, and hingu; for giving colour haridra; for good taste the powder of saindhvam, visvamarichim are sprinkled over the food and covered with a clean cloth and mixed slightly with oil.<span id="easy-footnote-8-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-69820" title="P. Arundhati, trans., <i>Royal Life in Mānasôllāsa</i> (New Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan, 1994), 120."><sup>8</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Various other recipes, including those for <i>dāl</i>, meat dishes, and fish were also spiced with asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-9-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>9</sup></a></span> My first inclination when I saw this was to question it: of course a king would spice his food. Spices were a luxury, and it goes without saying that a king could afford to command his kitchen to use whatever spices were available to him.</p>

<p>But a century prior to the publication of the <i>Mānasollāsa</i> came the <i>Lokopakara</i> (roughly translates to “For the benefit of the people”). Written in 1025 by the Jain scholar Chavundaraya II, the<i> Lokopakara</i> featured a section on cooking with a recipe for <i>dāl </i>that recommended a garnish of mustard, cumin seeds, asafetida, and curry leaves.<span id="easy-footnote-10-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Asafetida too made an appearance in recipes dating from the Sultanate era. From 1206 to 1526, a succession of Islamic dynasties known as the Delhi Sultanate ruled northern India. Nasir ud-Din Shah, a ruler of the Malwa Sultanate (a breakaway state from one of the Delhi Sultanate dynasties) produced the <i>Ni’matnama</i> (“The Book of Delights”). The book contained some of the recipes loved by his father, the Sultan Ghiyath Shah. Interestingly enough, the book contains a handful of recipes considered rustic or common—food for the common folk.</p>
<p>One recommends to:</p>
<blockquote><p>take root vegetables and boil them well, then take them off and fry them in ghee flavoured with sesame and asafetida.</p>
<p>Add lime juice, salt and burned vegetable oil and mix it as explained above. Take some of it, flavor it and cook it.<span id="easy-footnote-11-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-69820" title="Norah M. Titley, ed., <i>The Ni’matnama Manuscript of the Sultans of Mandu: The Sultan’s Book of Delights</i> (London: Routledge, 2004), 44–45."><sup>11</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure how burned vegetable oil would taste, but I’m sure the asafetida would make up for it. Maybe.</p>
<p>Humble <i>hīng</i> too made an appearance in the royal accounts of the Mughals. The Mughal Emperor Akbar reigned from 1556 to 1605. His court historian, Abu’l-Fazl ‘Allami, dutifully chronicled his reign in <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i> (“Administration of Akbar”). The work remains a quintessential source for the workings of Akbar’s government. It also contains a repertoire of recipes. For example, a recipe for <i>bādinjān</i> (eggplant) asks for:</p>
<blockquote><p>10 s. [<i>sīr</i>, approximately 640 grams] rice; 1 ½ s. g’hí [ghee], 3 ¾ s. onions; ¼ s. ginger and lime juice; pepper and coriander seed, 5 m. [misqal, approximately 6 grams] of each; cloves, cardamums [cardamom], and assafoetida, each ½ m.<span id="easy-footnote-12-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-69820" title="Abu’l-Fazl ’Allami, <i>The Ain I Akbari</i>, trans. Henry Blochmann, vol. 1 (Calcutta: Rouse, 1873), 59."><sup>12</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Strangely enough, the recipe for eggplant lacks any mention of eggplant. But regardless, there it is: a half <i>misqal</i> of asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-13-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-69820" title="A unit of mass equal to 4.25 grams. Misqal is sometimes written as mithqāl."><sup>13</sup></a></span> Even the kitchens of the Mughal court were filled with the wondrous odors of <i>hīng</i>.</p>
<p>The history of curry before Columbus is truly a history of spice. There are, of course, more spices to find in the archives: turmeric, coriander, and cumin come to mind. These are spices that cross region and class, the staples thrown into the pot in meal after meal. But ubiquitous, smelly, resinous <i>hīng</i> gives a chance to take a peek into the flavors of Indian food prior to the Columbian exchange. Perhaps there should be a new way to order something, not Indian spicy, but Indian spiced, with plenty of asafetida. I’ll hold my nose and ask for a generous portion, just like all those food chroniclers over the past millennium.</p>

<p>In 2006, Robert Andersen sent <a href="https://twitter.com/rsa/status/55281">the first tweet that @mentioned another user</a>, and an internet convention was born.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a tweet reading &quot;@ buzz - you broke your thumb and youre still twittering? that's some serious devotion&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_1.png"></p>
<p>In a world without smartphones, Twitter’s primary interface was SMS. There were no threads, no @username autocomplete. If a user said something and you wanted to reply, your only option was to compose a new text to 40404, manually typing the @mention into your phone’s SMS text box. SMS was also the origin of Twitter’s original <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/counting-characters">140 character</a> limit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter began as an SMS text-based service. This limited the original Tweet length to 140 characters (which was partly driven by the 160 character limit of SMS, with 20 characters reserved for commands and usernames).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also a holdover from the SMS days, Twitter does not allow any formatted or rich text. Users today work around this limitation by using the wide array of possibilities that Unicode affords. <a href="https://technastic.com/bold-text-twitter-mobile-web/#List_of_Online_Text_Generators">Text generators</a> convert ASCII characters into 𝔲𝔫𝔲𝔰𝔲𝔞𝔩 𝔘𝔫𝔦𝔠𝔬𝔡𝔢 𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔯𝔞𝔠𝔱𝔢𝔯𝔰. Memes take advantage of repeated spaces to position text, or to draw Unicode houses. (All of that is, of course, completely inaccessible to screen readers.) Emoji modifiers allow expressing a wide range of emotions with modifiers for skin tones and gender.</p>
<p><img alt="two screenshots, one of a unicode house reading &quot;in this house we worship unicode&quot; and another with a tweet from @helllzgirl that say &quot;cashiers 🤝 ariana grande ... thank u, next&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_5.png"></p>
<p>Critically, this “plain” text is fully copy-pastable into any app with Unicode support. While many Twitter users from 2006 were likely limited to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38#GSM_8_bit_data_encoding">GSM-7 encoding</a>, the limitations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)">T9 keyboard</a>, and their phone’s limited text rendering and shaping, modern users have found new ways to express themselves using the full Unicode character space. Nowadays, tweets, names, URLs, hashtags, basically <em>everything</em> can contain Unicode characters. Of course, everything except the @mention.</p>
<p>Usernames on Twitter have more or less the same requirements as during the SMS era — up to 15 letters from <code>a-z</code>, numbers from <code>0-9</code> and the underscore <code>_</code>. This requirement is similar to many other websites: GitHub only allows alphanumeric characters and non-repeating hyphens, and Facebook allows just alphanumeric characters and the period.</p>
<p>As we will see, this limitation is one of several problems with usernames.</p>
<h2>Unicode Usernames</h2>
<p>Imagine if instead of alphanumerics, GitHub allowed usernames to only be made up of the numbers <code>0-9</code> and Chinese characters. It would be pretty frustrating, right? If forced to use a system like this, we would likely ignore the Chinese characters, and just use the numbers as usernames. This is often what happens on social media platforms in countries that don’t use Latin script. In China, the QQ instant messaging service (originally started in 1999) completely got rid of usernames used by similar services like AOL. Instead, each user is assigned a unique number, their QQ ID. This number cannot be chosed by the user, and is immutable. WeChat similarly assigns users a random number when they sign up, although it does allow each user exactly one opportunity to change it to an alphanumeric string of their choice. Typing long numbers isn’t particularly ergonomic, which could help explain the widespread use of QR codes in China.</p>
<p>Even in Latin-speaking countries, AOL-style usernames had issues. By requiring a username when logging in, and <em>also</em> requiring usernames to be unique among all users, users are often forced to use different usernames on different services, creating a second password that they had to memorize. Thankfully, most services have fixed at least this small problem by having login be email- instead of username-based.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, usernames are alphanumeric only. Why can’t we just allow Unicode, so that usernames could contain Chinese, Cyrillic, or other non-Latin alphabets? Unfortunately Unicode usernames have their own issues — just look at the largest username system in the world, the domain name system and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">extension that allowed non-ASCII characters</a>. This was an essential upgrade, and yet it has inperfections, allowing the <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/chrome-firefox-unicode-phishing/">registration of websites</a> such as this one:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of browser window, URL bar reads &quot;epic.com&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_2.png"></p>
<p>This is latest Firefox, as of July 2020, displaying what appears to be “epic.com”, the website of a large healthcare company. However, as you can see, the content is actually some random blog reminding people to drink water. How is this possible? If we stick the code into a Unicode character inspector, we can see what’s going on:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of unicode character inspector revealing &quot;epic&quot; to actually be &quot;еріс&quot;. of course you, a screen reader user, aren't fooled." src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_3.png"></p>
<p>Byte-wise, the real “epic.com” and the false website “еріс.com” are completely different. But visually, they’re indistinguishable from each other in the URL bar, allowing phishing problems to run amock. Unicode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonicalization and normalization</a> can help with certain cases of this problem, but does nothing for our epic.com example.</p>
<p>This particular example isn’t visible in Chrome, which instead shows <code>https://xn--e1awd7f.com/</code>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">“punycode”</a> representation of the domain name. This is thanks to Chrome’s complex, <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/76be97d896f266d6b73b2fe0af5d6d479ca31306/docs/idn.md">13 step process</a> for detecting if a domain name is likely to be a Unicode phish or not. “Well, it may be complex,” you tell me, “but at least it solves the phishing problem!” Unfortunately it does not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific instances of IDN homograph attacks have been reported to Chrome, and we continually update our IDN policy to prevent against these attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Unicode spec is apparently too large to solve this problem 100% perfectly, and so their “solution” is to pay $2000 to anybody who finds new edge cases. This also doesn’t actually solve the problem for non-Latin alphabets — if for example, I own a Chinese domain name, it will never show punycode, and attackers can phish my site using duplicate encodings for those Chinese characters. Chrome just attempts to solve the much smaller problem of the numerous Unicode characters that visually look like the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>This is probably frustrating to read, and you may want to point fingers at Unicode, for failing to provide canonical encodings for a series of graphemes. Or perhaps we can blame the domain name registrars, for allowing visually identical registrations. But I think the real culprit here is the incorrect assumption we Latin script users have when we build usernames into our systems. We assume that two visually-identical printed text tokens will have the same bytewise encoding. This is simply not true for a huge portion of computer users, and is a root failing with username-based systems today. The only solution is to develop systems that don’t have usernames.</p>
<p>Even in a trusted system with no bad actors, there is no guarantee a user retyping a non-Latin username from a printed document will end up with the same bytes as the original document.</p>
<h2>Changing Usernames</h2>
<p>Let’s say you’re building a site for English use only, and so even after reading all of this, you think perhaps it’s ok to have usernames. After all, you’ll probably find, like Twitter did, that this makes text entry for @mentions <em>much</em> simpler to implement. You get to use just a plain text field, instead of building an input field that can insert custom @mention objects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you will still run into the issue of somebody <em>changing</em> their username. This is often an extremely complex problem. Take <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/changing-your-github-username">GitHub</a> for example. Changing your username there will redirect your old repository links to new ones. However, somebody else can come in and use your old username. What happens if they create a repo with the same name as your old one?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the new owner of your old username creates a repository with the same name as your repository, that will override the redirect entry and your redirect will stop working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>URLs aren’t the only place GitHub usernames are used. Using the web interface, in some cases, will create commits with the email <code><a href="https://lord.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="45283c303620372b2428200530362037366b2b2a372035293c6b222c312d30276b262a28">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>. These commits will permanantly be disconnected from your account, unless you somehow are able to force push edited commit headers to every repository you’ve ever contributed to. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Instagram has issues with changing usernames, too. Up until 2015, updating your username would cause you to lose all your previous @mentions. They’ve since fixed this; old @mentions eventually update. Twitter supposedly will also preserve your replies, although my testing shows this is an unreliable feature at best. Updating the actual @mention as it’s listed in the Tweet would have other issues, since if a user mentioned in a 280-character tweet adds 5 characters to their username, you’d suddenly get a 285-character tweet. Hope your Twitter clients can all support that.</p>
<p>The final example of username switching pains I have is from my year at Google. I was fortunate enough to never switch my username, perfectly satisfied every morning when I opened my laptop and saw <code><a href="https://lord.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7e121f0c1a3e19111119121b501d1113">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> on the login screen. But countless internal systems used by engineers there assume usernames are immutable, making a username switch a multi-day process that is never really complete.</p>
<p>There is one easy “solution” to all of this, of course, which is to make it impossible to change your username. This is <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en">what gmail does</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your account’s email address ends in @gmail.com, you usually can’t change it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the “usually”. I guess in certain, mysterious cases it’s possible to change it? In any case, making a random, numeric user ID immutable is fine. But if that user ID contains letters and is user-selected, making it immutable is an unacceptable solution for real-world situations. Whether it contains a user’s deadname, or an old nickname they don’t go by any longer, or even for those of us who, in sixth grade, decided “lordjubjub” would be an excellent and professional email address (just a hypothetical example, of course), usernames need to be editable. If they’re editable, why not avoid all these username troubles and just go for a fully-Unicode, non-unique display name instead?</p>
<h2>Username Alternatives</h2>
<p>250 million people have registered for Discord, a chat app similar to Slack or IRC. However, unlike Slack and IRC whose usernames are local to a particular server, Discord has just one server, and usernames are universal. With 250 million users in a single username …</p></div></div>

July 7, 2020 | https://secret.club/2020/07/06/bottleye.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://secret.club/2020/07/06/bottleye.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The popular anti-cheat <a href="https://battleye.com/">BattlEye</a> is widely used by modern online games such as <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/">Escape from Tarkov</a> and is considered an industry standard anti-cheat by many. In this article I will demonstrate a method I have been utilizing for the past year, which enables you to play any BattlEye-protected game online without even having to install BattlEye.</p><p>BattlEye is dynamically loaded by the respective game on startup to initialize the software service (“BEService”) and kernel driver (“BEDaisy”). These two components are critical in ensuring the integrity of the game, but the most critical component by far is the usermode library (“BEClient”) that the game interacts with directly. This module exports two functions: <code>GetVer</code> and more importantly <code>Init</code>.</p><p>The <em>Init</em> routine is what the game will call, but this functionality has never been documented before, as people mostly focus on BEDaisy or their <a href="https://secret.club/tags#battleye">shellcode</a>. Most important routines in <em>BEClient</em>, including <em>Init</em>, are protected and virtualised by <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/">VMProtect</a>, which we are able to devirtualise and reverse engineer thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vtil-project">vtil</a> by secret club member <a href="https://secret.club/author/can1357">Can Boluk</a>, but the inner workings of <em>BEClient</em> is a topic for a later part of this series, so here is a quick summary.</p><p><em>Init</em> and its arguments have the following definitions:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)
battleye<span>::</span>instance_status Init(std<span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> integration_version,

    SUCCESSFULLY_INITIALIZED,
    DESTROYING,
    DESTROYED
};

<span>struct</span> <span>becl_game_data</span>
{
    <span>char</span><span>*</span>         game_version;

    remove_peer_t remove_peer;
};
</code></pre><p>As seen, these are quite simple containers for interopability between the game and <em>BEClient</em>. <code>becl_game_data</code> is defined by the game and contains functions that <em>BEClient</em> needs to call (for example, send_packet) while <code>becl_be_data</code> is defined by <em>BEClient</em> and contains callbacks used by the game after initialisation (for example, received_packet). Note that these two structures slightly differ in some games that have special functionality, such as the recently introduced packet encryption in <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> that we’ve already <a href="https://secret.club/2020/06/19/battleye-packet-encryption.html">cracked</a>. Older versions of BattlEye (DayZ, Arma, etc.) use a completely different approach with function pointer swap hooks to intercept traffic communication, and therefore these structures don’t apply.</p><p>A simple <em>Init</em> implementation would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)
battleye<span>::</span>instance_status Init(std<span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> integration_version,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_game_data<span>*</span> game_data,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_be_data<span>*</span> client_data)
{
    <span>// CACHE RELEVANT FUNCTIONS</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet    <span>=</span> game_data<span>-&gt;</span>send_packet;

    <span>// SETUP CLIENT STRUCTURE</span>
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>exit                   <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>exit;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>run                    <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>run;

    <span>return</span> battleye<span>::</span>instance_status<span>::</span>SUCCESSFULLY_INITIALIZED;
}
</code></pre><p>This would allow our custom BattlEye client to receive packets sent from the game server’s <em>BEServer</em> module.</p><p>The function <code>received_packet</code> is by far the most important routine used by the game, as it handles incoming packets from the BattlEye server component. BattlEye communication is extremely simple compared to how important the integrity of it is. In recent versions of BattlEye, packets follow the same general structure:</p><pre><code><span>#pragma pack(push, 1)
</span><span>struct</span> <span>be_fragment</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> count;

};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet_header</span>

    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> sequence;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet</span> <span>:</span> be_packet_header
{
    <span>union</span> 
    {
        be_fragment fragment;

        <span>// DATA STARTS AT body[1] IF PACKET IS FRAGMENTED</span>
        <span>struct</span>
        {
            <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> no_fragmentation_flag;
            std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> body[<span>0</span>];
        };
    };
    <span>inline</span> <span>bool</span> fragmented()
    {
        <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>!=</span> <span>0x00</span>;
    }
};

</span></code></pre><p>All packets have an identifier and a sequence number (which is used by the requests/response communication and the heartbeat). Requests and responses have a fragmentation mode which allows <em>BEServer</em> and <em>BEClient</em> to send packets in chunks of <code>0x400</code> bytes (seemingly arbitrary) instead of sending one big packet.</p><p>In the current iteration of BattlEye, the following packets are used for communication:</p><h3 id="init-00"> <a href="#init-00">INIT (<code>00</code>)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent to the <em>BEClient</em> module as soon as the connection with the game server has been established. This packet is only transmitted once, contains no data besides the packet id <code>00</code> and the response to this packet is simply <code>00 05</code>.</p><h3 id="start-02"> <a href="#start-02">START (‘02’)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent right after the ‘INIT’ packets have been exchanged, and contains the server-generated guid of the client. The response of this packet is simply the header: <code>02 00</code></p><h3 id="request-04--response-05"> <a href="#request-04--response-05">REQUEST (<code>04</code>) / RESPONSE (<code>05</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is sent from <em>BEServer</em> to <em>BEClient</em> to request (and in rare cases, simply transmit) data, and <em>BEClient</em> will send back data for that request using the <code>RESPONSE</code> packet type.</p><p>The first request contains crucial information such as service- and integration version, not responding to it will get you disconnected by the game server. Afterwards, requests are game specific.</p><h3 id="heartbeat-09"> <a href="#heartbeat-09">HEARTBEAT (<code>09</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is used by the <em>BEServer</em> module to ensure that the connection hasn’t been dropped. It is sent every 30 seconds using a sequential index, and if the client doesn’t respond with the same packet, the client is disconnected from the game server. This heartbeat packet is only three bytes long, with the sequential index used for synchronization being incremental and therefore easily emulated. An example heartbeat could be: <code>09 01 00</code>, which is the second heartbeat (sequence starts at zero) transmitted.</p><p>With this knowledge, it is possible by emulating the entire BattlEye anti-cheat with only two proprietary points of data: the responses for request sequence one and two. These can be intercepted using a tool such as wireshark and replayed as many times as you want for the respective game, because the packet encryption used by BattlEye is static and contextless.</p><p>Emulating the <code>INIT</code> packet is as stated simply responding with the sequence number five:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT<span>:</span>
{
    <span>auto</span> info_packet <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>be_packet{};
    info_packet.id       <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT;
    info_packet.sequence <span>=</span> <span>0x05</span>;

    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(<span>&amp;</span>info_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(info_packet));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>START</code> packet is done by replying with the received packet’s header:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>START<span>:</span>
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>HEARTBEAT</code> packets is done by replying with the received packet:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>HEARTBEAT<span>:</span>    
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, length);
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>REQUEST</code> packets can be done by replaying previously generated responses, which can be logged with code hooks or man-in-the-middle software. These packets are game specific and some games might disconnect you for not handling a specific request, but most games only require the first two requests to be handled, afterwards simply replying with the packet header is enough to not get disconnected by the game server. It is important to notice that all <code>REQUEST</code> packets are immediately responded to with the header, to let the server know that the client is aware of the request. This is how BottlEye emulates them:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>REQUEST<span>:</span>
{
    <span>// IF NOT FRAGMENTED RESPOND IMMEDIATELY, ELSE ONLY RESPOND TO THE LAST FRAGMENT</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> respond <span>=</span> 
        <span>!</span>header<span>-&gt;</span>fragmented() <span>||</span> 
        (header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.index <span>==</span> header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>-</span> <span>1</span>);

    <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>respond)
        <span>return</span>;

    <span>// SEND BACK HEADER</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));

    <span>switch</span> (header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence)
    {
    <span>case</span> <span>0x01</span>:
    {
        battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>respond(header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence,
            {
                <span>// REDACTED BUFFER</span>
            });
        <span>break</span>;

It has allowed the world to examine what happens in a pandemic when a government allows life to carry on largely unhindered.</p><p>This is what has happened: Not only have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/15/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-deaths.html" title="">thousands more people died </a>than in neighboring countries that imposed lockdowns, but Swedenâ€™s economy has fared little better.</p><p>â€œThey literally gained nothing,â€� said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. â€œItâ€™s a self-inflicted wound, and they have no economic gains.â€�</p><p>The results of Swedenâ€™s experience are relevant well beyond Scandinavian shores. In the United States, where the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">virus is spreading</a> with alarming speed, many states have â€” at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/when-lockdown-ending-coronavirus.html" title="">President Trumpâ€™s urging</a> â€” avoided lockdowns or lifted them prematurely on the assumption that this would foster economic revival, allowing people to return to workplaces, shops and restaurants.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson â€” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/world/europe/boris-johnson-coronavirus-hospital-intensive-care.html" title="">previously hospitalized </a>with Covid-19 â€” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-reopening.html" title="">reopened pubs</a> and restaurants last weekend in a bid to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-reopening.html" title="">restore normal economic life</a>.</p><p>Implicit in these approaches is the assumption that governments must balance saving lives against the imperative to spare jobs, with the extra health risks of rolling back social distancing potentially justified by a resulting boost to prosperity. But Swedenâ€™s grim result â€” more death, and nearly equal economic damage â€” suggests that the supposed choice between lives and paychecks is a false one: A failure to impose social distancing can cost lives and jobs at the same time.</p><p>Sweden put stock in the sensibility of its people as it largely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus.html" title="">avoided imposing government prohibitions</a>. The government allowed restaurants, gyms, shops, playgrounds and most schools to remain open. By contrast, Denmark and Norway opted for strict quarantines, banning large groups and locking down shops and restaurants.</p><p>More than three months later, the coronavirus is blamed for 5,420 deaths in Sweden, according to the <a href="https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/se" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>. That might not sound especially horrendous compared with the more than 129,000 Americans who have died. But Sweden is a country of only 10 million people. Per million people, Sweden has suffered 40 percent more deaths than the United States, 12 times more than Norway, seven times more than Finland and six times more than Denmark.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><img alt="Per million people, Sweden has suffered 40 percent more coronavirus-related deaths than the United States." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" itemprop="url" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span>Credit...</span><span>Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse â€” Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The elevated death toll resulting from Swedenâ€™s approach has been clear for many weeks. What is only now emerging is how Sweden, despite letting its economy run unimpeded, has still suffered business-destroying, prosperity-diminishing damage, and at nearly the same magnitude of its neighbors.</p></div><div><div><p>Swedenâ€™s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/sweden-cenbank-forecast/table-swedish-cbank-forecasts-key-rate-at-0-for-coming-years-idUSS3N2AC001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">central bank</a> expects its economy to contract by 4.5 percent this year, a revision from a previously expected gain of 1.3 percent. The unemployment rate jumped to 9 percent in May from 7.1 percent in March. â€œThe overall damage to the economy means the recovery will be protracted, with unemployment remaining elevated,â€� Oxford Economics concluded in a recent research note.</p><p>This is more or less how damage caused by the pandemic has played out in Denmark, where the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-denmark-economy/denmarks-central-bank-sees-economy-shrink-by-41-this-year-idUSFWN2DT0WQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">central bank</a> expects that the economy will shrink 4.1 percent this year, and where joblessness has edged up to 5.6 percent in May from 4.1 percent in March.</p><p>In short, Sweden suffered a vastly higher death rate while failing to collect on the expected economic gains.</p><p>The coronavirus does not stop at national borders. Despite the governmentâ€™s decision to allow the domestic economy to roll on, Swedish businesses are stuck with the same conditions that produced recession everywhere else. And Swedish people responded to the fear of the virus by limiting their shopping â€” not enough to prevent elevated deaths, but enough to produce a decline in business activity.</p><p>Here is one takeaway with potentially universal import: It is simplistic to portray government actions such as quarantines as the cause of economic damage. The real culprit is the virus itself. From Asia to Europe to the Americas, the risks of the pandemic have disrupted businesses while prompting people to avoid shopping malls and restaurants, regardless of official policy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-03/merlin_171448116_dc72db1b-94a8-4bf3-89c9-4ae78673174b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div></div></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span>Credit...</span><span>Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse â€” Getty Images</span></span></figcaption><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-03/merlin_171448116_dc72db1b-94a8-4bf3-89c9-4ae78673174b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp"></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Sweden is exposed to the vagaries of global trade.

<p>It all began with a scratchy throat on Friday, March 13. A colleague had brought the novel coronavirus back with him from the Austrian ski resort <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-ischgl-outbreak-families-of-covid-19-victims-seek-justice-a-bbf9aa92-dfed-42d0-870c-ff9d17125d45" data-link-flag="english">Ischgl</a>. Shortly thereafter, Alexander Riesch, 26, whose name has been changed for this story, also tested positive for the virus.</p>


<div>
<p>"At first I thought, well, at least now you'll have gotten it over with," Riesch says. His doctors also had no doubt: The body of a young, healthy person wouldn't take long to vanquish the virus. They sent Riesch home to recover. But a few days later, he felt so miserable that he had to call an emergency doctor. He spent a week in the hospital.</p><p>Officially, Riesch has been recovered for nearly three months. He has antibodies against the virus in his blood. Yet he still goes through spells in which he feels very sick. So far, none of his doctors have been able to explain why.</p>

<p>In addition to suffering from sore throats that range from mild to severe and seem to come and go at random, his lungs are also still affected. The symptoms didn't begin until after the doctors released him from the hospital and he returned home. A respiratory physician prescribed him an asthma inhaler and advised him to be patient. The cortisone does help a little, Riesch says, but his cough and the tightness in his chest return as soon as he stops taking it.</p>

<div>
<p>There's also the sudden muscle pain. Sometimes the left half of Riesch's body becomes numb, other times he feels so weak that he has to lay down immediately. And that's not even to mention the abdominal pain and nausea, skin rash and severe fatigue.</p><p>Riesch was on sick leave for 10 weeks. Meanwhile, he's back at work as a real estate agent. But every now and then, he has to cancel appointments because he simply feels too exhausted. Most of the time, he tries to live a normal life. "I've come to accept the pain I'm in now."</p><h3>A Very Strange Disease</h3><p>Half a year since the pandemic began, doctors are now observing an increasing number of coronavirus patients like Riesch who are officially recovered but in reality are far from healthy.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>"COVID-19 is very unpredictable," says Timothy Spector of King's College London, who is tracking the course of the disease in more than 200,000 COVID-19 patients over a longer period of time, with the help of a mobile app, as part of a major research project. "I am trained as a rheumatologist, so I am used to strange diseases. But COVID-19 is the strangest disease I know."</p><p>Roughly one in 10 people with the disease continue to suffer from unexplainable symptoms for more than a month, many for more than two months. The most common are exhaustion, headaches, a loss of smell, trouble breathing, dizziness, diarrhea and skin rashes. "And some of our participants still have a fever after three months," Spector says.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Severe damage to the lungs, heart and nervous system in some people is also of concern. The disease can cause cardiac arrhythmia or even trigger diabetes mellitus. Some patients suffer from severe concentration and memory disorders, much like dementia. Even young people can be affected. More than 1,000 children around the world have contracted multisystem inflammatory syndrome in connection with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can lead to myocarditis and circulatory failure.</p><h3>Nothing To Be Done</h3><p>"Many patients say: 'Before the coronavirus infection, I was a different person,'" says the Swiss heart surgeon Paul Vogt. Doctors now fear that the pandemic will leave behind an army of chronically ill people. Some hospitals in Germany are already beginning to set up outpatient clinics for the follow-up care of COVID-19 patients.</p><p>"People tend to think: Either you are dead, or you are healthy again," says the British physician Helen Salisbury. "But it does not work like this."</p><p>For weeks, all people talked about was intensive care units and artificial ventilation. "But now there are all these people, that will maybe be ill for a long time."</p><p>Salisbury treats several people who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and still suffer from exhaustion and bouts of fever or coughing and who quickly get out of breath. "All the tests are normal," she says. "There is no therapy I can offer to them." Many of the chronically sick are young -- and desperate. "But I can do nothing but listen to them," Salisbury says.</p><p>It's still a mystery to experts as to why the symptoms are so persistent and severe even after the patients have supposedly recovered from the disease. Doctors suspect it could be due to malfunctions in the immune system caused by an infection. It's also possible that once the virus succeeds in establishing itself somewhere in the body, it can strike repeatedly.</p><p>Or the lasting ailments could be a consequence of a lack of oxygen during the acute phase of the disease. Young COVID-19 patients in particular often don't notice for a long time just how badly their body is doing.</p><h3>Like Other Viruses</h3><p>Doctors see a parallel to another coronavirus disease. After the SARS pandemic in 2003, doctors continued to notice many chronically sick people, for instance in Toronto, Canada, where the worst outbreak outside of Asia took place. "When I heard of the SARS-CoV-2 long-term patients, I thought: Oh, I was waiting for this," says Harvey Moldofsky, a sleep and pain researcher and a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>A physician, Moldofsky has been a specialist in unusual diseases since early on in his career. That's why he was asked to step in and help after the 2003 SARS pandemic had subsided. "There was a group of 50 people that had all survived SARS, but although they had gone through rehab, they could not go back to work full time," Moldofsky says.</p><p>He interviewed 22 of those people in detail, and the stories he heard all sounded similar. "Over one year post-infection, they were still fatigued, weak, had muscle pain, sleeping problems and could not think straight," says Moldofsky.</p><p>All of these grievances are familiar to experts. Patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome also complain of muscle, head and neck pain. Many also speak of a "brain fog" that prevents them from being able to concentrate.</p><p>A number of viruses are believed to cause chronic fatigue syndrome. Among them are the influenza and Epstein-Barr viruses, the latter of which is known to cause infectious mononucleosis, or mono. Researchers now suspect that the strange affliction is, in fact, an autoimmune reaction triggered by the viral infection, which can affect the autonomic nervous system. Other symptoms can include heart palpitations, an increased susceptibility to infection and sleep disorder.</p><h3>Neurological Problems</h3><p>Carmen Scheibenbogen, the head of the outpatient clinic for adult immunodeficiencies at Berlin's Charité University Hospital, is one of the few German experts on chronic fatigue syndrome. Many people with COVID-19 are currently turning to the physician for answers about their odd symptoms.</p><p>But even she has to disappoint them for the time being. A reliable diagnosis can only be made six months after infection. "By then, there's a good chance that everything will calm down on its own," Scheibenbogen says. Only symptoms that last longer than six months are considered chronic. And even then, there are few options for treatment.</p><p>Scheibenbogen advises those affected to take good care of their bodies. "Overexerting oneself or doing sports that exacerbate symptoms should definitely be avoided. This can make things worse," she says.</p><p>In addition to chronic fatigue, COVID-19 patients can also suffer from a number of other neurological complications. "The neuroscience research community is slowly waking up to this," says Benedict Michael, a senior clinician scientist and neurologist at the Health Protection Research Unit and the University of Liverpool. He adds that 20 to 30 percent of patients who require hospitalization develop some neurological complication.</p><p>In late June, Michael and some colleagues published a study on the matter in the medical journal <em>The Lancet Psychiatry</em>. In it, they examined 125 patients who developed neurological problems as a result of COVID-19. Around 60 percent of participants, mainly older people, suffered a stroke after being infected. Close to a third of them showed signs of other cognitive or psychiatric changes, including many younger patients.</p><p>In all, 8 percent of the 125 people examined developed a psychosis in connection with their coronavirus infection. Just under 5 percent developed dementia. "Many young people are still living their lives in the pandemic and do not even think about the fact that there is a potential risk of developing problems for them too," warns Michael.</p><p>At least in some cases it's easy to explain what caused the brain damage. Strokes can occur because COVID-19 often causes blood to clot. It's also known that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can sometimes lead to encephalitis.</p><p>In many other cases, however, the cause of the complications is still unclear. "It is quite possible that this is an immune reaction," Michael says. For some, it could also be a result of stress or a lack of oxygen -- or everything altogether.</p><h3>Not the Only One</h3><p>For many patients, there's still hope that the neurological and psychiatric problems, as well as the other persistent complications like exhaustion, will diminish or eventually disappear.</p><p>The case of the general practitioner Stephanie de Giorgio from Kent in the UK is also cause for hope. The 44-year-old was likely infected by one of her patients. A mother of two, de Giorgio had no risk factors other than mild asthma and being a bit overweight could have been cause for concern. "Well, now it has got me, too," she thought. Fifteen days later, her fever subsided.</p>

We don't have a lot data or code locked away in legacy systems, and we don't have the inertia of established workflows.</p><p>One of our experiments in "how to work" has been surprisingly successful, and that is using <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter notebooks</a> in the wet lab.</p><p>We initially resisted the idea, even though we were already big fans of Jupyter.

In those kinds of situations, you usually have a basic framework for a protocol, but you need to work out the specifics in the lab — which depend on whatever is "new" about what you're doing.</p><p>We think of those specifics, which include things like time, temperature, and concentration as well as more complicated biological variables, as parameters of an abstract protocol. However, our tools didn't allow us to express the problem this way, and every time we adjusted a "parameter" or some assumption of our protocol, we needed to manually rederive the protocol steps.</p><p>Translating this protocol into a Jupyter notebook allowed us express the protocol design and steps as functions of parameters, which more closely matched our conceptual model. This immediately solved our practical pain points, and it also made scaling up production trivial, since the protocol was paramterized over all inputs.</p><p>We've put together a notebook to illustrate some of the concepts behind our Jupyter workflows.

The source is in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/ivynatal/public-notebooks">GitLab repository</a>.</p><p>We've since transitioned all of our lab protocols and notebooks (and some of our analyses) to Jupyter notebooks, and we've discovered that our Jupyter-based workflows increase documentaiton, reduce data duplication, and ease analysis.</p><p>So far, we haven't had any trouble working with partners or collaborators, because a PDF of a well annotated notebook is as good or better than many alternatives.</p><p>We hope over time to share more details of our workflows because we think they could be useful to other labs. Of course, this approach won't be for everyone; it's technology that our team was already comfortable with, and our switching costs were low.</p><p>We'd love to hear what you think — please <a href="https://www.ivynatal.com/contact" target="_blank">drop us a line</a>!</p><p>—Jeff and Colin</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Everyone has the same amount of time in a day, except for the day they are born and the day that they die. Those days are started late and ended early, respectively. Every other day is the same, 24 hours. </p>



<p>Most of what happens within our days are the results of choices, concious or otherwise. I may choose to sleep 8 hours while someone else chooses only to sleep 5. I am sure you have often heard people respond to something that they say they want to do with “I don’t have time”. “I know I should work out but I don’t have time … I wish I spent more time with my kids but I don’t have time … I love to read but I just don’t have time anymore.” These people are either lying to you, or more likely, they are lying to themselves. </p>



<p>Most of us feel we do not have time for things but in reality we do not have the relative desire for them. We may want them, but we do not want them as much as the other things we are doing with our time. If we did, we would do them instead. Importantly, I am not referring to a spoken want but an actual one. I can say I want six pack abs but if I am not willing to put in the physical work to get there I don’t really want that more than the other things I spend my time doing during my days.</p>



<p>Most of the time, most people don’t truly want hardly anything as much as they want to check Instagram or Twitter or email. Of course, these are not the things they want directly but a means towards getting them. A dopamine hit from an Instagram like, a bite size piece of information or entertainment from a Tweet, or a sense of purpose through a feeling that one is needed, good at their job, and therefore good at something because they are known to respond to their emails in less than 10 minutes no matter the hour or the day. I know these things from experience.</p>



<p>The fact is that when one truly wants something and wants it more than everything else competing for the time in their day, one will absolutely make the time for that thing. Time does not come out of thin air. It comes from the other things we occupy ourselves doing. Everything is a trade-off. We operate based on a descending list of the things we care about whether we know them are not. </p>



<p>To understand what a real want feels like, it is helpful to think about and experience the fundamentals. Years ago, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcJHC9J7l4">an awesome motivational speech by a guy named Eric Thomas</a> where he tells his students they will be successful when they want it as badly as a person who is drowning wants to breathe (if you want to watch the first 3 minutes you will get the gist). Occasionally, I run several miles without a water bottle and I am reminded in the last couple of miles what it feels like to be truly thirsty, to want nothing but water. When you are sick, you usually want nothing but to feel better. When you are starving, all you want to do is eat. You will make time for what you want most. We can only do so much at a time and more distractions than ever are competing for our attention. This is why so many people feel there is not enough time in the day. </p>



<p>Next time you think about something you want to do or know you should do but “don’t have time” for, think again. You have the time, you just don’t care enough. In many cases, you will be content with that realization. In others, you will want to change it. Fortunately, you can. It is not about time. It is about you.</p>

<p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-supplement-api-design-703c4f801722" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The growth and adoption of web-based APIs is key to the transformational technology journey of any enterprise. Those APIs, whether they are RESTful or not, remain synchronous. They, like the web, utilize the pattern of HTTP to implement a request-response interaction approach.</p>

<p>To illustrate, assume we have a project management API with the following interactions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project (e.g. POST /projects)</li>
<li>Create a new task (e.g. POST /projects/{projectId}/tasks)</li>
<li>Assign the task to someone on our team (e.g. POST /tasks/{taskId}/assignees)</li>
<li>The assignee marks the task as complete (e.g. PUT /tasks/{taskId})</li>
</ol>

<p>An API following this design works if design of the user interface closely mirrors those endpoints. But suppose an additional application requirement is to ‘automatically’ update a task’s status when marked complete by another user. With a request/response web-API, an option is to incessantly poll a status API on the chance a status might have changed. This is both cumbersome and error-prone.
Instead of polling, we can introduce an <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-event-driven-architecture">Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#introduction-to-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>In an event-driven architecture (or EDA), an application is composed of independent components that react to events published by other components. EDA is popular for distributed applications, as new components may be introduced into a solution to solve emerging problems — without the knowledge of previously developed components. Message brokers are used as an intermediary for communication, producing a loosely coupled design by preventing components from directly communicating with one another.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA), you have experienced EDA. Most service-oriented architectures used an enterprise service bus (ESB) for service communication rather than a message broker. Events were published to the ESB, where they were then routed to other services to integrate two or more software systems. However, ESBs proved problematic as they were used as “integration glue”, causing integration code to become scattered across services, apps, and the ESB; fragile systems were created. This fragility produced a greater need for coordination between teams, slowing software delivery.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture">The Emergence of a Microservice and Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To overcome this increased coordination, the microservice architecture was introduced as a replacement for traditional SOA. This newer distributed architecture, built on APIs and microservices, encourages “dumb pipes, smart endpoints.” Integration logic is pushed to the consumers and producers. Message brokers, rather than ESBs, are used for message routing, not integration logic. Services and APIs talk to one another while hiding implementation details. This loose coupling makes software more resilient to evolution as new requirements emerge.</p>

<p>As enterprises shift to APIs backed by a microservice architecture, the number of published events has grown considerably. Message brokers are typically transactional in nature, ensuring once-and-only-once delivery of messages. While useful for traditional software development, the transactional nature of message brokers limits the scalability of service communication.</p>

<p>Distributed streaming data platforms, such as Apache Kafka, now offer enterprises higher throughput than traditional message brokers. Kafka removes the need for transactional messaging found in message brokers, opting instead for turning events into message streams. These streams are accessible by any authorized subscriber and may be accessed real-time or processed sequentially from a predetermined location or at the start of the stream.</p>

<h2 id="api-design-with-event-streaming">API Design with Event Streaming<a href="#api-design-with-event-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Event streams help software extend beyond the request-response approach common to web API styles such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. Software can communicate bi-directionally, removing the need for API consumers to continually poll for state changes. Instead, APIs publish events to an event stream for notification of data changes or important business events to any number of subscribed services for further processing.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit our previous example. We needed to solve two separate requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notification when a task is marked as completed. Our only option without a message-driven architecture is to require interested parties to constantly make API calls to see if the task has been completed (aka polling)</li>
<li>Alerting a project owner when a task has been modified or marked as completed. Our only option is to mix our user interface concerns with our API by making the API send an email. The API is no longer responsible for managing projects and tasks — it is now responsible for the content and look-and-feel for email alerts</li>
</ol>

<p>If we introduce a message-driven architecture to our solution, we can develop an API that delivers project and task resources that offer the necessary capabilities (create, read, update, delete, and mark as complete). Our API doesn’t need to know about how the task completion event notification will be used, including that an email will be sent. All it needs to do is publish event messages when those events occur and allow other services to take action as appropriate. Events this API may publish include:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-suplement-api-design/event-examples.webp" alt="Example of API events" title="Example of API events"></p>

<p>Interested parties can then subscribe to the event(s) they are interested in and safely ignore the rest. In our example, we may end up with three components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Projects API</strong> — Manages the Projects and Project Tasks resources via a REST-based API. The API may be comprised of one or more microservices that implement the capabilities offered by the REST API. When any event, from the list in the table above, occurs then the API publishes an event into the appropriate message stream for consumption by event subscribers</li>
<li><strong>Task Completed Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Completed event, notifying project manager(s) via email when any task has been marked as completed</li>
<li><strong>Task Modified Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Updated event, notifying all team members via email when any task has been edited</li>
</ol>

<p>The API has no awareness of the two microservices subscribed to the specific events; it just publishes the events to the appropriate message stream. The solution is considered loosely coupled and therefore capable of evolving over time as new requirements emerge, perhaps with new types of notifications (e.g. SMS, web dashboard alerts) or integrations (e.g. synching to JIRA).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>The demand for more robust methods of software communication is pushing the limits of today’s interface solutions. Request/response-based APIs are essential. However, today’s technical problems are now demanding event-driven support — in addition to request/response — to improve an API’s capability offerings.</p>

<p>As API designers, we must strive to use all available tools to offer a better developer experience. As you enhance your existing APIs and new APIs emerge, ask yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can my solution architecture be improved by moving beyond standard REST APIs and into a loosely-coupled event-driven architecture?</li>
<li>What events should my API publish that would benefit API consumers?</li>
<li>How will my API consumers benefit from the addition of these events and how do they take advantage of them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s shift our approach from strictly request-response to thinking in terms of how our APIs can not only offer endpoints for requests, but events that enable the API to push to other services. The result will be increased innovation and more transformative APIs both within and across our LOBs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>When running your business, you engage with the services of many different suppliers. This can range from your power company to your web hosting service. In all of these arrangements, your business is buying a specific service at an agreed upon price.</p><p>For example, when you pay a web hosting provider, they are managing your server, your website content management system <em>(like WordPress)</em>, backups, availability, and security. This simplifies all of that for your business and the monthly fee you pay them is a fair exchange of value for the services they provide.</p><p>Now let's look at YouTube. Everyone knows the power of embedding marketing videos on their website. YouTube greatly simplifies this, allowing you to easily add videos to help build your business. In return for this life-bettering service, you pay YouTube… <strong>nothing (?)</strong>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><mark>Sounds like a great deal, except when you think about it, would <em>your</em> business provide its service for free?</mark></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Most businesses are built to, ultimately, exchange risk and hard work <em>(what it takes to build a business)</em> for financial return. While it might be nice to give away services for free, most business owners can’t afford to do so and keep the doors open due to all the costs associated with keeping those doors open.</p><p>So when YouTube offers their service to you for free, it doesn't mean they aren't looking to do the same things with their business as you are doing with yours. It just means that <strong>you aren't the customer</strong>.</p><p>So who <em>is</em> the customer? <em>Someone </em>must be paying YouTube for the service that they provide. We know it's not you the business owner embedding videos using their player on your website. Who is paying their bills?</p><p>Here's the answer: <strong>YouTube's customers are the advertisers</strong> who pay for access to the large audience and detailed targeting data that YouTube provides them. This is similar to the way advertisers pay for the ability to show commercials on television networks, or banners on media websites. These advertisers are the <em>real </em>customers, therefore, YouTube's business model is optimized to solve for the problems and needs of these paying customers.</p><p>So what does this mean for you, the web guy or small business owner that embeds videos using YouTube on your website? It means that YouTube is offering that free service to you in order to serve their actual customer the advertisers. Let's go through a couple of the ways that YouTube ends up benefiting from your video embed that you may not have thought about.</p><h3 id="showing-ads-">Showing Ads 👀</h3><p>The simplest, most direct way is that each video embed is a source of your customer/leads’ eyeballs that YouTube can now show ads to. This is in the form of inserting video commercials into your content, banner overlays on top of the video, and suggesting other videos after the user watches your video. </p><p>These are all fairly obvious and they <em>do </em>offer switches to turn some of this off during the embed process. However, the difficulty lies in keeping up with this as <strong>YouTube continually adds new ways to monetize these free video views on your website</strong>. So while you may believe you have ads on your videos turned off <em>today</em>, when YouTube introduces a new banner format, icon, or related videos format <em>tomorrow</em>, you’ll need to figure out how to turn them off all over again. You must continually stay on top of these changes and keep adjusting your embeds, otherwise, what you thought would be a clean video promoting your business ends up showcasing ads for other products. Or worse... ads for <strong>your competitors</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At Swarmify, our mission is to bring an accelerated, distraction-free video experience to websites of all sizes. Whether you’re a  <a href="https://swarmify.com/pricing/"><strong>website owner</strong></a>, <a href="https://swarmify.com/agencies/"><strong>an agency</strong></a>, or you just want to get in on <a href="https://swarmify.com/affiliate-program/"><strong>our affiliate program</strong></a>, we have a plan for you!</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="user-siphoning">User Siphoning</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This is a much more subtle cost but one that can have an incredible impact on your business. If you have ever watched a video on YouTube, you’ve most definitely seen related videos appear at the end of the video you watched. These related videos are personalized to each user’s behavior and fine-tuned with the strength of a million Google AI servers to pull them into watching more content. <mark>To be blunt, this is weaponized AI</mark> being used to maximize YouTube's chances of convincing a user on your website who watched your video, to watch additional videos chosen by YouTube. And with each of these videos watched, YouTube is able to serve more ads and make more revenue. That's the payoff on their end. Get your customers/leads to watch more YouTube videos and show them more ads.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://buzz.swarmify.com/content/images/2019/05/xtraffic_funnel-1.png.pagespeed.ic.x-xBpQW1fh.png" alt="YouTube costs you customers"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In addition to related videos, there's the not-so-subtle YouTube logo shown overtop your video. This means you are contributing to the company’s branding with every single watch of content on your website. By the time a user finishes watching one of your videos, it can be hard to tell who gets more benefit; your business or YouTube with all of the branding they throw on top.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="secret-weapon-detailed-targeting-">Secret Weapon: Detailed Targeting 🎯</h3><p>As discussed above, part of what YouTube is selling are the eyeballs to watch advertiser videos. But what becomes just as important for advertisers is the ability to target ideal potential customers. <strong>Showing ads for dog food to people without pets would be a huge waste of money</strong>. So YouTube needs to be able to deliver as much detail as possible on the motivations, demographics, and current needs each user has in order to better target ads for their advertisers.</p><p>The latest in AI-powered targeting is called <em>"in-market targeting"</em>. It uses AI to attempt to determine which users are likely to be ready to purchase some category of goods or services. This makes sense as we are all in-market for various goods or services at a given time. We might be tired of fixing our old car and so we are ready to start looking for a new one, but it might also be lunchtime and we are hungry and trying to figure out what food to get delivered. We are constantly <em>"in-market"</em> for purchases both large and small. Allowing an advertiser to show us their ad for a healthy and convenient chicken sandwich when we are ready to head out for lunch can be <em>devastatingly effective</em> at driving our behavior. Whereas showing us that same ad late in the evening when we are about ready to go to sleep would be almost useless.</p><p>Great. So <em>"in-market targeting"</em> is the greatest thing since sliced bread for YouTube's advertisers. How does this matter to your website where you simply embed a video showing off your beautiful dental office and smiling, friendly staff? Maybe it’s hit you how this ties together. <strong>YouTube is tracking the audience that views your website and feeding that into AI servers</strong> to determine what each user is in-market for. What that means, using the example of the dentist, is YouTube now knows these users are in the market for dental services. It learned that because they came to your dental website and watched your office promo video.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Now the value for advertisers kicks in. Those users will start seeing ads for other dental offices nearby as you have just clued YouTube (Google) into very valuable potential leads for your competitors. Every dentist using Google or YouTube ads can now start showing banner and video ads around the web talking about why they should choose their office over yours. <mark>By embedding a simple video on your website, you have just given all of your competitors access to your hard-earned leads</mark> who were highly likely to buy from you since they were already on your website. But now, they start researching or second guessing as they suddenly see ads for other options at every turn. All of us have been the victim of viewing a certain product and then, suddenly, every ad across the Internet seems consumed with selling variations or alternatives to that product. Now you know how it works. Its all enabled by an unassuming, <em>“free”</em> video player.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="other-options">Other Options</h3><p>At least now you know the <em>actual </em>cost of that video player. Part of the reason YouTube seems like such a great bargain for you is because of the imbalance in understanding the amount of value they get every time a business like yours uses their player. If you are fine trading off some of your leads and customers in return for the free price, then YouTube may work for you.</p><p>On the other hand, if the cost of leads and customers being siphoned away seems too high, then there are other options. Just like your web hosting and other services, there are providers that will give you simple tools to embed videos just as easily as YouTube. You pay a small monthly fee in exchange for a video player that is focused on delivering your video to your customers and keeping those high value leads on your website where they belong.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>How would you compare the Windows and macOS operating systems? In what ways are they similar? Why do they each take different approaches to solving the same problem? For the last 19&nbsp;years I've developed security software for Windows. Recently, I’ve started implementing similar features on macOS. Since then, people have asked me questions like this. The more experience I gained on these two operating systems, the more I realized they’re very different. Even when the problems they set out to solve are common, their paths differ. In this two-part series, I will focus on the operating system events supported by Windows and macOS, and explain each operating system's approach.
</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>In Part 1, we’ll discuss process events.&nbsp;In Part 2, we’ll discuss file and network events. These events&nbsp;are crucial for endpoint security analysis. Through multiple perspectives in this post, I hope to:
</p><ul><li>Help you better understand the general differences between macOS and Windows on the system level
	</li><li>Help those who want to expand their experiences onto another platform be better prepared and adapted to differences that might seem to be shocking from their past experiences
	</li><li>Help cybersecurity professionals enrich their toolsets for creating innovative security products</li></ul><p>This post is based on some of my own experiences.&nbsp;It does not intend to be an exhaustive list.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Open vs. closed</h3></strong></p><p>Microsoft Windows has traditionally been open. It runs on hardware from different vendors and allows third-party developers to write applications on top of it. macOS is part of Apple’s end-to-end integrated ecosystem, which is quite the opposite of being “open.” This article does not try to take sides on the decades-long “open vs. closed” debate. Apart from end-to-end user experience, developers and researchers usually care about other things.&nbsp;
</p><p>The abundance of APIs and documents provided by Windows really enabled developers to do virtually anything in the cyber world. While on the macOS side, the beauty of simplicity reminds people that Apple takes lots of things as their own responsibility instead of sharing them with third-party developers. If you find something from Apple difficult to use, it’s perhaps because you’re looking at something&nbsp;Apple feels is their own backyard.&nbsp;Take&nbsp;<a href="https://knight.sc/debugging/2018/08/15/macos-kernel-debugging.html">kernel mode debugging</a> or <a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2004/tn2118.html">kernel core dumps</a>&nbsp;as examples. On the upside though, macOS developers can indulge themselves in the open source&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu">Darwin kernel</a>, whereas Windows’ kernel is closed source&nbsp;and yet Windows developers feel spoiled with an abundance of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/">documentation</a>.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Microkernel vs. monolithic kernel</h3></strong></p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt0a39b4008faf9cb9/5eea6e7d18cea32a006fba82/macos-windows-kernels-blog-monolothic-kernel-vs-microkernel.png" data-sys-asset-uid="blt0a39b4008faf9cb9" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel">Structure of monolithic and microkernel-based operating systems</a></figcaption><p>Modern macOS and Microsoft Windows both have hybrid kernels, which are neither a pure microkernel, nor monolithic. However, one cannot infer that the two kernels are similarly architectured based on the same kernel type — they actually came from different places.
</p><p>Microsoft Windows, in the Windows 9x days, used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel">monolithic</a> kernel. macOS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU">XNU</a> consists of several core building blocks, one of which came from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)">Mach kernel</a> that carries the genes of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel">microkernel</a>. Even though both operating systems have evolved into today’s “hybrid” form, their early influences still manifest and affect developers’ daily lives. For example, Apple announced in WWDC 2019 it’s going to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/702/">deprecate kernel extensions (kext) support</a> for third-party developers starting with macOS 10.16. This means they are kicking third-party developers out of the kernel. For some, this may seem shocking. However, thinking from a microkernel point of view, this change sounds just like a logical next step.
</p><p>Over the years, Microsoft created a new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/">Windows Driver Framework</a>. It also moved lots of traditional kernel mode driver support into user mode, encouraging people to implement <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">drivers in user mode</a>. However, caveats exist. For example, in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page">Windows Filtering Platform</a>, even though most of the functionalities can be done in user mode, some of the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23533627/is-it-possible-to-implement-user-mode-callouts-in-wfp-windows-filtering-platfor">crucial functionalities</a> still have to be done in the kernel.&nbsp;
</p> <p><strong><h3>Backward compatibility vs. complete rewrite</h3></strong></p><p>Some people have doubts about Apple's WWDC 2019 kext deprecation announcement, as it means that backward compatibility is broken for any third-party software that includes kexts. People will have to rewrite things in user mode from scratch. It’s understandable that some may want Apple to delay or cancel the deprecation. Regardless, deprecation is&nbsp;happening as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g28d5j9l">planned</a>. Because it is a closed ecosystem and Apple retains end-to-end control, backward compatibility is never on its menu and deprecation has been a consistent part of macOS releases. Check out the “Deprecation” sections in a few of the past release notes: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_mojave_10_14_release_notes?language=objc">Mojave</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_catalina_10_15_release_notes?language=objc">Catalina</a>, and the coming release of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11-beta-release-notes">Big Sur</a>.
</p><p>This means, as a macOS developer, you may frequently find yourself rewriting everything from scratch — even if your software is well-architected and implemented. Windows, on the other hand, has been keeping its promise of backward compatibility. You may find applications created for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">Windows 3.1</a> still run on the latest Windows 10. Microsoft does occasionally attempt to deprecate things. For example, it has been trying to deprecate support for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/about-file-system-legacy-filter-drivers">legacy file system drivers</a> ever since the introduction of its replacement —&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/filter-manager-concepts">file system minifilter</a> — in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP">Windows XP SP2</a> on August 25, 2004. But, as of today, it’s still unable to do so. However, this doesn’t mean legacy file system drivers remain a viable choice for third-party developers.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Process events</h2></strong></p><p>Windows and macOS organize process events very differently. Windows provides a single kernel callback, set by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutine">PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</a>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">Ex</a>, to trace all process creations and terminations. macOS process events are mainly retrieved from two sources:
</p><ul><li>An executable file’s <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vnode.9">vnode</a> operations
	</li><li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/vfork.2.html"><em>fork()</em></a> system call activities</li></ul> <p><strong><h3>Windows</h3></strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</a> allows developers to register a callback with Windows. Later on when a process is created or exits, Windows will notify the caller by invoking the callback. The callback can be used for both prevention and notification. The parameters passed to the callback contain a rich set of information useful for process events, shown in the following figure:
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt45abfe2a9f2dc473/5eea6ea834f8f30c7cfb289a/macos-windows-kernels-blog-process-events.png" data-sys-asset-uid="blt45abfe2a9f2dc473" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 2: Screenshot of a debug session that shows PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx parameters
</figcaption><p>To learn how to use <strong><em>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</em></strong>, take a look at Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/general/obcallback">ObCallback&nbsp; Registration Driver</a> sample code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s also worth mentioning the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue23/flower/context.html">context of a process</a>. On Windows, when the callback registered by <strong><em>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</em></strong> is invoked, it’s in the context of the creating process for process creations. For process terminations, it’s in the context of the terminating process (see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">document</a>). Inside the Windows kernel, most of the time you can find out the actor process by simply calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-psgetcurrentprocessid">PsGetCurrentProcessId</a>, because the kernel service usually shares context with the actor process. However, in the macOS kernel (for <a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECLISTENERGOTCHAS">reasons</a>), developers are advised to avoid calling <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1488975-proc_self?language=objc">proc_self</a> in the kernel to find out the actor process. This is easier to understand from a microkernel’s point of view, because most of the system services are delegated to other processes on a microkernel system. Particularly, when <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Extend/Extend.html">kernel extensions</a> are replaced by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/system-extensions/">system extensions</a> (which runs in user mode) in macOS 10.16, the same advice should be strictly followed.
</p> <p><strong><h3>macOS</h3></strong> <strong><h4>Kauth/MACF</h4></strong></p><p><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html">Kauth</a> is a Kernel Programming Interface (KPI) provided by macOS to allow third parties — primarily security software developers — to intercept select operations.<sup>1</sup> As the definition suggests, it can only be used in kernel mode. There’s another KPI, called <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/mac.html">Mandatory Access Control Framework</a> (MACF), which is way more powerful than Kauth, but it’s Apple’s private KPI and not “open” for third-party developers. With the kext deprecation announcement, both Kauth and MACF won’t be available for third-party developers, starting with macOS 10.16. I briefly describe Kauth here to present a continuity view for you to get an idea of macOS's evolution:
</p><p>Kauth defines “scopes,”&nbsp;which Apple describes as “areas of interest” for authorization within the kernel.<sup>1</sup> A couple scopes in Kauth provide means for third-party software to get notified when a process is launched.
</p><ul><li><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECVNODESCOPE">Vnode scope</a>&nbsp;- Vnode scope is capable of preventing a process from being launched. By calling KPI <em>kauth_listen_scope(KAUTH_SCOPE_VNODE,...)</em>, a developer can register a vnode scope listener callback. When an operation on a vnode is about to happen, macOS will invoke the callback. The callback can then block or allow the operation. Vnode operations are not limited to executions. There are other types of vnode operations as well, such as open/close/read/write/etc. By checking <em>KAUTH_VNODE_EXECUTE</em> flag against the vnode operation (<em>action</em>), we know a file is executed — which roughly translates to “a process is launched” in Windows language.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECFILEOPSCOPE">File operation scope</a>&nbsp;- Similar to vnode, file operation scope is able to report operations on a file. The <em>KAUTH_FILEOP_EXEC</em> flag in the <em>action</em> parameter indicates that a file is being executed. However, file operation scope works only in listening mode. It can not be used to prevent a file from being executed inline.</li></ul> <p><strong><h4>Endpoint Security system extensions</h4></strong></p><p>macOS <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity">Endpoint Security</a> (ES) is a kind of System Extension which runs in user mode, and it’s the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/702/">replacement</a> for Kauth. In the new ES framework, event types are better organized in one enum definition 
	<strong><em><a href="#es_event_type_t">es_event_type_t</a></em></strong> defined in XCode’s SDK header file:
</p><p>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/EndpointSecurity/ESTypes.h
</p><p>You can see that process events are just a subset of ES events (more discussion about ES events can be found in the next File Events section). The few types of ES events pertaining to process events are:&nbsp;
</p><ul> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_EXEC</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXEC</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_FORK</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXIT</em></li></em></ul><p>Note that if you find “<strong><em>AUTH</em></strong>” in the event …</p></div></div></div></div></div>
