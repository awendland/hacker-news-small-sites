      <p>This is the official announcement for the release of Micro 3.0 better known as M3O - a platform for cloud native development. 
Our 3.0 release is a major refactor and consolidation of the existing tooling into something that addresses the entire workflow 
of build, run, manage and consume all from the developers perspective.</p>

<p>Read on to learn more or go straight to the <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/releases/latest">latest release</a>. 
Head to <a href="https://m3o.com/">m3o.com</a> for the hosted offering.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Micro focuses on developer productivity for the backend. It’s clear that the Cloud has become infinitely more complex 
over the past few years. Micro attempts to create order out of that chaos by distilling it all down to a handful of 
primitives for distributed systems development.</p>

<p>Why should you care? If you’re reading this you’ve no doubt encountered the tedious nature of infrastructure management, 
wrangling a kubernetes cluster on AWS or the thousands of things you need to do to cobble together a platform before 
starting to build a product. We think we’ve nailed the solution for that just as Android did for Mobile. Keep reading 
if you want to find out more.</p>

<h2 id="quick-flashback">Quick Flashback</h2>

<p>Micro started out as a <a href="https://micro.mu/blog/2016/03/20/micro.html">toolkit for microservices</a> development, 
incorporating an api gateway, web dashboard and cli to interact with services built using a Go RPC framework. 
Back then it felt like getting anyone to buy into PaaS again was going to be a losing battle. So we chose 
to write single purpose tools around an RPC framework thinking it might allow people to adopt it piece by piece 
until they saw the need for a platform. It was really straight forward right until it wasn’t.</p>

<p>There was a simple Go framework plus some surrounding 
components to query and interact with them, but like any long lived project, the complexity grew as we 
tried to solve for that platform experience that just couldn’t be done with a swiss army knife. The repo 
exploded with a number of independent libraries. To the creator its obvious what these are all for but to 
the user there is nothing but cognitive overload.</p>

<p>In 2019 we went through a <a href="https://micro.mu/blog/2019/06/10/the-great-consolidation.html">consolidation</a> of all those libraries 
which helped tremendously but there was still always one outstanding question. What’s the difference between 
<a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">micro</a> and <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro">go-micro</a>? It’s a good 
question and one we’ve covered before. We saw go-micro as a framework and micro as a toolkit but these 
words were basically empty and meaningless because multiple projects working in coordination really need a 
crisp story that makes sense and we didn’t have one.</p>

<p>In 2020 we’re looking to rectify that but let’s first let’s talk about platforms.</p>

<h2 id="paas-in-2020">PaaS in 2020</h2>

<p>5 years ago the world exploded with a proliferation of “cloud native” tooling as containers and 
container orchestration took centre stage. More specifically, Docker and Kubernetes redefined the 
technology landscape along with a more conscious move towards building software in the cloud.</p>

<p>Micro took a forward looking view even as far back as 2015. It was clear distributed systems and cloud native 
was going to become the dominant model for backend services development over the coming years but, what wasn’t clear 
is just how long we’d spend wrangling all sorts tools like docker, kubernetes, grpc, istio and everything else. 
It felt like we were rebuilding the stack and weren’t really ready to talk about development aspects of it all.</p>

<p>In fact at that time, people mostly wanted to kick the tyres on all these tools and piece something together. 
Running kubernetes yourself became all the rage and even using service mesh as the holy grail for solving 
all your distributed systems problems. Many of us have come to realise while all of this tech is fun 
it’s not actually solving development problems.</p>

<p>We’ve gotten to the point of managed kubernetes and even things like Google Cloud Run or DigitalOcean App 
Platform, but none of these things are helping with a development model for a cloud native era. Our 
frustrations with the existing developer experience have grown and Micro felt like something that 
could solve for all that, but only if we took a drastic step to overhaul it.</p>

<p>We think PaaS 3.0 is not just about running your container or even your source code but something that 
encapsulates the entire developer experience including a model for writing code for the cloud. Based on that 
Micro 3.0 aka M3O is a platform for cloud native development.</p>

<h2 id="what-even-is-cloud-native">What even is Cloud Native?</h2>

<p>What is cloud native? What does it mean to build for the cloud? What is a cloud service?</p>

<p>Cloud native is basically a descriptive term for something that was built to run in the cloud. That’s it. It’s not 
magic, it might sound like a buzzword, but the reality is it simply means, that piece of software was built 
to run in the cloud. How does that differ from the way we used to build before? Well the idea behind the cloud 
is that its ephemeral, scalable and everything can be accessed via an API.</p>

<p>Our expectation for services running in the cloud is that they’re mostly stateless, leveraging external services 
for the persistence, that they are identified by name rather than IP address and they themselves provide an 
API that can be consumed by multiple clients such as web, mobile and cli or other services.</p>

<p>Cloud native applications are horizontally scalable and operate within domain boundaries that divide them as 
separate apps which communicate over the network via their APIs rather than as one monolithic entity. 
We think cloud services require a fundamentally different approach to software creation and why Micro 3.0 
was designed with this in mind.</p>

<h2 id="micro-30-aka-m3o">Micro 3.0 aka M3O</h2>

<p>Micro 3.0 (M3O) reimagines Micro as a platform for cloud native development. What does that mean? Well we think of 
it as PaaS 3.0, a complete solution for source to running and beyond. Micro has moved from just being a Go 
framework to incorporating a standalone server and hosted platform. Our hosted offering is called 
<a href="https://m3o.com/">M3O</a>, a hat tip to Micro 3.0 or M[icr]o, whichever way you want to see it.</p>

<p>Another way to think about it. What Git is to GitHub, Micro is to the M3O platform. Let’s dig into it.</p>

<p>Micro 3.0 includes the following.</p>

<h3 id="server">Server</h3>

<p>The server is our abstraction for cloud infrastructure and underlying systems you might need for writing 
distributed systems. The server encapsulates all of these concerns as gRPC services which you can 
query via any language. The goal here is to say developers don’t really need to be thinking about infrastructure 
but what they do need is design patterns and primitives for building distributed systems.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.mu/images/micro-3.0.png"></p>

<p>The server includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Authentication</strong>: Auth whether its authentication or authorization is part of the system. Create JWT tokens, define access rules, use one system to govern everything in a simple and straight forward manner. Whether it’s for a user or a service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Configuration</strong>: Dynamic config management allows you to store relevant config that needs to be updated without having to restart services. Throw API keys and business logic related configuration into the secure config service and let your services pick up the changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Key-Value Storage</strong>: We’re focused on best practices for microservices development which means keeping services mostly stateless. To do this we’re providing persistent storage on the platform. Key-Value allows you to rapidly write code and store data in the format you care about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Event Streaming</strong>: Distributed systems are fundamentally in need of an event driven architecture to breakdown the tight dependencies between them. Using event streaming and pubsub allows you to publish and subscribe to relevant events async.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Service Registry</strong>: Micro and M3O bake in service discovery so you can browse a directory of services to explore your service APIs and enable you to query services by name. Micro is all about microservices and multi-service development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Service Network</strong>: Because you don’t want to have to resolve those service names to addresses and deal with the load balancing aspect, the server bakes in a “service mesh” which will handle your inter-service requests (as gRPC) and route to the 
appropriate instance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Identity Proxy</strong>: We include a separate identity proxy for external requests using gRPC via the CLI and other means. This enables you to query from your local machine or anywhere else using valid auth credentials and have it seamlessly work as if 
you were in the platform itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>API Gateway</strong>: Finally there’s an API gateway that automatically exposes your services to the outside world over HTTP. Internally writing service to service using gRPC makes sense, but at the end of the day we want to build APIs consumed from clients via HTTP.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clients">Clients</h3>

<p>The server provides inter-service communication and two means of external communication with a HTTP API and gRPC proxy but that 
experience is made much better when there’s user experience on the client side that works. Right now we’ve got two ways of doing this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Command Line</strong>: The CLI provides a convenient and simple way to talk to the server via gRPC requests through the proxy. 
The most convenient commands are builtin but every service you write also gets beautiful dynamic generated commands 
for each endpoint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>gRPC SDKs</strong>: Every service in the server is accessible via gRPC. We’re code generating clients for the server itself 
so you can access them from any language. What this enables is a wide array of experiences on the client side without 
having to handcraft libraries for each language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web Interface</strong>: Coming soon is a dynamically generated web interface that creates a simple query mechanism through a 
browser for any of your services. We’ve got a http api, gRPC proxy and command line interface but feel like the browser 
could use some love too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="framework">Framework</h3>

<p>One thing we really understood from our time working on go-micro was that the developer experience …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>Last week I ran a poll on Twitter to see what people considered with respect to the meaning of ‘pwd’ in Unix and Linux systems. The results were varied, for perhaps good reason.</em></p>

<p>At the end of Oct 2020 I ran a <a href="https://twitter.com/qmacro/status/1322567992551624705">brief poll on Twitter</a>, on which 82 people voted. Here’s that poll, and the results. They’re quite mixed, which at first might seem surprising. But there are reasons for that, as we’ll find out.</p>

<p><img src="https://qmacro.org/content/images/2020/11/twitter-poll-pwd.png" alt="Poll on Twitter: &quot;Fun Saturday afternoon shell poll. In Unix (and Linux), what do you think the P in $PWD (or pwd) stand for?&quot;"></p>

<p><strong>Print working directory</strong></p>

<p>The most popular option was “print working directory”. At first sight it seems logical: “print out the current working directory, i.e. where I am right now”. Moreover, the description in various versions of the manual for <code>pwd</code> help to drive home that notion. Typically we see sentences like “<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/pwd">print name of current/working directory</a>” or “<a href="https://www.mankier.com/1/pwd">print the current directory</a>”.</p>

<p>But there are lots of commands that print stuff, and are described in that way too. Take the <code>id</code> command. Here’s what one man page says: “<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/id.1.html">print real and effective user and group IDs</a>”. There’s “print” again. But the command isn’t <code>pid</code>, it’s <code>id</code>. When you think about it, many, many commands in Unix send information to STDOUT, i.e. to the terminal. That’s sort of the point of many of them.</p>

<p>This time arguably only superficially definitive, it would seem, the Wikipedia entry states, on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd">page for <code>pwd</code></a>: “the pwd command (print working directory) writes the full pathname of the current working directory to the standard output”. As if to underline the hopeful authority of this statement, there are five (!) footnotes that supposedly link to resources that back this up.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the first footnote points to a Wayback Machine copy of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050520231659/http://cm.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/v7vol1.pdf">UNIX PROGRAMMERS MANUAL - Seventh Edition, Volume 1 - January, 1979</a>, wherein there are actually zero references to <code>pwd</code> being short for “print working directory”:</p>

<p><img src="https://qmacro.org/content/images/2020/11/programmers-manual-pwd.png" alt="excerpt from UNIX PROGRAMMERS MANUAL on pwd"></p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but this historic document carries more weight for me than other sources I’ve come across, and it only serves here to undermine the credibility of the Wikipedia entry.</p>

<p>The rest of the footnote links seem dubious at best, except for the one pointing to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#pwd-invocation">GNU Coreutils manual on pwd</a> which has it as “print working directory”. But everything else I’ve seen so far makes me think that this is a misunderstanding that has spread for obvious and innocent reasons. In addition, the one footnote in the Wikipedia page that is not used to back this claim up is a pointer to <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pwd.html">The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 edition’s information on pwd</a>, which almost seems like it’s actually avoiding using the word “print” at all: “return working directory name” … “The pwd utility shall write to standard output an absolute pathname of the current working directory, which does not contain the filenames dot or dot-dot.”. Very specific, very not-print.</p>

<p>So I’m thinking that “print working directory” isn’t what <code>pwd</code> stands for. In fact, “print working directory” may be common to some man pages, but on this macOS machine, with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">BSD</a> heritage, we have, instead: “pwd – return working directory name”. Moreover, it goes on to say “The pwd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to the standard output”.</p>

<p><strong>Pathname of working directory</strong></p>

<p>So perhaps it really is “pathname of working directory”. That would, at least to me, make more sense. Not only does it eschew the redundancy of “print”, it also is more specific about the output - if I’m in <code>/home/dja/</code> for example, then invoking pwd will tell me that, i.e. where I am, including the whole path, and not just <code>dja</code>:</p>



<p><strong>Process working directory</strong></p>

<p>As for the other options, I do favour “process working directory”, mostly because it makes a lot of sense to me; every process in Unix has the concept of a current working directory, and that’s exactly what I’m asking for when I’m in my shell process and enter <code>pwd</code> - there’s a part in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/hgFBRZmwpSM?t=165">Unix terminals and shells</a> that explains this very well.</p>

<p>I’d love to be able to point to some old Unix sources that definitively explain the answer, but unfortunately that search has come up with very little - the <code>pwd</code> source in both the <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V5/usr/source/s2/pwd.c">5th</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yisooan/unix-v6/blob/master/source/s2/pwd.c">6th</a> Editions of Unix shed no light on this whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>Present working directory</strong></p>

<p>What about “present working directory”? Well, that option seems to have legs, in the form of the Korn shell. While <a href="https://northstar-www.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/ipe-help/dbx/dbx88cc.html">one source</a> implies that the answer might well be “pathname of current working directory”, in that <code>pwd</code> just emits the value of the <code>$PWD</code> environment variable (and a variable called “print working directory” makes no sense at all) … it would seem that in ksh-land, at least, “present working directory” is what <code>pwd</code> represents. Take, for example, the <a href="https://osr507doc.xinuos.com/en/man/html.C/ksh.C.html">ksh man page</a> which states “PWD - The present working directory set by the cd command”.</p>

<p>There’s a ton of discussion, both direct and indirect, on this very question. Take for example these two entries in the Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange forum: <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/399026/etymology-of-pwd">Etymology of $PWD</a> and <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/174990/what-is-pwd-vs-current-working-directory">What is $PWD? (vs current working directory)</a>. Of course, perhaps the definitive answer will never be found, as computing history is nothing if not varied and prone to forking.</p>

<p><strong>Multics and print_wdir</strong></p>

<p>Talking of history, we could go further back to pre-Unix roots, in the form of Multics, which indirectly gave rise to Unix (originally “Unics”). In the <a href="https://multicians.org/multics-commands.html">list of Multics Commands</a>, we see, nestled amongst other similarly named commands, something that jumps out at us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>print_mail (pm)	display mail in a mailbox
print_messages (pm)	display interactive messages in a mailbox
print_motd (pmotd)	display message of the day (source)
print_proc_auth (ppa)	display process's sensitivity level and compartments
print_request_types (prt)	display list of I/O daemon request types
print_search_paths (psp)	display search paths
print_search_rules (psr)	display ready messages
print_wdir (pwd)	display working directory
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s <code>pwd</code>, and in fact, just like its sibling <code>pmotd</code>, for example, which is short for <code>print_motd</code>, it’s short for <code>print_wdir</code>. Now, given the context of the original poll being set to Unix and Linux, perhaps we must discount this information. But as someone who is fascinated with Unix history in general - how can I?</p>

<p>I guess there are few things to conclude. The history is rich and diverse, and maybe we’ll never know for sure. Perhaps, in fact, the answer will depend on whom we ask. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter … but to those who delight in minutiae, it’s a fun topic worth exploring.</p>

    </p>
  

  

  

  <p>I conduct Rails performance audits for a living. Clients usually approach me with a request to speed up the backend, i.e., optimize the bottleneck API endpoint or tune the database queries. After the initial research, it often turns out that tweaking the frontend will make a better impact on the perceivable performance than fine-tuning the backend.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I describe the often-overlooked techniques that can significantly improve your web app’s overall performance.</p>

<p>These tips apply to all the web technologies like Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, Python Django, or Elixir Phoenix. It does not matter if you render an HTML or serve an API consumed by the JavaScript SPA framework. It all comes down to transferring bytes over the HTTP protocol. Frontend performance optimization is all about making this process as efficient as possible.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-frontend-performance-critical-for-your-websites-success">Why is frontend performance critical for your website’s success?</h2>

<p>I guess that developers often disregard the frontend performance because it doesn’t directly affect the infrastructure costs. Rendering the unoptimized website is offloaded to the visitor’s desktop or mobile device and cannot be measured using backend monitoring tools.</p>

<p>Developers usually work on top-notch desktop computers with a high-speed internet connection. They do not experience poor performance themselves. The UX of visiting your landing page on a 15 inch Mac Book Pro with a fiber connection cannot be compared to an old Android device on a shaky 3G network.</p>

<p>A typical web app issues dozens of requests on initial load. Only a few are backend-related, i.e., website HTML, API calls, etc. The majority of requests are static assets, JavaScript libraries, images. Fine-tuning the frontend-related requests will give a much greater return than shaving a couple of hundered milliseconds off a database query.</p>

<p>Google Bot measures the performance of your website, and it directly affects the SEO rating. Since <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-first-indexing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 2019</a>, Google Bot is using a <em>“Mobile first”</em> approach to assessing your website.</p>

<p>You might not care about frying the CPU and wasting the bandwidth of your mobile users. Maybe landing a sweet spot in Google search results should convince you to focus on your frontend performance?</p>

<h2 id="test-in-your-clients-shoes">Test in your client’s shoes</h2>

<p><em>“If you want to write fast websites, use slow internet.”</em>.</p>

<p>You should regularly throttle the internet speed during the development process to experience first-hand how your app will behave for most users.</p>

<p>On macOS, you can use the <a href="https://nshipster.com/network-link-conditioner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network Link Conditioner</a> to do it:</p>

<p>Also, both Firefox and Chrome developer tools offer the option to throttle the internet speed in the <strong>Network</strong> tab:</p>

<p>Maybe the internal demos of the new features should also be done on the throttled network? Everyone in the company should have the chance to see how the app really works for most users.</p>

<h2 id="reconnaissance">Reconnaissance</h2>

<p>Discovering frontend issues is usually more straightforward than backend ones. You don’t even need admin access to the website. By definition, the frontend issues are in the <em>frontend</em>. You can scan and diagnose every website out there. I use the following tools to perform the initial scan:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fastorslow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FastOrSlow</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebPageTest</a></p>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google PageSpeed Insights</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoogleChrome lighthouse</a></p>

<p>There’s no reason why ANY website shouldn’t score top on each of those tools. Read on if your score is anywhere below 90%.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://abot.app/" target="_blank">Abot landing page</a> is a dynamic Rails website getting top performance rating</p>





<h2 id="client-side-caching">Client-side caching</h2>

<p>Correctly configuring client-side caching is the most critical frontend optimization. I’ve seen it misconfigured in multiple production apps so far. <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Webpack</a> comes with a great mechanism to easily leverage client-side caching, i.e., <em>MD5 digest</em>. The production assets generation process must be configured to append the <em>MD5 digest</em> tag to the filename.</p>

<p>It means that in the production environment, the <code>application.js</code> file becomes <code>application-5bf4f97...95c2147.js</code>. The random suffix is generated based on the file contents, so it is guaranteed to change if the file changes. You must add the correct <code>cache-control</code> header to make sure that once downloaded, the file will persist in the browser cache:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">cache-control: public, max-age<span>=</span>31536000, immutable</code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>immutable</code> parameter ensures that cache is not cleared when the user explicitly refreshes the website on the Chrome browser.</p>

<p>If you’re using NGINX as reverse proxy you can use the following directive:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nginx"><span>location</span> <span>~</span><span>*</span> <span>\</span><span>.(?:ico|css|js|gif|jpe?g|png|woff2)</span>$ <span>{</span>
  <span>add_header</span> <span>Cache-Control</span> <span>"public,</span> <span>max-age=31536000,</span> <span>immutable"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>=</span><span>404</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I’ve seen many apps using <code>Etag</code> and <code>Last-Modified</code> headers instead of <code>Cache-Control</code>. <code>Etag</code> is also generated based on the file contents, but the client has to talk to the server to confirm that the cached version is still correct. It means that on every page visit, the browser has to issue a request to validate its cache contents and wait for <code>304 Not Modified</code> response. This  completely unnecessary network roundtrip can be avoided if you add a <code>Cache-Control</code> header.</p>

<h2 id="limit-bandwidth-usage">Limit bandwidth usage</h2>

<p>Nowadays, websites are just MASSIVE. It often takes multiple MBs to render a static landing page. Let me point out the most common mistakes that affect it and how they can be resolved.</p>

<h3 id="compress-and-resize-images">Compress and resize images</h3>

<p>There’s no excuse for serving uncompressed images on your website. You must make sure to process all your images with tools like <a href="https://compressor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compressor.io</a>. There’s often no perceivable difference for images processed with <strong>Lossy</strong> compression, and it usually means ~70% size reduction.</p>

<p>Resizing an image to the size that it actually needs is often overlooked. To check it, visit your website using Firefox on a large desktop screen, right-click the image, and select <strong>View image info</strong>. You’ll see what dimensions the image needs vs. how large it is now:</p>

<p><img alt="Checking real image" title="Checking real image" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/real-image-size-524abe8437774180a233461deb8ada35092fda22cee4b3dfe85c0d0ad2e757b8.png"></p>

<p>Make sure first to resize the image and only then compress it. Otherwise, you might lose quality.</p>

<h3 id="defer-images-loading">Defer images loading</h3>

<p>You should defer the loading of the images that are not visible in the initial viewport. During the initial load, dozens of requests are competing for network throughput. Delaying the transfer of unnecessary images will leave more resources for necessary assets like CSS stylesheets etc.</p>

<p>There’s <a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty</a> of <a href="https://github.com/tuupola/lazyload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different</a> <a href="https://github.com/vvo/lazyload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript libraries</a> that offer this feature. Including them means additional bandwidth usage, so I prefer to keep things simple and use a native <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-loading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>loading='lazy'</code></a> HTML attribute.</p>

<p>It has decent <a href="https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">browser support</a>. Have a look at how it affected one of my blog posts:</p>

<p><img alt="Checking real image " title="Checking real image " loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/before-lazy-images-a0e8cdb9099f3d5a348f853f4f222b67149aa058e59ecd29d2d5338be81cd8c0.png"></p>

<p>Without lazy loaded images</p>

<p><img alt="Checking real image " title="Checking real image " loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/after-lazy-images-836f1781a9b7bf56cd8883a0ad0d252f52223f74b856e7e994ecef1d52efd029.png"></p>

<p>Lazy loading for images enabled</p>



<p>As you can see, adding <code>loading='lazy'</code> to all the images reduced ten requests and over <em>250kb</em> of transfer on the initial load. That’s a massive deal for slower internet connections!</p>

<h3 id="enough-with-the-gifs-already">Enough with the GIFs already…</h3>

<p>GIFs are HUGE! I understand you want to showcase a fancy UI on your landing page, but maybe you could use a lazy-loaded movie clip instead? <em>10MB</em> GIF can be converted to <em>250kb</em> mp4 file… Twitter automatically changes <em>GIF</em> images to <em>mp4</em> files, so I’d trust them on this one.</p>

<h3 id="cherry-pick-and-measure-dependencies-size">Cherry-pick and measure dependencies size</h3>

<p>Many frontend libraries offer a modular approach to including them in your application. For example, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> allows you to customize the build to include only the components you need.</p>

<p>Some popular libraries have lightweight alternatives. Since recently, <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1304676118822174721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChromeDevTools suggests them</a>, so make sure to use it for your application.</p>

<h3 id="reconsider-3rd-party-dependencies">Reconsider 3rd party dependencies</h3>

<p>Overusing externally hosted 3rd party JavaScript libraries is the simplest way to kill the performance of your website.</p>

<p>Dropping in yet another <code>&lt;script src="..."&gt;</code> tag might not seem like a big deal. It’s easy to forget that one script can result in a cascade of requests, each including more resources. Here’s the cost of embedding sample 3rd party JavaScript libraries:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Requests</th>
    <th>Bandwidth (total/gzipped)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a></td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>104.09 KB / 40.37 KB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple Analytics</a></td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>5.29 KB / 3.12 KB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/follow-button/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter button</a></td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>173.68 KB / 59.30 KB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disqus</a></td>
    <td>26</td>
    <td>862.55 KB / 271.48 KB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://commento.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commento.io</a></td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>64.73 KB / 19.25 KB</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>



<p>The only 3rd party JavaScript dependency I use for this blog is <a href="https://commento.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commento.io</a> for comments. It’s over <strong>10x</strong> lighter than its alternative Disqus.</p>

<p>I’ve switched from using Google Analytics to SimpleAnalytics long ago. Recently I’ve decided I don’t need to track the visitors of this blog at all. Summary visit stats from Cloudflare are enough for me.</p>

<p><img alt="CloudFlare visits stats" title="CloudFlare visits stats" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/cloudflare-total-stats-2af208b0332a799e70e0aaa5495ef01c05c12ccc24514110accd3a4005817863.png"></p>

<p>All the tracking I need. No JavaScript dependencies required</p>


<p>Including 3rd party libraries from external sources often reduces your ability to set correct caching headers, thus hurting your performance score.</p>

<p>You should always look for the most straightforward tool that meets your requirements and only resort to using 3rd party if you cannot develop the lightweight solution yourself.</p>

<h2 id="http-2">HTTP 2</h2>

<p><em>HTTP 2</em> offers massive performance improvement over <em>HTTP 1.1</em> for loading static assets. Headers are compressed to reduce bandwidth. Even more important is that multiple assets can be loaded in parallel over a single HTTP connection.</p>

<p>It might not be critical for API calls, but for static assets, you should enable <em>HTTP 2</em> and expect serious performance gains.</p>

<p>How to do it depends on your infrastructure. If you’re using custom infrastructure with NGINX reverse proxy, you can check out <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-with-http-2-support-on-ubuntu-18-04" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re using Heroku, you’re out of luck because currently, it <a href="https://help.heroku.com/JAOCNZ25/does-heroku-have-plans-to-support-http-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not support HTTP 2</a>. The simplest way to add HTTP 2 support for Heroku is to proxy your traffic through <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a>.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to move your application to Cloudflare’s DNS, you can always use a custom domain just for serving assets from their CDN.</p>

<h2 id="physical-server-location-and-cdn">Physical server location and CDN</h2>

<p>The usage of CDN (<em>Content Delivery Network</em>) is critical if your user base is spread across the globe. Correctly configured CDN will cache static assets on the edge locations, significantly reducing the request’s duration. We’re talking like <em>50ms</em> vs. <em>800ms</em> (<strong>16x</strong> …</p></article></div>

            <p>
            The last six months, I've been building out the automated testing infrastructure at a start up.
            Our infrastructure is mostly in Python, but writing Bash scripts is inevitable.
            At the end of the day, automated testing is all about running commands in a row—and Bash is the right tool for the job.
            </p>

            <p>
            There are a <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls">whole</a> <a href="https://github.com/anordal/shellharden/blob/master/how_to_do_things_safely_in_bash.md">bunch</a> <a href="https://sipb.mit.edu/doc/safe-shell/">of</a> <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-errors/">articles</a> about how to write safe Bash scripts, and the standard advice is to add <code>set -euo pipefail</code> to make your scripts "safe."
            In this article, I'm going to describe one edge case where <code>set -e</code> completely fails to work.
            </p>

            <h2> Background </h2>

            <p>
            Suppose we have two projects in a git repo, say MyLibrary and MyApplication, where MyApplication depends on MyLibrary. And suppose each project provides a script <code>test.sh</code> that looks something like this:
            </p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

./configure
make

python fancy_test_driver.py tests/first_tests
python fancy_test_driver.py --option-1 tests/second_tests
python fancy_test_driver.py --option-2 tests/third_tests
</code></pre>

            <p>
            This is a pretty reasonable script.
            We can now require that all changes pass both <code>my_library/test.sh</code> and <code>my_application/test.sh</code> before being merged.
            </p>

            <p>
            As time goes on, the amount of tests (and projects!) can spiral out of control.
            Eventually, someone (me) gets tasked with trying to optimize things.
            One obvious thing to do is to abort early.
            If MyLibrary fails testing, we don't need to bother with testing MyApplication.
            </p>

            <p>
            Of course, the developers who used to get errors from both projects aren't very happy about this change.
            Now passing the <code>test.sh</code> scripts is like peeling an onion: you resolve the first layer of errors only to find more errors lurking underneath—hidden by the early abort.
            However, there's a middle ground.
            We can test MyApplication only if MyLibrary fails while running test cases.
            If MyLibrary fails during compilation, continuing on is pointless since MyApplication depends on MyLibrary.
            </p>

            <p>
            So how do we distinguish when <code>test.sh</code> fails during compilation from when it fails during testing?
            Exit codes, naturally:
            </p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE=79

./configure || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE
make || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE

python fancy_test_driver.py tests/first_tests
python fancy_test_driver.py --option-1 tests/second_tests
python fancy_test_driver.py --option-2 tests/third_tests
</code></pre>

            <p>
            And we're done!
            An exit code of 0 means we passed the tests, an exit code of 79 means compilation failure (no need to test further projects), and any other exit code means we failed in testing—so we can continue testing the other projects.
            </p>

            <h2> Finding the Problem </h2>

            <p>
            The above solution works fine when we only have two lines that need the special exit code.
            However, it quickly becomes unwieldly when it needs to be applied to more lines:
            </p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE=79

pushd codegen_tool1 || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE
./configure || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE
make || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE
./codegen_tool1 || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE
popd || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE

pushd codegen_tool2 || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE
./configure || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE
make || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE
./codegen_tool2 || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE
popd || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE

./configure || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE
make || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE

# Run some tests...
</code></pre>

            <p>
            Gross!
            Clearly, we should factor out the <code>|| exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE</code> line and have it apply to all of our lines at once.
            We can easily do this by creating a separate <code>build.sh</code> script:
            </p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

pushd codegen_tool1
./configure
make
./codegen_tool1
popd

# snip

./configure
make
</code></pre>

            <p>
            And then adjusting <code>test.sh</code> to just have:
            </p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE=79

./build.sh || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE

# Run some tests...
</code></pre>

            <p>
            And this, too, works great!
            But wait!
            Why even use a second script?
            Can't we do the exact same thing with a subshell?
            </p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE=79

(
    pushd codegen_tool1
    ./configure
    make
    ./codegen_tool1
    popd

    # snip

    ./configure
    make
) || exit $COMPILE_FAILURE_CODE

# Run some tests...
</code></pre>

            <p>
            <strong>No!</strong>
            This subshell implementation is dangerously broken.
            The rest of this article will explore how and why the subshell code does not function as expected.
            </p>

            <h2> There's a Problem? </h2>

            <p>
            Let's run some simple bash programs and see what happens.
            First, we'll confirm <code>set -e</code> works as expected.
            </p>

<pre><samp>$ cat script1.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Statement 1"
(exit 3)
echo "Statement 2"

$ echo "$?"
0

#!/bin/bash
set -e
echo "Statement 1"
(exit 3)
echo "Statement 2"

$ ./script2.sh
Statement 1

$ echo "$?"
3
</samp></pre>

            <p>
            Yep, that's what we expected.
            Without <code>set -e</code> Bash ran every statement, and with <code>set -e</code> Bash stopped after the first non-zero exit code.
            What if we put our statements in a subshell?
            </p>

<pre><samp>$ cat script3.sh
#!/bin/bash
(
    echo "Statement 1"
    (exit 3)
    echo "Statement 2"
)

$ ./script3.sh
Statement 1
Statement 2

$ echo "$?"
0

$ cat ./script4.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e
(
    echo "Statement 1"
    (exit 3)
    echo "Statement 2"
)

$ ./script4.sh
Statement 1

$ echo "$?"
3
</samp></pre>

        <p>
        And again, that's what we expected.
        The subshell made no difference.
        Note that <code>set -e</code> does propagate into the subshell.
        Alright. What if we mask the subshell's exit code?
        </p>

<pre><samp>$ cat script5.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e
(
    echo "Statement 1"
    (exit 3)
    echo "Statement 2"
) || exit 9

$ ./script5.sh
Statement 1
Statement 2

$ echo "$?"
0
</samp></pre>

        <p>And again everything works as...</p>

        <h2> Wait, what? </h2>

        <p>Okay. Maybe <code>set -e</code> doesn't propagate?</p>

<pre><samp>$ cat script6.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e
(
    set -e
    echo "Statement 1"
    (exit 3)
    echo "Statement 2"
) || exit 9

$ ./script6.sh
Statement 1
Statement 2

$ echo "$?"
0

$ cat script7.sh
#!/bin/bash
(
    set -e
    echo "Statement 1"
    (exit 3)
    echo "Statement 2"
) || exit 9

$ ./script7.sh
Statement 1
Statement 2

$ echo "$?"
0
</samp></pre>

        <p>
        Nope. Still doesn't work.
        Even if we just have <code>set -e</code> in the subshell and not in the outer script, it doesn't work.
        </p>

        <h2>So what's going on?</h2>

        <p>
        Well, if we dig into the Bash man page, we find this excerpt about <code>set -e</code>:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
              Exit  immediately  if a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound command (see SHELL GRAMMAR above), exits with a non-zero status.
              The shell does not exit if the  command  that  fails  is part  of  the command list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test following the if or elif reserved  words, <em>part of any command executed in a &amp;&amp; or || list except the command following the final &amp;&amp; or ||,</em> any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being inverted with !.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        So, the spec says that if you're using <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code>, only the last command's exit code can cause the shell to exit.
        This makes sense, because you expect  <code>command_1 || command_2</code> to execute <code>command_2</code> if <code>command_1</code> fails.
        Without this exception, it would be very hard to have any logical statements when <code>-e</code> is set.
        </p>

        <p>
        The behavior we just witnessed is, therefore, Working as Intended™.
        When we try to mask the subshell's exit code, we put the subshell at the start of an <code>||</code> list.
        So, the subshell's exit code will not cause an exit despite <code>-e</code> being set.
        But, every single command inside the subshell is <em>also</em> considered part of the <code>||</code> list, and thus no exit code anywhere in the subshell can cause the subshell to exit.
        It's as if <code>set +e</code> is being run implicitly in the subshell—only, as we've seen, we can't override it with an explicit <code>set -e</code> in the subshell.
        </p>

        <p>
        Is there anything we can do to fix this?
        Well, you're probably better off with one of the approaches I presented earlier.
        If you need to stay inside the same shell script, the solution with <code>trap</code> below is probably what you want.
        And if you truly need to use a subshell, I was able to come up with this mess:
        </p>

<pre><samp>$ cat script8.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e
echo "Some stuff with -e set"

set +e
(
    set -e
    echo "Statement 1"
    (exit 3)
    echo "Statement 2"
)
[[ $? -ne 0 ]] &amp;&amp; exit 9
set -e

echo "More code with -e set (unreachable)"

$ ./script8.sh
Some stuff with -e set
Statement 1

$ echo "$?"
9
</samp></pre>

        <h3>Bonus Solution</h3>

        <p>
        I ended up using <code>trap</code> for error masking:
        </p>

<pre><samp>$ cat script9.sh
#!/bin/bash

set -e

trap 'exit 9' ERR

echo "Statement 1"
(exit 3)
echo "Statement 2"

trap - ERR

$ ./script9.sh
Statement 1

$ echo "$?"
9
</samp></pre>

        <p>
        The nice part about this solution is it allows you to stick with just one script (useful if you need to use functions), and the logic is straightforward.
        This option can be harder to make work if you're already using <code>trap ERR</code> for cleanup, though.
        </p>

Also, it is what all those products, apps, and services promise to deliver. External productivity is all about automation, better tools, frameworks, software, and anything that allows you to perform your work better and faster. It has a significant potential to improve your performance by taking advantage of technology and advanced tools.</p><p><strong>Internal productivity,</strong> on the other hand, is often overlooked. Unlike the external one, internal productivity is all about your cognitive and physical performance, about your ability to focus, sustain your attention on the task at hand, manage your energy, and, generally speaking, understand how your body and mind works.</p><h2 id="gaining-productivity-expertise--the-pyramid-of-mastery">Gaining Productivity Expertise — The Pyramid Of Mastery</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-of-mastery-1.png" alt="Pyramid of Mastery"></p><p><a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">The Pyramid of Mastery</a> is a model that defines any domain in terms of 4 categories:</p><p><strong>Elements</strong> are the fundamental building blocks that make up a domain. In productivity, elements are abstract: focus, attention, working memory, sensory channels, etc.</p><p><strong>Rules</strong> are the laws by which the elements interact with each other and general principles that govern a domain. Some rules are: goal-directed attention is easily distracted, senses have a different throughput, working memory cannot perform two tasks simultaneously (hence multitasking is a myth), etc.</p><p><strong>Tools</strong> are the instruments that help you operate with the Elements and Rules. The majority of productivity tools nowadays are software apps. One of the best productivity tools is pen and paper.</p><p><strong>Frameworks</strong> are a combination of the previous layers. A Framework is a layer of abstraction that hides the underlying fundamentals behind a friendly facade that is easy to use to achieve a specific goal. Some frameworks in productivity are office suites and various productivity methods (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 Rule</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">The Eisenhower Method</a>, and others).</p><p>All four layers together allow you to be an expert in your field. Leave one out, and there will always be something you do not fully understand. And when you don’t understand something, you cannot be fully efficient at it.</p><p>If you would like to find out more about how the Pyramid of Mastery applies to the field of productivity, I wrote a separate <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/productivity/">article</a> on that topic.</p><h2 id="productivity-approaches">Productivity Approaches</h2><p>Generally speaking, you can be more productive by taking one or several of the following approaches:</p><p><strong>1. Delegate/Outsource the task.</strong> This approach is the most efficient from the time standpoint as it frees all your time and allows you to focus on other tasks. Although it is limited in how much you can delegate/outsource, it is crucial to keep in mind that you can and need to delegate.</p><p><strong>2. Automate the task.</strong> If you cannot delegate/outsource, think about whether your work on a task can be either fully or partially automated. There are lots of services, products, and programs that can do the work for you in a broad range of areas. If their cost is smaller than the value of the time you can save using them, then do it.</p><p><strong>3. Use better tools and learn them well.</strong> If automation is also not an option, then it means <em>you</em> need to do it. Having good tools is crucial if you want to be productive. A thorough understanding of their functions can make a big difference. In the case of software, learn its features and the shortcuts of the most frequently used functionality by you.</p><p><strong>4. Understand cognitive processes and learn what works best for you.</strong> Whenever we need to perform mental work, understanding <em>how</em> our <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/human-senses/">senses</a>, <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/attention/">attention</a>, <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">working memory</a>, and other relevant processes work can make a huge difference. As a plant flourishes, when the conditions are right, our brains can be incredibly performant whenever we offer them the right environment in which they can function.</p><h2 id="my-top-productivity-strategies">My Top Productivity Strategies</h2><p><strong>The Rule Of Threes.</strong> This is a meta strategy I came up with some time ago that help me make the right decisions when it comes to taking on new opportunities. No matter how productive you are, if you have too much on your plate, your attention and energy will split into too many places, and that will affect your productivity. The rule is simple: at any one point in time, I should have no more than three ongoing projects, and by an ongoing project, I mean any work that spans for longer than one week. Having more than that will scatter your energy and attention to the detriment of effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Plan Your Day In Advance.</strong> It is much easier to follow a predefined list of steps rather than having only the destination in mind and think about your next course of action after each task. The 10–15 minutes spent in the evening to decide and prioritize what you will work on will save you plenty of energy and time the following day.</p><h2 id="more-productivity-tips-for-every-day">More Productivity Tips For Every Day</h2><p><strong>1. Reduce Distractions As Much As Possible.</strong> If there is something that can distract you, sooner or later, it will distract you. Therefore, if you want to keep focused for a longer time, remove as many distractions as you can. This includes visual distractions on your table and screen (yes, those Facebook and Twitter tabs are hooking your attention pretty easy, aren’t they?), audial distractions (buy yourself a good pair of noise-canceling headphones), and other types of disturbances that distract you regularly.</p><p><strong>2. Put Your Phone Away.</strong> Although it is also a distraction, this tip deserves a separate mention. Put your phone on silent mode and away from your sight (not in your pocket). All those sounds (including notifications, calls, etc.) and flashes are nothing else than stimuli that have their primary goal to grab your attention and distract you from the thing you are focused on. It is also essential to put the phone away, as having it in your area of sight will also urge you to grab it when you see it on the table.</p><p><strong>3. Split Your Tasks Into Manageable Chunks.</strong> If an assignment is too big for you to comprehend, consider splitting it into several smaller subtasks until you get them of a size that you can easily accomplish. A positive side-effect of this is that smaller tasks provide a sense of progress, positively affecting your overall state and mood.</p><p><strong>4. Use Good Tools And Learn Them Properly.</strong> If you use software tools, learn the shortcuts of the programs you work in as it will save you dozens of hours within a year. If you use physical tools, buy high-quality tools, as they will pay off multiple times.</p><p><strong>5. Your Energy Is More Important Than The Allocated Time.</strong> Time Management is overrated. It’s not that timing your tasks is not essential, but <em>time is absolute.</em> It is independent of anything. Consider your energy levels when planning your tasks. Your energy is what matters when working on a job. You can spend 2 hours banging your head against something in the evening when you are tired and then complete that task in 30 minutes the next morning. Know when you are more productive and work on the most important tasks then.</p><p><strong>6. Use Visual Aids.</strong> A pen and a piece of paper are sometimes the best, simple, and most efficient productivity tools you can use. If the task you are working on relies on manipulating multiple pieces of information at a time, write them on paper or draw a diagram. That will free up resources necessary to store them in your working memory so that you can focus on processing and manipulating them instead. This will also involve your visual sense, allowing you to make more potentially relevant connections between ideas.</p><h2 id="all-productivity-articles">All Productivity Articles</h2><p>These are all articles I have written on productivity.

November 10, 2020 | https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/09/this-is-how-i-git/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/09/this-is-how-i-git/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Every now and then I get questions on how to work with git in a smooth way when developing, bug-fixing or extending curl – or how I do it. After all, I <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/10/26/working-open-source/" data-type="post" data-id="14901">work on open source full time</a> which means I have very frequent interactions with git (and GitHub). Simply put, I work with git all day long. Ordinary days, I issue git commands several hundred times.</p>



<p>I have a very simple approach and way of working with git in curl. This is how it works.</p>



<h2>command line</h2>



<p>I use git almost exclusively from the command line in a terminal. To help me see which branch I’m working in, I have this little bash helper script.</p>



<pre>brname () {
  a=$(<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2&gt;/dev/null</code>)
  if [ -n "$a" ]; then
    echo " [$a]"
  else
    echo ""
  fi
}
PS1="\u@\h:\w\$(brname)$ "</pre>



<p>That gives me a prompt that shows username, host name, the current working directory and the current checked out git branch.</p>



<p>In addition: I use Debian’s <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/debian/bash-completion/-/blob/master/README.md">bash command line completion</a> for git which is also really handy. It allows me to use tab to complete things like git commands and branch names. </p>



<h2>git config</h2>



<p>I of course also have my customized <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file to provide me with some convenient aliases and settings. My most commonly used git aliases are:</p>


<pre title="">st = status --short -uno
ci = commit
ca = commit --amend
caa = commit -a --amend
br = branch
co = checkout
df = diff
lg = log -p --pretty=fuller --abbrev-commit
lgg = log --pretty=fuller --abbrev-commit --stat
up = pull --rebase
latest = log @^{/RELEASE-NOTES:.synced}..
</pre>


<p>The ‘latest’ one is for listing all changes done to curl since the most recent RELEASE-NOTES “sync”. The others should hopefully be rather self-explanatory.</p>



<p>The config also sets <code>gpgsign = true</code>, enables mailmap and a few other things.</p>



<h2>master is clean and working</h2>



<p>The main curl development is done in the single <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">curl/curl</a> git repository (primarily hosted on GitHub). We keep the master branch the bleeding edge development tree and we work hard to always keep that working and functional. We do our releases off the master branch when that day comes (every eight weeks) and we provide “<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/snapshots/">daily snapshots</a>” from that branch, put together – yeah – daily.</p>



<p>When merging fixes and features into master, we avoid merge commits and use rebases and fast-forward as much as possible. This makes the branch very easy to browse, understand and work with – as it is 100% linear.</p>



<h2>Work on a fix or feature</h2>



<p>When I start something new, like work on a bug or trying out someone’s patch or similar, I first create a local branch off master and work in that. That is, I don’t work directly in the master branch. Branches are easy and quick to do and there’s no reason to shy away from having loads of them!</p>



<p>I typically name the branch prefixed with my GitHub user name, so that when I push them to the server it is noticeable who is the creator (and I can use the same branch name locally as I do remotely).</p>



<pre>$ git checkout -b bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</pre>



<p>Once I’ve reached somewhere, I commit to the branch. It can then end up one or more commits before I consider myself “done for now” with what I was set out to do.</p>



<p>I try not to leave the tree with any uncommitted changes – like if I take off for the day or even just leave for food or an extended break. This puts the repository in a state that allows me to easily switch over to another branch  when I get back – should I feel the need to. Plus, it’s better to commit and explain the change <em>before</em> the break rather than having to recall the details again when coming back.</p>



<h2>Never stash</h2>



<p>“git stash” is therefore not a command I ever use. I rather create a new branch and commit the (temporary?) work in there as a potential new line of work.</p>



<h2>Show it off and get reviews</h2>



<p>Yes I am the lead developer of the project but I still maintain the same work flow as everyone else. All changes, except the most minuscule ones, are done as pull requests on GitHub.</p>



<p>When I’m happy with the functionality in my local branch. When the bug seems to be fixed or the feature seems to be doing what it’s supposed to do and the test suite runs fine locally.</p>



<p>I then clean up the commit series with “<code>git rebase -i</code>” (or if it is a single commit I can instead use just “<code>git commit --amend</code>“).</p>



<p>The commit series should be a set of logical changes that are related to this change and not any more than necessary, but kept separate if they are separate. Each commit also gets its own proper commit message. Unrelated changes should be split out into its own separate branch and subsequent separate pull request.</p>



<pre>git push origin bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</pre>



<h2>Make the push a pull request</h2>



<p>On GitHub, I then make the newly pushed branch into a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pulls">pull request</a> (aka “a PR”). It will then become visible in the list of pull requests on the site for the curl source repository, it will be announced in the #curl IRC channel and everyone who follows the repository on GitHub will be notified accordingly.</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, a pull request kicks of a flood of CI jobs that will build and test the code in numerous different combinations and on several platforms, and the results of those tests will trickle in over the coming hours. When I write this, we have around 90 different CI jobs – per pull request – and something like 8 different code analyzers will scrutinize the change to see if there’s any obvious flaws in there.</p>

Graph snapped on November 5, 2020</figcaption></figure>



<h2>A branch in the actual curl/curl repo</h2>



<p>Most contributors who would work on curl would not do like me and make the branch in the curl repository itself, but would rather do them in their own forked version instead. The difference isn’t that big and I <em>could</em> of course also do it that way.</p>



<h2>After push, switch branch</h2>



<p>As it will take some time to get the full CI results from the PR to come in (generally a few hours), I switch over to the next branch with work on my agenda. On a normal work-day I can easily move over ten different branches, polish them and submit updates in their respective pull-requests.</p>



<p>I can go back to the&nbsp;master branch again with ‘<code>git checkout master</code>‘ and there I can “<code>git pull</code>” to get everything from upstream – like when my fellow developers have pushed stuff in the mean time.</p>



<h2>PR comments or CI alerts</h2>



<p>If a reviewer or a CI job find a mistake in one of my PRs, that becomes visible on GitHub and I get to work to handle it. To either fix the bug or discuss with the reviewer what the better approach might be.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, flaky CI jobs is a part of life so very often there ends up one or two red markers in the list of CI jobs that can be ignored as the test failures in them are there due to problems in the setup and not because of actual mistakes in the PR…</p>



<p>To get back to my branch for that PR again, I “<code>git checkout bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</code>“, and fix the issues.</p>



<p>I normally start out by doing follow-up commits that repair the immediate mistake and push them on the branch:</p>



<pre>git push origin <code>bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</code></pre>



<p>If the number of fixup commits gets large, or if the follow-up fixes aren’t small, I usually end up doing a squash to reduce the number of commits into a smaller, simpler set, and then force-push them to the branch.</p>



<p>The reason for that is to make the patch series easy to review, read and understand. When a commit series has too many commits that changes the previous commits, it becomes hard to review.</p>



<h2>Ripe to merge?</h2>



<p>When the pull request is ripe for merging (independently of who authored it), I switch over to the master branch again and I merge the pull request’s commits into it. In special cases I cherry-pick specific commits from the branch instead. When all the stuff has been yanked into master properly that should be there, I push the changes to the remote.</p>



<p>Usually, and especially if the pull request wasn’t done by me, I also go over the commit messages and polish them somewhat before I push everything. Commit messages should follow our style and mention not only which PR that it closes but also which issue it fixes and properly give credit to the bug reporter and all the helpers – using the right syntax so that our automatic tools can pick them up correctly!</p>



<p>As already mentioned above, I merge fast-forward or rebased into master. No merge commits.</p>



<h2>Never merge with GitHub!</h2>



<p>There’s a button GitHub that says “rebase and merge” that could theoretically be used for merging pull requests. I <em>never</em> use that (and if I could, I’d disable/hide it). The reasons are simply:</p>



<ol><li>I don’t feel that I have the proper control of the commit message(s)</li><li>I can’t select to squash a subset of the commits, only all or nothing</li><li>I often want to cleanup the author parts too before push, which the UI doesn’t allow</li></ol>



<p>The downside with not using the merge button is that the message in the  PR says “closed by [hash]” instead of “merged in…” which causes confusion to a fair amount of users who don’t realize it means that it actually means the same thing! I consider this is a (long-standing) GitHub UX flaw.</p>



<h2>Post merge</h2>



<p>If the branch has nothing to be kept around more, I delete the local branch again with “<code>git branch -d [name]</code>” and I remove it remotely too since it was completely merged there’s no reason to keep the work version left.</p>



<p>At any given point in time, I have some 20-30 different local branches alive using this approach so things I work on over time all live in their own branches and also submissions from various people that haven’t been merged into master yet exist in branches of various maturity levels. Out of those local branches, the number of concurrent pull requests I have in progress can be somewhere between just a few up to ten, twelve something.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

<b><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="4"><p>AppleCrate II:  A New Apple II-Based Parallel Computer</p>
</span><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><p>
Michael J. Mahon – July 26, 2008<br>
Revised – September 23, 2015</p>

<p><img src="http://michaeljmahon.com/CrateII.jpg" width="500" height="612"></p>

</span><span face="Arial, helvetica"><p>Introduction</p>
</span></b><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><p>
In 2004 I built the first <a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/Applecrate.html">AppleCrate</a>, an 8-board system, as an inexpensive, easy to program
vehicle for experiments in parallel programming—a kind of "blade server" for the Apple II, if
you will!  AppleCrate I (at the time I didn't realize that it was number "I" ;-) was great fun, and it
enabled some very interesting experiments, but over time I discovered some of its shortcomings.</p>

<p>First and foremost, since the boards were supported by only two edges and not clamped in place, it
was relatively fragile and hard to transport.  Second, I had come across situations in which more
than 8 slave processors would have been useful.  Third, my arrangement for collecting audio signals
synthesized by the slaves was quite makeshift and delivered sound with lots of digital "hash"
as background noise.  And finally, the original AppleCrate made no provision for plugging I/O cards
into any of its boards, so it had to be hosted by a separate Apple II, adding to the problem of
transporting it for demonstrations.</p>

<p>The AppleCrate II is designed to be significantly improved in all of the areas that were
problems for the AppleCrate I.</p>

<b></b></span><b><span face="Arial, helvetica"><p>Description</p>
</span></b><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2">

<p>The AppleCrate II is made from 17 Enhanced Apple //e main boards.  (Fifteen of these boards were
obtained in the same eBay auction that netted the eight unenhanced boards for the original AppleCrate.)
Because they are enhanced ROMs, the original NadaNet boot ROM code would not fit and a new
boot protocol had to be developed, as described below.</p>

<p>Instead of mounting the cards vertically in a frame, as in the original, I decided to mount them
horizontally in a stack secured with standoffs—3/4" long hexagonal rods, each with a screw protruding from
one end and a tapped hole in the other.  The AppleCrate II has nine "columns" of these standoffs—six
metal columns at the back and corners of the boards and three nylon columns interior to the boards
to add stiffness, as shown in the photo below at the 2-board construction stage:</p>

<p><img src="http://michaeljmahon.com/TwoBoards.jpg" width="800" height="554"></p>

<p>This "hi-rise" construction makes the "stack" quite rigid and sturdy, while eliminating the need
for a space-consuming exoskeleton.  It also has the advantage of leaving the top board unobstructed
so that I/O cards can be plugged in, allowing it to serve as the host machine for the AppleCrate.  (In fact,
I used 17 boards so that the top board can serve as master and leave 16 slave machines for parallel
programs.)</p>

<p>The Pushbutton 1 input and Annunciator 1 output bus wires and the AN2-to-PB2 GETID daisy chain wires are connected to
machined-pin sockets inserted into the 16-pin game port connector.  These connections support <a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/NadaNet.html">NadaNet</a>,
which is the only signal connection between the boards.  The network adapter (described below) is shown
with its mounting bracket under what will be the third board.  The power bus card is supported by a
similar angle bracket, and the standoffs immediately beneath them are filed down to accomodate the
bracket thickness.</p>

<p>The boards are powered by a PC AT power supply.  The average power consumed by an Apple //e
board is about 4.2 watts, so the whole 17-board crate consumes only about 70 watts in total,
and both the AppleCrate and the power supply run only a few degrees above ambient temperature.</p>

<p>I decided to use #12 copper bus wires
to distribute power to all boards (visible on the right side of the first photo).  I would have preferred
a connectorized approach, but I could not come up with a connector scheme with a
reasonable mating/unmating force.  As a result, I decided to go with soldered power connections.
(It's a good thing that Apple //e's are so reliable, since replacing one in the middle of the
stack would be relatively difficult!)</p>

<p>The top board is used as the "master" machine with I/O cards and an external keyboard plugged into it.
The Master boots the 16 slave Apples in the AppleCrate II and uses them to run parallel programs.
Once they have been booted and started, they can run independently of the master—though they are clearly
I/O-constrained!</p>

<b></b></span><b><span face="Arial, helvetica"><p>Indicators</p>
</span></b><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2">

<p>It has proven useful to have some real-time indication of each board's activity.  The stock board contains a
red "power" LED (at the right) and a red "speaker" LED at the left.  Both are easily visible from the back of the
boards (the "front" of the AppleCrate).  The function of the power LED is fixed, but the speaker LED is usable
as an indicator that software running on the board can operate, just by toggling the speaker.  For example,
printing a "beep"—CHR$(07)—causes the speaker LED to flash for 0.1 second, and can be used to indicate some
condition in the software.  (The speaker LED will not light when a speaker is installed, but AppleCrate
boards have no speakers attached.)</p>

<p>Although the Applecrate network interface described below incorporates an LED to show global network activity,
it is very useful to be able to see when any particular board is sending on the network.  This need is met by
using the PDL 3 timer to "stretch" each packet send operation into a visible flash of a green rectangular LED.</p>

<p><img src="http://michaeljmahon.com/SendLED.jpg" width="762" height="263"></p>

<p>These photos show the modification made to the 558 timer chip, in which a 267-ohm resistor (just what I
had handy—any value between 220 and 560 ohms is fine) is connected
between pins 5 and 8, and the "send" signalling LED is connected between pin 8 and ground, with pin 8 going to the
anode.  The rectangular LED is carefully pressed between the cassette input and output jacks.  On some boards,
the jacks were so close together that it was necessary to "shave" the upper plastic swage on the side of the input
jack with an Exacto knife to make room for the LED to press fit between them.  (Note that in these photos the red
wire connected to the anode of the LED has not yet been soldered.)</p>

</span><b><span face="Arial, helvetica"><p>Network Boot in NadaNet 3.x</p>
</span></b><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2">

<p>Since AppleCrate machines have no I/O capabilities other than
the network, they must be booted from the network.  This requires that the ROMs on the boards be replaced with
EPROMs containing modified RESET code to perform the network boot.</p>

<p>As with the AppleCrate I, replacement of the self-test code was the easiest path, since it is self-contained,
contiguous, and is executed upon power-on reset if no keyboard is connected.  However, the Enhanced //e ROM contains
only $200 bytes of self-test code, just half the size of the unenhanced //e self-test, requiring a new
design for the network boot.</p>

<p>The AppleCrate I used an "active" boot protocol, in which each board enabled by the "GETID daisy chain" (connected from
AN2 of the previous machine to PB2 of the current machine) continuously sent GETID requests to ID 1, until it was assigned
a permanent ID and received a NadaNet boot image.  The complexity of this protocol, requiring both sending and receiving
packets over the network, resulted in a boot ROM requirement of almost $400 bytes—which fit in an <b>Unenhanced</b> //e ROM.</p>

<p>Since the <b>Enhanced</b> //e ROM has only $200 bytes available, a new "passive" boot protocol had to be devised.
The <a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/PASSIVEBOOT.ROM.pdf">new ROM code</a> continuously monitors the network for a broadcast BOOTREQ control packet
containing  the load address and length of the immediately following boot code data.  When the boot image has been correctly
read from the network, control is passed to its starting address.  This passive boot code only needs to <b>read</b> packets from the
net, and so occupies just $190 bytes, which comfortably fits in place of the Enhanced //e ROM self-test code at $C600.</p>

<p>The new boot protocol capitalizes on the fact that boot code is sent as a broadcast transaction, so the
machines being booted do not need IDs to receive boot code.  A page of "second-stage boot" code is added at the
front of the slave machine boot image.  This code is given control immediately after the boot image is received, and,
when enabled by the "GETID daisy chain", it sends a GETID request to the machine that &amp;BOOTed it, making use of the
code in the full NadaNet boot image to do so (see the BOOT2 code in the <a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/NADA.CRATE.pdf">NADA.CRATE</a>
listing for details).</p>

<p>The GETID daisy chain functions just as it did in the AppleCrate I.  The "first" machine is permanently enabled
by connecting its PB2 to ground.  AN2 of each machine is connected
to PB2 of the "next" machine.  The second-stage boot code running in each machine initially sets its AN2.
Then it waits until it sees its PB2 go low, enabling it to send its GETID request.  When its GETID is successful
it drops its AN2, enabling the next machine.  Then it clears its video display, writes a banner showing the
machine ID, and enters its server loop.</p>

<p>This results in permanent
IDs being assigned in the fixed order of the physical daisy chain, while allowing all ROMs to be identical.
An LED on the AppleCrate II NadaNet adapter board is wired to the last machine's AN2, so that when the last
machine drops its AN2, the red LED extinguishes, signalling that all machines have booted successfully.</p>

<p>When a network-booting machine is reset, it first checks the network state.  If the network is low (ZERO),
it performs a cold start.  If the network is being held high (ONE), it checks page 3 to see if it is being cold started or warm reset.  If it is
a warm reset, it re-enters its Server loop.  If it is a cold start, it initializes and enters the ROM boot code, again waiting
for a BOOTREQ packet.  (This approach has the advantage of reliably forcing a reboot on a power cycle, while
still permitting boards to be warm reset while holding the network high.)</p>

<p>As of NadaNet 3.1, all AppleCrate boot ROMs must be <a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/PASSIVEBOOT.ROM.pdf">NadaNet 3.x capable</a>.</p>

</span><b><span face="Arial, helvetica"><p>AppleCrate II NadaNet Interface</p>
</span></b><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2">
<p><a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/NadaNet.html">NadaNet</a> is a TTL-level serial network in which logic high is represented by a voltage greater than +2 volts
and logic low is represented by a voltage less than +0.7 volts.  The fanout capability of a TTL annunciator output
is sufficient to  drive a dozen or so TTL pushbutton inputs if they are not otherwise …</p></span></div>

November 9, 2020 | https://zach.bloomqu.ist/blog/2020/11/aftermarket-cell-phone-battery.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://zach.bloomqu.ist/blog/2020/11/aftermarket-cell-phone-battery.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>This is a story of one manâ€™s quest for power.</p> <p>I purchased my current phone, a OnePlus 5T, in 2017. This summer, after about two and a half years of ownership, I noticed that it was no longer holding a charge all day. Frequently, the phone would reach 0% and shut off, right in the middle of tracking an evening bike ride or watching Netflix while cooking dinner. Although cell phone battery wear is a well-known issue, I got tired of it pretty quickly.</p> <p>I used the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digibites.accubattery&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">AccuBattery</a> app for about two months to try and get a handle on my battery health. It measured my phoneâ€™s amperage draw during the day and used that to estimate that of the 3300 milliamp-hour (mAh) capacity that my battery originally offered, only about 2400 mAh of capacity remained - only about 75% of the batteryâ€™s original health:</p> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/battery/oem-capacity.png" alt="Screenshot of AccuBattery app for OEM battery capacity"></p> <p>This answered the question of â€œwhy does it feel like my phone is shutting off so quickly?â€� pretty clearly. Now, it was up to me to get a replacement battery.</p> <h3 id="attempting-to-get-a-genuine-battery">Attempting to get a genuine battery</h3> <p>My first thought was that I could simply order the OEM OnePlus 5T battery somewhere online. Why not? I found a page on the OnePlus website where prices are listed for replacement parts. The USA page was down at the time of this writing, but the <a href="https://www.oneplus.in/support/pricing/detail?code=7">India support page</a> lists a OnePlus 5T OEM battery replacement as being about $15.</p> <p>This seemed acceptable to me. My first thought was to email OnePlus support asking how to purchase the battery. Unfortunately, according to the service rep, they do not ship or sell OEM batteries without service:</p> <blockquote> <p>We would like to inform you that we do not ship or sell the accessories in any parts of the world, and all the repairs are carried out by our Authorized service centers only. So if you wish to get the device repaired, you can send it to the OnePlus authorized service center and get the same repaired.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is in line with what other OnePlus customers have reported - nobody, as far as I can tell, has ever been able to source OEM batteries from OnePlus, leaving DIY customers like myself to try and find knock-offs elsewhere.</p> <p>I wouldâ€™ve sent my phone in for repairs, but after I received the above email, I had such a long and terrible customer support experience trying to arrange the repair that by the end of it, I no longer trusted OnePlus to reliably service and return my phone. This lack of trust was reinforced by horror stories from other OnePlus customers - one customerâ€™s phone was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/eleckw/sent_my_oneplus_5_to_fort_worth_tx_for_repair_no/">lost by the Fort Worth, TX service center</a>, anotherâ€™s was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/depgkg/oneplus_lost_my_coworkers_phone_during_repair_at/">lost and took 4 weeks before being returned</a>, and yet another customer had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/jke2kd/sent_my_op3t_for_a_battery_replacement_oneplus/">their phone held hostage unless they agreed to repairing EVERYTHING instead of just getting the battery replaced</a>. These stories, combined with my awful customer support experience, convinced me that sending my phone in would be a truly bad idea.</p> <h3 id="buying-an-aftermarket-battery">Buying an aftermarket battery</h3> <p>Many people on the /r/oneplus5t subreddit have recommended purchasing a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Android/OnePlus-5-5T-Replacement-Battery/IF330-018?o=2">replacement battery from iFixit</a>, but I felt like iFixit was simply selling cheap Chinese batteries with a nice label on them. I mean, if OnePlus can fix it for $15, why does the iFixit battery cost $30, if not for marketing?</p> <p>So, I hit up eBay and AliExpress, and eventually found the [sic] â€œSpecail Mobilephone Parts Storeâ€�, where they offer a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201109223630/https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000438352423.html">â€œ4650 mAhâ€� â€œPerfect business batteryâ€�</a> for the OnePlus 5T. With slogans like <a href="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/battery/giant-energy-huge-capacity.webp">â€œGiant energy; huge capacityâ€�</a>, <a href="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/battery/safety-does-not-explode.webp">â€œSafety does not explodeâ€�</a>, and <a href="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/battery/ensure-qualified-and-safe-to-use.webp">â€œEnsure qualified and safe to useâ€�</a>, I felt confident that my $11.87 was going to a good place. I placed the order and, about 3 weeks later, I received the battery in my mailbox.</p> <h3 id="battery-physics-101">Battery Physics 101</h3> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/battery/oem-and-aftermarket.jpg" alt="Photo of the OEM battery and the aftermarket battery side-by-side"> <small>The OEM battery (left) and the aftermarket battery installed (right).</small></p> <p>The first thing I noticed about the replacement battery was that the capacity was even HIGHER than what I ordered. The OnePlus 5T OEM battery is rated at 3300 mAh capacity, the AliExpress product page advertised a battery with 4650 mAh capacity, and the label on the battery I received claimed an astounding <em>5350 mAh</em> capacity - 162% of the OEM capacity. Clearly, I had gotten a great deal!</p> <p>The second thing I noticed was that the aftermarket battery was significantly lighter than the OEM battery. So much lighter that I weighed the batteries out of curiosity. The OEM OnePlus 5T battery weighed 47.0g. The aftermarket OnePlus 5T battery weighed 38.7g, or about 17% less.</p> <p>Itâ€™s amazing that Da Da Xiong was able to achieve 162% capacity with 17% less weight. Too amazing to be true, in fact.</p> <p>Via Wikipedia, I learned that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_energy">specific energy</a> of a lithium-ion polymer battery can be up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery">265 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg)</a>. The nominal voltage of the lithium-ion polymer batteries here is about 3.8V. We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law">Ohmâ€™s law</a> to calculate the maximum possible capacity of each battery based on weight, assuming that each battery is always supplying the nominal 3.8V.</p> <p>Letâ€™s start by calculating the maximum possible Amp-hours (Ah) per kilogram (kg) for a Li-ion poly battery at 3.8V, using Ohmâ€™s law:</p> <div><div><pre><code>265 Wh/kg / 3.8 V = 69 Ah/kg
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now, we can calculate the maximum physically possible capacity for each battery by multiplying this number by the weights of each battery:</p> <div><div><pre><code>OEM battery:          .047 kg * 69 Ah/kg = 3.2 Ah = 3200 mAh
Aftermarket battery: .0387 kg * 69 Ah/kg = 2.6 Ah = 2600 mAh
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The astute reader might be wondering why this estimate for the maximum capacity of the OEM battery (3200 mAh) is less than the capacity OnePlus advertises (3300 mAh). Why is this? Well, itâ€™s because the assumption we made - that each battery is always supplying the nominal 3.8V - is false. The voltage output of a Li-ion poly battery <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/li-ion-and-lipoly-batteries/voltages">drops over time</a>, so the calculation shown is only a lower bound approximation of each batteryâ€™s maximum capacity.</p> <p>I donâ€™t have information about the exact chemical composition of these batteries, nor the voltage charts, nor do I know what the upper and lower voltage limits are on the OnePlus 5T charging circuit. However, if we estimate that the voltage drops from 3.8V to 3.0V in a linear fashion (<code>V = 3.8 - .8t, 0 &lt;= t &lt;= 1</code>), we can use integration to arrive at approximately 3600 mAh maximum capacity for the OEM battery and 2900 mAh maximum capacity for the aftermarket battery.</p> <p>Even without exact numbers, these calculations demonstrate that <em>something</em> is fishy about the Da Da Xiong batteryâ€™s mAh claims.</p> <h3 id="real-world-usage">Real-world usage</h3> <p>Anyways, I didnâ€™t buy this shady AliExpress battery just so that I could do a bunch of math. I purchased it to restore my phoneâ€™s ability to last all day, and it has definitely succeeded at that. From a qualitative perspective, I now have enough juice to keep my phoneâ€™s battery fueled all day until I can recharge it at night.</p> <p>From a quantitative perspective, AccuBattery reports that the aftermarket battery has an estimated 3360 mAh capacity, which about matches the capacity of the OEM battery:</p> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/battery/aftermarket-capacity.png" alt="Screenshot of AccuBattery app for aftermarket battery capacity"></p> <p>However, what AccuBattery fails to account for is the fact that once the aftermarket battery reaches 15%, the battery percentage begins to free-fall until it reaches 0% and shuts off. It seems like 15% on the aftermarket battery is equivalent to 1% on the OEM battery. I think this is because the Android OS cannot correctly estimate the batteryâ€™s remaining charge because it has different voltage characteristics than the OEM battery, but it doesnâ€™t really bother me, I just have to make sure that to charge the phone at 15% instead of 1%. This seems to be an extremely common experience with DIY battery replacements - even folks using the iFixit battery run in to this issue.</p> <p>If we take 15% off of AccuBatteryâ€™s estimated capacity, we get 2856 mAh, which is really really close to what a brand new OnePlus 5T reports - AccuBattery estimates the OEM battery as having ~3000 mAh capacity when it is brand new. That about matches my experience - with the Da Da Xiong battery, the phone is staying alive longer, almost like when it was new.</p> <h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3> <ul> <li>Random Chinese batteries do not work as advertised - they will not magically double your phoneâ€™s battery capacity.</li> <li>However, random Chinese batteries work <em>almost as well</em> as brand new OEM batteries, but your battery percentage will forever be miscalibrated.</li> <li>Never trust OnePlus customer service.</li> </ul> </div></div>]]>

<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/snoyberg/snoyman.com/edit/master/content/posts/haskell-bad-parts-2.md">Edit this page on Github</a>
</i>
</p>

<p>If you didn’t see it, please check out <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1">part 1 of this series</a> to understand the purpose of this. Now, for more bad parts!</p>
<h2>Partial functions (in general)</h2>
<p>Laziness very likely belongs in this list. My favorite part of criticizing laziness is how quickly people jump to defend it based on edge cases. So let’s be a bit more nuanced before I later get far <em>less</em> nuanced. Laziness is <strong>obviously</strong> a good thing. Strictness is <strong>obviously</strong> a good thing. They also both suck. It depends on context and purpose. Each of them introduce different kinds of issues. The real question is: what’s a more sensible default? We’ll get to that another time.</p>
<p>I called this section partial functions. Am I having a senior moment? Maybe, but I intentionally started with laziness. In a strict language, function calls can result in exceptions being thrown, segfaulting occurring, or panicking. (And if I write a “Rust: The Bad Parts”, believe me, I’ll be mentioning panicking.) The fact that a function <em>acts</em> like it can successfully perform something, but in fact fails in a predictable way (like failing a <code>HashMap</code> lookup), it should be reflected at the type level. If not, ya dun goofed.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a language that doesn’t let you reflect this information at the type level: ya dun goofed.</p>
<p>Partial functions are the antithesis of this concept. They allow you to say “yeah dude, I can <em>totally</em> give you the first value in an empty list.” Partial functions are like politicians: you can tell they’re lying because their lips are moving. (“But Michael,” you say. “Functions don’t have lips!” Whatever, I’m waxing poetical.)</p>
<p>Alright, so plenty of languages screw this up. Haskell tells those languages “hold my beer.”</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snoyman.com/static/images/holdmybeer.jpg"></p><p>Haskell screws up partial functions way, way worse than other languages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It promotes a whole bunch of them in the standard libraries and <code>Prelude</code>.</li>
<li>Some libraries, like <code>vector</code> (I’m getting to you, don’t worry) make it <em>really</em> confusing by providing an <code>index</code> and <code>unsafeIndex</code> function. Hint: <code>index</code> isn’t really safe, it’s just less unsafe.</li>
<li>There’s no obvious way to search for usages of these partial functions.</li>
<li>And, by far, the worst…</li>
</ol>
<h3>Values are partial too!</h3>
<p>Only in a lazy language does this exist. You call a function. You get a result. You continue working. In any other non-lazy language, that means you have a value. If I have a <code>u32</code> in Rust, I actually have a <code>u32</code> in Rust. Null pointers in languages like C and Java somewhat muddy this situation, but at least primitive types are really there if they say they’re there.</p>
<p>No, not Haskell. <code>x :: Int</code> may in fact not exist. It’s a lie. <code>let x = head [] :: [Int]</code> is a box waiting to explode. And you find out <em>much</em> later. And it’s even worse than that. <code>let alice = Person { name = "Alice", age = someAge }</code> may give you a valid <code>Person</code> value. You can evaluate it. But Cthulhu help you if you evaluate <code>age alice</code>. Maybe, just maybe, <code>someAge</code> is a bottom value. Boom! You’ve smuggled a dirty bomb out.</p>
<p>I’m not advocating for removing laziness in Haskell. In fact I’m not really advocating for much of anything in this series. I’m just complaining, because I like complaining.</p>
<p>But <em>if</em> I was to advocate some changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecate partial functions</li>
<li>Introduce a naming scheme for partial functions to be more obvious</li>
<li>Introduce a compiler warning to note partial function use (with a pragma to turn off specific usages)</li>
<li>Warn by default on partial pattern matches</li>
<li>Advocate strict data fields by default</li>
</ul>
<h3>But ackshualllly, infinite loops</h3>
<p>Someone’s gonna say it. So I’ll say it. Yes, without major language changes, you can’t prevent partial functions. You can’t even detect them, unless Turing was wrong (and I have my suspicions.) But Haskell community, please, please learn this lesson:</p>
<p><strong>DON’T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD</strong></p>
<p>We can get rid of many of the most common partial functions trivially. We can detect many common cases by looking for partial pattern matches and usage of <code>throw</code> (again, horribly named function). “But we can’t get everything” doesn’t mean “don’t try to get something.”</p>
<h2>Hubris</h2>
<p>Given what I just said, we Haskellers have a lot of hubris. Each time you say “if it compiles it works,” a thunk dies and collapses into a blackhole. We’ve got plenty of messes in Haskell that don’t sufficiently protect us from ourselves. The compiler can only do as good a job as our coding standards and our libraries allow.</p>
<p>“But Haskell’s at least better than languages like PHP.” I mean, obviously I agree with this, or I’d be writing PHP. But since I’m being ridiculously hyperbolic here, let me make a ridiculous claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PHP is better than Haskell, since at least you don’t get a false sense of security</strong></p>
<p><em>- Michael Snoyman, totally 100% what he actually believes, you should totally quote this out of context</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve said this so many times. So I’ll say it again. Using a great language with safety features is one tiny piece of the puzzle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you get the software requirements right?</li>
<li>Did you leverage the type system to prevent the bugs you’re trying to prevent?</li>
<li>Do your underlying libraries have bugs?</li>
<li>Did you find a way to implement a function with correct types but incorrect semantics?</li>
<li>Did you host the thing on a dinky server sitting under your desk and forget that you have power outages on a daily basis?</li>
<li>Did you forget to write a single test case?</li>
<li>Do your test cases actually test anything meaningful?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <em>so many ways</em> for software to fail outside the purview of the type system. We’ve got to stop thinking that somehow Haskell (or, for that matter, Rust, Scala, and other strongly typed languages) are some kind of panacea. Seriously: the PHP people at least know their languages won’t protect them from anything. We should bring some of that humility back to Haskell.</p>
<p>Haskell provides me tools to help prevent certain classes of bugs, so I can spend more of my time catching a bunch of other bugs that I’m absolutely going to write. Because I’m dumb. And we need to remember: we’re all dumb.</p>
<h2>More partial functions!</h2>
<p>You know what’s worse than partial functions? Insidiously partial functions. We’ve all been screaming about <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> for years. My hackles rise every time I see a <code>read</code> instead of <code>readMaybe</code>. I can’t remember the last time I saw the <code>!!</code> operator in production code.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of other functions that are just as dangerous, if not more so. More dangerous because they aren’t well known to be partial. They are commonly used. People don’t understand why they’re dangerous. And they fail only in edge cases that people aren’t thinking about.</p>
<p>Exhibit A: I present <code>decodeUtf8</code>. (Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/kerckhove_ts/status/1321390954172063745?s=20">Syd</a>.)</p>
<p>Go ahead, search your codebase. Be dismayed that you’ve found it present.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with <code>decodeUtf8</code>? As we established last time, character encoding crap breaks stuff in production. UTF-8 works about 99% of the time, especially for people in Western countries. You’ll probably forget to even test for it. And that function looks so benign: <code>decodeUtf8 :: ByteString -&gt; Text</code>.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT BE FOOLED</strong></p>
<p>This function is a ticking time bomb. Use <code>decodeUtf8'</code> (yes, it’s named that badly, just like <code>foldl'</code>) and explicitly handle error cases. Or use I/O functions that explicitly handle UTF-8 decoding errors and throw a runtime exception.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe Michael still thinks runtime exceptions are a good idea.” I’ll get to that another time. I don’t really believe they’re a good idea. I believe they are omnipresent, better than bottom values, and our least-bad-option.</p>
<h2>Law-abiding type classes</h2>
<p>Now I’ve truly lost it. What in tarnation could be wrong with law-abiding type classes? They’re good, right? Yes, they are! The section heading is complete clickbait. Haha, fooled you!</p>
<p>There’s a concept in the Haskell community that all type classes should be law-abiding. I’ve gone to the really bad extreme opposing this in the past with early versions of <code>classy-prelude</code>. In my defense: it was an experiment. But it was a bad idea. I’ve mostly come around to the idea of type classes being lawful. (Also, the original namespacing issues that led to <code>classy-prelude</code> really point out a much bigger bad part of Haskell, which I’ll get to later. Stay tuned! Hint: Rust beat us again.)</p>
<p>Oh, right. Speaking of Rust: they do <em>not</em> believe in law-abiding type classes. There are plenty of type classes over there (though they call them <code>trait</code>s) that are completely ad-hoc. I’m looking at you, <code>FromIterator</code>. This is Very, Very Bad of course. Or so my Haskell instincts tell me. And yet, it makes code Really, Really Good. So now I’m just confused.</p>
<p>Basically: I think we need much more nuanced on this in the Haskell community. I’m leaning towards my <em>very</em> original instincts having been spot on. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Law abiding type classes: great</li>
<li>Flippantly non-law-abiding type classes ala the original <code>classy-prelude</code>: bad</li>
<li>“You know what I meant” typeclasses like <code>ToContent</code> in Yesod: also great</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t exactly in line with a “bad part” of Haskell. Up until now I’ve been giving a nuanced reflection on my journeys in Haskell. Let me try something better then. Ahem.</p>
<p><strong>DON’T LECTURE ME ON LAW ABIDING TYPE CLASSES AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE LAWS</strong></p>
<p>I’m staring at you, <code>Eq Double</code>. No, you cannot do equality on a <code>Double</code>. (And thanks again to Syd for this idea.) Rust, again, Got It Right. See <code>PartialEq</code> vs <code>Eq</code>. Floating point values do not allow for total equality. This makes things like <code>Map Double x</code> dangerous. Like, super dangerous. Though maybe not as dangerous as <code>HashMap Double x</code>, which deserves its own rant later.</p>
<p>So come down from your high horses. We don’t have law abiding type classes. We have “if I close my eyes and pretend enough then maybe I have law abiding type classes.”</p>
<h2>Unused import warnings</h2>
<p>Haskell has a dumb set of default warnings enabled. (“I think you mean GHC, one implementation of Haskell, not Haskell the language itself.” Uh-huh.) How can we <em>not</em> generate a warning for a partial pattern match? Come on! ADTs and pattern matching is <em>the</em> killer feature to first expose people to. And it’s a total lie: the …</p></div></div>

<p>I recently started looking into using Rust and the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> Game Engine for developing games. A very quick experiment recently was to compare performance of GDScript, Visual scripting and Rust for the same task.</p>



<p>It is simple: Let us just draw a ton of lines to have a lot of traffic between our code and the engine:</p>

<p><img src="http://extrawurst.github.io/assets/godot-rust-benchmark/result.png" alt="res"></p>

<p>In fact it is so many lines that we end up with a filled circle. Nothing beautiful, this is just a benchmark afterall 👌</p>



<p>Let us look at the contenders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>gdscript</li>
  <li>visual script</li>
  <li>gdnative (rust)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>GDScript</strong> is the official scripting language shipping with Godot.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Script</strong> is the official node based way to visually script in Godot (think Unreal Blueprint or Unity Bolt)</p>

<p><strong>GDNative</strong> is the official C-Api to access Godot from escentially any language. We are using <a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust">Godot-Rust</a> to be able to compile shared libraries from Rust code to interface with Godot.</p>

<hr>

<p>The entire test with all three options can be found on github: <a href="https://github.com/extrawurst/godot-rust-benchmark">extrawurst/godot-rust-benchmark</a></p>

<p>Rerun it for yourself :)</p>

<h2 id="gdscript">GDScript</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the official way of doing things in Godot - using GDScript:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>extends</span> <span>CanvasItem</span>

<span># how many lines to draw? (this can be adjusted from the editor UI)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>_draw</span><span>():</span>
	<span># lets measure the runtime</span>
	<span>var</span> <span>startTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>OS</span><span>.</span><span>get_ticks_usec</span><span>()</span>

	<span>update</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="visual-script">Visual Script</h2>

<p>The following screenshot shows the same logic in a visual node based way:</p>

<p><img src="http://extrawurst.github.io/assets/godot-rust-benchmark/visualscript.png" alt="vs"></p>

<p>We immediately see how this is more verbose but at least it is possible and it even just crashed once on me 🙈</p>

<h2 id="gdnative-rust">GDNative (Rust)</h2>

<p>We are using <a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust">Godot-Rust</a> for this.</p>

	<span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>I am not going to further comment on the ergonomics of either language. I really did this for two reasons: 1) can we do all we need in the visual script and 2) how does performance compare between the alternatives</p>

<p>Here are the timings:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>type</th>
      <th>usecs</th>
      <th>slowdown</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>gdnative (rust)</td>
      <td>~980 usec</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gdscript</td>
      <td>~5112 usec</td>
      <td>5x</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>visual script</td>
      <td>~7099 usec</td>
      <td>7x</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><sub><sup>(executed on a macbook 2016 3,3 GHz i7, 16 GB Ram, Intel Iris 550 and Godot 3.2.3, avg. over 10 runs)</sup></sub></p>

<p>On twitter people noted that this might change with Godot 4.0 and the support of type checking in gdscript. This could be interesting to measure once 4.0 is released.</p>

<p>For now my conclusion is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GDScript is easy and quick to learn</li>
  <li>Visual Scripting in Godot works although it feels a little instable</li>
  <li>Godot-Rust is a clear alternative to write entire Godot games in</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course point 3) is limited to people coming with a Rust background otherwise the Rust part in it is a clear challenge to learn first.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, when I was trying to open an account at a financial institution here in Hong Kong, someone noticed I was born in the USA and my account was denied.</p><p>They wrote “I regret to inform you at this time we are unable to accept bank wire deposits/withdrawals from US citizens. For more information, please refer to our article: Restricted nationalities and countries.” While this is a common experience for Americans living abroad, one I’ve experienced many times before, it was a mistake, a mistake that reminded me to write this blog post.</p><p>A few days ago, I received a rather passive-aggressive email from one of my banks asking me to “let us know about your tax connection to the United States” with the threat of closing my account if I don’t. Another common experience for Americans living abroad, another mistake and another reminder to write this post.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-10-22-at-5.52.02-PM.png" alt=""></figure><p>Tomorrow, Americans will vote to choose one of two candidates no one really likes. I’m not allowed to vote this time around because two years ago, I finally rid myself of the burden that is American citizenship.</p><h2 id="a-hard-story-to-tell">A hard story to tell</h2><p>I’ve tried to write this blog post a number of times over the past two years. I’ve written entire drafts of this post from scratch more than once and never published them, unhappy with the tone or the content or the narrative or worried about the reaction of people I’ve never met on the internet. Perhaps it was the years of brainwashing…I mean, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_education_in_the_United_States">civic education</a>”…in US public schools that has scared my psyche and made me afraid of what the tribe will do when it finds out I’ve deserted them. Having to say the "Pledge of Allegiance" every day during one's childhood before he knows what the words "pledge" or "allegiance" even mean really does a job on one's mind.</p><p>I want to tell my story because I hope that it will benefit others on their journey towards personal freedom just the stories of others benefited me.</p><p>Our story starts about a year ago, in October 2019.</p><p>It's 2am on a Saturday morning in Hong Kong and I can't sleep. My body thinks it's still in Paris after two weeks in Europe. One year ago today, I also couldn't sleep but for a different reason. I was tossing and turning from stress the night before what I thought was going to be the biggest decision of my life: to give up US citizenship.</p><p>After over 11 years living outside of the USA, I had made an appointment on October 12, 2018, at the US Consulate in Hong Kong to go through the process known as "expatriation" or "renouncing US citizenship."</p><p>This was the second appointment in the process. The first had been a few weeks prior, on August 31, 2018. You see, the United States wants you to believe that giving up US citizenship is a Big Deal, and in many ways it is! You lose a whole bunch of rights granted by citizenship such as no longer being able live or work in the country unless you get a visa. In this day and age of passports, visas and borders, (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/features/a-history-of-the-passport/">it didn't used to be like this</a>! travel used to be free as in freedom!) if you didn't have another citizenship, you could become "stateless" with nowhere to go and no way to get past borders to get there. To someone like me who was born and raised in suburban Ohio, this felt like a Big Deal.</p><p>What they don’t tell you, is that you’re also freed from a number of coercive obligations you never agreed to that other countries don’t impose on their citizens by opting-out of US citizenship. They tell you it's all pain with no gain.</p><p>To drive home the Big Dealness of the decision, the State Department made me make two appointments at the consulate to make sure I got their point. And I had to make the appointments well in advance as they were fully booked for months. I wasn’t the only American in Hong Kong trying to exit.</p><p>At the first appointment, a nice vice consul named Rachel took me in to a tiny interview room complete with an American flag in the nondescript Garden Road compound. Our interview began with Rachel hitting her head on the phone on the wall quite hard as she was sitting down and me asking her with a bit of a shock, “OMG, are you okay?!?!" After a minute or so of rubbing her head and grimacing, she was fine and we started with our interview.</p><p>She roughly followed a script that is specified in the <a href="https://fam.state.gov/fam/07fam/07fam1260.html">US State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual</a>. She asked me questions about myself and my decision. Where was I from? (Ohio) How long have I lived abroad? (Since May, 2007) Where does my family live? (My parents live in the US and my brother lives in Bulgaria). Did I have another citizenship and passport? (Yes, Italian) Why did I want to give up US citizenship? (It's complicated, but I didn't feel American anymore and when visiting the US anymore I felt like a tourist).</p><p>After the questions she started reading me a list of what came off as warnings and disclaimers to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into:</p><ul><li>Any children I had wouldn't become US citizens</li><li>Might not be able to travel to the US again</li><li>Wouldn't be able to live or work in the US an appropriate visa</li><li>I would still have to file for and pay taxes that I owe</li><li>If I didn't have another citizenship I could be come stateless</li></ul><p>She then instructed me to take a couple of weeks for a "period of reflection" (this is required according to State Department regulations) and handed me a packet of papers to review listing the consequences giving up my blue passport and outlining the tax implications.</p><p>Where better to go to reflect and get some clarity on my decision to exit the US than to visit a country struggling with its own exit decision, the United Kingdom? So I headed off to the UK for a short vacation followed by a work trip in London.</p><p>By the time I made my first August appointment, I'd already made the decision - I'd been thinking about it for years and had done a ton of research and due diligence. I'd read a lot about other people's experiences and thinking. I was particularly inspired by bitcoin investor Roger Ver's story and Balajis Srinivasan's talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">Voice vs Exit</a>.</p><p>I was most concerned about losing the right to live and work in the US - it seems so many people want this right and that they're willing to go through great pain and inconvenience to get it. However, I hadn't ever used this right in the almost 20 years of my adult life. I’d always competed on the global market without the benefit of “work authorization” protecting me from competition of “aliens.” As life long entrepreneur and a strong advocate of remote work, I didn't ever see myself wanting to sign up for some office job in the States. But would I want to live there?</p><h2 id="a-tourist-in-my-own-country">A tourist in my own country</h2><p>In 2016, I flew to California and rented a car to do some due diligence on the country I was thinking of leaving. I spent a month driving across the US and back, taking in the sites and visiting places I thought I might like to live. The natural beauty of America and her parks is breathtaking. While it is amazing to visit and even vacation for a few weeks, it wasn’t someplace I'd want to live. New York and Chicago were my favorite cities, but cold climate and snow is a turn off as is the crumbling infrastructure and confiscatory tax rates.</p><p>A number of tech friends moved to Austin for the low tax and warm weather, so I stopped there for a few days. After over a decade in Asia, Austin hardly seems big enough to even be called a city. My impression was that it is a bunch of suburban sprawl with some bigger buildings in the middle. And I much prefer being on islands surrounded by water instead of landlocked.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/IMG_5406.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>In June of 2018, I took a vacation to America’s only state that is “a bunch of islands surrounded by water,” Hawaii. I had found memories of visiting the Aloha state as a child and wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing out on some future destiny where Larry becomes a Hawaiian like George Clooney in <em>The Descendants</em>. The nature was nice, but the poverty, crime and remoteness from everywhere made it not very attractive as a future home.</p><p>I'd discussed the decision with family and friends. Friends ranged from very unhappy to mildly supportive to downright enthusiastic. My brother, also an entrepreneur who has lived outside of the States for more than a decade, was understanding of the challenges the USA imposes on its entrepreneurs abroad and very supportive. My parents were skeptical that it was the right decision. They'd lived their whole lives in the USA and grown up on stories of World War II valor and of their grandparents who had struggled to immigrate to the United States for a better life. They shared their views with me but never gave me any pressure and let me make my own decision.</p><h2 id="the-oath">The oath</h2><p>October 12, 2018, my second appointment in the renunciation process, quickly arrived. I couldn’t really sleep the night before. I was nervous about both the appointment and a <a href="https://blog.blockstack.org/a-path-to-decentralization/">big work announcement</a>. Lots of things were changing.</p><p>In the morning, I woke up and took a taxi to the US consulate for my appointment. Here’s a picture of me before the appointment. You can see the stress in my face.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/IMG_8562.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>After entering the consulate and going through security, the first step of the appointment was paying the fee: US$2,350. You can’t free yourself from the Land of the Free without having the cash money to buy your freedom. Think of the renunciation fee as an emancipation fee, a lot of money, but a small price to pay for freedom.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/https---blogs-images.forbes.com-robertwood.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>The actual renunciation ceremony was sort of an out-of-body blur. I felt like I was watching myself in the little room with the American flag renouncing my allegiance (which of course the US education system forces children who don’t know what the word “allegiance” means to “pledge”) to the USA.</p><p>The consular official told me that they would take my US passport and hold on to it until the State Department approved my renunciation and return it to me canceled along with my Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN) at some later date. He advised that if I needed to travel to the US I might be able to borrow the passport for a trip if the …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Let’s say I’m ordering burritos for my two friends while they quar up in Jersey City, and want to calculate the total price of my order:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of spreadsheet; burrito price is listed as $7, burrito price w ship as burrito price plus $3, num burritos is 2, and total is num burritos times burrito price w ship, for a total of $20" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_0.png"></p>
<p>It’s a little confusing to follow the flow of data in a spreadsheet when it’s written like that, so I hope you don’t mind this equivalent diagram that represents it as a graph:</p>
<p><img alt="the previous spreadsheet represented as a graph, with arrows from one cell to another replacing the spreadsheet cell references" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_1.png"></p>
<p>We’re rounding the cost of an El Farolito super vegi burrito to $8, so assuming the per-burrito delivery toll remains at just $2 per burrito, it looks like the total for our two burritos will be $20.</p>
<p>Oh no, I completely forgot! One of my friends loves to wolf down multiple burritos at a time, so I actually want to place an order for three burritos. If I update <code>Num Burritos</code>, a naïve spreadsheet engine might recompute the entire document, recalculating first the cells with no inputs, and then recalculating any cell whose inputs are ready until we’ve finished every cell. In this case, we’d first calculate <code>Burrito Price</code> and <code>Num Burritos</code>, then <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code>, and then a new final <code>Total</code> of $30.</p>
<p><img alt="same as previous graph, but num burritos is updated to 3, and every cell is tagged as &quot;recalc&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_2.png"></p>
<p>This simple strategy of recalculating the whole document may sound wasteful, but it’s actually already <em>better</em> than VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet software ever made, and the first so-called “killer app”, responsible for popularizing the Apple II. VisiCalc would repeatedly recalculate cells from left-to-right and top-to-bottom, sweeping over them again and again until none of them changed. Despite this “interesting” algorithm, VisiCalc remained the dominant spreadsheet software for four years. Its reign ended in 1983, when Lotus 1-2-3 swept the market with “natural-order recalculation”, <a href="https://aresluna.org/attached/computerhistory/articles/spreadsheets/tenyearsofrowsandcolumns">as described by Tracy Robnett Licklider in Byte Magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lotus 1-2-3 exploited natural-order recalculation, although it also supported VisiCalc’s row- and column-order modes. Natural-order recalculation maintained a cell dependency list and recalculated a cell before recalculating cells that depended on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lotus 1-2-3 implemented the “recalculate everything” strategy we’ve shown above, and for the first decade of spreadsheets, that was as good as it got. Yes, we recalculate every cell in the document, but at least we only recalculate every cell once.</p>
<h2>but what about “burrito price w ship”</h2>
<p>Great point, header 2. In my three burrito example there’s no reason to recompute <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code>, because changing the number of burritos we order can’t possibly influence the per-burrito price. In 1989, one of Lotus’ competitors realized this, and created SuperCalc5, presumably naming it after the theory of super burritos at the core of this algorithm. SuperCalc5 recalculated “only cells dependent on changed cells”, which would make updating the burrito count look more like this:</p>
<p><img alt="same as prior graph, with burrito count updated from 2 to 3, but now only the two affected cells &quot;num burritos&quot; and &quot;total&quot; are tagged as recalc" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_3.png"></p>
<p>By only updating a cell when one of its inputs changes, we can avoid recalculating <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code>. In this case, it saves just a single addition, but on larger spreadsheets it can save quite a bit of time! Unfortunately, we now have another problem. Let’s say my friends now want meat burritos, which cost a dollar more, and simultaneously El Farolito adds a $2 fee paid per-order, regardless of how many burritos you order. Before any formula outputs are recalculated, our graph might look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="same as prior graph (after burrito count update finished calculation), but now burrito price is being updated from $8 to $9, and simultaneously total is updated from &quot;burrito price w ship * num burritos&quot; to &quot;burrito price w ship * num burritos + $2 fee&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_4.png"></p>
<p>Since there are two updated cells here, we have a problem. Should we recalculate <code>Burrito Price</code> first, or <code>Total</code>? Ideally, we first calculate <code>Burrito Price</code>, notice that its output has changed, then recalculate <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code>, and finally recalculate <code>Total</code>. However, if we instead recalculate <code>Total</code> first, we’ll have to recalculate it a second time once the new $9 burrito price propagates down. If we don’t calculate cells in the right order, this algorithm isn’t better than recalculating the whole document. In some cases, it’s as slow as VisiCalc!</p>
<p>Clearly, it’s important for us to figure out the right order to update our cells. Broadly, there are two solutions to this problem: dirty marking and topological sorting.</p>
<p>This first solution involves marking all cells downstream from an edit as dirty. For instance, when we update <code>Burrito Price</code>, we would mark the downstream cells <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code> and <code>Total</code> as dirty, even before doing any recalculations:</p>
<p><img alt="same as prior graph with the two updates, but now three nodes are tagged as dirty: &quot;burrito price&quot;, &quot;burrito price w ship&quot;, and &quot;total&quot;. would also like to apologize for the rather confusing image alt text so far; it's really hard to write these for graph diagrams!! if you are a screen reader user and have advice on better ways to do this, would love to hear from you." src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_5.png"></p>
<p>Then, in a loop, we find a dirty cell that has no dirty inputs, and recalculate it. When there are no dirty cells left, we’re done! This solves our ordering problem. There’s one downside though — if a cell is recalculated and we find its new output to be the same as its previous output, we’ll still recalculate downstream cells! A little bit of extra logic can avoid actually running the formula trouble in this case, but we unfortunately still waste time marking and unmarking a lot of cells as dirty.</p>
<p>The second solution is topological sorting. If a cell has no inputs, we mark its height as 0. If a cell has inputs, we mark its height as the maximum of the heights of its inputs, plus one. This guarantees all cells have a greater height than any of their inputs, so we just keep track of all cells with a changed input, always choosing the cell with the lowest height to recalculate first:</p>
<p><img alt="same as prior graph with the two updates, but instead of dirty tags, now every node has a height tag. &quot;burrito price&quot; and &quot;num burritos&quot;, the two cells with no in-nodes, have height 0. &quot;burrito price w ship&quot; has height 1. &quot;total&quot; has height 2." src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_6.png"></p>
<p>In our double-update example, <code>Burrito Price</code> and <code>Total</code> would be initially added to the recalculation heap. <code>Burrito Price</code> has lesser height, and would be recalculated first. Since its output changes, we then would add <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code> to the recalculation heap, and since it too has less height than <code>Total</code>, it would be recalculated before we finally recalculate <code>Total</code>.</p>
<p>This has a big advantage over the first solution: no cell is ever marked dirty unless one of its inputs actually change. However, it requires we keep all cells pending recalculation in sorted order. If we use a heap, this results in an <code>O(n log n)</code> slowdown, so in the worst case, asymptotically slower than Lotus 1-2-3’s strategy of recalculating everything.</p>
<p>Modern-day Excel uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/excel/excel-recalculation">a combination of dirty marking and topological sorting</a>, which you can read more about in their docs.</p>
<h2>demand-driven complications</h2>
<p>We’ve now more or less reached the algorithms used in modern-day spreadsheet recalculation. Unfortunately, I suspect there is basically no business case to be made for ever improving it further. The few people with the problem “my Excel spreadsheet is too slow” have already written enough Excel formulas that migration to any other platform is impossible. Fortunately, I have no understanding of business, and so we’re going to look at further improvements anyway.</p>
<p>Beyond caching, one of the cool aspects of a spreadsheet-style computation graph is we can only calculate the cells that we’re interested in. This is sometimes called lazy computation, or demand-driven computation. As a more concrete example, here’s a slightly expanded burrito spreadsheet graph. This example is the same as before, but we’ve added what is best described as “salsa calculations”. Each burrito contains 40 grams of salsa, and we perform a quick multiplication to know how much salsa is in our entire order. In this case, since our order has three burritos, there’s a total of 120 grams of salsa in our entire order.</p>
<p><img alt="a new graph. similar structure to the old graph, but there are two new nodes: &quot;salsa per burrito&quot;, which is set to the constant &quot;40 grams&quot;, and &quot;salsa in order&quot;, which is &quot;salsa per burrito&quot; times &quot;num burritos&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_7.png"></p>
<p>Of course, astute readers will have spotted the problem here already: knowing the total weight of salsa in an order is a pretty useless measurement. Who cares that it’s 120 grams? What am I supposed to do with this information?? Unfortunately, a regular spreadsheet would waste cycles calculating <code>Salsa In Order</code>, even if we don’t want it recalculated most of the time.</p>
<p>This is where demand-driven recalculation can help. If we could somehow specify that we’re only interested in the output of <code>Total</code>, we could only recompute that cell and its dependencies, and skip touching <code>Salsa In Order</code> and <code>Salsa Per Burrito</code>. Let’s call <code>Total</code> an <em>observed</em> cell, since we’re trying to look at its output. We can also call both <code>Total</code> and its three dependencies <em>necessary</em> cells, since they’re necessary to compute some observed cell. <code>Salsa In Order</code> and <code>Salsa Per Burrito</code> would be aptly described as <em>unnecessary</em>.</p>
<p>Some folks on the Rust team created the <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">Salsa</a> framework to solve this problem, clearly naming it after the unnecessary salsa calculations their computers were wasting cycles on. Salsa is really cool, and I’m sure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_IhACacPRY">they can explain</a> how it works better than I can. Very roughly, they use revision numbers to track whether a cell needs recalculation. Any mutation to a formula or input increments the global revision number, and every cell tracks two revisions: <code>verified_at</code> to track the revision its output was last brought up-to-date, and <code>changed_at</code> to track the revision its output last actually changed.</p>
<p><img alt="our new graph, but now there's a title of &quot;current revision: R6&quot;. each cell is tagged with a change revision and verified at revision. all change revisions are R1, except &quot;salsa per burrito&quot;, which is R6. all verified at revisions are R6, except &quot;salsa in order&quot;, which is R1." src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_8.png"></p>
<p>When the user indicates they’d like a fresh value for <code>Total</code>, we’d first recursively recalculate any cell necessary to <code>Total</code>, skipping cells if their <code>last_updated</code> revision is equal to the global revision. Once the dependencies of <code>Total</code> are up-to-date, we only rerun the actual formula in <code>Total</code> if either <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code> or <code>Num Burrito</code> have a <code>changed_at</code> revision greater than the <code>verified_at</code> revision of <code>Total</code>. This is great for Salsa’s purposes in the rust-analyzer, where simplicity is important and each cell takes a significant amount of time to compute. However, we can see the disadvantages in our burrito graph above — if <code>Salsa Per Burrito</code> constantly changes, our global revision number will frequently tick up. This will make each observation of <code>Total</code> walk the three cells necessary to it, even though none of those cells have actually changed. No formulas will be recalculated, but if the graph is large, repeatedly walking all of a cell’s dependencies could get expensive.</p>
<h2>faster demand-driven solutions</h2>
<p>Instead of inventing new algorithms for demand-driven spreadsheets, what if we instead draw from the two classical spreadsheet algorithms mentioned earlier: dirty marking and topological sorting? As you might imagine, a demand-driven model complicates both of these, but both are still viable.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at dirty marking. As before, when we change a cell’s formula, we mark all downstream cells as …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-1a93d359="" data-v-0291b861=""> <p>A co-worker of mine recently brought up an issue to me where one of our clients were exceeding their monthly ShipperHQ api quota. The wordpress site in question was exceeding their 10k api limit from ShipperHQ for 2 months in a row. The combined traffic and sales from the site did not justify hitting 10k api calls monthly. This is where I came in to see if there was a deeper issue.</p> <p>My first steps were to identify when the api call was sent to ShipperHQ on the site. After some navigating though some pages and keeping an eye on the network tab. I determined the call was being sent out when visiting the checkout.</p> <p>With that known it was time to see where the hits were coming from.</p> <ol><li><p>My first though was to check if the shopping checkout was indexed somewhere on google. A quick google dork later <code>site:site-url inurl:checkout</code> I had found that there were a few entries for the shopping checkout url on google. We removed them and edited the robots.txt</p></li> <li><p>Ensured ShipperHQ was not on the cart page.</p></li> <li><p>lastly, after analyzing the logs I had found a large number of bots that did not respect the robots.txt. Becuase of this they were adding items to carts and navigating to the checkout as they crawled the site. This is where I believed the majortity of the ShipperHQ api hits were coming from. Now its time to block these bots entirly from the site.</p></li></ol> <h4>Nginx Config</h4> <p>To block these malicious bots from crawling the site you can do the following in your nginx conf. While this isnt perfect, as the person with the crawler can change the user_agent. It will atleast get the majortity of them</p> <p>If you need to find the user_agent just go to your nginx access.log and it will show it there. Copy and past it to this list (+restart nginx) and it will start blocking.</p> <p>Specifically for nginx we send back http code 444 for any matching user agents.

## How does consciousness even make sense?

<p>I don’t think the current state of “artificial intelligence” really has proven that it earns the great title of <em>intelligence</em>, as I believe it’s all still just a sophisticated application of statistics on large amounts of data. I prefer the title “machine learning”, as in my opinion that describes the process of adjusting the parameters of statistical methods based on the given data adequately.</p>
<p>I’m not even sure if intelligence and consciousness can be simulated by a computer. Because if they could, then the speed of execution surely wouldn’t matter to that fact, right? And if speed didn’t matter, one could just as well represent the (deterministic!) calculations of a finite computer on a piece of paper or by arranging some stones on a large field. Granted, it’d be somewhat slower than a modern computer and the paper would have to be sufficiently large, but in the end flipping bits, drawing on paper, and moving rocks in a systematic way is just the same when it comes to representing computation. So that’d mean if we arranged a bunch of stones on a large field in a certain pattern and then used some fancy (but deterministic) rules to move them around, we’d create consciousness?! I can’t really believe that’s true.</p>
<p><em>But how is a human brain any different??</em> In the end it’s also just biological wires exchanging electricity (+ some chemistry added to the process)…<br>
I can’t really grasp that. Do my thoughts make sense? Where’s the flaw?</p>

Offset and keyset pagination with PostgreSQL and TypeORM</li></ul><p>As our database grows, so do the results of our queries. Returning a lot of data in our API might not be the best approach performance-wise. Dividing our content into multiple pages and solutions like infinite scrolling have been around for quite some time. In this article, we explore ways of implementing pagination and point out their pros and cons.</p><p>You can find all of the code from this series in <a href="https://github.com/mwanago/nestjs-typescript">this repository</a>.</p><h2>Offset and Limit</h2><p>Let’s start with the following, straightforward query:</p><div id="crayon-5facb8976f1f0168538207" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>SELECT</span><span> </span>*<span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> </span>post</p><p><span>ORDER</span><span> </span><span>BY</span><span> </span>id<span> </span><span>ASC</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>The above returns all of the records from the <span id="crayon-5facb8976f1f9665148220"><span><span>post</span></span></span> table. To be sure about the order of the results, we sort them by id.</p><p>The first step in implementing pagination would be to limit the number of results. We can do that using the <span id="crayon-5facb8976f1fc808623692"><span><span>LIMIT</span></span></span> statement.</p><div id="crayon-5facb8976f1fe496569151" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>SELECT</span><span> </span>*<span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> </span>post</p><p><span>ORDER</span><span> </span><span>BY</span><span> </span>id<span> </span><span>ASC</span></p><p><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span>10</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Now, instead of getting all of the posts, we get just the first ten of them. This results in getting elements with ids from 1 to 10.</p><p>To have fully functional pagination, we need to specify the starting point of our query. To do that, we can use the <span id="crayon-5facb8976f200058233719"><span><span>OFFSET</span></span></span> keyword. With it, we can say how many rows we want to skip.</p><div id="crayon-5facb8976f202464302749" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>SELECT</span><span> </span>*<span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> </span>post</p><p><span>ORDER</span><span> </span><span>BY</span><span> </span>id<span> </span><span>ASC</span></p><p><span>OFFSET</span><span> </span>10</p><p><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span>10</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>We omit the first ten posts with the above while still getting just ten posts as a result. This gives us elements with ids from 11 to 20.</p><p>If we would like to change the way we order elements while paginating, we need to modify our <span id="crayon-5facb8976f204502187195"><span><span>ORDER </span><span>BY</span></span></span> clause.</p><h3>Implementing offset and limit with TypeORM</h3><p>We want the users to provide the offset and the limit through query params. To implement this, let’s use the knowledge we’ve gained in previous parts of this series.

Unfortunately, its performance might fall short of our expectations.</p><p>An essential thing to keep in mind is that the database still needs to compute the rows skipped by the <span id="crayon-5facb8976f21e528034224"><span><span>OFFSET</span></span></span>. First, the database sorts all of the rows according to our <span id="crayon-5facb8976f220337805426"><span><span>ORDER </span><span>BY</span></span></span> clause. Then, Postgres drops the number of rows specified in the <span id="crayon-5facb8976f222164511666"><span><span>OFFSET</span></span></span>. This might require quite a bit of work.</p><p>Aside from the performance, another important thing to consider is consistency. We want an element to appear in the results exactly once. Let’s imagine the following situation:</p><ol><li>one user fetches page number one with posts</li><li>meanwhile, the second user creates a new post – after sorting, it ends up on page number one</li><li>the first user fetches the second page</li></ol><p>The last element of the first page is now again seen on the second page because of the above. What’s even worse, the user missed the element that has been added to the first page.</p><h3>Advantages</h3><p>While the offset approach has its cons, it is still common. Due to its simplicity, it is straightforward to implement. Also, it is easy to change the column that we use for sorting, including the usage of multiple columns. Because of that, it is a viable solution in many cases. Especially if the offset is expected not to be big, and the result inconsistencies are acceptable.</p><h2>Keyset pagination</h2><p>While the offset-based pagination can be useful, its performance might not be the best. Sometimes we might want to avoid it.</p><p>One of the ways to do so is to implement keyset pagination. Instead of using the <span id="crayon-5facb8976f224038289038"><span><span>OFFSET</span></span></span> clause, we use the <span id="crayon-5facb8976f226044396390"><span><span>WHERE</span></span></span> command to select the data we haven’t fetched yet.</p><p>Let’s start with a simple query:</p><div id="crayon-5facb8976f228076254782" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM </span><span>post</span></p><p><span>ORDER </span><span>BY </span><span>id </span><span>ASC</span></p><p><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>The above query gets us the first ten posts. Let’s assume that the id of the last post was&nbsp;<strong>20</strong>. With this assumption, we can run this query:</p><div id="crayon-5facb8976f22a899382803" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM </span><span>post</span></p><p><span>WHERE </span><span>id</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>20</span></p><p><span>ORDER </span><span>BY </span><span>id </span><span>ASC</span></p><p><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>The above query gets us ten posts with id bigger than 20. Now, we can take the last post and rerun the query, changing the id. Doing that creates us simple and efficient pagination mechanism.</p><p>This exposes the biggest drawback of the keyset pagination, though. To get a page, we need to know the last element of the previous set of results. This makes traversing multiple pages at once impossible.</p><p>Fortunately, most of the time, the users got straight to the next page. To cover all of the cases, we can implement both the offset-based approach and the keyset pagination.</p><p>If we would like to change the column that we order our elements by, we need to change both the <span id="crayon-5facb8976f22c661849632"><span><span>ORDER </span><span>BY</span></span></span> and <span id="crayon-5facb8976f22e861091823"><span><span>WHERE</span></span></span> clauses.</p><h3>Implementing keyset pagination with TypeORM</h3><p>Adding keyset pagination is not difficult with TypeORM. First, let’s add another query parameter called <span id="crayon-5facb8976f230403157368"><span><span>startId</span></span></span>&nbsp;to our <span id="crayon-5facb8976f232144179709"><span><span>PaginationParams</span></span></span>.</p><div id="crayon-5facb8976f233880855472" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p><p>7</p><p>8</p><p>9</p><p>10</p><p>11</p><p>12</p><p>13</p><p>14</p><p>15</p><p>16</p><p>17</p><p>18</p><p>19</p><p>20</p><p>21</p><p>22</p></div></td><td><div><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>IsNumber</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Min</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>IsOptional</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'class-validator'</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>Type</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'class-transformer'</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>PaginationParams</span><span> </span><span>{</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>IsOptional</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>Type</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Number</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>IsNumber</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>Min</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>startId</span><span>?</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>IsOptional</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>Type</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Number</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>IsNumber</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>Min</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>offset</span><span>?</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>IsOptional</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>Type</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Number</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>IsNumber</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@</span><span>Min</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>limit</span><span>?</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Along the way, we will face a small issue with the count of our elements.

  <p><em><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/autocorrelation.html">Autocorrelation</a> is used to compare a signal with a time-delayed version of itself. If a signal is periodic, then the signal will be perfectly correlated with a version of itself if the time-delay is an integer number of periods. That fact, along with related experiments, has implicated autocorrelation as a potentially important part of signal processing in human hearing.</em></p>

<p>ACF is a simple method to visualize music that produces surprisingly good results. Perhaps the most unexpected property of ACF is that it accurately transfers the subjective “harmony level” from music to images. It’s almost an unreasonable property, if you think about it. Images below are ACF height maps in polar coordinates.</p>

<table>

      <th>David Parsons</th>

      <th>Bird</th>

<p>More examples: <a href="https://soundshader.github.io/gallery/">soundshader.github.io/gallery</a> (beware of large images).</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might think, our ears don’t seem to rely on an FFT-like process to extract isolated frequencies. Instead, our ears detect periodic parts in the signal, although in most cases those periodic parts closely match the FFT frequencies. There is a simple <a href="https://auditoryneuroscience.com/pitch/missing-fundamental-stimuli">experiment</a> that proves this point:</p>

<p><img src="https://auditoryneuroscience.com/sites/default/files/missingFundamental2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As can be clearly seen on the FFT image, the A signal is a pure sinusoidal tone, while B is a mix of tones. Despite each tone in B is higher than A, our ears perceive B as a lower tone. If we plot both waveforms, we’ll see that A has about 9 peaks in a 20 ms window, while B has only 5. The definition of “peak” is moot, but it doesn’t stop our ears from counting them and using the “number of peaks per second” as a proxy to the tone height.</p>

<p>ACF detects those peaks. ACF sees that there are 5 equally spaced time shifts where <code>B[t] * B[t + shift]</code> reaches the maximum, so on the ACF output we’ll see those 5 peaks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given that I’ve shamelessly stolen the experiment’s illustration above, I feel obligated to recommend the book where the illustration came from: <a href="https://auditoryneuroscience.com/book-preview">Auditory Neuroscience</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One downside of ACF is that it drops the phase component of the input signal, and thus ACF is not reversible. This means that images that only render ACF, lose about 50% of the information from the sound and those 50% are important, e.g. dropping the phase from recorded speech makes that speech indiscernible. Real world sounds, such as voice, heavily use nuanced amplitude and phase modulation. ACF captures the former, but ignores the latter.</p>



<p>ACF of a sound sample <code>X[0..N-1]</code> can be computed with two FFTs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>S = |FFT[X]|^2
ACF[X] = FFT[S]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And thus ACF contains exactly the same information as the spectral density <code>S</code> (the well known spectrogram).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re familiar with the ACF definition, you’ll notice that I should’ve used the inverse FFT in the last step. There is no mistake. The inverse FFT can be computed as <code>FFT[X*]*</code>, where <code>X*</code> is complex conjugate, but since <code>S[i]</code> is real-valued (and positive, in fact), the conjugate has no effect on it, and since ACF is also real valued in this case, the second conjugate has no effect either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ACF is a periodic and even function and so it can be naturally rendered in polar coordinates. In most cases, ACF has a very elaborate structure. Below are some examples, where red = ACF &gt; 0 and blue = ACF &lt; 0.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>conventional music</th>
      <th>a bird song</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="https://soundshader.github.io/pics/acf-c-1.jpg" alt=""></td>
      <td><img src="https://soundshader.github.io/pics/acf-c-3.jpg" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Looking at the first example, we can tell that there are 5 prominent peaks in a 20 ms sound sample, which corresponds to 250 Hz. This means that our ears would necesserarily perceive this sound as a 250 Hz tone, regardless of what its spectrogram says. If it was a pure 250 Hz tone, we’d see perfectly round shapes of the <code>r = cos(250Hz * t)</code> line, but it’s not the case here: we see that the 5 peaks are modulated with small wavelets: there is one big wavelet in the middle (which consists of 3 smaller wavelets) and 4 smaller wavelets. Our ears would hear the big wavelet as the 2nd harmonic of the 250 Hz tone (i.e. it would be a 500 Hz tone with a smaller amplitude) and the 4 small wavelets as the 5th harmonic (1000 Hz) at barely discernible volume. In addition to that, the 500 Hz harmonic is also modulated by the 3 tiny wavelets, which means we’d hear a 1500 Hz tone, almost inaudible. We can say all this without even looking at the spectrogram or hearing the sound.</p>



<p>Music is a temporal ornament. There are many types of ornaments, e.g. the 17 types of wallpaper tesselations, but few of them look like music. However there is one particular type of ornament that resembles music a lot - I mean those “mandala” images. I don’t know how and why those are produced, but I noticed a connection between those images and music:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The 1st obvious observation is that a mandala is drawn in polar coordinates and is <code>2*PI</code> periodic. Sound is periodic too, so I thought the two facts are related.</li>
  <li>The 2nd observation is that patterns on those images evolve over the radial axis. Ans so is music is a sequence of evolving sound patterns.</li>
  <li>The 3rd observation is that a <code>2*PI</code> periodic function trivially corresponds to a set of frequencies. We usually use FFT to extract the frequencies and another FFT to restore the <code>2*PI</code> periodic function. Thus, a single radial slice of a mandala could encode a set of frequencies. If this is correct, a mandala is effectively an old school vinyl disk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Putting these observations together we naturally arrive with the ACF idea.</p>

<strong><em>A Visual Guide…</em></strong> Over the winter, I read <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781441997814"><em>Targeted Learning</em></a> by Mark van der Laan and Sherri Rose. This “visual guide” I made for <em>Chapter 3: Superlearning</em> by Rose, van der Laan, and Eric Polley is a condensed version of the following tutorial. It is available as an <a href="https://github.com/hoffmakl/CI-visual-guides/blob/master/visual-guides/Superlearner.pdf">8.5x11" pdf on Github</a>, should you wish to print it out for reference (or desk decor).

<div id="supercuts-of-superlearning">

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Superlearning</strong> is a technique for prediction that involves <strong>combining many individual statistical algorithms</strong> (commonly called “data-adaptive” or “machine learning” algorithms) to <strong>create a new, single prediction algorithm</strong> that is expected to <strong>perform at least as well as any of the individual algorithms</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The superlearner algorithm “decides” how to combine, or weight, the individual algorithms based upon how well each one <strong>minimizes a specified loss function</strong>, for example, the mean squared error (MSE). This is done using cross-validation to avoid overfitting.</p></li>
<li><p>The motivation for this type of “ensembling” is that <strong>a mix of multiple algorithms may be more optimal for a given data set than any single algorithm</strong>. For example, a tree based model averaged with a linear model (e.g.&nbsp;random forests and LASSO) could smooth some of the model’s edges to improve predictive performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Superlearning is also called stacking, stacked generalizations, and weighted ensembling by different specializations within the realms of statistics and data science.</p></li>

<h2>
<strong>Step 1: Split data into K folds
</strong></h2><p><img src="https://www.khstats.com/img/sl_steps/step1.png">
The superlearner algorithm relies on K-fold cross-validation (CV) to avoid overfitting. We will start this process by splitting the data into 10 folds. The easiest way to do this is by creating indices for each CV fold.</p>
<pre><code>k &lt;- 10 # 10 fold cv
cv_index &lt;- sample(rep(1:k, each = n/k)) # create indices for each CV fold. We need each fold K to contain n (all the rows of our data set) divided by k rows. in our example this is 5000/10 = 500 rows in each fold</code></pre>


<h2>
<strong>Step 2: Fit base learners for first CV-fold
</strong></h2><p><img src="https://www.khstats.com/img/sl_steps/step2.png"></p>
<p>Recall that in K-fold CV, each fold serves as the validation set one time. In this first round of CV, we will train all of our base learners on all the CV folds (k = 1,2,…,9) <em>except</em> for the very last one: <code>cv_index == 10</code>.</p>
<p>The individual algorithms or <strong>base learners</strong> that we’ll use here are three linear regressions with differently specified parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Learner A</strong>: <span>\(Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_2 + \beta_2 X_4 + \epsilon\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learner B</strong>: <span>\(Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_1 X_3 + \beta_4 sin(X_4) + \epsilon\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learner C</strong>: <span>\(Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \beta_4 X_1 X_2 + \beta_5 X_1 X_3 + \beta_6 X_2 X_3 + \beta_7 X_1 X_2 X_3 + \epsilon\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>cv_train_1 &lt;- obs[-which(cv_index == 10),] # make a data set that contains all observations except those in k=1
fit_1a &lt;- glm(y ~ x2 + x4, data=cv_train_1) # fit the first linear regression on that training data
fit_1b &lt;- glm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1*x3 + sin(x4), data=cv_train_1) # second LR fit on the training data
fit_1c &lt;- glm(y ~ x1*x2*x3, data=cv_train_1) # and the third LR</code></pre>
<p>I am <em>only</em> using the linear regressions so that code for running more complicated regressions does not take away from understanding the general superlearning algorithm.</p>
<p>Superlearning actually works best if you use a diverse set, or <strong>superlearner library</strong>, of base learners. For example, instead of three linear regressions, we could use a least absolute shrinkage estimator (LASSO), random forest, and multivariate adaptive splines (MARS). Any parametric or non-parametric supervised machine learning algorithm can be included as a base learner.</p>


<h2>
<strong>Step 3: Obtain predictions for first CV-fold
</strong></h2><p><img src="https://www.khstats.com/img/sl_steps/step3.png"></p>
<p>We can then get use our validation data, <code>cv_index == 10</code>, to obtain our first set of cross-validated predictions.</p>
<pre><code>cv_valid_1 &lt;- obs[which(cv_index == 10),] # make a data set that only contains observations except in k=10
pred_1a &lt;- predict(fit_1a, newdata = cv_valid_1) # use that data set as the validation for all the models in the SL library
pred_1b &lt;- predict(fit_1b, newdata = cv_valid_1) 
pred_1c &lt;- predict(fit_1c, newdata = cv_valid_1)</code></pre>
<p>Since we have 5000 <code>obs</code>ervations, that gives us three vectors of length 500: a set of predictions for each of our Learners A, B, and C.</p>
<pre><code>length(pred_1a) # double check we only have n/k predictions ...we do :-)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 500</code></pre>
<pre><code>knitr::kable(head(cbind(pred_1a, pred_1b, pred_1c)), digits= 2, caption = "First CV round of predictions") </code></pre>

<h2>
<strong>Step 4: Obtain CV predictions for entire data set
</strong></h2><p><img src="https://www.khstats.com/img/sl_steps/step4.png"></p>
<p>We’ll want to get those predictions for <em>every</em> fold. So, using your favorite <code>for</code> loop, <code>apply</code> statement, or <code>map</code>ping function, fit the base learners and obtain predictions for each of them, so that there are 1000 predictions – one for every point in <code>obs</code>ervations.</p>
<p>The way I chose to code this was to make a generic function that combines Step 2 (base learners fit to the training data) and Step 3 (predictions on the validation data), then use <code>map_dfr()</code> from the <code>purrr</code> package to repeat over all 10 CV folds. I saved the results in a new data frame called <code>cv_preds</code>.</p>
<pre><code>cv_folds &lt;- as.list(1:k)
names(cv_folds) &lt;- paste0("fold",1:k)

get_preds &lt;- function(fold){   # function that does the same procedure as step 2 and 3 for any CV fold
  cv_train &lt;- obs[-which(cv_index == fold),]  # make a training data set that contains all data except fold k
  fit_a &lt;- glm(y ~ x2 + x4, data=cv_train)  # fit all the base learners to that data
  fit_b &lt;- glm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1*x3 + sin(x4), data=cv_train)
  fit_c &lt;- glm(y ~ x1*x2*x3, data=cv_train)
  cv_valid &lt;- obs[which(cv_index == fold),]  # make a validation data set that only contains data from fold k
  pred_a &lt;- predict(fit_a, newdata = cv_valid)  # obtain predictions from all the base learners for that validation data
  pred_b &lt;- predict(fit_b, newdata = cv_valid)
  pred_c &lt;- predict(fit_c, newdata = cv_valid)
  return(data.frame("obs_id" = cv_valid$id, "cv_fold" = fold, pred_a, pred_b, pred_c))  # save the predictions and the ids of the observations in a data frame
}

cv_preds &lt;- purrr::map_dfr(cv_folds, ~get_preds(fold = .x)) # map_dfr loops through every fold (1:k) and binds the rows of the listed results together

cv_preds %&gt;% arrange(obs_id) %&gt;% head() %&gt;% kable(digits=2, caption = "All CV predictions for all three base learners") </code></pre>

<h2>
<strong>Step 5: Choose and compute loss function of interest via metalearner
</strong></h2><p><img src="https://www.khstats.com/img/sl_steps/step5.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the key step of the superlearner algorithm: we will use a new learner, a <strong>metalearner</strong>, to take information from all of the base learners and create that new algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we have cross-validated predictions for every observation in the data set, we want to merge those CV predictions back into our main data set…</p>
<pre><code>obs_preds &lt;- 
  full_join(obs, cv_preds, by=c("id" = "obs_id"))</code></pre>
<p>…so that we can minimize a final loss function of interest between the true outcome and each CV prediction. This is how we’re going to optimize our overall prediction algorithm: we want to make sure we’re “losing the least” in the way we combine our base learners’ predictions to ultimately make final predictions. We can do this efficiently by choosing a new learner, a metalearner, which reflects the final loss function of interest.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we’ll use another linear regression as our metalearner. Using a linear regression as a metalearner will minimize the Cross-Validated Mean Squared Error (CV-MSE) when combining the base learner predictions. Note that we could use a variety of parametric or non-parametric regressions to minimize the CV-MSE.</p>
<p>No matter what metalearner we choose, the predictors will always be the cross-validated predictions from each base learner, and the outcome will always be the true outcome, <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>This metalearner provides us with the coefficients, or weights, to apply to each of the base learners. In other words, if we have a set of predictions from Learner A, B, and C, we can obtain our best possible predictions by starting with an intercept of -0.003, then adding -0.017 <span>\(\times\)</span> predictions from Learner A, 0.854 <span>\(\times\)</span> predictions from Learner B, and 0.165 <span>\(\times\)</span> predictions from Learner C.</p>

<p>Maria Ressa has a cheerful way of making apocalyptic pronouncements. “The world as we knew it is rubble,” she says over a Zoom call from Manila. “Facts are debatable, we have alternate realities — the White House will say we have alternate realities.”</p>



<p>Ressa is the CEO of Rappler, a prominent digital news outlet in the Philippines. Over the past few years, she has watched from the front row as the internet helped demolish civil discourse and fracture society’s shared sense of reality. In 2016, Ressa witnessed a flood of digital disinformation help elect Rodrigo Duterte, the firebrand populist who as president launched a “war on drugs” that has killed thousands of Filipinos. That year, the same trends helped put in office U.S. President Donald Trump and push the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.</p>



<p>During Duterte’s 2016 campaign, Rappler analyzed fraudulent social media networks that promoted the president and attacked his opponents, drawing on Ressa’s experience mapping terrorist organizations as an investigative reporter in the 1990s and 2000s.</p>



<p>Over the following four years, Ressa became not only a chronicler of the government’s falsehoods but a target of them. Through intimidation and lawsuits, the Duterte administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/world/asia/philippines-abs-cbn-duterte.html">worked to muzzle</a> a number of independent media organizations in the Philippines. Ressa has been singled out: She and her company were charged with a series of spurious crimes, including tax evasion, all of which she has denied. In June, she and a former colleague <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/business/maria-ressa-verdict-philippines-rappler.html">were convicted</a> of cyberlibel, a charge that stemmed from an article Rappler published in 2012. Ressa is now out on bail pending an appeal but could ultimately face years in prison.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather than silence her, these attacks have only given Ressa a bigger platform. Named a <em>Time </em>magazine <a href="https://time.com/5793800/maria-ressa-the-guardians-100-women-of-the-year/">person of the year</a> in 2019, she has become a global symbol of press freedom and an avatar of courage in the face of rising authoritarianism. As her profile has grown, so, too, has her mission. Today, Ressa’s focus has shifted away from Duterte, whom she sees as only the symptom of a larger problem: Facebook.</p>



<p>Ressa is one of the founding members of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/29/21472092/real-facebook-oversight-board-stunt-activism-limitations">Real Facebook Oversight Board</a>, a group of academics, journalists, and activists formed as a tongue-in-cheek counterpoint to the company’s actual <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcoming-the-oversight-board/">Oversight Board</a>, launched in May. That board was designed to function as a “Supreme Court” of sorts, with the power to decide if the company’s content-moderation decisions “were made in accordance with Facebook’s stated values and policies.” Ressa contends that those values and policies are<em> themselves</em> the problem, and says that Facebook’s persistent failure to effectively combat disinformation and hate speech poses an existential threat to democracy around the world.</p>



<p>“We’re fighting huge powers. Duterte, Zuckerberg,” she says. “Who would have thought you would have put the two of them in the same breath, but that’s what I’ve been living with for the last four years.”</p>



<p>Rappler began as a Facebook page in 2011 and launched as a stand-alone website the following year. Ressa says she was initially enthusiastic about the power of “social media for good.” Rappler even partnered with Facebook’s Internet.org initiative, which gives consumers in developing countries free access to certain websites. The program was instrumental in getting millions of Filipinos online, and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/09/how-facebooks-free-internet-helped-elect-a-dictator.html">also on Facebook</a>: Today, nearly all internet users in the country have a Facebook account. It was the 2016 presidential election in the Philippines that eventually changed Ressa’s mind about the social network. “When the problems began, we were the first to feel it,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rappler identified dozens of Facebook accounts that were creating and spreading disinformation in support of Duterte. Some posted fictionalized accounts of terrorist attacks and murders supposedly committed by drug addicts, which fed into the newly elected president’s law-and-order agenda. Ressa alerted Facebook, but she says it failed to take action. So <a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/propaganda-war-weaponizing-internet">Rappler exposed the accounts</a> in a series of articles, instantly making the site a target of the same troll armies it was reporting on. (Facebook says it removes any content that violates its rules.)</p>

<p>Since 2016, Ressa has become increasingly convinced that Facebook needs to profoundly change how it’s designed and governed. She believes the platform’s algorithms and content-moderation policies are inherently prejudiced against reasoned debate based on settled truths. “The platform itself is biased against facts. It’s really biased against journalism,” she says. “Social media platforms have atomized meaning to meaninglessness. They have completely deconstructed context.”</p>



<p>Her opinions are backed by a growing body of academic research, which shows that social media sites often <a href="https://jonahberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ViralityB.pdf">reward emotional messages over rational analysis</a>, funnel users toward <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biases-make-people-vulnerable-to-misinformation-spread-by-social-media/">content that reinforces their</a> preexisting beliefs, and<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146"> spread lies more rapidly and widely than they do the truth</a>.</p>



<p>Ressa says one of Facebook’s most alarming shortcomings is its reluctance to moderate <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/in-the-philippines-fake-news-can-get-you-killed/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1603977263">disinformation posted by governments and politicians</a>. The company has justified its restraint by arguing that statements from public figures should remain online for public scrutiny. Although Facebook has removed state-backed propaganda in some instances, Ressa, along with other activists, say that these actions frequently amount to too little, too late. They say Facebook’s inaction has allowed propaganda and disinformation to spread unchecked, overwhelming and delegitimizing the news media.</p>



<p>“What we saw [in the Philippines] was that news organizations were being pushed to the periphery, and the center of the conversation was being taken over by the pro-government, state-sponsored disinformation,” Ressa says.</p>



<p>Without checks and balances on social media, Ressa says, authoritarian governments like Duterte’s can impose their own narratives — that drug addicts and communists run the country, and that journalists like Ressa are criminals and conspirators.</p>



<p>Ressa, who speaks in long, rapid-fire monologues, apologizes throughout her interview for her anger. “It’s very emotional for me,” she says. “I have real skin in the game. If they don’t fix this, this is how the government will normalize the possibility of jailing me. I could go to jail because [Facebook] refuses to address these problems that they created.”</p>



<p>The idea for the Real Facebook Oversight Board began taking shape last year, after Ressa met with Carole Cadwalladr, the journalist who, in 2018, first reported that political consulting firm <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files">Cambridge Analytica had harvested Facebook data</a> from millions of users. Since then, a number of high-profile academics and activists have joined the project, including Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff, who wrote the best-selling book <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em>, as well as former Estonian President Thomas Hendrik Ilves and NAACP President Derrick Johnson.</p>



<p>The board was created to force Facebook into taking responsibility for the damage it has caused. The group <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-critics-take-on-its-oversight-board-06c496a2-355f-4a10-a8b4-d8f9b041a611.html">plans</a> to “use stunts, viral video, celebrity endorsement, and skillful media management” to put a spotlight on the threats social media companies pose to democracy. Ressa says she hasn’t fully discounted Facebook’s ability to do the right thing. “They just need to get off their butts and fix it before it is completely broken,” she says.</p>



<p>Ressa is still processing her evolution from journalism to activism, but she says she sees an obvious connection between the two, especially in an environment where facts are under constant attack. “Journalism is activism when it is a battle for truth,” she says. “This is a time when anyone living in a democracy, if you care about democracy, you have to sit there and answer the same question I was forced to answer four years ago, which is: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth?”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the weird things that people don’t tell you about management is the degree to which people will sometimes scrutinize your behavior.</p>

<p>This is completely opposite to how most human interactions work. Generally speaking people overestimate how much attention others are paying to them. It’s easy to be embarrassed if your voice cracks while meeting someone new, if you say something silly in front of your in-laws, or if you have spaghetti sauce on your shirt. In most cases nobody notices because their own life is being pumped into their brain in stereo.</p>

<p>But this isn’t always true. People actually <em>do</em> scrutinize the behavior of people who have some measure of control over their careers (such as the CEO) carefully, and in some cases will even document what they say for a rainy day. This pattern becomes more extreme as titles and organizations grow, to the point where the job of a Fortune 500 CEO almost overlaps with Broadway theater.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are obvious. People aren’t paying attention out of any sort of expectation of wisdom – but when someone has an impact on your job, it’s rational and reasonable to analyze them to help your career. However, I find that few new managers are aware of this phenomenon, which can have far-ranging consequences.</p>

<h2 id="the-awkward-lunch">The Awkward Lunch</h2>

<p>I remember the first time that I learned this lesson. I was eating lunch with my team as we lightly discussed our upcoming customer conference, and made a quick, dismissive offhand comment about how I felt that one of our marketing teams, led by Steve, was going in circles and wasting time on trivial details. This was 100% wrong – you should never “otherize” other teams – but I didn’t say anything particularly incendiary or critical. Nobody made any mention and I certainly forgot what I had said almost immediately.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, a member of my team offered out of the blue to handle an upcoming planning meeting with Steve’s group. I was confused – why was she making this offer? “Well, you mentioned that you thought that Steve had a tendency to waste time, and I know that you’re presenting at that conference in a week so you’re probably busy. I figured I could help cover a meeting with a team you don’t like.”</p>

<p>A team I don’t like? Where did that come from?! I dimly recalled the lunch in which I had made that comment, and realized that the offhand comment which I had immediately deleted from my mind had stuck with my lunchmates. With a growing sense of dread, I also realized that versions of this situation had probably been happening without my realizing it.</p>

<h2 id="managing-under-a-microscope">Managing Under a Microscope</h2>

<p>Advice that I had received earlier in my career, especially after becoming a new manager: assume that someone might remember everything you say or do. For extra fun, also expect that about 10% of the juiciest details that get remembered will be at least somewhat inaccurate.</p>

<p>Since it can be jarring to realize that your team is watching you a little bit more closely than you might like, I try to convey the general advice below to first time managers on my team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Treat everything that you say like an email – assume that it may live on in someone’s memory for a long time after you say it.</li>
  <li>Be intentional in how you operate or communicate, as some people (particularly your team) may emulate some of your patterns. If you are really harsh when you communicate with other teams, they’ll tend to be harsher as well. If you’re extremely accommodating, they’ll also tend to be more accommodating.</li>
  <li>Build the mental muscle of being less reactive to stressful situations. Try not to visibly frown or look skeptical unless you really mean to express that emotion as people will likely pick up on it. This is true even if you’re stressed because you’re thinking about how your corgi Mr. Snuffles is sick, and your bad mood has nothing to do with work.</li>
  <li>Be extra vigilant not to say things that could be misconstrued as disrespectful or offensive.</li>
  <li>Don’t get wasted at your company’s holiday party, or at other types of events. While I find that most people will give you a pass, it’s really easy to start rumors after hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no way to stop people from scrutinizing – it’s human nature mixed with rational behavior. But if you’re intentional in your actions, you should at least be able to avoid putting your foot in your mouth by saying something dumb at lunch.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Every now and then I get questions on how to work with git in a smooth way when developing, bug-fixing or extending curl – or how I do it. After all, I <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/10/26/working-open-source/" data-type="post" data-id="14901">work on open source full time</a> which means I have very frequent interactions with git (and GitHub). Simply put, I work with git all day long. Ordinary days, I issue git commands several hundred times.</p>



<p>I have a very simple approach and way of working with git in curl. This is how it works.</p>



<h2>command line</h2>



<p>I use git almost exclusively from the command line in a terminal. To help me see which branch I’m working in, I have this little bash helper script.</p>



<pre>brname () {
  a=$(<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2&gt;/dev/null</code>)
  if [ -n "$a" ]; then
    echo " [$a]"
  else
    echo ""
  fi
}
PS1="\u@\h:\w\$(brname)$ "</pre>



<p>That gives me a prompt that shows username, host name, the current working directory and the current checked out git branch.</p>



<p>In addition: I use Debian’s <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/debian/bash-completion/-/blob/master/README.md">bash command line completion</a> for git which is also really handy. It allows me to use tab to complete things like git commands and branch names. </p>



<h2>git config</h2>



<p>I of course also have my customized <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file to provide me with some convenient aliases and settings. My most commonly used git aliases are:</p>


<pre title="">st = status --short -uno
ci = commit
ca = commit --amend
caa = commit -a --amend
br = branch
co = checkout
df = diff
lg = log -p --pretty=fuller --abbrev-commit
lgg = log --pretty=fuller --abbrev-commit --stat
up = pull --rebase
latest = log @^{/RELEASE-NOTES:.synced}..
</pre>


<p>The ‘latest’ one is for listing all changes done to curl since the most recent RELEASE-NOTES “sync”. The others should hopefully be rather self-explanatory.</p>



<p>The config also sets <code>gpgsign = true</code>, enables mailmap and a few other things.</p>



<h2>master is clean and working</h2>



<p>The main curl development is done in the single <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">curl/curl</a> git repository (primarily hosted on GitHub). We keep the master branch the bleeding edge development tree and we work hard to always keep that working and functional. We do our releases off the master branch when that day comes (every eight weeks) and we provide “<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/snapshots/">daily snapshots</a>” from that branch, put together – yeah – daily.</p>



<p>When merging fixes and features into master, we avoid merge commits and use rebases and fast-forward as much as possible. This makes the branch very easy to browse, understand and work with – as it is 100% linear.</p>



<h2>Work on a fix or feature</h2>



<p>When I start something new, like work on a bug or trying out someone’s patch or similar, I first create a local branch off master and work in that. That is, I don’t work directly in the master branch. Branches are easy and quick to do and there’s no reason to shy away from having loads of them!</p>



<p>I typically name the branch prefixed with my GitHub user name, so that when I push them to the server it is noticeable who is the creator (and I can use the same branch name locally as I do remotely).</p>



<pre>$ git checkout -b bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</pre>



<p>Once I’ve reached somewhere, I commit to the branch. It can then end up one or more commits before I consider myself “done for now” with what I was set out to do.</p>



<p>I try not to leave the tree with any uncommitted changes – like if I take off for the day or even just leave for food or an extended break. This puts the repository in a state that allows me to easily switch over to another branch  when I get back – should I feel the need to. Plus, it’s better to commit and explain the change <em>before</em> the break rather than having to recall the details again when coming back.</p>



<h2>Never stash</h2>



<p>“git stash” is therefore not a command I ever use. I rather create a new branch and commit the (temporary?) work in there as a potential new line of work.</p>



<h2>Show it off and get reviews</h2>



<p>Yes I am the lead developer of the project but I still maintain the same work flow as everyone else. All changes, except the most minuscule ones, are done as pull requests on GitHub.</p>



<p>When I’m happy with the functionality in my local branch. When the bug seems to be fixed or the feature seems to be doing what it’s supposed to do and the test suite runs fine locally.</p>



<p>I then clean up the commit series with “<code>git rebase -i</code>” (or if it is a single commit I can instead use just “<code>git commit --amend</code>“).</p>



<p>The commit series should be a set of logical changes that are related to this change and not any more than necessary, but kept separate if they are separate. Each commit also gets its own proper commit message. Unrelated changes should be split out into its own separate branch and subsequent separate pull request.</p>



<pre>git push origin bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</pre>



<h2>Make the push a pull request</h2>



<p>On GitHub, I then make the newly pushed branch into a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pulls">pull request</a> (aka “a PR”). It will then become visible in the list of pull requests on the site for the curl source repository, it will be announced in the #curl IRC channel and everyone who follows the repository on GitHub will be notified accordingly.</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, a pull request kicks of a flood of CI jobs that will build and test the code in numerous different combinations and on several platforms, and the results of those tests will trickle in over the coming hours. When I write this, we have around 90 different CI jobs – per pull request – and something like 8 different code analyzers will scrutinize the change to see if there’s any obvious flaws in there.</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_2020-11-05-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png"><img loading="lazy" width="2686" height="1510" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_2020-11-05-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png" alt=""></a><figcaption>CI jobs per platform over time. Graph snapped on November 5, 2020</figcaption></figure>



<h2>A branch in the actual curl/curl repo</h2>



<p>Most contributors who would work on curl would not do like me and make the branch in the curl repository itself, but would rather do them in their own forked version instead. The difference isn’t that big and I <em>could</em> of course also do it that way.</p>



<h2>After push, switch branch</h2>



<p>As it will take some time to get the full CI results from the PR to come in (generally a few hours), I switch over to the next branch with work on my agenda. On a normal work-day I can easily move over ten different branches, polish them and submit updates in their respective pull-requests.</p>



<p>I can go back to the&nbsp;master branch again with ‘<code>git checkout master</code>‘ and there I can “<code>git pull</code>” to get everything from upstream – like when my fellow developers have pushed stuff in the mean time.</p>



<h2>PR comments or CI alerts</h2>



<p>If a reviewer or a CI job find a mistake in one of my PRs, that becomes visible on GitHub and I get to work to handle it. To either fix the bug or discuss with the reviewer what the better approach might be.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, flaky CI jobs is a part of life so very often there ends up one or two red markers in the list of CI jobs that can be ignored as the test failures in them are there due to problems in the setup and not because of actual mistakes in the PR…</p>



<p>To get back to my branch for that PR again, I “<code>git checkout bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</code>“, and fix the issues.</p>



<p>I normally start out by doing follow-up commits that repair the immediate mistake and push them on the branch:</p>



<pre>git push origin <code>bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</code></pre>



<p>If the number of fixup commits gets large, or if the follow-up fixes aren’t small, I usually end up doing a squash to reduce the number of commits into a smaller, simpler set, and then force-push them to the branch.</p>



<p>The reason for that is to make the patch series easy to review, read and understand. When a commit series has too many commits that changes the previous commits, it becomes hard to review.</p>



<h2>Ripe to merge?</h2>



<p>When the pull request is ripe for merging (independently of who authored it), I switch over to the master branch again and I merge the pull request’s commits into it. In special cases I cherry-pick specific commits from the branch instead. When all the stuff has been yanked into master properly that should be there, I push the changes to the remote.</p>



<p>Usually, and especially if the pull request wasn’t done by me, I also go over the commit messages and polish them somewhat before I push everything. Commit messages should follow our style and mention not only which PR that it closes but also which issue it fixes and properly give credit to the bug reporter and all the helpers – using the right syntax so that our automatic tools can pick them up correctly!</p>



<p>As already mentioned above, I merge fast-forward or rebased into master. No merge commits.</p>



<h2>Never merge with GitHub!</h2>



<p>There’s a button GitHub that says “rebase and merge” that could theoretically be used for merging pull requests. I <em>never</em> use that (and if I could, I’d disable/hide it). The reasons are simply:</p>



<ol><li>I don’t feel that I have the proper control of the commit message(s)</li><li>I can’t select to squash a subset of the commits, only all or nothing</li><li>I often want to cleanup the author parts too before push, which the UI doesn’t allow</li></ol>



<p>The downside with not using the merge button is that the message in the  PR says “closed by [hash]” instead of “merged in…” which causes confusion to a fair amount of users who don’t realize it means that it actually means the same thing! I consider this is a (long-standing) GitHub UX flaw.</p>



<h2>Post merge</h2>



<p>If the branch has nothing to be kept around more, I delete the local branch again with “<code>git branch -d [name]</code>” and I remove it remotely too since it was completely merged there’s no reason to keep the work version left.</p>



<p>At any given point in time, I have some 20-30 different local branches alive using this approach so things I work on over time all live in their own branches and also submissions from various people that haven’t been merged into master yet exist in branches of various maturity levels. Out of those local branches, the number of concurrent pull requests I have in progress can be somewhere between just a few up to ten, twelve something.</p>



<h2>RELEASE-NOTES</h2>



<p>Not strictly related, but in order to keep interested people informed about what’s happening in the tree, we sync the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES">RELEASE-NOTES</a> file every once in a while. Maybe every 5-7 days or so. It …</p></div></div>

Exposure and awareness within the game developer community, however, remains limited. In this post, I provide a gentle introduction to Rust and attempt to justify its place on your radar.</em></p>
<h2 id="a-short-history-lesson">A Short History Lesson</h2>
<p>What is Rust, and where did it come from? In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiWkMFE8uRE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this fantastic talk</a>, James Munns gives us a detailed oral history. Way back around 2010, Mozilla was frustrated by the state of development in Firefox, a massive software project  written mostly in C++. Despite best practices and an abundance of engineering talent, writing high-performance, parallelised, and memory-safe code, at that scale of complexity, remained fraught and error-prone.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, this predates the advent of C++11 (aka the 2011 edition) which heralded efforts to somewhat modernise the language. Even so, manual memory manipulation is easy to get wrong, and <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/18/we-need-a-safer-systems-programming-language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">research</a> from <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">multiple vendors</a> describes this category of error as responsible for 70% of security vulnerabilities. </p>
<p>Into this context steps Graydon Hoare, a Mozilla employee, introducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)#History" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a potential solution</a> to the roadblock: Rust, the hobby language he'd been tinkering with since 2006. In 2012, Mozilla would formally announce Servo, an experimental research project to re-imagine a browser engine built with memory safety and concurrency as first principles. And alongside it, Rust, the companion language to make it all possible.</p>
<p>These early days of Rust are described as a Cambrian explosion of ideas and wild experimentation. Concepts were liberally stolen from other languages, from C++ to OCaml, Haskell, Erlang, ML, C#, Ruby and more, reflecting the diverse pool of engineers working on the language at the time. Still, most in the industry, while admiring the optimism in taking such an ambitious moon shot, <a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2018/09/18/falling-in-love-with-rust/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">remained pessimistic</a> about the prospects of success. </p>
<p>2015 saw a major milestone, with the release of Rust v1.0. Perhaps as significant as the feature list, was the number of failed experiments left behind on the cutting room floor, the team unafraid to pare down the language to its quintessential elements. This was also the first time stability guarantees would be offered, a quality notoriously absent before. </p>
<p>Soon after, in 2016, Firefox <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/07/shipping-rust-in-firefox/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shipped its first production Rust code</a>. The industry and community started to take notice, and Rust began its impressive, and as yet unbroken, <del>four</del> <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">five year streak</a> as Stack Overflow's most beloved language. [<em>Thank you James Munns for pointing out it's now actually five years</em>]. </p>
<p>Right from the outset, Rust set out with a clear focus on   building an inclusive community. They, in turn, have contributed to Rust's impressive technical aptitude, but have also fostered a sense of reverence and fondness not often witnessed in other languages. Are they crazy zealots or onto something?</p>
<h2 id="why-rust">Why Rust?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The performance of C++ with the convenience of C#</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the first time Rust hijacked my attention. C++ enjoys a long-standing ubiquity, in part, due to its ability to express zero cost abstractions. As explained by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What you don't use, you don't pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn't hand code any better.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's easy to spot the relevancy to games. Making frame-rate while simulating entire worlds is a daunting performance challenge. Indeed, C++ underpins the bulk of game engines. There simply is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltCgzYcpFUI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">no other industrial language</a> that offers the same speed and low-level control, whilst writing programs in the large. </p>
<p>C++, however, suffers from the weight of its legacy. The accumulation of features over 40 years makes for a complex and intricate language. In the last decade modernisation of the standard has done well to uplift it from its C roots, but the experienced programmer must build up an arcane lore of which features are blessed, and which machinery is dangerous. As Stroustrup again describes:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes the language daunting and difficult to approach for beginners. In <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this blog post</a>, Rust contributor <em>withoutboats</em> defines an import quality about abstraction:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A zero cost abstraction, like all abstractions, must actually offer a better experience than the alternative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, of course, C++ offers a better time than your own hand wrought assembly. However, this is making the subtle point that it's competing against a secondary force: a more expensive abstraction that justifies its cost by being more comfortable and convenient.</p>
<p>We see this writ large in the rise of popular game engines that eschew the complexity of C++, the most notable being Unity. End users write code in C#, a more forgiving and ergonomic language, creating a boon in developer productivity and a reduction in iteration time.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-10-Unity-Interest.png" title="Unity interest over time in search trends"></p>
<p>In large codebases though, near the edge of the performance envelope, this trade-off begins to bite. The garbage collector eliminates an entire category of errors by removing responsibility for memory management from the end-user. However as its workload grows, so do periodic performance spikes antithetical to smooth gameplay.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-11-GC-spikes.png" title="Unity interest over time in search trends"></p>
<p>The experienced developer can still create a performant experience, however, this demands plugging the leaks in the abstraction. They must build a mental model of the machinery behind the curtain, a collection of arcane wisdom that bans many of the original conveniences, lest they disturb the garbage collector. </p>
<p>So development teams face a choice. Better resourced AAA studios generally choose Unreal or in-house engine tech built on C++, able to absorb the overhead for long term gain. Less resourced studios optimise for time to market, choosing Unity, or one of the many other accessible game making tools (Godot, Haxe, Game Maker, etc.). They often postpone performance concerns until after business eligibility is secured.   </p>
<p>Rust, however, for the first time, promises a third way. A world where it's possible to write zero cost abstractions without sacrificing higher-order elegance. </p>
<h3 id="ownership-based-memory">Ownership based memory</h3>
<p>To understand Rust's special sauce, we're going have to talk about ownership and how it handles memory. This is only a simple sketch, but <a href="http://intorust.com/tutorial/ownership/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">in-depth resources</a> exist for the curious. </p>
<p>Writing optimised code is often about taking the way we, as humans, naturally think of an idea or algorithm, and instead expressing it in terms that favour the computer. This act often harms the legibility and understanding of a program, which makes it much harder for us, the humans, to reason about its correctness. </p>
<p>In a manually managed language, like C, the hapless programmer is left responsible for the machinations of the machine. They must take great care to ensure data is appropriately loaded into memory before operation, and then responsibly disposed of afterwards. A difficult dance in which missteps either cause dramatic crashes or else subtle and hard to detect vulnerabilities. But these are the very same tools that allow careful users to tune performance.  </p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, garbage collection promises the programmer it will automatically deal with the problem on their behalf. They are now free to express code naturally, but in doing so, it ties hands behind their back. They no longer have, at least not without indirection, the levers needed to wring out maximal performance.</p>
<p>Rust begins from a different premise. Rather than hiding this complexity, it accepts that computers are hard for humans, and instead tries to save us from the dangerous bits. Users can still tune the machine, but with less rope to wrap around their necks. </p>
<p>In the same way that static typing exists, very clever people have figured out how to make the compiler eliminate a whole category of memory and concurrency errors. To achieve this, Rust makes a bargain with the developer: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm going to keep track of the lifetime of every piece of memory in your program for you. This way, I can detect the moment you're no longer using it and safely free it on your behalf. But in return, I'm going to need you to follow <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">strict rules</a> about the ownership of that memory. If you try to use it outside of the scope that owns it, my humourless friend here, the borrow checker, is going to make sure you don't hurt yourself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, like static typing, this lunch isn't free. Rust is known to have a steep learning curve, "fighting the borrow checker" becomes a right of passage. It takes time to learn this new paradigm. Ownership makes some familiar patterns difficult or impossible and demands new ones be learnt in their place. Perhaps we should revise our earlier statement as: "The performance of C++ with the <del>convenience</del> safety of C#"</p>
<h2 id="unpacking-rusts-popularity">Unpacking Rust's Popularity</h2>
<p>Early adopters have a selfish reason to extol the virtues of their chosen technology, as widespread adoption enhances the return on their risky investment. In this respect, while interest is high but opportunities for real-world exposure are limited, is it possible that Rust is cresting a wave of unearned hype? <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Not every javascript or python developer</a> interested in the language, for example, has a use case that merits the additional complexity.</p>
<p>To a developer standing on the shores of 2010, <code>git</code>, a new version control system with a steep learning curve, may have seemed like a risky investment. But, in the ensuing world of Github, it's hard to argue the effort was wasted, even if some workloads (i.e. large games) still require alternatives.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, how can we qualify Rust's popularity as a meaningful signal? Ultimately, we will only know by the volume of mud we've dug through in the trenches, and admittedly, it is far too early to collect this data for games. </p>

More and more, Artificial Intelligence is coming to our lives, from the image processing after a picture is shot in our phones to the recommendation algorithm in most content places.
And the number of companies that want to introduce some AI process to their workflow increases by the minute.</p><p>Soon, AI systems will be diagnosing illnesses, granting mortgages, etc.
But then doubts arise.
A lot of those AI systems will be black box systems, most likely Neural Networks or Ensembles.
Basically a lot of automatic learned equations and parameters that are going to tell everybody if they are fit to buy a house, or if they have this or that illness.<br>But can we really trust these systems? They have been proven wrong in the past, showing incredible and unexpected
<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/07/13/racist-soap-dispensers-dont-work-for-black-people-6775909/" target="_blank">biases</a>.</p><p>Here is why the trend is moving towards making AI fair and understandable.
There are great initiatives like
<a href="https://www.fast.ai/" target="_blank">fast.ai</a> that focus on unbiased AI, but here we are going to use some of the latest framework to <strong>explain existing models</strong>.<br>Whether you have an AI pipeline in your company or you are learning how to use the latest Neural Network models, this tutorial will explain you a bit more about what is going on inside that process.</p><h2 id="anchor">Anchor <a href="#anchor"><svg height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>There are plenty of papers researching XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), but there are not so many frameworks that can currently take an existing model and explain its internal processes.
This kind of <em>post-hoc explanation</em> is very interesting because it does not have to reimplement and retrain the existing pipelines, but rather can work as a new addition to those pipelines.</p><p>In this article we will explain
<a href="https://github.com/marcotcr/anchor" target="_blank">Anchor</a>, a state-of-the-art library programmed in Python which has proven efficiency and is considered the rival to beat when developing new algorithms.
Anchor is an open-source library that learns a model-agnostic model (this is, it works with any kind of machine learning algorithm).
This model generates a set of rules (or anchors, hence the name) that classify and explain each particular example. Anchor can work with a variety of data, from text to images or tabular.
In this article, we will explain how to use it on a tabular database.</p><h2 id="installing-anchor">Installing Anchor <a href="#installing-anchor"><svg height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>To install Anchor, we will need Python 3.7 or greater. To install the package from
<a href="https://pypi.org/" target="_blank">PyPI</a> just type:</p><p>Or clone their repository and install the package:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Bash">
git clone https://github.com/marcotcr/anchor.git
python setup.py install

</code></pre></div><h2 id="installing-additional-elements">Installing Additional Elements <a href="#installing-additional-elements"><svg height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>First step will be to choose our database and to train our model. In this article we will use the very well known
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris" target="_blank">iris database</a> that we can find packaged inside
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">Scikit Learn</a>.</p><p>This is a flower database with 150 registers of different iris flowers. Each register measures both sepal and petal lengths in centimeters, and the target class is the type of iris (setosa, versicolor or virginica).</p><p>To install Scikit-Learn type in the terminal:</p><p>To train a model, we will use one of the best Python libraries out there:
<a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">XGBoost</a>.</p><p>This will train a tree ensemble that grants a great accuracy.
Again, to install it type:</p><h2 id="training-our-model">Training our model <a href="#training-our-model"><svg height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>Now we are ready to train our model.
The first step will be to import everything we need:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Python">
<span>import</span> xgboost <span>as</span> xgb

<span>from</span> sklearn <span>import</span> datasets
<span>from</span> sklearn.model_selection <span>import</span> train_test_split

<span>from</span> anchor <span>import</span> anchor_tabular

</code></pre></div><p>Here we have imported:</p><ul><li>The library to train our model (xgboost)</li><li>The datasets</li><li>A function to automatically generate the train and the test sets to properly validate the model</li><li>Anchor</li></ul><p>Next step will be to load the database:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Python">
iris <span>=</span> datasets<span>.</span>load_iris()

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test <span>=</span> train_test_split(iris<span>.</span>data, iris<span>.</span>target, test_size<span>=</span><span>0.3</span>, random_state<span>=</span><span>42</span>)

</code></pre></div><p>In this step, we load the iris dataset from the scikit package.<br>In this format, <code>iris.data</code> contains a series of <code>numpy</code> arrays with the features of the 150 registers, and <code>iris.target</code> contains an array of the prediction (as integers).
Then, we split the data in train and test sets.
This way, we have a random 70% of the database that will be used to train the model, and the 30% remaining that we will use to test the score.
We will also use it later to get some registers unknown to the model that we will be able to classify and explain.</p><p>Now it is time to train the model:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Python">
xgb_model <span>=</span> xgb<span>.</span>XGBClassifier(random_state<span>=</span><span>42</span>)
xgb_model<span>.</span>fit(X_train, y_train)

</code></pre></div><p>The library <code>XGBoost</code> implements a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting" target="_blank">Gradient Boosting</a> algorithm.<br>What it does is to generate an ensemble of weak models that combine to generate a strong classifier.</p><p>This is typically done by training very shallow decision trees with random sets of data so that they are different from each other.
When they combine by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_%28machine_learning%29" target="_blank">boosting</a> they generate a very powerful model.</p><p>This is a classification problem, so we use a Classifier (not a Regressor).</p><blockquote><p>For this database we can leave the default parameters as is.<br>For other databases, you might need to fine-tune the model.
You can get all you need from the
<a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html" target="_blank">docs</a>.</p></blockquote><p>The model is trained just with the train data. Let’s see how it performs:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Python">
<span>print</span>(xgb_model<span>.</span>score(X_test, y_test)) <span># 0.98</span>

</code></pre></div><p>If everything is correct, the score should be <code>0.98</code> or higher, given the randomness of some parts of the algorithm.</p><p>Impressive, but this will not tell us <strong>why a particular register is classified in some way</strong>.<br>For this, we will need to apply Anchor.</p><h2 id="applying-anchor-to-our-model">Applying Anchor to our model <a href="#applying-anchor-to-our-model"><svg height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>The first step will be to create the <code>explainer</code>.
This is the element that will take the model and explain the registers:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Python">
explainer <span>=</span> anchor_tabular<span>.</span>AnchorTabularExplainer(class_names<span>=</span>iris<span>.</span>target_names,
                                                    feature_names<span>=</span>iris<span>.</span>feature_names,
                                                    train_data<span>=</span>X_train)

</code></pre></div><p>The <code>explainer</code> takes three parameters:</p><ul><li>The name of each feature</li><li>The name of each class value</li><li>The same data we have used to train the model.</li></ul><p>Note that we are not giving any data from our test set, the explainer does not use that to train.
This way, the explainer doesn’t know the test data, just like the model.</p><p>Let’s take the register with index 30 (at random) from out test data.<br>Pass it through our model:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Python">
idx <span>=</span> <span>30</span>
np<span>.</span>random<span>.</span>seed(<span>1</span>)
<span>print</span>(<span>'Prediction: '</span>, explainer<span>.</span>class_names[xgb_model<span>.</span>predict(X_test[idx]<span>.</span>reshape(<span>1</span>, <span>-</span><span>1</span>))[<span>0</span>]])

</code></pre></div><pre><code>
Prediction:  setosa

</code></pre><p>Our <code>xgb_model</code> predicts that it will be a <code>setosa</code> output, but why?</p><p>Let’s generate the explanation:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Python">
exp <span>=</span> explainer<span>.</span>explain_instance(X_test[idx], xgb_model<span>.</span>predict, threshold<span>=</span><span>0.95</span>)

</code></pre></div><p>Here is where the magic happens.<br>We pass the explainer the register we want to explain and the <code>predict</code> function from our model.
This is the good thing about Anchor: as long as the <code>predict</code> function can take a numpy array and return an integer as a prediction, it will work with absolutely any model out there! Even with custom ones you can program.
Note that there is a <code>threshold</code> parameter.
This means that the predictions for the explanation it has generated will hold at least 95% of the time.
But how to show that explanation?</p><p>With this code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Python">
<span>print</span>(<span>'Anchor: </span><span>%s</span><span>'</span> <span>%</span> (<span>' AND '</span><span>.</span>join(exp<span>.</span>names())))
<span>print</span>(<span>'Precision: </span><span>%.2f</span><span>'</span> <span>%</span> exp<span>.</span>precision())
<span>print</span>(<span>'Coverage: </span><span>%.2f</span><span>'</span> <span>%</span> exp<span>.</span>coverage())

</code></pre></div><pre><code>
Anchor: 1.70 &lt; petal length (cm) &lt;= 5.10 AND petal width (cm) &lt;= 1.30 AND sepal length (cm) &gt; 5.80
Precision: 1.00
Coverage: 0.06

</code></pre><p>Here we are.
Now we know that our register is a <code>setosa</code> because its petal length is smaller than 1.7 and so on.
We also know that 100% of the registers that match this rule are <code>setosa</code> and that 6% of the training registers match this rule.
With this, we have not only explained what is happening in the model, but also how confident we are in these rules.</p><h2 id="what-is-an-anchor">What is an Anchor <a href="#what-is-an-anchor"><svg height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>All right, so now we have a rule or <em>anchor</em> that can explain the registry.<br>But how are they computed? Well, the deep mathematics of the anchor are a bit complicated, but the gist of it is as follows.<br>First, the system determines a probability for a certain <em>anchor</em> to get its precision.<br>Then, using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm" target="_blank">greedy algorithm</a>, it starts adding features, values and splits (such as [<code>petal length (cm)</code>, <code>1.7</code>, <code>&lt;</code>]) and computing the best next addition.<br>The system keeps searching the best <em>anchor</em> according to the precision threshold, so that it returns the <strong>shortest</strong> anchor for the specified threshold.
It is not very explainable if the rule has 70 features, is it?<br>The nitty gritty part of the search is more complex, but if you want to have a look feel free to check the original
<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf" target="_blank">article</a>, where everything is explained.</p><h2 id="closing-words">Closing words <a href="#closing-words"><svg height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>In these days where AI is taking over more and more functions and processes, it is very easy to just let it decide for us without knowing why.
But there are aspects in life too important to just blindly trust a machine.
With Anchor, we have a library that is easy to add to any machine learning pipeline where the trust of each answer is as important as the answer itself.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main id="content" role="main" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Blog"> <article id="post-4678" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><div> <!-- .entry-header --><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Recently, I came across a resource that allowed me to download the entire collection of UTZOO NetNews Archive of the earliest USENET posts. These were essentially the earliest available discussions posted to the Internet by people working at various Universities who were already connected to the Internet. There were approximately 2.1 million posts in these archives created between Feb 1981 and June of 1991. This article describes the journey of converting those tapes into fully searchable PostgreSQL database and later also into the <a href="https://usenetarchives.com/groups.php?c=utzoo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usenetarchives.com</a> website.</p><p>Until 2001, these early Usenet discussions were considered being lost, but miraculously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Spencer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Spencer</a> from the University of Toronto, Department of Zoology was backing it up onto magnetic tapes and kept them stored for all these years (apparently at a great cost).</p><p><a href="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15.png" alt="" width="325" height="259" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15.png 1282w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15-300x239.png 300w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15-768x613.png 768w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15-1024x817.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px"></a>H. Spencer had altogether 141 of these magnetic tapes, but there were of no use, so eventually, him and a couple of motivated people such as David Wiseman (who dragged 141 tapes back and forth in his a pickup truck), Lance Bailey, Bruce Jones, Bob Webber, Brewster Kahle, and Sue Thielen; embarked on a process of converting all of these tapes into the regular format, accessible to everyone.</p><p>And that’s the copy I downloaded. What a treasure, right?</p><p>Well, not so fast, once I unzipped the data, I realized that the TGZ format contains literally millions of small text files (each post in its own file). While it was certainly nice to have, it wasn’t something that I or anyone else could read. Certainly not in a forum like discussion format. It wasn’t obvious which post is the one that starts the discussion or which ones are the replies to the thread. And forget about searching through these files, that was utterly not possible. Just to put things into perspective, it took me over 5 hours to un-tar the archives.</p><p>That said, it didn’t take long for me to decide to develop a Python-based converter that would allow me to convert the entire collection from millions of flat files into a fully searchable PostgreSQL database. The following post talks about the process and also includes the Python code of the solution released as open source.</p><p>The UTZOO Usenet archive can be downloaded here:</p><ul><li>http://www.skrenta.com/rt/utzoo-usenet/</li><li>http://shiftleft.com/mirrors/utzoo-usenet/</li><li>https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTo7fRxpXwxv6Uw4TAAtyLWEmvugKaggrHSKNBTRHzWcA/</li><li>Or using this torrent: <a href="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive_archive.zip">utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive_archive</a></li></ul><p>Once downloaded you’ll see that archive contains 161 x TAR Archive files. It looks like this:</p><p><a href="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c69574363b87.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c69574363b87.png" alt="" width="596" height="531" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c69574363b87.png 832w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c69574363b87-300x268.png 300w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c69574363b87-768x685.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px"></a></p><p>So, I grabbed a copy of the 7-Zip archiver from <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">https://www.7-zip.org</a> and started decompressing the files.</p><p>I ended up with over <strong>2,104,828</strong>&nbsp;flat text files in <strong>56,988</strong> folders, which was the entire copy of Henry Spencer’s Usenet archive.</p><p>For those who like numbers, here is each Utzoo tape along with its size, number of files and folders:</p><p id="MLqhONH"><img loading="lazy" width="602" height="2294" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e6e422f3ee.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e6e422f3ee.png 602w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e6e422f3ee-79x300.png 79w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e6e422f3ee-269x1024.png 269w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e6e422f3ee-403x1536.png 403w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></p><h3>File Issues</h3><p>While examining the extract, I realized that Magnetic Tape 118 is uncompressed in \utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\news118f1 folder, named tape118, so I had rename it to tape118.tar and extracted it manually, only to realize it’s a copy of files which I already have. Someone creating the original archive forgotten to remove that file. There are 3 files in these folders that need to have.tar extension added and decompressed as well:</p><ul><li>\utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\news118f1\tape118</li><li>\utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\news120f1\tape120</li><li>\utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\news121f1\tape121</li></ul><p>If you opened one of the folders and navigated down to one of the many subfolders, you’d find a file that contained the message. For example, going into&nbsp;\utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\news006f1\b15\net\aviation folder, I was now apparently in the <strong>net.aviation</strong> Usenet group. But the only way to find out was to open one of the files and look at the content. Here I highlighted what it looked like.&nbsp;As you can see, each file seems to consist of a header, then a single empty line and the body of the message:</p><p id="RYYsysr"><a href="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c.png" alt="" width="1110" height="759" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c.png 1110w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c-300x205.png 300w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c-768x525.png 768w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c-1024x700.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1110px) 100vw, 1110px"></a></p><p>So, I decided to build a Python parser, that went through all these files reading the header portion of each message and grouping all unique results together, giving me all the possible headers such as (From, Subject, Newsgroup, etc.). I found that there were about 79 x different types of headers. So it appeared that not all messages adhered to the same basic structure. Going through the headers, all had the standard set that was common across all posts.</p><p>Once I had the common field, I’ve created a Postgres database called ‘utzoo’</p><pre>create database utzoo;</pre><p>And a new schema called all_messages</p><pre>create schema all_messages;


</pre><p>The above database and schema were the pre-requisites. Everything else, like table creation, inserting the posts, etc. is part of the Python script and fully automated.</p><p>In terms of table creation, the script automatically creates 5 tables for each detected newsgroup:</p><ul><li>headers – parsed headers</li><li>references – references for each message</li><li>body – text of the message</li><li>from – who posted the message</li><li>subjects – list of unique subject lines</li></ul><p>This is what the script auto-creates for each unique Group name:</p><pre>create table all_messages.<strong>GroupName_headers</strong>
(
    id         bigserial not null
        constraint GroupName_headers_pk primary key,
    dateparsed timestamp,
    subj_id    bigint,
    ref        smallint,
    msg_id     text,
    msg_from   bigint,
    enc        text,
    contype    text,
    processed  timestamp default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
alter table all_messages.GroupName_headers
    owner to postgres;


create table all_messages.<strong>GroupName_refs</strong>
(
    id      bigint,
    ref_msg text default null
);
alter table all_messages.GroupName_refs
    owner to postgres;

create table all_messages.<strong>GroupName_body</strong>
(
    id   bigint primary key,
    data text default null
);
alter table all_messages.GroupName_body
    owner to postgres;

create table all_messages.<strong>GroupName_from</strong>
(
    id   serial not null
        constraint GroupName_from_pk primary key,
    data text
);
alter table all_messages.GroupName_from
    owner to postgres;

create table all_messages.<strong>GroupName_subjects</strong>
(
    id      serial not null
        constraint GroupName_subjects_pk primary key,
    subject text
);
alter table all_messages.GroupName_subjects
    owner to postgres;</pre><p>Those will be the tables where the Python parser will dump all the data and make sure posts are properly lined up between tables.</p><p>The python script also creates indexes to make the inserting and later reading of the posts faster:</p><pre>create unique index GroupName_headers_uiidx on all_messages.GroupName_headers(id);
create unique index GroupName_headers_umidx on all_messages.GroupName_headers(msg_id);
create unique index GroupName_body_idx on all_messages.GroupName_body(id);; 
create unique index GroupName_from_idx on all_messages.GroupName_from(data);
create unique index GroupName_subjects_idx on all_messages.GroupName_subjects(subject);

</pre><p>Once created, the structure per group looks like this:</p><p id="kdsmyQE"><img loading="lazy" width="362" height="703" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e3e7d98df4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e3e7d98df4.png 362w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e3e7d98df4-154x300.png 154w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px"></p><p>The following screenshot explains how it’s all wired up. I didn’t do any hardcoded relationships, but you can change the script if you want that.</p><p id="THgecCD"><img loading="lazy" width="601" height="496" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e40111a6ef.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e40111a6ef.png 601w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e40111a6ef-300x248.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px"></p><p>The date is an integral part of each message and I had to do some data conversion massaging in Python to get the proper date, as dates were coming in a variety of formats. I’ve tried various libraries but dateutil.parser.parse standard date and time library for Python did the best job.</p><p>However, I still needed to account for various labelling of data fields in the headers, so if data wasn’t found in the ‘date’ header, I had to look into other header parts such as ‘NNTP-Posting-Date’, ‘X-Article-Creation-Date’,&nbsp;‘Posted’,&nbsp;or ‘Received’ fields.</p><p>Well and then it was all about creating a Python parser, start the PostgreSQL, point it to an archive directory, and wait :)</p><p>At the bottom of this article is the code of the Python solution. It’s about 1,000 lines, and it took altogether about 1 day to create and test it. The script is smart enough to keep the track of where it started, so if it needs to be interrupted, it’ll know where to continue from to get the job done.</p><p>The source code is available on GitHub as open-source under MIT license:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/JozefJarosciak/python_mbox_parser/blob/master/utzoo2postgres.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/JozefJarosciak/python_mbox_parser/blob/master/utzoo2postgres.py</a></p><p>The final solution artifact is called ‘<strong>utzoo2postgres.py</strong>‘ , and it was tested on Python 3.8.</p><p>Open the script and define the path to un-tared Utzoo archive directories.</p><p>Examples:</p><pre># for Windows

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Note: this article is an edited transcript of my talk of the same name at the Jamstack Berlin meetup. You can watch the video <a href="https://youtu.be/taOyVmLgym4">here</a>.</em><br></p><p>Jamstack is thriving. There is a plethora of languages, frameworks, libraries, and services that allow you to take full advantage of static websites while being able to leverage the JavaScript and Serverless ecosystems to build rich, dynamic, and whimsical experiences.</p><p>This often comes at a cost—as most Jamstack frameworks are based on JavaScript frameworks (NextJS and Gatsby on React, NuxtJS, and Gridsome on Vue), <a href="https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/">the JavaScript tax</a> takes a toll on performance, and, ultimately, on your users.</p><p>This article aims to give directions to curb that JS tax—whether by optimizing your existing JavaScript-framework-based website or by going for an alternative: Eleventy.</p><p>But first, let’s take a trip down memory lane to understand how we got where we are today.</p><h2>From Jekyll to Gatsby</h2><p>The Static/Jamstack ecosystem has evolved <em>a lot</em> over the past decade. This evolution has had a deep impact on the way we conceive websites and on the way our users experience them.</p><p>We’re going to cover three major steps through that journey from the (fictional) point of view of a casual discussion between a server and a user.</p><p>Our user will try and access a website, and our server will give her what she needs to <em>view</em> and <em>interact</em> with it. Those two important steps (the user can see the content, the user can interact with it) will be denoted with associated red badges, highlighting the moment in the conversation when they become possible.</p><p>Buckle up! We’re going all the way back to 2008.</p><h3><br>Pure Static (e.g. Jekyll)</h3><p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, created in 2008, has long been the most popular Static Site Generator. Following the “<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404">bake, don’t fry</a>” adage, it pre-computed all the pages of the website to have them readily available for its visitors.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/4da9af4b2075d28a8d8e43004d0da1dfa53663ad-1876x802.png" alt="A discussion goes like this. User: “hey could you pass me that index.html file you got there?”. Server: “sure thing here you go”. User: “thanks”"></p><p>It’s straightforward. Simple. No shenanigans. The desired page is served immediately to the user, and it is immediately available to view and interact with. Should she navigate to another page, her browser would fetch it in the same way it did the first.</p><p>As years went by, however, the user experience this solution provided somehow lagged behind what users got used to with mobile applications. Transitions, offline-mode, all the bells and whistles of the mobile revolution were nowhere to be found.</p><p>JavaScript frameworks, Angular, React and Vue among them, offered a new proposition that was to bring native-like experiences to the web, bringing us to our next stop: Client-Side Rendered websites.</p><h3><br>Client-Side Rendering (e.g. React, Vue)</h3><p>To make websites feel native-like, the solution offered by new JavaScript frameworks circa 2015 was to embed a JS-based engine that would create and update the HTML markup and associated styles dynamically. The upfront price to download, parse, and execute that engine would supposedly be offset by faster subsequent navigation and a richer user experience.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/b6ac711b81b742038bfa1d6503e6768a046c83dd-1872x1150.png" alt="Discussion goes like this. User: “oooh this new online publication looks cool can i see it?”. Server: “you know what why don’t you take all the raw materials and figure it out yourself”. User: “ wow rude but ok”. User computes the page for a moment. User: “ it works!”"></p><p>The major shift that happened with that evolution is that <strong>the cost of building web pages passed from the server to the user’s browser</strong>. This cost is indicated in the discussion with the gear icon, during which the screen is mostly blank or showing a loading indicator.<br></p><p>As a result, the performance of Client-Side Rendered websites depend widely on the specs of the device of the user, as JavaScript is CPU-intensive. The following video, by <a href="https://joshwcomeau.com/">Josh Comeau</a>, shows a 28 seconds difference (!) in load time for the Washington Post between an iPhone and a $100 Xiaomi Redmi 8.</p><h3>Server-Side Rendering (e.g. Next.js, Nuxt.js)</h3><p>A few years after this paradigm was introduced, these issues lead the pendulum to swing back towards the server, with the introduction of Server-Side Rendering.</p><p>Server-Side Rendering was introduced to fix one of the most annoying aspects of Client-Side Rendering: that the content the user came for would not be visible until after the (usually large) JavaScript code is downloaded, parsed, and executed. Those seconds can be <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/">the difference between the visitor staying or leaving the website</a>.</p><p>Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js appeared to try and bring the server back to its original role: building web pages. The approach would be different from Jekyll’s, though: in the Server-Side Rendering paradigm, the server acts as a web browser and renders the page using JavaScript—not Ruby.<br></p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/515d9fcb7a96cf4f41c6c090977e5fbbb0cec9cc-1716x1364.png" alt="Discussion goes like this. User: “i heard they worked on performance on this publication”. Server: “they did! here it is: i’m building the page very quicky…”. Server computes the page for a moment. Server: “and now send you the raw materials to build it yourself BUT now you have a nice picture of the finished page to look at meanwhile!”. Server: “and now send you the raw materials to build it yourself BUT now you have a nice picture of the finished page to look at meanwhile!”. User: “sweet! i can see the content first…”. User computes the page for a moment. User: “and now click around!”"></p><p><br>This approach leverages the power of the server to show the content to the visitor immediately. However, as interactivity still relies on client-side JavaScript, a delay is being introduced between the <em>availability</em> of the content and its <em>readiness</em>. From the point of view of the visitor, this can induce <em>rage clicks</em>: clicking on a button or a link has no effect for several seconds, as illustrated below.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/46db90282489daeae289e6307f4dab205b1b79d4-800x445.gif" alt="An animated gif showing two pages loading (one resembling AirBnB, the other Amazon). The pages look like they are ready, and a fictional user clicks on them for around 20 seconds until it has an effect. The fictional user gets annoyed, then angry, then despaired at the situation."></p><p><em>Source: Addy Osmany, <a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4">The Cost Of JavaScript in 2018</a></em>​</p><p>There would be much more to say on the topic, as some of the frameworks have additional optimizations (prerendering, link-prefetching…), but we already covered enough ground to know that JavaScript has an impact on the user experience for Jamstack websites. This impact has been dubbed the <em>JavaScript tax</em>.</p><h2>Curbing the JavaScript tax</h2><p>Without entering into more details, we can follow the simple approximation that the less JavaScript is used, the lower the tax will be. Shipping less JavaScript then becomes a powerful approach to enhance the performance of our websites.</p><p>What if we could remove it altogether?</p><h3>Removing the JavaScript of JavaScript frameworks</h3><p><a href="http://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> are two popular Server-Side Rendered JavaScript frameworks used on many Jamstack websites. They both use React as the underlying JS library to manage state and UI.</p><p>For this section, I’ll take <a href="https://phacks.dev/">my personal blog</a> as an example. I chose to build it with Gatsby, as I wanted to learn more about how it worked and could leverage my React experience to ship it quickly.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/1a51c0e83d712f7944362eea3142c9f42e60e64f-2756x1164.png" alt="A screenshot of my personal blog"></p><p>The Developer Experience was a delight and I’m overall pretty happy with it, but something felt <em>off</em>. My blog is pretty basic: an index of all the articles, a page for each, and a few other pages here and there. Yet it was powered by the same technology that powers Facebook, AirBnB and many other extremely complex websites: React. Any overengineering questions put aside, I still required any reader to download, parse, and execute React for <em>no benefits at all</em>. There are no smart widgets or complex UI to justify React. Only text and images.</p><p>My (outstanding) developer experience had an impact on my reader’s user experience. <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1139625725504512003">There is no such thing as trickle-down UX</a>.</p><p>Well, it turns out that there <em>is</em> a way to get the best of both worlds. If, like my blog, your Gatsby website does not require React (or any other JavaScript) to run, you can <em>disable it</em>. The <a href="https://github.com/itmayziii/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript">Gatsby Plugin No Javascript</a> community plugin will let you enjoy the DX of Gatsby without taking a toll on user experience. A <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/11949">similar (experimental) plugin</a> also exists for Next.js.</p><p>Of course, not every website is as simple as my blog—that would be pretty boring. A lot of Gatsby and Next.js websites out there rely on React for their user experience: pretty animations, shopping carts, newsletter sign-ups, and the likes. Is there something we can do on those websites to make them lighter?</p><h3>(P)react</h3><p>When React is required for a website to run properly, we can’t just get rid of JavaScript. What we can do, however, is look for ways to reduce its footprint.</p><p><a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> is an alternative to React that has the same functionality, the same modern API, for a tenth of its size. The Preact team managed to drastically reduce the footprint by dropping support for some old browsers and legacy React APIs.</p><p>Although there are some slight differences (<a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/differences-to-react#main-differences">see the list</a>), Preact can be used instead of React for many websites without any impact on the end-user, and barely any on the developers.</p><p>We switched from React to Preact on the Orbit app without issues and shaved off half of our JavaScript footprint in the process. If you’d like to try, there are plugins for <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact/">Gatsby</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/using-preact">Next.js</a>, and <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/switching-to-preact">a guide for switching manually</a>.</p><p>Now, say you are in a situation where you have to create a brand new website. You want to use the Jamstack because you’re convinced of the benefits. You want to be mindful of the user experience, also because you’re convinced of the benefits. Say the website you want to create is similar to this very one, <a href="https://orbit.love/">orbit.love</a>.</p><p>What would you choose for a Lightweight Jamstack? What <em>did I</em> choose for a Lightweight Jamstack?</p><h3>Building orbit.love with Tailwind, Eleventy, and Alpine.js</h3><p>The Orbit website does not have a complex UI—interactivity is limited to a mobile nav menu, modals, and sign-ups for our newsletter and early access. I knew from the get-go that reaching out to (P)react would be heavy handed, so I looked for lightweight alternatives.</p><p>I went for the following: TailwindCSS, for styling, Eleventy, for the static site generation, and Alpine.js, for interactivity.</p><p><a href="http://11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is a JavaScript-based Static Site Generator that, despite being written in JavaScript, shares a lot more with Jekyll than with Gatsby. Indeed, Eleventy (also known as 11ty) <em>does not ship any JavaScript by default</em>. You are free to add any, of course, but it does not force you to use any library or framework.</p><p>Not having to use a JavaScript framework also meant that HTML, not JSX or Vue components, is now front and center in the code you write. This helped me avoid the usual traps when writing React: the infamous <a href="https://www.chillybin.com.sg/would-you-like-another-bowl-of-div-soup/#:~:text=What%20is%20Soup%3F,to%20make%20your%20eyes%20bleed.">div soup</a>, inaccessible components, or non-semantic tags.</p><p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a> is a utility-first CSS framework, which means that instead of writing CSS for your components (class="navbar__mobile"), you combine utility classes that each do one specific thing (class="flex flex-row justify-center w-full").</p><p>I find this approach incredibly productive once you learn the grammar, and it makes for a resilient CSS architecture at the admitted cost of some duplication in your code. What makes it a great match with Eleventy is that you rarely, if ever, leave your HTML components when writing code. It helps me focus on the task at hand by …</p></div></div></div>

     <p><strong>Im EU-Ministerrat wurde binnen fünf Tagen eine Resolution beschlussfertig gemacht, die Plattformbetreiber wie WhatsApp, Signal und Co. künftig dazu verpflichtet, Generalschlüssel zur Überwachbarkeit von E2E-verschlüsselten Chats und Messages anzulegen.</strong></p>
     



     


     <p>Von <a href="http://fm4.orf.at/tags/erichmoechel">Erich Moechel</a></p><p>Der Terroranschlag in Wien wird im EU-Ministerrat dazu benützt, um ein Verbot sicherer Verschlüsselung für Services wie WhatsApp, Signal und viele andere im Schnellsiedeverfahren durchzusetzen. Das geht aus einem mit 6. November datierten internen Dokument der deutschen Ratspräsidentschaft an die Delegationen der Mitgliedsstaaten im Rat hervor, das ORF.at vorliegt.</p><p>Das sollte nun unter den „weiteren Schritten gegen den Terrorismus“ zu verstehen sein, die Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron mit Bundeskanzler Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) im Rahmen einer Videokonferenz zu Wochenbeginn besprechen will. Der Beschluss ist bereits so weit akkordiert, dass er in der Videotagung der Innen- und Justizminister Anfang Dezember ohne weitere Diskussion verabschiedet werden kann.</p><div><p><img src="https://tubestatic.orf.at/static/images/site/tube/20201145/eu_ministerrat_cover.5944853.jpg" alt="Text" title="© EU Ministerrat" width="800" height="560"></p><p>EU Ministerrat</p><p>Rechts sind die Ratsarbeitsgruppen aufgelistet, an die dieser Text erging, dessen erste revidierte Fassung offenbar am Freitag fertig wurde. Wie im Ministerrat üblich, wurde das Dokument als „limite“ klassifiziert. Da es aus diesem Grund abseits des Rats nirgendwo für die Öffentlichkeit einsehbar ist, wird es hier zur Verfügung gestellt: <a href="https://files.orf.at/vietnam2/files/fm4/202045/783284_fh_st12143-re01en20_783284.pdf">[PDF]</a></p></div><h2>Analogien zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung</h2><p>Aus dem ursprünglich für Anfang kommender Woche geplanten Besuch Macrons wurde pandemiebedingt eine Videokonferenz „zur Bekämpfung des islamistischen Terrorismus“. Weiters steht ein Besuch des EU-Ratspräsidenten Charles Michel in Wien für Montag an, der ebenfalls mit Bundeskanzler Kurz Gespräche führen wird. Zudem empfängt Europaministerin Karoline Edtstadler (ÖVP) den französischen Europastaatssekretär Clement Beaune im Bundeskanzleramt. Alleine um Kondolenzbezeugungen geht es dabei natürlich nicht.</p><p>Mittlerweile wird zwar immer klarer, dass offenbar haarsträubende Ermittlungsfehler im BVT den Anschlag erst ermöglicht hatten und nicht fehlende digitale Überwachungsbefugnisse. Ob irgendein solcher Zusammenhang zur Tat besteht, ist allerdings unerheblich. In Brüssel wird so ein Anlass seit 25 Jahren mit schnöder Regelmäßigkeit dafür missbraucht, längst geplante Überwachungsvorhaben durchzusetzen. Auf diese Weise wurde die fünf Jahre lang in der EU umstrittene Vorratsdatenspeicherung nach den Zugsanschlägen in Madrid (2004) und London durch Islamisten (2005) durch den Ministerrat und das Parlament geschleust.</p><div><p><img src="https://tubestatic.orf.at/static/images/site/tube/20201145/ohne-titel-2.5944858.jpg" alt="Text" title="© EU Ministerrat" width="800" height="360"></p><p>EU Ministerrat</p><p>An den letzten Änderungen (fett und unterstrichen) sieht man, welche Formulierungen von einzelnen Mitgliedsstaaten in den Text reklamiert worden waren. Zuletzt eingefügt wurden „Terrorismus“ und eine unscheinbare Änderung im Wording. Statt der in allen Dokumenten seit 1995 üblichen Strafverfolger („law enforcement“) ist nun konsequent von „competent authorities“ die Rede. Wer damit gemeint ist, steht weiter unten.</p></div><h2>Verabschiedung ohne weitere Diskussionen</h2><p>Diese Resolution des Ministerrats ist laut Dokument - da wird um allfällige letzte Einwände gebeten -  nicht nur fast fertig ausformuliert. Sie ist im Rat offenbar auch bereits fertig abgestimmt. Am 19. November soll sie dann in der Ratsarbeitsgruppe zur Kooperation im nationalen Sicherheitsbereich (COSI) verabschiedet werden, am 25. ist die Vorlage im Rat der ständigen Vertreter der EU-Mitgliedsstaaten (COREPER) geplant. Dort hat der Ratsbeschluss bereits den Status eines I-Items, damit kann er ohne weitere Diskussion passieren.</p><p>In einer für Anfang Dezember geplanten virtuellen Sitzung des Rats der Innen- und Justizminister soll der Beschluss dann abgefeiert werden. Was folgen wird, ist klar, nämlich ein Auftrag des Ministerrats an die EU-Kommission, einen Entwurf für eine Verordnung zu erstellen, die dann das übliche Prozedere durch Parlament und Rat durchlaufen wird. Angesichts der offenbaren Einstimmigkeit wäre es im Ministerrat allerdings möglich, die geplante Regulation in ihrem Kern auch ohne Mitwirkung des Parlaments durchzuziehen. Auch das hat es in Zusammenhang mit Überwachung schon gegeben. So wurde der berühmte Beschluss im Fischereiausschuss des Rats von 1995 zur Überwachbarkeit der damals neuen GSM-Netze als A-Item (beschlossene Sache) durchgezogen, von dem das EU-Parlament erst nach seinem Inkrafttreten 1996 Kenntnis erhielt.</p><div><p><img src="https://tubestatic.orf.at/static/images/site/tube/20201145/ohne-titel-1.5944852.jpg" alt="Text" title="© Public | FiveEyes" width="1280" height="255"></p><p>Public | FiveEyes</p><p>Diese Passage sieht dem EU-Ministerratsbeschluss zwar zum Verwechseln ähnlich, stammt jedoch nicht aus Europa. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety">Sie findet sich vielmehr in einer Resolution der Innen- und Justizminister</a> aus den „Five Eyes“-Staaten, datiert mit 11. Oktober. Die Spionageallianz ist neben Europol und diversen europäischen Diensten eine der treibenden Kräfte, auf die der aktuelle Ministerratsbeschluss zurückzuführen ist.</p></div><h2>Treibende Kräfte im Hintergrund</h2><p>Frankreich treibt das ursprünglich von Großbritannien angestoßene Vorgehen gegen sichere Verschlüsselung auf Plattformen wie WhatsApp bereits das ganze Jahr auf EU-Ebene voran. Der Boden dafür wurde seit 2015 in einer ganze Serie von Kampagnen vorbereitet, die abwechselnd von Europol und FBI bzw. den Diensten der „Five Eyes“-Spionageallianz samt den dafür zuständigen Ministern gefahren wurden. Erst Anfang Oktober hatten die Innenminister dieser fünf Staaten - Großbritannien, USA, Australien, Neuseeland und Kanada - die Internetkonzerne erneut aufgefordert, ihre IT-Netze mit Hintertüren für die Strafverfolger auszustatten.</p><p>Sekundiert wurden sie dabei von ihren Amtskollegen in Japan und in Indien. Warum sich die Geheimdienstallianz so auffällig um die bedauernswerten Strafverfolger jahrelang öffentlich gesorgt hat, ist eigentlich selbsterklärend. Sie sind die übrigen „competent authorities“ die ebenfalls Zugang erhalten werden.</p><h2>„Competent authorities“ lassen grüßen</h2><p>Laut weiteren Informationen, die ORF.at vorliegen, soll die Überwachungsmethode „Exceptional Access“ gewählt werden, das geht indirekt bereits aus diesem  nicht technischen Resolutionstext hervor. Unter acht möglichen Modellvorschlägen, die allesamt aus technischen Szenarien verschiedener Geheimdienste stammen, wurde jener aus dem britischen „National Cyber Security Center“ (NCSC) ausgewählt. Das NCSC ist eine Abteilung des britischen Militärgeheimdienstes GCHQ. Plattformbetreiber wie WhatsApp, Signal und Co, die alle E2E-Verschlüsselung benützen, sollen verpflichtet werden, zusätzlich Generalschlüssel anzulegen und diese zu hinterlegen.</p><div><p><img src="https://tubestatic.orf.at/static/images/site/tube/20200939/eu_ministerrat_diskussionspapier_ea.5941753.jpg" alt="Skizzen aus Dokumenten" title="© EU-Ministerrat" width="800" height="409"></p><p>EU-Ministerrat</p><p>Hier wird ein Nachschlüssel für Dritte in den Verschlüsselungsprozess zweier Chatteilnehmer geschmuggelt, es ist die Methode „Exceptional Access“ des GCHQ. Mit sicherer Verschlüsselung hat diese wie alle anderen in diesem Dokument enthaltenen Varianten nichts zu tun, es sind einfach nur verschiedene Arten von „Man in the middle“ -Angriffen auf sichere Kommunikation. Die Studie wurde im Auftrag der deutschen Ratspräsidentschaft erstellt und im August <a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SKM_C45820090717470-1_new.pdf">vom Fachmagazin Politico</a> veröffentlicht.</p></div><p>Das nämlich sind die „competent authorities“: GCHQ, DGSE, BND usw., deren Staubsaugermethoden an den Glasfasern wegen zunehmender Transportverschlüsselung immer weniger verarbeitbare Daten einbringen. Um diese drohende Datenarmut abzuwenden, wurden jetzt Generalschlüssel verlangt - und wie es aussieht, wird das im Rat auch bewilligt. Dann kann das BVT, das es nicht einmal schafft, einen Terroristen auszuschalten, der von zwei anderen Diensten zweimal auf dem Silbertablett serviert wird, künftig auch in Chatverläufen wochenlang nicht ermitteln.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Kubernetes is a tremendously powerful cluster management system. &nbsp;There are many pluggable technologies to choose from that exhibit the features you desire, which is great because you have options--but also comes with the down-side that the likelihood someone else has done exactly what you are trying to do is slim. &nbsp;Eventually, there will be some consolidation as developers gather around the best solutions, but for the moment, there are lots of interesting projects to choose from (and not a ton of great examples for certain configs). Today, I'm sharing a slightly challenging setup and hoping it helps the community.</p><p>I am using Istio as my L7 ingress and routing controller, which is based on Envoy. &nbsp;It is a highly scalable L7 proxy with excellent performance characteristics and relatively mature feature set. When it came time to implement a basic <code>/admin</code> route on a project, I came up with the list of features that I wanted to achieve. &nbsp;My desired config:</p><ul><li>Applications should not have access to user passwords or necessarily email</li><li>Applications should not re-implement role-based access control (RBAC) security, as every application will need it</li><li>Users should be able to login without creating yet another username/password to remember, but support it if they prefer</li><li>Users should be able to self-register, password reset if necessary, and manage what remote authentications are associated with their account without needing support (Google keyword CIAM)</li><li>Application Admins should be able to edit the role of users, either explicitly or by group permissions, with a visual interface for non-technical people to control access</li><li>K8s Ops should be able to change what RBAC rules protect individual routes to applications without a redeploy</li><li>Fully self-hosted, to limit external dependencies and have auditable security around user data</li></ul><p>The simplest way to get started is to follow the excellent walkthrough on <a href="https://www.blog.jetstack.io/blog/istio-oidc/">Jetstack.io</a> that explains in reasonably good detail how to cover your whole ingress with JWT handling. &nbsp;I won't go over all that detail here. &nbsp;Instead, I will present the exact YAML manifests necessary to directly deploy a working config, as well as show screenshots of relevant bits in FusionAuth of exactly how to configure the application so it communicates properly with these manifests.</p><h3 id="why-fusionauth">Why FusionAuth?</h3><p>I usually try out two or three alternative technologies before settling into one I like. Although I did start with KeyCloak, it felt a little unpolished and left a lot to be desired when it came to explaining how to configure it if the terminology wasn't familiar (eg. people who aren't security professionals). &nbsp;I studied several other options and it came down to Gluu or FusionAuth. &nbsp;The main deciding factor for me in favor of FusionAuth was the amount of documentation and tutorials (with much appreciated touches of humor). &nbsp;There is also a clear effort made by the developers to provide official docker images and Kubernetes examples that show real world use. &nbsp;I have been remarkably satisfied with this decision.</p><h3 id="quick-architecture-overview">Quick Architecture Overview</h3><p>Ok, so let's talk about the architecture of how this works together. &nbsp;Like any other traffic using Istio, a request will come into an application by following the routing rules of a <code>VirtualService</code> to a <code>Service</code>, then to a Deployment's <code>Pod</code>. &nbsp;To use the Istio security features, this pod needs to have the Sidecar Proxy running, otherwise the rules don't do anything. (This is unfortunate, as it has been my experience that the sidecar can cause connectivity issues with certain workloads, so just be aware it can cause side effects and you may need to explicitly create and configure the <code>Sidecar</code> for this namespace). The easiest way to get this working is to enable automatic sidecar proxy injection on a new <code>Namespace</code> and deploy the application there. &nbsp;By declaring a <code>RequestAuthentication</code> rule, we configure Istio to refuse any traffic that doesn't have a validly signed Json Web Token (JWT). &nbsp;And by declaring an <code>AuthorizationPolicy</code> rule, we configure Istio to accept or deny traffic by matching specific HTTP paths or user roles, etc. &nbsp;That's great! &nbsp;Right?</p><p>Well, Istio isn't quite mature enough to speak Open ID Connect. &nbsp;It's only smart enough to expect a validly decoded JWT and do some simple pattern matching against its contents. &nbsp;When those rules fail, you just get <code>RBAC: access denied</code> as a response to your request. &nbsp;There's no redirection logic to send the browser to the auth server login page. &nbsp;So, let's teach it to do that with a simple <code>EnvoyFilter</code> rule that is injected on <code>SIDECAR_INBOUND</code>. This lets us target specific applications to protect only the routes we care about without impacting anything else. </p><p>A few critical details: <code>RequestAuthentication</code> only accepts a &nbsp;JWT that is signed with an RSA key, because HMAC is a symmetrical key and anyone who can decode it can also sign it. &nbsp;This means it needs to know where to get the public RSA key, which is supplied in the <code>issuer</code> field. &nbsp;Assuming this checks out, Istio then looks at any <code>AuthorizationPolicy</code> rules and either <code>ALLOW</code> or <code>DENY</code> traffic based on matching or non-matching details. &nbsp;In this case, I have provided a basic rule that allows anyone who has been verified to have an account with this application, and further restrict the <code>/admin/</code> path to accounts that have the <code>admin</code> role. &nbsp;Should anything go wrong, Istio just says <code>RBAC: access denied</code> . &nbsp;To diagnose, just delete these rules and try hitting the endpoint to see what errors pop up. &nbsp;If these rules are removed and you are still getting Unauthorized messages, it's oauth2-proxy refusing the user--check the config and logging to see why.</p><p>Here's the YAML we've all been waiting for. &nbsp;This fully describes a working config where the <code>VirtualService</code> is in the default namespace but everything else is in <code>auth</code> just to keep it away from everything else. &nbsp;The application is hosted at <code>https://auth-example.reachablegames.com</code>. &nbsp;Certain difficult and undocumented details that cause problems if not configured properly have been commented below--please pay attention before changing or simplifying things.</p><pre><code># create namespace where applications can have sidecar injection

November 9, 2020 | https://juliagpu.org/2020-11-05-oneapi_0.1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://juliagpu.org/2020-11-05-oneapi_0.1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main"><i data-feather="calendar"></i><time datetime="2020-11-05">Nov 5, 2020</time><br><i data-feather="edit-2"></i>Tim Besard<p>We’re proud to announce the first version of oneAPI.jl, a Julia package for programming
accelerators with the <a href="https://www.oneapi.com/">oneAPI programming model</a>. It is currently
available for select Intel GPUs, including common integrated ones, and offers a similar
experience to CUDA.jl.</p><p>The initial version of this package, v0.1, consists of three key components:</p><ul><li>wrappers for the oneAPI Level Zero interfaces;</li><li>a compiler for Julia source code to SPIR-V IR;</li><li>and an array interface for convenient data-parallel programming.</li></ul><p>In this post, I’ll briefly describe each of these. But first, some essentials.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p>oneAPI.jl is currently only supported on 64-bit Linux, using a sufficiently recent kernel,
and requires Julia 1.5. Furthermore, it currently only supports a limited set of Intel GPUs:
Gen9 (Skylake, Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake), Gen11 (Ice Lake), and Gen12 (Tiger Lake).</p><p>If your Intel CPU has an integrated GPU supported by oneAPI, you can just go ahead and
install the oneAPI.jl package:</p><pre><code>pkg&gt; add oneAPI
</code></pre><p>That’s right, no additional drivers required! oneAPI.jl ships its own copy of the <a href="https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime">Intel
Compute Runtime</a>, which works out of the box on
any (sufficiently recent) Linux kernel. The initial download, powered by Julia’s artifact
subsystem, might take a while to complete. After that, you can import the package and start
using its functionality:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; using oneAPI

julia&gt; oneAPI.versioninfo()
Binary dependencies:
- NEO_jll: 20.42.18209+0
- libigc_jll: 1.0.5186+0
- gmmlib_jll: 20.3.2+0
- SPIRV_LLVM_Translator_jll: 9.0.0+1
- SPIRV_Tools_jll: 2020.2.0+1

Toolchain:
- Julia: 1.5.2
- LLVM: 9.0.1

1 driver:
- 00007fee-06cb-0a10-1642-ca9f01000000 (v1.0.0, API v1.0.0)

1 device:
- Intel(R) Graphics Gen9
</code></pre><h2 id="the-onearray-type">The <code>oneArray</code> type</h2><p>Similar to CUDA.jl’s <code>CuArray</code> type, oneAPI.jl provides an array abstraction that you can
use to easily perform data parallel operations on your GPU:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; a = oneArray(zeros(2,3))
2×3 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0

julia&gt; a .+ 1
2×3 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0

julia&gt; sum(ans; dims=2)
2×1 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 3.0
 3.0
</code></pre><p>This functionality builds on the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUArrays.jl/">GPUArrays.jl</a>
package, which means that a lot of operations are supported out of the box. Some are still
missing, of course, and we haven’t carefully optimized for performance either.</p><h2 id="kernel-programming">Kernel programming</h2><p>The above array operations are made possible by a compiler that transforms Julia source code
into SPIR-V IR for use with oneAPI. Most of this work is part of
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUCompiler.jl">GPUCompiler.jl</a>. In oneAPI.jl, we use this
compiler to provide a kernel programming model:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; function vadd(a, b, c)
           i = get_global_id()
           @inbounds c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
           return
       end

julia&gt; a = oneArray(rand(10));

julia&gt; b = oneArray(rand(10));

julia&gt; c = similar(a);

julia&gt; @oneapi items=10 vadd(a, b, c)

julia&gt; @test Array(a) .+ Array(b) == Array(c)
Test Passed
</code></pre><p>Again, the <code>@oneapi</code> macro resembles <code>@cuda</code> from CUDA.jl. One of the differences with the
CUDA stack is that we use OpenCL-style built-ins, like <code>get_global_id</code> instead of
<code>threadIdx</code> and <code>barrier</code> instead of <code>sync_threads</code>. Other familiar functionality, e.g. to
reflect on the compiler, is available as well:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; @device_code_spirv @oneapi vadd(a, b, c)
; CompilerJob of kernel vadd(oneDeviceArray{Float64,1,1},
;                            oneDeviceArray{Float64,1,1},
;                            oneDeviceArray{Float64,1,1})
; for GPUCompiler.SPIRVCompilerTarget

               ...
               OpReturn
               OpFunctionEnd
</code></pre><h2 id="level-zero-wrappers">Level Zero wrappers</h2><p>To interface with the oneAPI driver, we use the <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/level-zero">Level Zero
API</a>. Wrappers for this API is available under the
<code>oneL0</code> submodule of oneAPI.jl:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; using oneAPI.oneL0

julia&gt; drv = first(drivers())
ZeDriver(00000000-0000-0000-1642-ca9f01000000, version 1.0.0)

julia&gt; dev = first(devices(drv))
ZeDevice(GPU, vendor 0x8086, device 0x1912): Intel(R) Graphics Gen9
</code></pre><p>This is a low-level interface, and importing this submodule should not be required for the
vast majority of users. It is only useful when you want to perform very specific operations,
like submitting an certain operations to the command queue, working with events, etc. In
that case, you should refer to the <a href="https://spec.oneapi.com/level-zero/latest/index.html">upstream
specification</a>; The wrappers in the
<code>oneL0</code> module closely mimic the C APIs.</p><h2 id="status">Status</h2><p>Version 0.1 of oneAPI.jl forms a solid base for future oneAPI developments in Julia. Thanks
to the continued effort of generalizing the Julia GPU support in packages like GPUArrays.jl
and GPUCompiler.jl, this initial version is already much more usable than early versions of
CUDA.jl or AMDGPU.jl ever were.</p><p>That said, there are crucial parts missing. For one, oneAPI.jl does not integrate with any
of the vendor libraries like oneMKL or oneDNN. That means several important operations, e.g.
matrix-matrix multiplication, will be slow. Hardware support is also limited, and the
package currently only works on Linux.</p><p>If you want to contribute to oneAPI.jl, or run into problems, check out the GitHub
repository at <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl">JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl</a>. For questions,
please use the <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/gpu">Julia Discourse forum</a> under
the GPU domain and/or in the #gpu channel of the <a href="https://julialang.org/community/">Julia
Slack</a>.</p></main></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f18334b57a4385ee2a76"><div><p><em>This blog originally appeared in my </em><a href="https://avthar.substack.com/"><em>weekly newsletter</em></a><em>, where I share ideas I’m reflecting upon, experiments I’m trying and lessons I’ve learned, all to help you level up your own life. To get posts like this straight to your inbox, </em><a href="https://avthar.substack.com/"><em>subscribe here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>—</p><p>Youtube recommended to me&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVnDE8wSrVo">what Elon Musk would work on if he was 22 years old today</a>. The video has almost 3 million views. In the past, I would’ve immediately watched the whole video, gotten inspired by what Elon thought were industries important to the future of humanity and then spent a ton of time working on that and telling everyone about it. All because Elon Musk thought it was important.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is outsourcing your thinking</strong>. This trick served me well in highschool and throughout college, but it’s not sustainable for long term success and happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two problems with outsourcing your thinking. Continuing with the example of past me, there are things I’m already interested in, have&nbsp;<a href="https://nav.al/specific-knowledge">specific knowledge</a>&nbsp;about or possess a competitive advantage in, that won’t be mentioned on Elon’s list. Consequently, the first problem is that I will look down on those things as less meaningful and important and not pursue them, despite my better suitability and chances of success in those areas.</p><p>The second problem with outsourcing your thinking is that once the novelty of the problem fades away, I’d be faced with navigating difficulty, naysayers and the friction of creating something new, without an internal compass to guide me toward the correct paths to take. Put simply, Elon Musk isn’t there to talk me through what he thinks the path forward to be. This all stems from the issue that I pursued something, not because I had interest in that thing, actually enjoyed it or thought it was important, but because Elon Musk (or whoever else) thought it was important to work on. And I followed his thinking, rather than thinking for myself.</p><p>The reason this is important is because most success in business is having&nbsp;<strong>product-market-founder fit</strong>, not just about working on what’s world changing or hot. It’s about building a product that solves a burning problem for the right market and&nbsp;<strong>being the right person, with the right intuition</strong>&nbsp;to bring that product to market, operate that company and delight those customers. Even if you’re working on an important problem, if you don’t have conviction that comes from your own mental models, you’ll get burned when chaos hits. Just ask all the crypto ‘experts’ of 2016/17.&nbsp;<strong>It’s better to build something that’s an expression of yourself, rather than something others think is smart.</strong></p><p>Outsourcing your thinking is a manifestation of the error of trusting others more than we trust ourselves.&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.com/blog/jw-curation">Josh Waitzkin</a>&nbsp;talks about how this phenomenon of outsourcing your thinking happens all the time in the investing world:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>If you take investors, there might be an investment, which one from the outside we think is objectively good. But it really isn't objectively good. It has to fit into one's portfolio of investments in a way that emerges from one's own mental models. Otherwise, it is not a form of self expression. Then, when you enter volatility, you're not gonna know what to do with it.</em>” -&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.com/blog/jw-curation">Josh Waitzkin</a></p></blockquote><p>Elon Musk is a placeholder for anyone telling you what you should do or think. That could be entrepreneurs or VCs you idolize or maybe your parents (especially true if you’re brown). The reality is that you should not care what Elon Musk or anyone else says is important, you should decide for yourself what you should work on, based on following your own curiosity and interest.&nbsp;<strong>Do the hard work of experimenting, exploring and thinking for yourself. Don’t outsource your thinking.</strong></p><p><a href="https://avthar.substack.com/"><em>Subscribe here</em></a><em> to get posts like this straight to your inbox, </em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>MONTREAL -- 
	Last April, Malcolm Angell, a 46-year-old New Zealander who moved to Montreal to work in the city's famed visual effects industry, was taken to hospital after attempting suicide.</p>
<p>
	He was back at work two days later at Montreal-based visual effects studio Mill Film, according to his brother, Ivan. A month later -- shortly after learning his mother had a brain tumour and didn't have long to live -- Angell tried to kill himself again. This time he died.</p>
<p>
	Angell's former colleagues allege the work environment at Mill Film was toxic. They say 80-hour workweeks were common, and that Angell was regularly humiliated by his bosses. Ivan says he's certain his brother would have quit -- were it not for a clause in Angell's contract requiring he pay a $35,000 penalty.</p>
<p>
	The story told by Angell's colleagues is not uncommon in Canada's visual effects and animation sectors, according to industry insiders. Long overtime hours, often unpaid, are seen as normal, they say. And employees in these industries are vulnerable -- particularly foreign workers -- who toil on short-term contracts and are afraid to speak up out of fear of not getting hired again.</p>
<p>
	For Vanessa Kelly, a former animator and union organizer in Vancouver's animation industry, Angell's suicide is a sign that something is deeply wrong with the visual effects sector. She said similar issues exist in animation and within video game companies across Canada.</p>
<p>
	"These are movies. Why are people dying for movies?" said Kelly, general director of the Art Babbitt Appreciation Society, which is trying to organize animators in Vancouver.</p>
<p>
	Angell had nearly 20 years experience in film, and got his start working on set during the production of The Lord of The Rings. In August 2019, he moved to Montreal to work in the city's visual effects industry -- one of the largest in the world. Colleagues and friends say it was not long before the job started to get to him.</p>
<p>
	The Canadian Press spoke to three of Angell's former colleagues, who painted a picture of a workplace where Angell was under extreme pressure and where bosses yelled at him during meetings. Complaints to human resources and to senior mangers, they said, went nowhere.</p>
<p>
	The Canadian Press has agreed not to identify those workers because they fear repercussions. All three said people in the industry who speak out against work conditions are frequently blacklisted.</p>
<p>
	"Work kinda sucks," Angell wrote in an email to a friend in New York City in early September 2019. By November, in an email to the same friend, he said he was doing the work of two people. A planned trip to New Zealand for a wedding in February, 2020, was cancelled, his brother Ivan said in a recent interview, because Angell couldn't get the time off work.</p>
<p>
	Ivan Angell said friends noticed a change in his brother by December. The man who was described in an obituary as a "superfriend" who was always smiling, had become a "shadow of himself," he said.</p>
<p>
	Julia Neville, with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, said fears of being blacklisted for speaking out in the visual effects industry are legitimate. Visual effects artists are precarious workers, Neville said, because their contracts are typically for one project at a time. "There's always that underlying insecurity," she said. Foreign workers, such as Angell, are "particularly vulnerable."</p>
<p>
	"They can't just cross the street and work for another visual effects house -- their whole ability to work in Canada is tied to a specific employer," Neville said. Much of the film industry is unionized, while the large majority of visual effects artists are not, she explained. Long hours and unpaid overtime "are very common," she said, adding that unfair labour practices are frequent in other entertainment sectors, such as animation, reality television and in commercials.</p>
<p>
	Neville said visual effects companies try to underbid each other for work on projects produced by major movie studios. "That pressure is exerted downward onto the worker," she said. "What ends up happening is there's never enough time allotted to accomplish what you need done."</p>
<p>
	Angell's former colleagues said he was under extreme pressure to complete his part in the movie "Bios," starring Tom Hanks. They said Angell and the team he oversaw had been told by his bosses at Mill Film to finish additional work but hadn't been given more time or money to get it done.</p>
<p>
	Another element that tied Angell to his employer was his contract, a copy of which The Canadian Press viewed. The contract included a clause stating he was liable to pay Mill Film a $35,000 indemnity should he leave in the middle of a project.</p>
<p>
	The indemnity clause identified Angell as a "key member" of the team and indicated that the company would be contractually committing Angell's services to its client. The contract said that for "certain very exceptional and serious" reasons the company could decide to waive the indemnification clause.</p>
<p>
	Adelle Blackett, a law professor at McGill University and labour law expert, said that clause "is deeply disturbing." Quebec's labour standards require employers to provide working conditions that "safeguard employees' dignity, health and well-being," she wrote in an email. "An employee working in conditions of freedom must be able to terminate an employment contract with only minimally necessary restrictions."</p>
<p>
	Technicolor, Mill Film's parent company, did not make anyone available to speak on the record. In an emailed statement, the company said Angell's death was a "traumatic and tragic event for his family, friends and for our team. We mourn his passing and continue to express our deepest condolences to his family."</p>
<p>
	The company said it has introduced a new program aimed at supporting employee mental health since Angell's death -- due to the "severity and isolating nature of the pandemic." Another program has been launched encouraging employees to "call out" inappropriate behaviour, the company said.</p>
<p>
	"Technicolor has had longstanding and robust anti-harassment policies in place in Canada. This specifically includes broad anti-bullying and related anti-retaliation policies, among others," it said. The company said it takes complaints seriously and that it didn't receive any formal complaints about Angell's treatment at Mill Film.</p>
<p>
	Kelly -- who quit animation work in 2017 to pursue a science degree -- said unpaid overtime is common. "In animation and (visual effects) we have major skilled labour shortages," she said, adding that companies often don't have the budget to hire more people. "We have to fill in those gaps with overtime and they don't want to pay us for it."</p>
<p>
	Kelly said she got involved with union organizing after working on a project as a storyboard artist. She said her workload suddenly doubled but her deadline remained the same. The work -- which required hours of unpaid overtime -- damaged her wrist and her eyesight, she said.</p>
<p>
	"My physical body was being harmed, my mental capacity was being harmed and my relationships were being harmed. And I looked around and I said, what is this for? A PBS show for children?"</p>
<p>
	For many workers in animation, the job is a part of their identity, Kelly said. "People don't do this because they just want a job, they do this because they have a skill and a passion.</p>
<p>
	"They eat, live and breathe this." But behind the scenes, she said, "there's blood on the screen."</p>

Ask Patrick any question you have about pricing your product live!</em></p><p>With that out of the way, let’s dive in!</p><p>—</p><p><em>by Patrick Campbell</em></p><p>Pricing is one of those topics that sits at the nexus of uncomfortable and long-term, which means companies often don’t think about it for far too long. Even when they eventually figure it out, they don’t touch it again for years.</p><p><strong>The most successful companies optimize monetization in some manner every quarter</strong>. You may be thinking, “they change their price every 3 months!?” No, and that's the first lesson of monetization: pricing goes so much further than the actual price. Let me explain.</p><p>If we go to a thirty thousand foot view, you have to think about what you're actually doing with pricing. No matter the business you're in — non-profit, retail, SaaS, DTC, B2B, whatever — you've created some sort of value. You attach a unit of measurement to the value you created: your price. Put simply, your price is the exchange rate on the value you're creating in the world.</p><p>But price doesn’t live in a vacuum. Everything in your business — from sales and marketing to product and finance — is used to drive someone to buy the product at the price you're offering. Dozens of aspects of your business influence your price, and how effectively it converts customers:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The segment and vertical you are targeting</strong>: You can go upmarket to customers who have higher willingness to pay, shift to a vertical that sees more value in your offering, or even change the ideal customer profile entirely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Your product, positioning, and packaging</strong>: You can come out with new features, move features to different tiers, pull features out and make them add-ons, change up your value propositions, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Your price</strong>: You can move your price up or down, which will impact conversion obviously, but will also impact the perception of your brand.</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F637dba83-56b6-434f-906e-330f363cbde7_1600x900.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F637dba83-56b6-434f-906e-330f363cbde7_1600x900.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/637dba83-56b6-434f-906e-330f363cbde7_1600x900.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>These are not the only axes when it comes to pricing, but the point is anything that influences the value of your product is involved in pricing and monetization. Cool – I've now given you a college lecture worthy of a tweed blazer, so let's dig into where you should start.</p><p><strong>In the beginning, the actual number you're charging isn't that important. </strong></p><p>There are some exceptions, but for the most part, you should first be figuring out the range you're in: a $10 product, $100 product, $1k product, etc. Don't waste time debating $500 vs. $505, because this doesn't matter as much until you have a stronger foundation beneath you.</p><p>What matters much more is two other questions:</p><ol><li><p>Your <strong>value metric</strong></p></li><li><p>Your ideal <strong>customer profiles and segments</strong></p></li></ol><p>These two elements are the foundation of your monetization and pricing strategy. Let’s explore them individually.</p><h3>Step 1: Determine your Value Metric</h3><p>A “value metric” is essentially what you charge for. For example: per seat, per 1,000 visits, per CPA, per GB used, per transaction, etc. <strong>If you get everything else wrong in pricing, but you get your value metric right, you'll do ok</strong>. It's that important. Partly because it bakes lower churn and higher expansion revenue into your monetization.</p><p>Pricing based on a value metric (vs. a tiered monthly fee) is important because it allows you to make sure you're not charging a large customer the same as you'd charge a small customer.</p><p>If you remember back to your high school or college economics class, the professor put a point on a demand curve for the perfect price and said “the revenue a firm gets is the area under that point.” The problem here is — what about all that other area under the curve? <strong>You’re missing out on that revenue by charging a flat monthly fee.&nbsp;</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F971baee8-62bc-4007-8a62-b2179faef927_1600x900.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F971baee8-62bc-4007-8a62-b2179faef927_1600x900.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/971baee8-62bc-4007-8a62-b2179faef927_1600x900.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>“Good, better, best” pricing is a bit more advantageous, because you end up with three points on our trusty demand curve, and thus more revenue potential. You see this in a lot of retail products who are constrained by being physical goods — the car with the basic package vs. the car with the stereo and sunroof vs. the car with everything. In software, it’s thankfully dying out, but you’ll still see it with mass-market products:&nbsp; Netflix, Adobe Creative Cloud, etc.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24c3c7aa-aab8-40d1-9d5b-147b44cc2669_1600x900.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24c3c7aa-aab8-40d1-9d5b-147b44cc2669_1600x900.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/24c3c7aa-aab8-40d1-9d5b-147b44cc2669_1600x900.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>A value metric however allows you to have essentially infinite price points — maximizing your revenue potential.

If they end up using or consuming less, they pay less (and thus avoid churning). This is why companies using value metrics are typically growing at <a href="https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/outcome-based-value-metrics-for-growth">double the rate with half the churn and 2x the expansion revenue</a> when compared to companies that charge a flat fee or where the only difference between their pricing tiers are features.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>How to determine your value metric</strong></h4><p>To determine your value metric, think about the <em>ideal essence of value</em> for your product&nbsp;— what value are you directly providing your customer? </p><p>In B2B, it's likely going to be money saved, revenue gained, time saved, etc. In DTC, it may be the joy you bring them, fitness achieved, increased efficiency, etc. Obviously, we can't measure all of these, but if you can, <em>and</em> your customer trusts your measurement (meaning you say you saved them $100 and they agree you saved them $100), that’s your value metric.</p><p>As an example, the perfect value metric for ProfitWell Retain (our churn recovery product) is how much churn we recover for you. We can measure this, and our customers agree to the measurement, so we can charge on that axis. Other pure value metric products include <a href="https://mainstreet.us/">MainStreet</a>, which handles government paperwork to automatically get you back tax credits — you pay a percentage of the money saved.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of you won't have a pure value metric, so the next step is to find a proxy for that metric. Take for example <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>’s marketing product. Their pure value metric is the amount of revenue their tool drives for your business. This is hard to measure and hard for the customer to agree to in terms of what percentage of credit HubSpot deserves for revenue from a blog post. Proxies for HubSpot are things like the number of contacts, number of visits, number of users, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>To find the right proxy metric, you want to come up with 5-10 proxies and then talk to your customers and prospects. You’ll typically find 1-2 of these pricing metrics will be most preferred amongst your target customers. You then want to make sure those 1-2 also make sense from a growth perspective. Your larger customers should be using/getting more of the metric, whereas your smaller customers should be using/getting less of the metric. You also want to make sure the metric encourages retention.</p><p>When we look at HubSpot, if they were to primarily price on “number of seats”, folks could share a login and HubSpot wouldn’t make much more money on large customers vs. small. Ironically they wouldn’t get as many people invested into HubSpot, because there’d be friction to adding additional seats. Instead, if they give unlimited seats and price based on “number of contacts” there’s minimal friction to getting as many people into HubSpot as possible to do activities (e.g. blog posts, email campaigns, landing pages, etc.)&nbsp;that then produce contacts.</p><p>The result: HubSpot’s marketing product’s value metric is “contacts”, which ensures growth is baked directly into how they make money. The usage drives the metric, which therein drives revenue. Most importantly customers small, medium, and large are all paying at the point they see value and then can grow.</p><p>Some other examples:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://wistia.com/">Wistia</a> charges by the number of videos or channels you use/have</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> invented the concept of zap (connection of software) and charge based on time to connect</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29551380">Theater in Barcelona charged based on the number of laughs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.husqvarna.com/">Husqvarna</a> charges based on time for lawn care products vs. making you buy them</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/en_US/home.html">Rolls Royce</a> charges per mile for airplane engines. They own the engines on the plane you own and do all the maintenance. Cool model.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.freshpatch.com/">Fresh Patch</a> charges based on the amount of grass you want per month for your dog — yes they deliver grass to you monthly</p></li></ol><p>As a side note, you should stop pricing based on seats for products where each seat doesn’t provide a unique experience. For instance, in a CRM if I log in to the AE sitting next to me’s account, I can’t really do my work because I’m only seeing their leads and accounts. Conversely, if I log in to our marketing manager’s …</p></div></div>

<p>Today would have been Aaron’s 34th birthday, but instead we mourn our friend and wonder what could have been, had he not taken his own life seven years ago after being terrorized by a career-driven prosecutor and U.S. Attorney who decided to just make shit up, make an example out of Aaron, impress their bosses and further their own careers.</p>
<p>As it turns out though, <strong><a href="https://www.aaronswartzday.org/aaron-swartz-was-authorized/">Aaron’s downloading wasn’t even illegal</a></strong>, as he was a Harvard Ethics Fellow at the time and Harvard and MIT had contractual agreements allowing Aaron to access those materials en masse.</p>
<p>But all this didn’t come to light until it was too late.</p>
<p>Aaron was careful not to tell his friends too much about his case for fear he would involve them in the quagmire. In truth, we wouldn’t have minded doing anything we could to help him, but we didn’t realize he needed help, and that his grand jury’s runaway train had gone so far off the rails.</p>
<p>We should have known though, as Grand Juries are <strong><a href="https://www.releasechelsea.com/faq/e/">a dangerous, outdated practice</a></strong> that <strong><a href="https://www.releasechelsea.com/faq/h/">give prosecutors unlimited power</a></strong>, making it easy to manipulate the way that witnesses and evidence are presented to the Grand Jury and convince jurors of almost anything. These kinds of proceedings also often violate <strong><a href="https://www.releasechelsea.com/faq/i/">the subject and witness’ constitutional rights</a></strong> in different ways. For these reasons, most civilized countries have transitioned away from them<strong> <a href="https://www.releasechelsea.com/faq/j/">in favor of preliminary hearings</a></strong>.</p>
<p>We learned many other lessons from his case, after the smoke had cleared. We learned that Aaron’s Grand Jury prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Heymann, and the U.S. Attorney in charge of his case, Carmen Ortiz, were so obsessed with trying to make names for themselves, they were&nbsp; willing to fabricate charges and evidence in order get indictments that would otherwise be unachievable.</p>
<p>As Dan Purcell explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Steve Heymann did what bureaucrats and functionaries often choose to do. He wanted make a big case to justify his existence and justify his budget. The casualties be damned…</p>
<p>Our bottom line was going to be that Aaron had done only what MIT permitted him to do. He hadn’t gained unauthorized access to anything. He had gained access to JSTOR with full authorization from MIT. Just like anyone in the jury pool, anyone reading Boing Boing, or anyone in the country could have done.</p>
<p>We hoped that the jury would understand that and would acquit Aaron, and it quickly became obvious to us that there really wasn’t going to be opportunity to resolve the case short of trial because Steve Heymann was unreasonable.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We also learned that MIT was more concerned with their own reputation than standing up for the truth or protecting Aaron. In fact, we learned that MIT decided to <em>assist the government with its case</em> <em>against Aaron</em>, rather than helping him by pressuring to Feds to drop the case, even after JSTOR had made it clear it did not wish to prosecute.</p>
<p>We know all this because <strong><a href="https://www.aaronswartzday.org/kevin-poulsen-2014/">Kevin Poulsen explained to us how he had to sue the Department of Homeland Security</a></strong> to get access to documents in <strong><a href="http://swartzfiles.com/">Aaron’s FBI file</a></strong>, and that <strong><a href="https://boingboing.net/2013/07/18/mit-blocking-release-of-aaron.html">MIT blocked their release</a></strong> – intervening as a third party – and demanding to get a chance to further redact them before they were released to Kevin – and the Judge granted their request! Only time will tell what MIT was so worried about, but its behavior suggests that there may have been some kind of cover-up&nbsp; regarding its involvement in Aaron’s case.</p>
<p>Most recently, thanks to Property of the People’s Ryan Shapiro, we learned that <strong><a href="https://www.aaronswartzday.org/jan11rawthought/#Aarondocs">Aaron had an erroneous code in his FBI record</a></strong>&nbsp; that meant “International Terrorism involving Al Qaeda” – deriving from his sending a single email to the University of Pittsburg, which might explain why the FBI was so suspicious of him during his case.</p>
<p>There are still many pieces of the puzzle missing, but we won’t stop trying to put it all together. We hope you will join us on November 14th to honor him and learn about his projects and ideas that are still bearing fruit to this day, such as <strong><a href="https://securedrop.org/">SecureDrop</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a></strong>, and the <strong><a href="https://www.aaronswartzday.org/psp/">Aaron Swartz Day Police Surveillance Project</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Until then, we will continue to come together to help each other and share information, knowledge and resources, and to try to make things better in our world.</p>
<p>Please email us at aaronswartzday at gmail.com or <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/aaronswartzday">DM us on Twitter</a></strong> if you would like to contribute a project to the hackathon – or want to be on the hackathon or speaker Jitsi calls<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>We hope to see you on November 14th!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Last year I was invited to <a href="https://en.elixirconf.la/">ElixirConf Latin America in Colombia</a> to give a talk,
I proposed to also give a tutorial about <a href="https://riak-core-lite.github.io/">Riak Core</a>
and they said that it should be in Elixir, so I started looking into Elixir to
translate my Riak Core material to it.</p><p>This year I was invited to give another talk about languages on the Erlang virtual machine at <a href="https://www.codebeambr.com/">Code BEAM Brasil 2020</a> and I thought it would be a good idea
to continue working on it and maybe announce it at the talk.</p><p>To measure progress I built some scripts that would transpile the Erlang
standard library to Elixir and then try compiling the resulting modules with
the Elixir compiler, I would pick one compiler error, fix it and try again.</p><p>With this short feedback loop and a counter that told me how many modules
compiled successful it was just a matter of finding errors and fixing them.
At the beginning each fix would remove lot of compiler errors and some times
surface new ones, after a while each error was a weird corner case and progress
slowed.</p><p>Some days before the talk I managed to transpile all of Erlang/OTP and 91% of
the Elixir translations compiled successfully.</p><p>The result is of course <a href="https://github.com/marianoguerra/efe">Elixir Flavoured Erlang</a>, but
as a side effect I have Erlang/OTP in Elixir, so I decided to publish it too.</p><p>The objective of this repository is to allow Elixir programmers to read Erlang
code for projects they use, most of the code compiles but I can't ensure that
it behaves identically to the original source.</p><p>While writing the readme of efe I needed some example that wasn't OTP so I
decided to also transpile a widely used project on Erlang and Elixir: the <a href="https://github.com/marianoguerra/otp.ex/tree/main/cowboy/src">Cowboy web server</a></p><div id="the-match-operator-in-elixir">
<h2>The ^ match operator in Elixir</h2>
<p>In Elixir variable bindings by default rebind to the new value, if they are
already bound and you want to pattern match on the current value you have to
add the <em>^</em> operator in front:</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_fd61af65dfe74189aeb889ef8462540c-1"></a><span>iex</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<a name="rest_code_fd61af65dfe74189aeb889ef8462540c-2"></a><span>1</span>
<a name="rest_code_fd61af65dfe74189aeb889ef8462540c-3"></a><span>iex</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<a name="rest_code_fd61af65dfe74189aeb889ef8462540c-4"></a><span>2</span>
<a name="rest_code_fd61af65dfe74189aeb889ef8462540c-5"></a><span>iex</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<a name="rest_code_fd61af65dfe74189aeb889ef8462540c-6"></a><span>2</span>
<a name="rest_code_fd61af65dfe74189aeb889ef8462540c-7"></a><span>iex</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>^</span><span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<a name="rest_code_fd61af65dfe74189aeb889ef8462540c-8"></a><span>**</span> <span>(</span><span>MatchError</span><span>)</span> <span>no</span> <span>match</span> <span>of</span> <span>right</span> <span>hand</span> <span>side</span> <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
</pre>
<p>In Erlang variables are bound once and then always pattern match, the easy
part of the translation is that I know that when a variable is bound and in
match position I have to add the <em>^</em>, the thing is that I can't add the <em>^</em>
on the first binding and I have to know where variables are in match position.</p>
<p>For this I do <a href="https://github.com/marianoguerra/efe/blob/main/src/efe_var_ann.erl">a pass on the Erlang Abstract Syntax Tree and I add annotations
on variables</a> to know if it's already bound and if it's in match possition, the
pretty printer in the second pass checks those annotations to know if it has
to add the <em>^</em> or not.</p>
</div><div id="why-some-modules-don-t-compile">
<h2>Why some modules don't compile?</h2>
<p>Here's a list of reasons why the remaining modules don't compile after being
transpiled.</p>
<div id="for-comprehensions-must-start-with-a-generator">
<h3>For comprehensions must start with a generator</h3>
<p>There's a weird trick in Erlang where you can generate an empty list if a
condition is false or a list with one item if a condition is true by having a
list comprehension that has no generator but has a filter.</p>
<p>I've been told that it's an artifact of how list comprehensions used to be
translated to other code in the past.</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_2bdc186984394a22b651c88739f592c2-1"></a><span>1</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>ok</span> <span>||</span> <span>true</span><span>].</span>
<a name="rest_code_2bdc186984394a22b651c88739f592c2-2"></a><span>[</span><span>ok</span><span>]</span>
<a name="rest_code_2bdc186984394a22b651c88739f592c2-3"></a>
<a name="rest_code_2bdc186984394a22b651c88739f592c2-4"></a><span>2</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>ok</span> <span>||</span> <span>false</span><span>].</span>
<a name="rest_code_2bdc186984394a22b651c88739f592c2-5"></a><span>[]</span>
</pre>
<p>The fact is that it's valid Erlang and is used in some places in the standard library.</p>
<p>For simple cases in efe I insert a dummy generator:</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_0369c5665dce49749f10a1cf9ea48854-1"></a><span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>[</span><span>:EFE_DUMMY_GEN</span><span>],</span> <span>true</span> <span>do</span>
<a name="rest_code_0369c5665dce49749f10a1cf9ea48854-2"></a>    <span>:ok</span>
<a name="rest_code_0369c5665dce49749f10a1cf9ea48854-3"></a><span>end</span>
<a name="rest_code_0369c5665dce49749f10a1cf9ea48854-4"></a>
<a name="rest_code_0369c5665dce49749f10a1cf9ea48854-5"></a><span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>[</span><span>:EFE_DUMMY_GEN</span><span>],</span> <span>false</span> <span>do</span>
<a name="rest_code_0369c5665dce49749f10a1cf9ea48854-6"></a>    <span>:ok</span>
<a name="rest_code_0369c5665dce49749f10a1cf9ea48854-7"></a><span>end</span>
</pre>
<p>For more advanced cases with many filters I have to analyze if inserting a
generator at the beginning doesn't change the result, that's why some cases are
left as is.</p>
</div>
<div id="erlang-records-dont-evaluate-default-expressions-elixir-defrecord-do">
<h3>Erlang records don’t evaluate default expressions, Elixir defrecord do</h3>
<p><a href="http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/records.html">Erlang records</a> are not
part of the language, they are expanded by the <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/epp.html">Erlang Preprocessor</a>.</p>
<p>What the preprocessor does is to insert the default values "as is" on the places
where a record is created, this means that if the default is a function call it
won't be evaluated during definition, there will be a function call for each
instantiation of the record.</p>
<p>Elixir has <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/master/Record.html">a module to deal with Erlang Records</a> using macros, the thing is that Elixir will evaluate the defaults when they are defined,
this means that if the call doesn't return a constant the behavior won't be the same.
If the call returns a value that can't be represented as a constant in the code it won't compile either.</p>
<p>Another issue is if the function being called is declared after the record is
defined, it will fail with an error saying that the function doesn't exit.</p>
<p>There could be a solution here by creating another module that tries to emulate
the way default values behave in Erlang (they behave as "quoted" expressions)
but I don't know so much about Elixir macros to know how to do it.</p>
</div>
<div id="named-lambda-functions">
<h3>Named lambda functions</h3>
<p>In Erlang <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/expressions.html#fun-expressions">lambda functions can have names to allow recursion</a>, in Elixir this is not supported, there's
no way to automatically change the code in a local/simple way, it's easy to
change the code by hand so I decided to transpile it as if Elixir supported
named lambda functions and get a compiler error.</p>
</div>
<div id="expressions-in-bitstrings">
<h3>Expressions in bitstrings</h3>
<p>In Elixir <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/binaries-strings-and-char-lists.html#bitstrings">size in bitstring expects an integer or a variable as argument</a>, Erlang allows any expression there, it's easy to fix by hand by extracting the expression into a variable and putting the variable there, it could be doable but for now I just leave the expression in place and get a compiler error.</p>
</div>
<div id="variable-defined-inside-scope-and-used-outside">
<h3>Variable defined inside scope and used outside</h3>
<p>In Erlang variables introduced within the if, case or receive expressions are implicitly exported from the bodies, this means this works:</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_6cfc4681f2944f1785c8eee1cdfb7414-1"></a><span>case</span> <span>1</span> <span>of</span> <span>A</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ok</span> <span>end</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span>
<a name="rest_code_6cfc4681f2944f1785c8eee1cdfb7414-2"></a><span>% or this</span>
<a name="rest_code_6cfc4681f2944f1785c8eee1cdfb7414-3"></a><span>case</span> <span>1</span> <span>of</span> <span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>end</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>.</span>
</pre>
<p>Elixir has more strict scoping rules and that is not allowed, this is highly discouraged in Erlang but used in some places in the standard library.</p>
</div>
</div><div id="corner-cases-all-the-way-down">
<h2>Corner cases all the way down</h2>
<p>Here's a list of small differences that I had to fix.</p>
<div id="erlang-vs-elixir-imports">
<h3>Erlang vs Elixir imports</h3>
<p>In Erlang you can import functions from a module in multiple imports and they "add up".</p>
<p>In Elixir later imports for the same module "shadow" previous ones.</p>
<p>The solution is to group imports for the same module and emit only one import
per module.</p>
<p>In Erlang you can import a function more than once, in Elixir it's a compiler
error, the solution is to deduplicate function imports.</p>
</div>

<div id="lowercase-variables-that-become-keywords">
<h3>Lowercase variables that become keywords</h3>
<p>Erlang variables start with uppercase, Elixir variables with lowercase, this
means in Erlang variable names can't clash with language keywords but the lowercase
versions can, that's why I have to <a href="https://github.com/marianoguerra/efe/blob/main/src/efe_pp.erl#L1738">check if the variable is a keyword</a> and add a suffix to them.</p>
</div>

<h3>Local calls and Kernel autoimports</h3>
<p>Elixir auto import functions from the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html">Kernel</a> module

<div id="binary-operators">
<h3>Binary operators</h3>
<p>In Erlang <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/expressions.html#arithmetic-expressions">binary operators</a> are builtin.</p>
<p>In Elixir they are macros from the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Bitwise.html">Bitwise</a> module.</p>
<p>The fix was easy, just use the module.</p>
</div>
<div id="call-expressions">
<h3>Call Expressions</h3>
<p>In Erlang there's no extra syntax to call a function that is the result of an
expression:</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_6b808e85e84a4da6aa619e274c1eb8ba-1"></a><span>fun</span> <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ok</span> <span>end</span><span>().</span>

<a name="rest_code_6b808e85e84a4da6aa619e274c1eb8ba-3"></a><span>(</span><span>return_fn</span><span>())().</span>
</pre>
<p>In Elixir it has to be wrapped in parenthesis and a dot added before the call:</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_a7611ce6437f4112b8095f769d3914e5-1"></a><span>(</span><span>fn</span> <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>:ok</span> <span>end</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>()</span>
<a name="rest_code_a7611ce6437f4112b8095f769d3914e5-2"></a><span># or</span>

</pre>
</div>
<div id="weird-function-names">
<h3>Weird function names</h3>
<p>In Erlang to declare or call function names whose names are not valid identifiers
the name has to be in single quotes:</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_e525dfbd2faa468dab783017a1e1faf2-1"></a><span>'substring-after'</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
<a name="rest_code_e525dfbd2faa468dab783017a1e1faf2-2"></a>    <span>wxMenu</span><span>:</span><span>'Destroy'</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>).</span>
</pre>
<p>In Elixir the declaration is different from the call.</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_511d8c2441144a3f847e5f7b9b36594f-1"></a><span>def</span> <span>unquote</span><span>(</span><span>:"substring-after"</span><span>)()</span> <span>do</span>

<a name="rest_code_511d8c2441144a3f847e5f7b9b36594f-3"></a><span>end</span>
</pre>
<p>When the function is a keyword in Elixir the declaration is the same but a
local call must be prefixed with the module to be valid syntax:</p>

<div id="erlang-non-short-circuit-boolean-operators">
<h3>Erlang non short circuit boolean operators</h3>
<p>For historical reasons Erlang's boolean operators <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> do not short
circuit, this means they evaluate both sides before evaluating itself, for short
circuit versions the newer and recommended <em>andalso</em> and <em>orelse</em> operators
exist. Still the old versions are used in some places.</p>
<p>Elixir only has short circuit versions, to solve this I replace calls to those
operators to the functions in the Erlang module that do the same, since I need
to force the evaluation of both sides and function calls evaluate the arguments
before calling it does what I need.</p>

<p>The following piece is the culmination of a three-month long investigation into Smart TVs running Android. Having lived through this research experience, I can wholeheartedly say that there were multiple moments that I, and another security researcher that I met along the way, couldn’t believe what was happening. On multiple occasions I found myself feeling as though, “you couldn’t even make this up…”</p>



<p>I’m a security researcher, a freelance developer, and a hacker.</p>



<p>Please follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/sickcodes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@sickcodes</a> here: <a href="https://twitter.com/sickcodes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://twitter.com/sickcodes</a></p>



<p>The second researcher in this story is John Jackson: <a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://twitter.com/johnjhacking</a>, an Application Security Engineer with Shutterstock, and a hacker.</p>



<p>We met about half way through this, and I have included his experience too.</p>



<h2>Initial Research</h2>



<p>Near the end of September, while conducting research into low-end Android boxes, I came across a number of serious flaws in the way in which these devices were being designed.</p>



<p>Without delving into the nuances of each device, all of the Smart TV products are Android based.</p>



<p>There are four types of TV products in the TV market:</p>



<ol><li>TV Sticks</li><li>TV Boxes</li><li>Smart TVs</li><li>Android TVs</li></ol>



<p>All of them are ARM based single board computers (SBCs). Most of the dies are 32bit, some are 64bit, but all of them are like a little Raspberry Pi competitor, focusing on GPU performance through the small, but powerful, Mali GPUs.</p>



<p>Some of the products that I investigated were “factory-flawed” and deliberately insecure.</p>



<h2>First Blood</h2>



<p>On 2020-09-20, I discovered some ridiculous security shortfalls in the TV Sticks.</p>



<p><em>NOTE: TCL does not make TV sticks that are vulnerable. Only TCL Android TVs are affected. The following vulnerabilities refer to other products that I was testing at the time before finding the TCL vulnerability that is discussed in depth after the nmap scaps below.</em></p>



<p>Each stick that I tested had at least one of the following major security flaws.</p>



<ul><li>Port 22 open and allowing SSH access as root:root out of the box</li><li>Port 5555 open and allowing unauthenticated android (adb) as root:root out of the box</li><li>Rooted device, with world-executable su binaries in multiple locations</li><li>Open WiFi network with adb and ssh daemons running</li></ul>



<p>In effect, if you had a thousand of these devices, you could worm through all of them, taking advantage of the dual WiFi, plain-text WAN router credentials, and the ability to then hop from the TV stick, to the router, MITM the router, search for more vulnerable devices from the larger, more powerful router, and truly “surf the internet”.</p>



<p><strong>Proof of Concept</strong></p>



<pre># connect to the device's open WiFi network without any password
adb connect 192.168.1.1
adb shell
su
whoami
# root</pre>



<p>Having witnessed how dismal the security was on these devices, or lack thereof, my plan was to write a really big proof of concept, in the form of an actual shell based worm, that would hop between the 4 or 5 TV sticks that I had.</p>



<p>Speaking to an associate about my idea, we ended up chatting about real Android TVs.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I thought, “If these sticks are the same, just little Rockchip &amp; Amlogic CPUs, then what is so special about Smart TVs?”</p>



<p>Since I don’t actually have an Android Television to test, I asked my friend what type of Smart TV does he have and is it running Android?</p>



<p>His answer was, “TCL and not sure.”</p>



<p>I hadn’t really heard much about TCL, but it turns out TCL is a huge Chinese electronics manufacturing company.</p>



<p>TCL has been growing their global market share, at a remarkable rate.</p>



<p>According to a Forbes article, they only launched in the United States in 2013 and sales began on Amazon: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2016/11/14/how-a-no-name-chinese-tv-brand-came-to-dominate-the-amazon-charts/?sh=15fd0d52f096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2016/11/14/how-a-no-name-chinese-tv-brand-came-to-dominate-the-amazon-charts/?sh=15fd0d52f096</a></p>

<p>With their Amazon success, TCL began targeting other large markets.</p>



<p>The key point here is that they aren’t Samsung or LG, but they ARE selling millions of TV sets…</p>



<p>We did a remote desktop session and I ran a trivial nmap scan on the TV to see what it was running out of the box.</p>



<p>Here is the nmap scan:</p>

<p>If you nmap your Android mobile phone, you will generally find 0 open TCP ports.</p>



<p><strong>Zero.</strong></p>



<p>So why does a TV need so many open ports?</p>



<p>While there are some reasons why TVs should have open ports, some of the above services warranted much deeper investigation.</p>



<p>Since I was in a remote desktop session, I just entered all the URLs manually into his web browser.</p>

<p>Some of the pages were blank white pages. This can indicate an API endpoint.</p>



<p>Some of the pages just hang the browser.</p>



<p>Then the rest of the nmap scan came through…</p>

<p>Port 7989 was showing a 404 error, yet when I visit 10.0.0.117:7989 in the browser, an error is shown.</p>



<p>http://10.0.0.117:7989 did not return a page in the browser.</p>

<p>What kind of special web server doesn’t show an index page, but shows deeper pages?</p>



<p>I had recently done research on an IoT device that was serving CGI scripts from the / directory, so the first page I thought to test was init.rc</p>



<p><em>http://10.0.0.117:7989/init.rc</em></p>



<p>403 Forbidden.</p>



<p>Yikes.</p>



<p>This means that the file is exists but we are not authorized to view it.</p>



<p>Naturally, I tested some other Android directories:</p>



<p><em>http://10.0.0.117:7989/sdcard</em></p>

<p>If you work with computers, no matter whether it be mobile apps, web apps, websites, back-end, front-end, upend…</p>



<p>Ask yourself this question right now:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><em>When in the history of your career…</em><br><em>Have you ever needed to serve the entire filesystem…</em><br><em>over http?</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>This becomes a really import question because this custom vendor firmware is currently installed in millions of TCL Android TVs around the world.</p>



<p>My friend who was actually on the phone to me while we were doing the remote desktop, was fairly surprised.</p>



<p>“Why can we see all the files in the TV?”</p>



<p>Port 7989 is not on the list of standard TCP/UDP ports by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt</p>



<p>This means, without scanning all 65,535 ports, most scanners will skip that port.</p>



<p>Secondly, the actual root page is blank.</p>



<p>So in order to scan more than 1 page per port, port scan times will exponentially increase…</p>



<p>Curiously, I checked the IANA list for other …</p></div></div>

<p>Here’s the complete timeline of events. From my first denial to travel to the US until I eventually received a tourist visa. And then I can’t go anyway.</p>



<h2>December 5-11, 2016</h2>



<p>I spent a week on Hawaii with Mozilla – my employer at the time. This was my 12th visit to the US over a period of 19 years. I went there on ESTA, the visa waiver program Swedish citizens can use. I’ve used it many times, there was nothing special this time. The typical procedure with ESTA is that we apply online: fill in a form, pay a 14 USD fee and get a confirmation within a few days that we’re good to go.</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hawaii-2016.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hawaii-2016.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="414"></a><figcaption>I took this photo at the hotel we stayed at during the Mozilla all-hands on Hawaii 2016.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>June 26, 2017</h2>



<p>In the early morning one day by the check-in counter at Arlanda airport in Sweden, I was refused to board my flight. Completely unexpected and out of the blue! I thought I was going to San Francisco via London with British Airways, but instead I had to turn around and go back home – slightly shocked. According to the lady behind the counter there was “something wrong with my ESTA”. I used the same ESTA and passport as I used just fine back in December 2016. They’re made to last two years and it had not expired.</p>



<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/bagder/status/879198063998513152"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_2020-11-06-Twitter-Publish.png" alt="" width="553" height="199"></a><figcaption>Tweeted by me, minutes after being stopped at Arlanda.</figcaption></figure>



<p>People engaged by Mozilla to help us out could not figure out or get answers about what the problem was (questions and investigations were attempted both in the US and in Sweden), so we put our hopes on that it was a human mistake somewhere and decided to just try again next time.</p>



<h2>April 3, 2018</h2>



<p>I missed the following meeting (in December 2017) for other reasons but in the summer of 2018 another Mozilla all-hands meeting was coming up (in Texas, USA this time) so I went ahead and applied for a new ESTA in good time before the event – as I was a bit afraid there was going to be problems. I was right and I got denied ESTA very quickly. “Travel Not Authorized”.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/ESTA-travel-not-authorized.png" alt="" width="642" height="458"><figcaption>Rejected from the ESTA program.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Day 0 – April 17, 2018</h2>



<p><strong>Gaaah</strong>. It meant it was no mistake last year, they actually mean this. I switched approach and instead applied for a tourist visa. I paid 160 USD, filled in a ridiculous amount of information about me and my past travels over the last 15 years and I visited the US embassy for an in-person interview and fingerprinting.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/Administrative-Processing.png" alt="" width="577" height="289"></figure>



<p>This is day 0 in the <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/07/28/administrative-purgatory/" data-type="post" data-id="11076">visa process</a>, 296 days after I was first stopped at Arlanda.</p>



<h2>Day 90 – July 2018</h2>



<p>I missed the all-hands meeting in San Francisco when I didn’t get the visa in time.</p>



<h2>Day 240 – December 2018</h2>



<p>I <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/18/im-leaving-mozilla/">quit Mozilla</a>, so I then had no more reasons to go to their company all-hands…</p>



<h2>Day 365 – April 2019</h2>



<p><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/04/17/one-year-in-still-no-visa/" data-type="post" data-id="12216">A year passed</a>. “someone is working on it” the embassy email person claimed when I asked about progress.</p>



<h2>Day 651- January 28, 2020</h2>



<p>I emailed the embassy to query about the process</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/651-days-email.png" alt="" width="611" height="166"><figcaption>Screenshotted email</figcaption></figure>



<p>The reply came back quickly:</p>



<blockquote><p>Dear Sir, </p><p>All applications are processed in the most expeditious manner possible. While we understand your frustration, we are required to follow immigration law regarding visa issuances. This process cannot be expedited or circumvented. Rest assured that we will contact you as soon as the administrative processing is concluded.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Day 730 – April 2020</h2>



<p><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/17/two-years-in/" data-type="post" data-id="13456">Another year had passed</a> and I had given up all hope. Now it turned into a betting game and science project. How long can they actually drag out this process without saying either yes or no?</p>



<h2>Day 871 – September 3, 2020</h2>



<p>A friend of mine, a US citizen, contacted his Congressman – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Connolly">Gerry Connolly</a> – about my situation and asked for help. His office then subsequently sent a question to the US embassy in Stockholm asking about my case. While the response that arrived on September 17 was rather negative…</p>



<pre>your case is currently undergoing necessary administrative processing and regrettably it is not possible to predict when this processing will be completed.</pre>



<p>… I think the following turn of events indicates it had an effect. It unclogged something.</p>



<h2>Day 889 – September 22, 2020</h2>



<p>After 889 days since my interview on the embassy (only five days after the answer to the congressman), the embassy contacted me over email. <em> For the first time since that April day in 2018.</em></p>



<pre>Your visa application is still in administrative processing. However, we regret to inform you that because you have missed your travel plans, we will require updated travel plans from you.</pre>



<p>My travel plans – that had been out of date for the last 800 days or so – suddenly needed to be updated! As I was already so long into this process and since I feared that giving up now would force me back to square one if I would stop now and re-attempt this again at a later time, I decided to arrange myself some updated travel plans. After all, I work for an American company and I have a friend or two there.</p>



<h2>Day 900 – October 2, 2020</h2>



<p>I replied to the call for travel plan details with an official invitation letter attached, inviting me to go visit my colleagues at <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a> signed by our CEO, Larry. I really want to do this at some point, as I’ve never met most of them so it wasn’t a made up reason. I could possibly even get some other friends to invite me to get the process going but I figured this invite should be enough to keep the ball rolling.</p>



<h2>Day 910 – October 13, 2020</h2>



<p>I got another email. Now at 910 days since the interview. The embassy asked for my passport “for further processing”.</p>



<h2>Day 913 – October 16, 2020</h2>



<p>I posted my passport to the US embassy in Stockholm. I also ordered and paid for “return postage” as instructed so that they would ship it back to me in a safe way.</p>



<h2>Day 934 – November 6, 2020</h2>



<p>At 10:30 in the morning my phone lit up and showed me a text telling me that there’s an incoming parcel being delivered to me, shipped from “the Embassy of the United State” (bonus points for the typo).</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/embassy-text.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/embassy-text.png" alt="" width="496" height="211"></a></figure>



<h2>Day 937 – November 9, 2020</h2>



<p>I received my passport. Inside, there’s a US visa that is valid for ten years, until November 2030.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/VISA.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/VISA.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="221"></a><figcaption>The upper left corner of the visa page in my passport…</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As a bonus, the visa also comes with a NIE (National Interest<br>Exception) that allows me a single entry to the US during the PP (Presidential Proclamations) – which is restricting travels to the US from the European Schengen zone. In other words: I am actually allowed to travel right away!</p>



<p>The timing is fascinating. The last time I was in the US, Trump hadn’t taken office yet and I get the approved visa in my hands just days after Biden has been announced as the next president of the US.</p>



<h2>Will I travel?</h2>



<p>Covid-19 is still over us and there’s no end in sight of the pandemic. I will of course not travel to the US or any other country until it can be deemed safe and sensible.</p>



<p>When the pandemic is under control and traveling becomes viable, I am sure there will be opportunities. Hopefully the situation will improve before the visa expires.</p>



<h2>Thanks to</h2>



<p>All my family and friends, in the US and elsewhere who have supported me and cheered me up through this entire process. Thanks for keeping inviting me to fun things in the US even though I’ve not been able to participate. Thanks for pushing for events to get organized outside of the US! I’m sorry I’ve missed social gatherings, a friend’s marriage and several conference speaking opportunities. Thanks for all the moral support throughout this long journey of madness.</p>



<p>A special thanks go to David (you know who you are) for contacting Gerry Connolly’s office. I honestly think this was the key event that finally made things move in this process.</p>

    </span></p><p>Apache Kafka is a beautiful system. It scales well, it is stable and it provides phenomenal system architecture flexibility.
After 5 years of running production Kafka clusters, I have collected a list of tips and pitfalls. Some of them were learnt the hard way.
If you work in a small team rolling out Kafka to production, those might prove useful.
The article assume familiarity with basic Kafka concepts, such as brokers, topics, producers and consumers.
What is more, the following points should be valid for up to Kafka 2.6.0.
Without further ado.</p><h3>1. Key all the messages!</h3><p>Kafka topics consist of a (configurable) number of partitions.
If the partition number is not provided by the user, <code>KafkaProducer</code>
chooses the partition for the message using the <code>key</code> in the <code>ProducerRecord</code> instance passed to it.</p><p>Check out the default <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2.6.0/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/DefaultPartitioner.java#L65">implementation</a>:
It checks if the key is <code>null</code>, and if it isn't it, computes a <code>murmur2</code> hash modulo the number of partitions.
This is consistent; it will yield the same result for messages sharing the same key.
If the key is <code>null</code> though, it uses a <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2.6.0/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/StickyPartitionCache.java#L60">sticky partitioner</a>
that chooses a partition randomly at every batch.
In practical terms, if no key is passed, the producer will choose the partition randomly.</p><p>This has important implications because <strong>Kafka only provides delivery ordering guarantees within a partition</strong>.
Messages in the same partition will be delivered in the order they were committed.
Messages in different partitions will be delivered in non-deterministic order.
If the messages have any form of <strong>causal relationship</strong> between them, and they are <strong>not</strong> in the same partition,
then any downstream consumer will have to collect all messages for a key before processing them, else causal consistency might be violated; whatever <em>all</em> means in the context of
an infinite stream.</p><p>As a simple example to illustrate the above, think of a simple event like the following:</p><div data-language=""><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>case class EmailSubscription(</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  email: Email,</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  active: Boolean,</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  createdOn: DateTime</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>def storeToDB(sub: EmailSubscription) = ???</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>val events: Stream[EmailSubscription] = ???</span></p></pre></div><p>If emails arrive in causal order, then we can map the events statelessly:</p><p>If per-email causal order is not guaranteed though, we need to maintain enough state to know
if the event we see is indeed the latest. Else if the order is reversed, we might send an email to a user who
has unsubscribed.
For example:</p><div data-language=""><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>events</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  .groupMapReduce(_.email)(identity)(</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    (e1, e2) =&gt; if (e1.createdOn.isAtfer(e2.createdOn)) e1 else e2</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  )</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    .values</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    .map(storeToDB)</span></p></pre></div><p>If we key messages using <code>email</code>, then Kafka will deliver all messages for a single email in the order they were inserted.
Our consumer can be completely stateless; it can fetch messages from Kafka and store them to a datastore.
If the key is <code>null</code> (none provided), our stateless consuer will happily store a message from the past.
To mitigate that, at the very minimum we need to maintain the latest <code>createdOn</code> date for every email.
Relying on wall clocks for causality <a href="https://github.com/aphyr/distsys-class#clocks">is a very bad idea</a>.</p><p>Assuming per key ordering can be guaranteed, downstream reducer bounds can be reduced from a <code>Semilattice</code> to a <code>Semigroup</code>.
In practical terms, by taking advantage of this property we can drop the commutativity requirement which unlocks easier implementations.
If designing reducers for Kafka consumers sounds interesting, let me know and I will write about it.</p><h3>2. Ensure all producers are using the same partitioner</h3><p>Providing a key is not enough. Partitioners (ie the function f: (key) =&gt; partition) are configurable.
Kafka provides a few and users can roll out their own. Do <strong>NOT</strong> assume all producers are using the same partitioner.</p><p>In a complex system where Go services, Python services, Spark and other wild animals all share the same Kafka cluster, all sorts of different implementations might exist.
If different services are pushing data to the same topics, an integration test would be very useful.
If things go wrong, delivery to consumers will be non-deterministic and debugging it can be pure hell.</p><h3>3. Topic versioning</h3><p>The beauty of Kafka is that data can be reprocessed as many times as needed.
This forgives a lot of errors. To illustrate this one, let's assume the same dummy model:</p><div data-language=""><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>case class EmailSubscription(</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  email: Email,</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  active: Boolean,</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  createdOn: DateTime</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div><p>Let's now assume messages are serialized to <code>json</code> before being pushed to Kafka.
Due to a json serialization bug, the following is pushed to the <code>emailsubscriptions</code> topic:</p><div data-language=""><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>{</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  "email": {</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    "value": "aris@aris.com"</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  },</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  "active": false,</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  "createdOn": 1600000000</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>Instead of the expected:</p><div data-language=""><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>{</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  "email": "aris@aris.com",</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  "active": false,</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  "createdOn": 1600000000</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>Downstream consumers try to deserialize the message and fail. What can be done?</p><p>One solution would be to create a custom deserializer for those buggy instances and to add it to all the consumers.
That's non trivial and error prone code; useful just for this instance.</p><p>Another solution would be to implement a consumer that would read from <code>emailsubscriptions-1</code>, fix the issue, and write to <code>emailsubscriptions-2</code>.
Once the offsets of the two topics are identical, producers and consumers can switch from <code>emailsubscriptions-1</code> to <code>emailsubscriptions-2</code> without having to update any code.
What's great about this is that those migrations can fail with no major consequences. If <code>emailsubscriptions-2</code> is no good, we can run again and produce <code>emailsubscriptions-3</code> and so on.
This trick also works for non-trivial schema changes, migrations and other data enrichments.
Avro and Profobuf can help in some cases, but bugs will occur and requirements will evolve in unpredictable ways.
In any case, "fixing" a topic's data by reading from it and publishing to it is rarely a good idea.
Topics should be immutable and versioning them can help in many situations where a topic's content have been corrupted.</p><h3>4. Treat ZooKeeper like royalty</h3><p>Up until at least 2.6.0, Kafka relies on ZooKeeper.
Losing connection to ZooKeeper means no ISRs (In-Sync-Replicas, more on that later), no partition leader election and eventually the brokers shut down.
Thankfully <a href="https://twitter.com/fpjunqueira?lang=en">@fpjunqueira</a> and his team who created ZooKeeper are real pros, and that won't happen without reason.
In fact, ZooKeeper is one of the most reliable distributed systems (that I have seen at least).</p><p>The two following mess ups have occurred though:</p><ol><li>Due to a bug in the provisioning Ansible script, 2/3rds of a cluster ended up in the same availability zone, with sequential IPs (that usually means in the same rack on AWS).
They all disappeared at the same time. No consensus, hell broke loose.</li><li>A QA environment ran for long enough for all nodes to run out of disk space (ZooKeeper creates backup snapshots of the transaction log over time and someone/something external has to deal with deleting them).
At the same time. Bringing this env back to life required editing znodes manually, and still data was lost.</li></ol><p>To clean up older transaction log snapshots in ZooKeeper 3.4.x, ZooKeeper provides the following tool:</p><div data-language=""><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>java -cp zookeeper-3.4.x.jar:lib/*:conf org.apache.zookeeper.server.PurgeTxnLog \</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  /var/lib/zookeeper /var/lib/zookeeper -n 5</span></p></pre></div><p>Ideally on a cron.</p><p>Those are just two examples. A lot more can go wrong. Because of the consequences of failure, proper JMX metric monitoring and real time log aggregation,
all hooked up to a form of PagerDuty, are very highly recommended.</p><h3>5. Unclean elections and minimum ISRs</h3><p>This is essentially a trade off between availability and durability. Let's start with unclean elections.</p><p>Let's assume we have a topic with a single partition and a single replica. Data is happily flowing in.
If the replica is "in-sync" (aka identical to the leader and in the ISR set in ZooKeeper),
then if the leader partition becomes unavailable (eg the broker crashes) then the replica can pick up, accept writes and continue with no downtime.
If the replica lags behind though, the leader will remove it from the ISRs in ZooKeeper. If then the leader goes down, there are two options:</p><ol><li>The lagging replica picks up, accepts writes and whatever excess writes the old leader had are <em>lost</em>. Essentially, the replica gets elected as leader without being in-sync. This is the "unclean" part.</li><li>The partition becomes unavailable and new writes are rejected.</li></ol><p>It entirely depends on the kind of data the topic holds. If the topic holds system metrics,
then maybe the most recent data is more valuable and thus losing some older writes might be acceptable.
If the topic contains bank transactions, going down until a human intervenes might be a better option.
This is a broker level config that can be overridden per topic.</p><p>The second part of this equation is <code>min.insync.replicas</code>, which represents the minimum number of replicas that have to be in-sync for a write to go through.
This is configurable at the broker level, topic level and even at the producer level (ie <code>acks</code>). Same considerations as above,
if the topic holds payments, having just 1 replica with all the data might be risky.</p><p>Legendary distributed systems researcher Kyle Kingsbury, aka Aphyr, did an <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/293-call-me-maybe-kafka">excellent analysis on Kafka's replication mechanism</a> some 7 years ago.
If you wish to dig deeper into this trade off, reading Aphyr's piece is very highly recommeneded. As far as I understand, the basic trade offs discussed still hold true today.</p><h3>6. Memory Maps</h3><p>Kafka uses a LOT of those. Running out of them leads to a fatal runtime exception that will kill the broker.
If the OS defaults are used, it is extremely likely that those will be reached as soon as the cluster has a few tens of thousand segments per broker.
What's worse is that in a well balanced cluster where brokers hold similar numbers of partitions, those failures will occur roughly at the same time.
Let's look a bit closer:</p><p><code>vm.max_map_count</code>: is the maximum number of memory map areas a process can have.</p><p>From the linux kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysctl/vm.html?highlight=max_map_count#max-map-count">docs</a>:</p><blockquote><p>max_map_count:<br>

may have. Memory map areas are used as a side-effect of …</p></blockquote></section></div>

  </ul><p><em>Updated on Sun, 08 Nov 2020 03:01:01 GMT, tagged with ‘finance’.</em></p><p>Imagine. It's 1871. A promising young American has just entered the workforce and makes it a point to buy $100 of the S&amp;P 500 index every month, with dividends reinvested, over a forty year career. It's now 1911. Our American, about to retire, stops these monthly purchases and asks, "What is the real return I achieved in excess of risk-free Treasuries over my forty-year investing horizon?"</p>
<p><strong><em>Answer: 3.8%.</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You want details, I got details. You can read the <a href="https://github.com/fasiha/shiller-heat/blob/8cac0574702320ffc41302c8392b4929855ed321/shiller.ts#L121-L125">code</a> or the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jzBiJ4OAIDo35Nom0U6a655TJAnqeoMf/view?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> (start at cell W5), but I use Robert Shiller's <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm">online dataset</a>. It contains monthly numbers for the S&amp;P 500 index's price (dollars per share), dividends (dollars per month), CPI (consumer price index, to discount inflation), and 10-year Treasury yields, all starting in 1871. I assume you invested $1 at the beginning of each month at the real CPI-adjusted price of the stock index, reinvesting the dividends that accrued over the previous month. After 480 such buying sessions, I calculate the internal rate of return (XIRR) by assuming the entire portfolio was liquidated, which is just an accounting choice to answer the question, "what real return did the S&amp;P 500 yield over this forty year horizon after monthly dollar cost averaging".</p>
<p>I then do a similar exercise with Treasuries: every month I assume you put that real $1 into a savings account-like vehicle that pays interest monthly at the same rate as the 10-year T-note's (CPI-adjusted). XIRR again computes the internal rate of return, over the same time horizon. <em>Excess</em> return is just the S&amp;P's real return minus the Treasuries' real return, and is expressed in a percentage just like any rate of return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine now that every year after 1871, we can find one such promising young American to join the work force and to do the same thing: monthly-dollar-cost average into the S&amp;P 500 index for forty years.</p>
<p>Seven years later, the investor who began dollar-cost averaging in 1878 and asks in 1918 what their real excess rate of return was, gets a shocking number.</p>
<p><strong><em>0.3%.</em></strong></p>
<p>This investor retiring in 1918; the next one retiring in 1919, and 1920, and on, up to 1924: each of these see an excess real rate of return between <strong><em>-1.3%</em></strong> and <strong><em>0.3%</em></strong>. In 1925, the retiree who began in 1885, sees a <strong><em>0.8%</em></strong> excess real return, and only after them does each successive year's retiree see a nice positive excess real return.</p>
<p>The graph below plots this time series: the excess real return each year's retiree saw, from 1911 to 2020. Thanks to Plotly, it's interactive so you can click, tap, zoom, pan, pinch, etc. You can see it starts out at the 3.8% mentioned above, drops to -1.3% in the early 1920s, and wanders between -2.4% and 6.6%, as each year's retiree does a bit better or worse than the previous year's. The <em>median</em> excess real return for all our retirees: 1.6%.</p>

<p>From 1925 to 1981, each retiree saw a positive real excess return.</p>
<p>Then, from 1981 to 2013, thirty-one retirees during this thirty-three year interval saw negative excess real returns over forty years of monthly dollar-cost averaging. (There was a brief blip into positive territory during 1999 and 2000, i.e., the Tech Bubble.) That's a whole generation: a parent and their child could both have seen zero real excess return, over a career's worth of investing.</p>
<p>As I'm writing this, in late 2020, I see this year's retiree is looking back on 3.1% real excess return of the S&amp;P 500 over Treasuries, over forty years of monthly dollar-cost averaging. I'm about fifteen years into my career. You might be thirty-five years into yours, or just three years. We don't yet know what the graph will look like for us when we retire, in five, twenty-five, and thirty-seven years hence—but seeing this graph, with its plateaus and gyrations, and imagining at each point a retiree looking back on <em>a lifetime</em> of following solid retirement advice, gives me pause: so many of them were <em>unrewarded</em> for investing in stocks—they could have just bought Treasuries and relaxed.</p>
<p>I'm caricaturing retirement conventional wisdom a little bit—although its simplest tenet is to buy and hold a diversified basket of equities and reap its risk premium over the long-term, we haven't simulated a glide path to bonds, or explored any alternatives. Nevertheless, for me personally, answering this simple question about equities' excess real returns following this commonly-recommended strategy was very illuminating, because it makes me feel that retirement savings is less of a solved topic than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>Postscript</strong> A friend recently asked me, "What should I invest in for my newborn's college fund?" Although the universe of assets worth considering is much larger than just S&amp;P 500 ETF vs a money market fund, the above analysis can apply: what is the excess real return of the S&amp;P 500 over Treasuries over all <em>twenty</em> year horizons of monthly dollar-cost averaging, with dividends reinvested?</p>
<p>That's the graph below (along with several other horizons).</p>

<p>Answer: it ranges from between 10.4% to -10% annualized rate of return, with a <em>median</em> of 2.4%. If we imagine an annual series of parent–investors adopting this strategy, the first's child turning twenty in 1891, this median means that half of them saw excess returns greater than 2.4% and half of them less. Do these returns justify putting your child's college fund in the S&amp;P 500? I would feel sufficiently uneasy about this and seek to explore other options.</p>

<p>2020-11-08</p>
<p>This is a little demonstration of how little you need to host your own git
repositories and have a modest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</a>
system for them. All you need is a unixy
server you can ssh into, but arguably you can try this out locally as well.
We will use Redis at one point to queue tasks, but
strictly speaking this can be achieved without additional software. To keep things
simple this will only work with one repository, since this is only describing a
pattern.</p>
<p>The source code to all of that follows below can be found <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Estchris/tiny-ci">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Hosting bare git repositories</h2>
<p>Assuming you can ssh into a server and create a directory, this is all you need
to create a shareable git repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ git init --bare
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally you are using a distinct user for it (named <code>git</code>) and have it set to
use <code>git-shell</code> as its default shell. By convention bare repositories are stored
in directories which end in <code>.git</code>. You can now clone this repository from your
machine with:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone ssh://git@host.example.com/~git/repo.git
</code></pre>
<h2>post-receive hooks</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#post-receive">post-receive hook</a> is an executable which can do some work as soon as something new was pushed to the repository. We will use an executable shell script which needs to go inside the <code>hooks</code> directory of the (bare) repository on the server side.</p>
<p>Now the most trivial thing to do would be to do the actual work in here, but this would block the <code>git push</code> on the client side, so we just want to enqueue a new job, return a handle and exit. If what you do takes only a short amount of time, you can stop here. Alternatively you can use this repository for deployments only, by defining it as a separate remote. But the goal here is to have tests run on every push, so we will split the job creation from the actual run.</p>
<p>This is where Redis comes into play for the job queueing. We will assume redis is installed and running and we will use redis-cli to access it from the script. We will use two data structures: a list of jobs waiting to be executed, referenced by a UUID we will generate and a hash where we can store the git revision and the state associated to a given job, as well as its output.</p>
<p>Note that git is passing three arguments to the script via stdin: the old revision before the push, the new revision and the current ref.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
while read -r _ newrev ref
do
	id=$(uuid)
	echo "Starting CI job $id"
	redis-cli hset "$id" rev "$newrev" &gt;/dev/null
	redis-cli hset "$id" ref "$ref" &gt;/dev/null
	redis-cli lpush jobs "$id" &gt;/dev/null
done
</code></pre>
<h2>Defining build jobs</h2>
<p>By convention our system will run whatever is in an executable script named <code>ci.sh</code>. The drawback is that this only works with trusted systems and access to the repository needs to be guarded to prevent random code execution. The big advantage is that we don't need to come up with a job definition DSL or cumbersome file format.</p>
<p>Our convention will also be that the script will be passed one argument: the name of the git ref, so we can decide what to do based on the branch we are on.</p>
<p>Let's just put this into a file named <code>ci.sh</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

# the git ref gets passed in as the only argument
ref="$1"

# pretend we're running tests
echo "running tests"

# only deploy if we're on the main branch
[[ "$ref" == "refs/heads/main" ]] &amp;&amp; echo "Deploying"
</code></pre>
<h2>The build runner</h2>
<p>Now that jobs are queued the last piece missing is a job runner. We will make use of Redis' <a href="https://redis.io/commands/blpop">BLPOP command</a> to block until the jobs list has a new job for us. That job id will give us the revision we need to check out and will allow us to write back the output and status of the job.</p>
<p>Note that, as discussed, this assumes a repository called <code>test</code> is already checked out right next to the script.</p>
<p>tiny-ci.sh</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

# ./runner.sh is supposed to run on the server where your git repository lives

# the logic in here will run in an infinite loop:
# * (block and) wait for a job
# * run it
while :
do

# Announce that we're waiting
echo "Job runner waiting"

# We are using https://redis.io/commands/blpop to block until we have a new
# message on the "jobs" list. We use `tail` to get the last line because the
# output of BLPOP is of the form "list-that-got-an-element\nelement"
jobid=$(redis-cli blpop jobs 0 | tail -n 1)

# The message we received will have the job uuid
echo "Running job $jobid"

# Get the git revision we're supposed to check out
rev=$(redis-cli hget "${jobid}" "rev")
echo Checking out revision "$rev"

# Get the git ref
ref=$(redis-cli hget "${jobid}" "ref")

# Prepare the repository (hardcoded path) by getting that commit
cd test || exit; git fetch &amp;&amp; git reset --hard "$rev";

# Actually runs the job and saves the output
if ! output=$(./ci.sh "$ref" 2&gt;&amp;1);
then
    status="failed";
else
    status="success";
fi;

# Update the result status
redis-cli hset "${jobid}" "status" $status;

# Update the job output
redis-cli hset "${jobid}" "output" "$output";

echo "Job ${jobid} done"

done
</code></pre>
<h2>Running it</h2>
<p>Summing up:</p>
<ul>
<li>there's a bare git repository somewhere, called <code>test.git</code></li>
<li>we can clone the empty repo (or create a new one and add the respective remote)</li>
<li>on the server hosting the git repository we clone <code>test.git</code> into <code>test</code> and place <code>tiny-ci.sh</code> next to it</li>
<li>we run builds by starting <code>tiny-ci.sh</code> on the server hosting the repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if we <code>git push</code> a new commit to the <code>main</code> branch with the <code>ci.sh</code> file from above, the output will return the job id</p>
<pre><code>Enumerating objects: 5, done.
...
remote: Starting CI job dab82634-21cc-11eb-b3b3-9b8767dff47c
</code></pre>
<h2>Checking build status</h2>
<p>Knowing a job uuid, the easiest way to get the status
of a build is by using the <code>--csv</code> style output of the <a href="https://redis.io/commands/hgetall">HGETALL</a> command of redis.</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh example.com redis-cli --csv hgetall $JOB_UUID
"rev","f0706ea18a22031f84619b1161c8fbdb0dcd6850","ref","refs/heads/master","status","success","output","running tests\nDeploying"
</code></pre>
<h2>Possible further improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>multi-repo support</strong></p>
<p>This would mean changes to the <code>post-receive</code> hook to put jobs in a list named <code>job-${REPONAME}</code> and then have the worker also react based on that. Notice how <code>redis-cli blpop</code> takes several lists to watch and will also return the name of the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>job cleanup</strong></p>
<p>Creating a key for every job pollutes the redis database unnecesarily. Enqueuing the job could be done via <a href="https://redis.io/commands/setex">SETEX</a> so that the keys go away after one hour / one day / one week. The purpose of Redis here is short term storage and not long-term archival of job results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>more workers</strong></p>
<p>Scaling to multiple workers on the same machine would need different working folders (and some process isolation depending on the tasks run in there). Scaling to multiple machines would need access to a central redis instance for job distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>worker isolation / sandboxing</strong></p>
<p>For more complex tasks some kind of process and file-system isolation is necessary. The worker could spin up VMs or Docker containers. The build system used on <a href="https://builds.sr.ht/">builds.sr.ht</a> for instance uses a <a href="https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/installation.md#security-model">Docker container run as an unprivileged user in a KVM qemu machine</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>timestamps</strong></p>
<p>For convenience you would definitely want timestamps for every operation. This also allows to list queries like "the last five jobs" or to do maintenance on job results based on their time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>notifications</strong></p>
<p>Any CI system will have some form of notifications and the simplest form would be to do something in the script, right at the end. But this covers only the success case, so a better approach would be to create a notification queue and have a notification worker react on that.</p>
</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>No More Free Work from Marak: Pay Me or Fork This</p>

  <p>Respectfully, I am no longer going to support Fortune 500s
( and other smaller sized companies ) with my free work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gist is that Marak, who’s on the brink of homelessness after his apartment building caught fire, is no longer interested in doing unpaid work for businesses using his <a href="https://github.com/Marak/faker.js">faker.js</a> project. He seems to be getting a lot of support from the open source developer community.</p>

<h2 id="unpaid-interns">Unpaid Interns</h2>

<p>The foundational principle of open source is “fix your problem, then give the world a copy of the solution.” So let’s get one thing straight: <em>open source developers are not volunteering to fix your problem.</em> They are fixing their own problems, then letting you use the solution too because it costs them nothing. That near-zero cost of replicating software is why open source works.</p>

<p>Because of this, I don’t think developers claiming to do open source should expect compensation for features that they need for themselves. But developing a new feature that they don’t need is something different entirely. In IT we call that a Change Request, and CRs come with a fee to cover them. ‘Near-zero cost’ doesn’t apply anymore because now they’re taking on a lot of work they otherwise wouldn’t have done.</p>

<p>Not recognizing this difference has led to a situation where for-profit entities are using open-source devs as unpaid interns. Well it’s worse really: at least interns get resume filler.</p>

<h2 id="no-more-free-features">No More Free Features</h2>

<p>I look forward to a day when asking anyone to do unpaid labor is considered unethical by our industry. That goes for feature requests on open source projects, on unpaid internships, and on unpaid ‘take home’ interview assignments.</p>

<p>Requesting work in an economic context without offering compensation in some form is morally indefensible. It’s wrong because unpaid labor is wrong. It’s wrong because presuming on anyone’s helpful nature is wrong. We shouldn’t be using bounties to move our change requests to the head of the line because we shouldn’t even be making requests without a bounty attached.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article"><p>Today it's almost obvious to state that good written communication creates a business advantage.</p>
<p>I've probably read more articles on written communication in the workplace in the last two months than over the last 10 years. </p>
<p>Most of these essays gave tips on how to become better writers.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but notice that many (if not all) of them questioned the same thing: the prose.</p>
<p>Everyone advised to keep sentences short and to the point, use active voice and not passive&nbsp;voice, use fewer commas and more periods, avoid acronyms, etc.</p>
<p>Let's be clear: none of these are mistaken or wrong by any means. But this made me realize how huge the misconceptions are on what good business writing actually means.</p>
<p>In fact, what separates most people from good writing has very little to do with style, grammar, local sentences structure, word selection, or even content per se.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people can't write well because they don't know how to control the logical sequence in which they present their ideas.</p>
<p>And that is the single most important act necessary to clear writing.</p>
<p>In this essay we're going to dig into how you can effectively share written ideas in a way that value time and effort for others.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="understanding-how-we-think"><a href="#understanding-how-we-think" aria-label="understanding how we think permalink"></a>Understanding How We Think</h2>
<p>Writing an idea is always the result of two macro-steps. First, decide the point that we want want to make, and then put into words.</p>
<p>To understand how we can effectively share written ideas, we need to understand first how we formulate them in the first place.</p>
<p>Deciding the point you want to make is the result of a 5-step process.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unbundling</em> a concept</li>
<li><em>Noticing</em> something</li>
<li><em>Articulating</em>/<em>Developing</em> an idea</li>
<li><em>Re-Bundling</em>&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Reframing</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/generate-idea-thinking-process.png" alt="State diagram to share the 5-step process one use to generate an idea."></p>
<h3 id="unbundling-a-concept"><a href="#unbundling-a-concept" aria-label="unbundling a concept permalink"></a>Unbundling A Concept</h3>
<p>Every idea begins with an unbundling process. Unbundling is an act of exploration that leads to the decoupling of all the individual items of a certain subject.</p>
<p>Unbundling something doesn't imply a deep understanding of it. It's more a perception of full awareness.</p>
<p>In fact, you might not even know how every individual piece works, but you know they all exist in separate forms. No hidden parts.</p>
<h3 id="noticing-something"><a href="#noticing-something" aria-label="noticing something permalink"></a>Noticing Something</h3>
<p>Unbundling enhances our ability to observe, and this can lead us to noticing something. This can be a pattern, an insight, a novelty, or even a minor detail.</p>
<p>If <em>unbundling</em> is the flint, <em>noticing</em> is the spark that really makes the fire.</p>
<h3 id="articulatingdeveloping-an-idea"><a href="#articulatingdeveloping-an-idea" aria-label="articulatingdeveloping an idea permalink"></a>Articulating/Developing An Idea</h3>
<p>Only when we notice something can we start developing an idea. That's where the creative part begins. That's where you try to develop your initial cue into a fully formed idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if you noticed that something was unnecessary or too complicated, you might run a simplification process. If you noticed something was missing, you go through an addition or reinforcement process.</p>
<h3 id="re-bundling-and-reframing"><a href="#re-bundling-and-reframing" aria-label="re bundling and reframing permalink"></a>Re-bundling And Reframing</h3>
<p>Once you finish including your idea, you go through re-bundling. This is a reconstruction process. This is where you try to recompose a world that now contemplates your newly inserted idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bundling is a fundamental part because it's where you can verify if the your new world still holds up. If not, that's a signal you need to put more work in the articulation phase or what you noticed didn't lead to anything meaningful at all.</p>
<p>If at the end of the re-bundling process your world does hold up, you go through a reframing process.</p>
<p>On paper, this seems to be a very logical and clear process, but in reality it's much more complicated as you constantly repeat these steps of of unbundling, editing your idea, and re-bundling until you find a viable path.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/generate-idea-complexity.png" alt="The complex process of idea generation"></p>
<p>Now that you have an idea, you need to decide how to put it into words that you can share with others.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-how-we-write"><a href="#understanding-how-we-write" aria-label="understanding how we write permalink"></a>Understanding How We Write</h2>
<p>From a broader point, the single goal of writing is to get some information into someone's head.</p>
<p>Think about it. It's almost a simulation act.</p>
<p>You need to reproduce your reader's thinking process using your brain. And know how to build up your information in a way that feels logical and makes sense to them.</p>
<p>This process has very little to do with what you went through when you came up with the idea in the first place. In fact, forcing the reader through the exact same original path you took will have the opposite effect and create more confusion.</p>
<p>Here's how it often goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have an idea <em>x</em></li>
<li>You write down a set of words <em>m</em> that lead you to <em>x</em></li>
<li>Because of the pre-existing narrative that led you to the idea, you associate <em>m -&gt; x</em></li>
<li>When you proofread it, you mentally get it. Not because <em>m -&gt; x</em> but because of all the pre-existing associations.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how most people write. And it's exactly why most people's writing sucks.</p>
<p>Not because they use too many passive forms or weak verbs (that doesn't help either), but because they aren't able to write from the reader's perspective. Most writings lacks the basic logical order and structure.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-good-business-writing"><a href="#what-is-good-business-writing" aria-label="what is good business writing permalink"></a>What is Good Business Writing</h2>
<p>Good business writing is a combination of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information Context</li>
<li>Information Resolution</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-build-context-the-scqa-framework"><a href="#how-to-build-context-the-scqa-framework" aria-label="how to build context the scqa framework permalink"></a>How to build Context: The SCQA Framework</h3>
<p>Context is the "<em>you're here</em>" red arrow that you can see on almost any maps. Good information context helps the reader set the frame to understand what they're about to read next.</p>
<p>Shared context helps the participants make judgments calls using the same pair of lenses.</p>
<p>A lack of a shared understanding on the basic principles can easily result in a partial understanding or conflict on what follows.</p>
<p>What's the best way to build information context?</p>
<p>Barbara Minto, a McKinsey consultant in the 70s, solved this problem with what she called the <em>SCQA framework</em>.</p>
<p>She named this framework the <em>Situation — Complication — Question — Answer</em> framework. You can unpack more on this topic in her book “The Pyramid Principle”.</p>
<p>According to Minto, context is the result of these four sub-ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>Situation,</li>
<li>A Complication,</li>
<li>A Question,</li>
<li>... and an Answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Situation</strong> is a non-controversial statement on a subject that you know the reader will agree because it's something he already knows. By summarizing what he already knows, the situation establishes the relevance of the questions that your document is going to answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Complication</strong> describes an alteration of a stable situation. Keep in mind, this alteration is purely fact-based. The Situation-Complication combination should lead the reader to an immediate question.</p>
<p>The <strong>Question</strong> represents an intuitive response to the complication. The best Situation-Complication scenario makes the question sound totally superfluous to state. The best questions aren't posed, they emerge.</p>
<p>The <strong>Answer</strong> is the summary of your main idea. Beware, it's the solution, not the explanation of it. Good answers are typically represented by 3/4 bullet points. No more.</p>
<p>If you squint at it, you realise that the SCQA framework turned out initial schema upside down.</p>
<p>Ideas comes up in a bottom-up fashion, but they need to be told top-down.</p>
<p>This is not how we think. But it's how we should write.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/scqa-reversed-thinking-frmework.png" alt="SCQA reversed thinking framework"></p>
<p>Another interesting benefit of building information context using the SCQA framework is that once you've gotten the initial part out of the way, you can focus all your energy on making and supporting the case for why it's true.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-increase-resolution-whyhow-dialogues"><a href="#how-to-increase-resolution-whyhow-dialogues" aria-label="how to increase resolution whyhow dialogues permalink"></a>How to increase Resolution: Why/How Dialogues</h3>
<p>Ensuring you and your reader are in the same place before you lead him through your thinking is a necessary but non-sufficient condition. </p>
<p>Once he's aware of the gist of your main idea (Answer), you need to argue and support it. That's when you need to focus on information resolution.</p>
<p>Think of <em>information resolution</em> as the density level of details that you're able to provide to the reader. The bolder the answer, the higher resolution levels it requires.</p>
<p>If you gloss over key important passages, people will not follow your thinking and might have a partial understanding of the message.</p>
<p>How do you increase information resolution?</p>
<p>You support your initial <em>Answer</em> using the form of Why/How dialogues. Making an initial statement that the reader doesn't know will automatically raise a logical question in his mind. <em>How is that possible?</em> <em>Why do you say that?</em> In your following answers, you're likely to tell him other details he doesn't know and this will raise further questions that you're going to answer. And so on.</p>
<p>The author will continue to write, raising and answering questions, until he reaches a point at which he judges the reader will have no more logical questions.</p>
<p>The vertical relationship of a why/how dialogue helps capture the reader's attention. It permits you, as an author, to establish an inner dialog that will pull him with great interest through your reasoning. The reader will be forced to respond logically to your ideas.</p>
<p>As you can see we've not made a full circle. We're now in the (previously discussed) unbundling part.</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-good-business-writing"><a href="#examples-of-good-business-writing" aria-label="examples of good business writing permalink"></a>Examples of Good Business Writing</h2>
<p>Armed with our SCQA framework and the Why/How vertical development, let's look at the skeleton of some real examples.</p>

<p>It's one of the most common examples. common examples. A salesperson, after speaking with a customers, irrupts in the #product or #engineering Slack channels requesting the implementation of a given feature.</p>
<p>If you've been in this position, here's how you can Minto-ize an internal feature request for your product:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Situation:</em>
We have never allowed customers to customize XYZ in order to keep complexity low.</p>
<p><em>Complication:</em>
However, competitor X has now shipped such a customization feature, and we’ve been losing deals because of that.</p>
<p><em>Questions:</em>
We now need to decide whether we want to allow some kind of customization as well.</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em>
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Directives are the most common internal memo. Executives write them to request something of someone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Situation:</em>&nbsp;
As you know we're repositioning product <em>x</em> for mid-sized enterprise. We need to teach you how to see <em>x</em> for organizations between 100 and 200 employees.</p>
<p><em>Complication:</em>
We've never sold to this type of customer before. Hence, we need to construct a new customer profile from scratch</p>
<p><em>Questions:</em> (How can we do the profile?)</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em>
We're going to host:</p>

			<p>03 Nov 2020 — by Fotis Xenakis</p>
		</header>
		<p>This article provides an overview of <a href="https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/">virtio-fs</a>,
a novel way for sharing the host file system with guests and
<a href="https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv">OSv</a>, a specialized, lightweight
operating system (unikernel) for the cloud, as well as how these two fit
together.</p>

<h2 id="virtio-fs">virtio-fs</h2>

<p>Virtio-fs is a new host-guest shared filesystem, purpose-built for local file
system semantics and performance. To that end, it takes full advantage of the
host’s and the guest’s colocation on the same physical machine, unlike
network-based efforts, like virtio-9p.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, virtio-fs builds on virtio for providing an efficient
transport: it is included in the (currently draft, to become v1.2) virtio
<a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/virtio-spec">specification</a> as a new device. The
protocol used by the device is a slightly extended version of
<a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">FUSE</a>, providing a solid foundation for
all file system operations native on Linux. Implementation-wise, on the QEMU
side, it takes the approach of splitting between the guest interface (handled
by QEMU) and the host file system interface (the device “backend”). The latter
is handled by virtiofsd (“virtio-fs daemon”), running as a separate process,
utilizing the
<a href="https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/interop/vhost-user.html">vhost-user</a> protocol
to communicate with QEMU.</p>

<p>One prominent performance feature of virtio-fs is the DAX (Direct Access)
window. It’s a shared memory window between the host and the guest, exposed as
device memory (a PCI BAR) to the second. Upon request, the host (QEMU) maps file contents to the window for the guest to access directly. This bears performance
gains due to taking VMEXITs out of the read/write data path and bypassing the
guest page cache on Linux, while not counting against the VM’s memory (since
it’s just device memory, managed on the host).</p>

<p><img src="https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/virtio-fs.gitlab.io/-/raw/master/architecture.svg" alt="virtio-fs DAX architecture"></p>

<p>Virtio-fs is under active development, with its community focussing on a pair of
device implementation in QEMU and device driver in Linux. Both components are
already available upstream in their initial iterations, while upstreaming
continues further e.g. with DAX window support.</p>

<h2 id="osv">OSv</h2>

<p>OSv is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel">unikernel</a> (framework). The
two defining characteristics of a unikernel are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Application-specialized</strong>: a unikernel is an executable machine image,
consisting of an application and supporting code (drivers, memory management,
runtime etc.) linked together, running in a single address space (typically
in guest “kernel mode”).</li>
  <li><strong>Library OS</strong>: each unikernel only contains the functionality mandated by its
application in terms of non-application code, i.e. no unused drivers, or even
whole subsystems (e.g. networking, if the application doesn’t use the
network).</li>
</ul>

<p>OSv in particular strives for binary compatibility with Linux, using a <a href="https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Dynamic-Linker">dynamic
linker</a>. This means
that applications built for Linux should run as OSv unikernels without requiring
modifications or even rebuilding, at least most of the time. Of course, not the
whole Linux ABI is supported, with system calls like <code>fork()</code> and relatives
missing by design in all unikernels, which lack the notion of a process. Despite
this limitation, OSv is quite full featured, with full SMP support, virtual
memory, a virtual file system (and many filesystem implementations, including
ZFS) as well as a mature networking stack, based on the FreeBSD sources.</p>

<p>At this point, one is sure to wonder “Why bother with unikernels?”. The problem
they were originally
<a href="http://unikernel.org/files/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf">introduced</a> to solve is the
bloated software stack in modern cloud computing. Running general-purpose
operating systems as guests, typically for a single application/service, on top
of a hypervisor which already takes care of isolation and provides a standard
device model means duplication, as well as loss of efficiency. This is were
unikernels come in, trying to be just enough to support a single application
and as light-weight as possible, based on the assumption that they are executing
inside a VM. Below is an illustration of the comparison between
general-purpose OS, unikernels and containers (as another approach to the same
problem, for completeness).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.qemu.org/screenshots/2020-11-04-unikernel-vs-gpos.svg" alt="Unikernels vs GPOS vs containers"></p>

<h2 id="osv-meet-virtio-fs">OSv, meet virtio-fs</h2>

<p>As is apparent e.g. from the container world, it is very common for applications
running in isolated environments (such as containers, or unikernels even more
so) to require host file system access. Whereas containers sharing the host
kernel thus have an obvious, controlled path to the host file system, with
unikernels this has been more complex: all solutions were somewhat heavyweight,
requiring a network link or indirection through network protocols. Virtio-fs
then provided a significantly more attractive route: straight-forward mapping of
fs operations (via FUSE), reusing the existing virtio transport and decent
performance without high memory overhead.</p>

<p>The OSv community quickly identified the opportunity and came up with a
read-only implementation on its side, when executing under QEMU. This emphasized
being lightweight complexity-wise, while catering to many of its applications’
requirements (they are stateless, think e.g. serverless). Notably, it includes
support for the DAX window (even before that’s merged in upstream QEMU),
providing <a href="https://github.com/foxeng/diploma">excellent performance</a>, directly
rivalling that of its local (non-shared) counterparts such as ZFS and ROFS (an
OSv-specific read-only file system).</p>

<p>One central point is OSv’s support for booting from virtio-fs: this enables
deploying a modified version or a whole new application <strong>without rebuilding</strong>
the image, just by adjusting its root file system contents on the host. Last,
owing to the DAX window practically providing low-overhead access to the host’s
page cache, scalability is also expected to excel, with it being a common
concern due to the potentially high density of unikernels per host.</p>

<p>For example, to build the <code>cli</code> OSv image, bootable from virtio-fs, using the
core OSv <a href="https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv#building-osv-kernel-and-creating-images">build
system</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>scripts/build fs=virtiofs export=all image=cli
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This results in a minimal image (just the initramfs), while the root fs contents
are placed in a directory on the host (<code>build/export</code> here, by default).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv#running-osv">Running</a> the above image
is just a step away (may want to use the virtio-fs development version of
<a href="https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/qemu/-/tree/virtio-fs-dev">QEMU</a>, e.g. for DAX
window support):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>scripts/run.py --virtio-fs-tag=myfs --virtio-fs-dir=$(pwd)/build/export
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This orchestrates running both virtiofsd and QEMU, using the contents of
<code>build/export</code> as the root file system. Any changes to this directory, directly
from the host will be visible in the guest without re-running the previous build
step.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>OSv has gained a prominent new feature, powered by virtio-fs and its QEMU
implementation. This allows efficient, lightweight and performant access to the
host’s file system, thanks to the native virtio transport, usage of the FUSE
protocol and the DAX window architecture. In turn, it enables use cases like
rapid unikernel reconfiguration.</p>

<h2>Ortografia cyrylicka dla języka polskiego</h2>
<h2>A Cyrillic orthography for the Polish language</h2>

<p><big>E</big>ver wondered what Polish would look like if it were written in Cyrillic? Perhaps you have. Or not. In any case, I have. That's what happens when you spend half of your life working on language projects that one way or another are related to Polish or the Slavic languages in general. Toying around with Polish, Slavic, as well as with several Slavic orthographies, it is hard not to think about the possibilities of a Cyrillic orthography for Polish.</p>

<p>Many people have argued that Cyrillic would be unsuitable for Polish. I disagree with that opinion. Granted, Polish phonology differs from that of the other Slavic languages in several ways, but these two facts remain: Polish is a completely Slavic language by any standard, and Cyrillic, unlike the Latin alphabet, was made especially to fit Cyrillic phonology, and therefore is perfectly suited for it. Therefore, I am convinced that Polish and Cyrillic are a perfect match. Much more so, in fact, than Polish and the Latin alphabet. Latin orthographies of Slavic languages always have one of the following two disadvantages: either they are full of diacritical marks, or they look horribly like English or another Western language. Slovene manages best, but still has <b>š</b>, <b>ž</b> and <b>č</b>. Other languages have more of those babies. Polish orthography has managed to avoid hačeks, but has a whole bunch of other diacritics instead: <b>ą</b>, <b>ę</b>, <b>ł</b>, <b>ż</b>, <b>ć</b>, <b>ń</b>, <b>ó</b>, <b>ś</b>, <b>ź</b>. Besides, Polish in addition tends to favour digraphs like <b>sz</b> and <b>ie</b>, so Polish words tend to be appear longer than they actually are.</p>

<p>Now, I am quite fond of Polish orthography, and therefore my Cyrillic orthography of Polish should by no means be treated as a serious proposal to replace Polish orthography. If anyone would ever make such a proposal, I would be the first to stand up against it. This project, therefore, is primarily a thought experiment, my answer to the question if such an orthography would be possible at all.</p>

<p>The idea, by the way, is not new at all. If we have to believe Wikipedia, Russia's czar Nikolay I intended to cyrillify Polish in the mid-19th century as a means for russification, although at last nothing came of his plans. Here is a sample:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>

Бąдзь похвалёна пр̌енайсьвęтша Трóйца<br>
Тэразъ и часу вшелькего.</p><p>
(...)</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>A few pecularities in this text deserve our attention:
</p><ul>
<li>the use of the letter <b>р̌</b> for Polish <b>rz</b>;
</li><li>the hard sign <b>ъ</b> at the end of many words (a feature common in prerevolutionary Russian);
</li><li>the fact that Polish <b>ó</b> remains untouched;
</li><li>this orthography inherits the Polish ogonek and adds it to Cyrillic letters;
</li><li>the use of <b>ць</b> and <b>дзь</b> where Polish has <b>ć</b> and <b>dź</b>, a feature also present in contemporary Belarusian.
</li></ul>

<p>My own Cyrillic orthography for Polish is largely based on the same premises, but there are a few differences as well, which I will describe below. By the way, it should be noted that the transcription quoted above is not the only attempt at a Cyrillic alphabet for Polish. Several people have played with the idea, seriously or less seriously. An interesting example is <a href="http://varpho.livejournal.com/2006/11/17/">Jusowica (Юсовица)</a>, created by Szymon Pawlas.</p>

<hr>

<p><big>T</big>he biggest problem related with the Cyrillisation of Polish are sounds that do not exist in other languages, nor do they correspond closely with anything else that exist in them: the nasal vowels <b>ą</b> and <b>ę</b>. The 19th century Russian solution is in fact a pretty funny one: it simply teleports the ogonek to Cyrillic, thus producing four characters that have never seen before in Cyrillic: <b>а̨</b>, <b>э̨</b>, <b>я̨</b> and <b>е̨</b> (the latter two representing <b>ją</b> and <b>ję</b> respectively). A funny solution indeed! And an unnecessary one to that, because Old Church Slavonic has precisely four Cyrillic characters for exactly these four sounds: <b>ѫ</b>, <b>ѧ</b>, <b>ѭ</b> and <b>ѩ</b>. True, they are uncommon, because the only living Slavic language that preserved these sounds is Polish, a language that happens to be written in Latin alphabet. But since these letters are around, why shouldn't we simply use them? After all, they exist, and are indefinitely more Cyrillic than Cyrillic letters with ogoneks beneath them. Besides, the choice for <b>а̨</b> and <b>я̨</b> is equally unlogical as the Polish letter <b>ą</b> itself, since it is pronounced as nasalised <b>o</b>; it is not for nothing that the Latin transcription of Old Church Slavonic uses <b>ǫ</b>.</p>

<p>Another specifically Polish letter is the <b>ó</b>, pronounced as [u] (its Czech equivalent is <b>ů</b>). The transcription mentioned above conveniently keeps it. But why would we? It has no pronunciation of its own; the only thing that distinguishes it from <b>u</b> is that it alternates with <b>o</b>. Incidentally, mixing up those two is the most common spelling mistake in Polish. As far as I am concerned, there is no reason to keep it. Since <i>miasto</i> alternates with <i>mieście</i> (and not with <i>miæście</i> or something), why can't <i>grud</i> alternate with <i>grodzie</i>? So let's be bold and use <b>у</b> instead.</p>

<p>The characters <b>ć</b> and <b>dź</b> could of course be rendered like Belarusian (and in a way, Polish) does, by using <b>ць</b> and <b>дзь</b>, but I'd much prefer <b>ть</b> and <b>дь</b>. Etymologically speaking, this is more correct; after all <b>ć/dź</b> are the softened equivalents of <b>t/d</b>, not of <b>c/dz</b>. Sequences like <b>ti</b> and <b>di</b> are rare in Polish and occur only in foreign words. In these rare cases, we could write <i>радио</i> and <i>тиара</i> (a Pole will know that they are to be read as <i>radio</i> and <i>tiara</i> and not like <i>radzio</i> or <i>ciara</i>). Or, if we want to be really sure that the <b>t</b> will not be softened in these cases, we could use the hard sign and write <i>радъио</i> and <i>тъиара</i>.<br>
Using <b>ть</b>/<b>дь</b> instead of <b>ць</b>/<b>дзь</b> has one more advantage: now at least will not have to worry about the sequence <b>cja</b>, which is unambiguously rendered as <b>ця</b>.</p>

<p>Same goes for the digraphy <b>rz</b>, which in Polish is pronounced like <b>ż</b>. Another common source of spelling errors. Yet, I wouldn't propose transcribing it to <b>ж</b>, for the same etymological reasons: <b>rz</b> comes from softened <b>r</b>, while <b>ż</b> comes from softened <b>g</b>. The fact that it sounds very different does not change that fact. Therefore, we simply use <b>рь</b> (and not this weird creation from the 19th century, <b>р̌</b>). Just like <b>ti</b> and <b>di</b>, <b>ri</b> is a rare sequence in Polish that occurs only in foreign words, so I propose the same solution for it as well.</p>

<p>And then we have the letter <b>e</b>. Because in Polish palatalising <b>e</b> is way more numerous than its non-palatalising equivalent, we will use Cyrillic <b>e</b> for the former (usually rendered as <b>je</b> or <b>ie</b>) and <b>э</b> for the latter. This is also what the 19th century version does.</p>

<p>The choice for other Cyrillic letters is merely a matter of picking an option. For example, how do we represent <b>i</b> and <b>y</b>? Do we follow the Russian model and pick <b>и/ы</b> or do we prefer the Ukrainian model and pick <b>і/и</b>? Both are possible, but I've decided to follow the Russian model. Also, when preceded by <b>cz</b>, <b>sz</b> or <b>ż</b> we write <b>и</b> instead of <b>ы</b> – just like Russian does. Again, a matter of etymology.</p>

<p>So, let's see now what Cyrylica Polska looks like.</p>

<a name="alphabet"><hr></a><h2>Alphabet</h2>

<p><big>C</big>yrylica Polska has 37 letters. Exactly the same as the 33 letters of the Russian alphabet, with four additional characters for the nasals:</p>

<p><p><b><span size="+1">А Б В Г Д Е Ë Ж З И Й К Л М Н О П Р С Т У Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ъ Ы Ь Э Ю Я Ѧ Ѫ Ѩ Ѭ</span></b></p></p>

<a name="vowels"><hr></a><h2>Vowels</h2>

<p><big>E</big>very vowel has a hardening and a softening version. Both can occur in two possitions: either it follows a consonant, or it doesn't (in that case it is either word-initial or after another vowel). In Polish orthography, when a softening vowel follows a consonant, it is preceded by <b>i</b>, unless the consonant in question is inherently soft. In other positions this vowel is preceded by <b>j</b>. The only exceptions are <b>i</b>, which is softening by definition, and <b>y</b>, which is never softening. <br>
Just like <b>i</b> and <b>y</b> form a pair, in Cyrillic all vowels come in pairs, as you can see in the table below:</p>

<p><table><colgroup><col><col><col><col>
</colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Latin</th><th colspan="2">Cyrylica</th></tr>
<tr><th> <i>hard</i> </th><th> <i>soft</i> </th><th> <i>hard</i> </th><th> <i>soft</i> </th></tr>
<tr><td>	a	</td><td>	ia/ja		</td><td>	а	</td><td>	я	</td></tr>
<tr><td>	e	</td><td>	ie/je		</td><td>	э	</td><td>	е	</td></tr>

<tr><td>	ą	</td><td>	ią/ją		</td><td>	ѫ	</td><td>	ѭ	</td></tr>
<tr><td>	ę	</td><td>	ię/ję		</td><td>	ѧ	</td><td>	ѩ	</td></tr>
</tbody></table></p>

<a name="consonants"><hr></a><h2>Consonants</h2>

<p><big>N</big>ow that the question of palatalised vs. non-palalalised consonant has been resolved by the vowels that follow them, the consonants have suddenly become very simple to handle. Here goes:</p>

</td></tr></tbody></table></p>

<p>A few notes:
</p><ul>
<li>Most consonants can be soft (palatalised) or hard. Whether a Cyrillic <b>д</b> should be read as <b>d</b> or <b>dź</b> is decided by the consonant that follows it: <b>дэ</b> should be read as <b>de</b>, <b>де</b> should be read as <b>dzie</b>.
</li><li>If a soft consonant is not followed by a vowel, i.e. when it is word- or syllable-final, it is followed by the soft sign: <b>bat</b> becomes <b>бат</b>, <b>bać</b> becomes <b>бать</b>.
</li><li>In reality, the soft sign will occur only after <b>т</b>, <b>д</b>, <b>н</b>, <b>л</b>, and <b>р</b>. However, in a few cases it can be placed after another consonant as well, although that wouldn't affect pronunciation. For example, take these two Polish cities: Kraków and Wrocław. When declined, the former has a hard <b>w</b>, the latter a soft <b>w</b>, and so their genitives are <i>Krakowa</i> and <i>Wrocławia</i> respectively. In Cyrillic, we could easily write <b>Вроцлавь</b> for "Wrocław", to make this fact predictable.
</li><li>Most consonant clusers as palatalised as a whole, and only in a few cases consonants in such a cluster are palatalised individually. Therefore, <b>śmiałość</b> is written <b>смялость</b>, and not <b>сьмялосьть</b>.
</li><li>The consonant clusters <b>śr</b> and <b>źr</b> (historically from <i>ser-/zer- &gt; srze-/zrze-</i>, in some dialects <i>st…</i></li></ul></div>

            <section>
            <div>
                <div><p>Last week I felt way more on edge than usual. There were new lockdown restrictions here in Austria due to COVID, the US elections kept me checking the news every few minutes and a terrorist attack shook up the country. My belly was tight and the world felt gray. Quickly, I felt preoccupied with so many things at once.</p>
<p>My experience is that when events like these happen, I can feel an urge to drop everything and somehow get involved and do things related to these events. Or to fall into apathy. Some of that feels good, yet often the intention it’s coming from is one of my underlying fear, anger, hatred, or sadness. I witness this in others often too. The more I reflect on this, the more it becomes clear to me that this is usually a dead-end. The more helpful way forward seems to be to attend to my emotions and state of being first, before I’m doing anything with it.</p>
<p>Hard, yet simple. Especially when so much is coming at us all at once.</p>
<h2>Being touched, but not led astray</h2>
<p>My friend Matthias told me recently on a hike through the forest, how he spent some time meditating on the terrorist attacks. His intention was to see the causes and conditions that led to it, casting a net as wide as possible. To me, this was a great example of letting ourselves be touched by current events, but not led astray. I would illustrate it like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ideas-8.jpg" alt="" width="2157" height="1668" srcset="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ideas-8.jpg 2157w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ideas-8-300x232.jpg 300w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ideas-8-1024x792.jpg 1024w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ideas-8-768x594.jpg 768w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ideas-8-1536x1188.jpg 1536w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ideas-8-2048x1584.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2157px) 100vw, 2157px"></p>
<p>The patterns I see the most and know well from myself, that I believe aren’t very helpful are two extreme reactions to current events:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>apathy or “I don’t care…”</strong>: I simply carry on with my life, pretending that nothing happened or ignoring any major current events that have shaken up the world. This tends to keep me focused, but also makes my work and attention kind of lifeless, apathetic, and overall feel disconnected from my own intentions and dreams.</li>
<li><strong>flooded or “OMG, drop everything &amp; let’s do something!”</strong>: Here I have such a strong reaction that I want to take to the streets immediately, express my anger, hurt, sadness, and pain in the hopes that it will improve the situation. I feel reactive and righteous that I’m doing something about the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that neither of these reactions helps us create the life and world that we ultimately want to see. And I think there’s a middle way, that uses the wisdom of both of these more extreme directions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Care</strong>: When there is a major external event after we’ve gotten to safety, whether it’s from disease, attack, or something else, we first need care. By care, I mean our ability to tend to the emotional and inner states that have been evoked from the event. Tending to our anger, hurt, pain, feeling our sadness, tears, and frustration. This can take some time and the more support we have to feel through these elements of life, the more enjoyable this part can be for us.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with the life you want</strong>: Once the big emotions have settled, we can turn our attention to integration and meaning-making. What does it mean that we have experienced this? How does this connect with our bigger intention of living the life we want? An example from my own life is that through plenty of reflection on the coronavirus crisis and the amount of physical distancing and disconnection has birthed a new idea of a product to help us reconnect in a meaningful way, even when we’re not in the same room together. I’ve deeply enjoyed working on this the last weeks, it doesn’t feel reactive, yet it seems to be aligned with what is happening in the wider world and my dream of creating more presence and aliveness for myself and the people I meet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Letting the urgency illusion pass and acting with power</h2>
<p>As the urgency illusion passes, there comes a window for all of us where we can be present to what happened and at the same time have enough space inside for ourselves and our dreams. This is the sweet spot, where we can make useful sense of ourselves and the world around us.</p>
<p>If you’re stuck along the journey towards integration right now, here’re some questions that you might find helpful to journal with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Care-questions</strong>: What needs to be tended to on the inside? How are you doing? What level of care would support you the most right now?</li>
<li><strong>Integration-questions</strong>: What are the 3 most important values for you to live into in this life? Where is the overlap between those and what happened in the world? How can you move forward in integrity with what happened, without throwing everything overboard?</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, see which actions naturally arise for you as you give yourself space and time to let everything integrate.</p>
<p>Whatever you’re going through, keep going, sending love and care your way!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>The COVID-19 crisis, while disrupting the global world unlike anything before, has opened up an unexpected window to remote work. Nearly all major<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>tech<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> giants<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> have<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> allowed their workers to do home office. Many people are considering this as a sign of the advent of <strong>Work 2.0</strong>, where physical offices spaces will be irrelevant, and people can work from their cozy dens. There are however significant challenges in adoption of generalized remote work and things will be back as usual once the COVID-19 ends.</p>
<p>The <strong>challenges surrounding remote work outweigh it’s promises</strong>. Not every company is a FAANG, and companies will struggle to transition given their limited resources.</p>
<h2 id="regulations">Regulations</h2>
<p>The most significant hurdle in hiring a global remote team is <strong>regulation</strong>. Labor regulations are wildly different amongst countries, and could be cumbersome for some companies. Some major hurdles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Payroll taxes</strong>, retirement bonuses: Germany has rentenversicherung, sozialversicherung whereas USA has 401k contributions. Can a German company afford to <strong>setup payroll</strong> taxes for a remote workers hired from India, Chile or US? Or will it lead to worker abuse through <strong>laissez-faire abuse</strong> through freelance contracts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notice periods</strong>: Europeans (on average) have 3 months notice period while US Americans have 2 weeks. How would a US company deal with it? On top of that, several countries have <strong>protection against unlawful termination</strong>, and how can a Slovakian employee avail that benefit against a German company?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP protection</strong>: It’s hard to <strong>protect IP</strong> if employees are not in the same jurisdiction. A company operation from Czechia would find it hard to settle trade disputes with a remote worker from South Africa. Another example is of <strong>TISAX compliance</strong> that is required for specialized hardware projects for Automotive industries. Remote work fails to make a dent in this situation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hardware-cant-remote">Hardware can’t remote</h2>
<p>Patio11’s law<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> states that the <strong>economy is much bigger than you think</strong>. There are companies which have widely different business models and they often have a hardware related product. My <a href="https://www.salonlab-server.de/en-GB/">current project</a> is an IoT device that talks to an iPad app. The <strong>hardware team</strong> needs <strong>specialized tools</strong> to work on the IoT device, and these tools can’t be moved to home office. Remote work is a strict no-no for such products.</p>
<h2 id="swim-against-the-tide">Swim against the tide</h2>
<p>The biggest hurdle employees face in remote/home offices is <strong>lack of focus and direction</strong>. Humans have evolved over thousands of years to collaborate based on interpersonal cues, and a video call simply does not have the same effect. Humans need <strong>feedback</strong> and <strong>constructive communication</strong> whereas isolation kills the spirit. People who are new to remote work often feel <strong>rudderless</strong> because <strong>self discipline is hard</strong> when there’s no structure. I’m doing remote work on-and-off since 2018, and it took me a lot of discipline to get productive. The simple fact is that remote work is not natural, and not suited for all work streams in a typical company. Add to it the fact that many <strong>families</strong> simply don’t have space to work from home, and on top of that there might be kids around.</p>
<p>Remote work might be one of the few positive outcomes of the COVID-19 crisis but unless we tend to it carefully, we’ll end up creating a unhappy and unproductive workspace.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div><p>In this guide we're going to take a look at how we can use cheap and "low end" hardware to build an amazing OpenBSD router with firewalling capabilities, segmented local area networks, DNS with domain blocking, DHCP and more.</p><p>We will use a setup in which the router segments the local area network (LAN) into three separate networks, one for the grown-ups in the house, one for the children, and one for public facing servers, such as a private web server or mail server. We will also look at how we can use DNS to block out ads, porn, and other websites on the Internet. The OpenBSD router can also be used on small to mid-size offices.</p></div>

<h2 id="why-a-firewall">Why a firewall?</h2>
<p>Almost no matter how you connect to the Internet from your home or office, you need a real firewall between you and the modem or router that your ISP has provided you with.</p>
<p>Very rarely do consumer-grade modems or routers get firmware updates and they are often vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_router#Security">network attacks</a> that turns these devices into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet">botnets</a>, such like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)">Mirai malware</a>. Many consumer-grade modems and routers is to blame for some of the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_denial_of_service_attack">distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks</a>.</p>
<p>A firewall between you and your ISP modem or router cannot protect your modem or router device against attacks, but it can protect your computers and devices on the inside of the network, and it can help you monitor and control the traffic that comes and goes to and from your local network.</p>
<p>Without a firewall between your local network and the ISP modem or router you could basically consider this an open door policy, like leaving the door to your house wide open, because you cannot trust the equipment from your ISP.</p>
<p>It is always a really good idea to put a real firewall between your local network and the Internet, and with OpenBSD you get an very solid solution.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>Currently this guide only deals with IPv4 as most people still don't use IPv6 and many ISPs also still only use IPv4, but IPv6 is planned for a future update of the guide.</p>

<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>You don't have to buy expensive hardware to get an effective router and firewall for your house or office. Even with cheap and "low end" hardware you can get a very solid solution.</p>
<p>I have build multiple solutions with the <a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Q1900DC-ITX/">ASRock Q1900DC-ITX</a> motherboard that comes with an Intel Quad-Core Celeron processor.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/img/asrock-q1900dc-itx.png" alt="ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard"></p>
<p>I'll admit, it's a pretty "crappy" motherboard, but it gets the job done and I have several builds that have run very solid for many years on gigabit networks with full saturation and the firewall, DNS, etc. working "overtime" and the CPU hardly breaks a sweat.</p>
<p>The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard has the advantage that it comes with a DC-In Jack that is compatible with a 9~19V power adapter, making it very power saving. Unfortunatly the ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard is no longer made, but I'm just using it as an example, I have used several other cheap boards as well.</p>
<p>I have also used the ASRock Q1900-ITX (it doesn't come with the DC-In Jack) combined with a PicoPSU.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/img/picopsu.png" alt="PicoPSU power supply"></p>
<p>You can find different brands and versions of the PicoPSU, some are better quality than others. I have two different brands, the original and a cheaper knockoff, both performs very well and they save quite a bit of power contrary to running with a normal power supply.</p>
<p>Last, I am using a cheap Intel knockoff quad port NIC found on Ebay like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/img/intel-quad-nic.png" alt="Intel Quad NIC"></p>
<p>I know it is better to use quality hardware, especially on a network that you care about, but this tutorial is about how you can get away with using fairly cheep hardware and still get an extremely useful product that will continue to serve you well for many years - at least that is my experience.</p>
<p>I recommend that you look for a low power mini ITX board with hardware <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html">supported by OpenBSD</a>, such as an Intel Celeron or Intel i3 processor. These boards are typically cheap, less power hungry, and they don't take up much space. I don't recommend using the Intel Atom CPU if you have a gigabit network as they usually choke because they can't handle the amount of traffic, but your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>You might also need a couple of cheap gigabit switches for the segmented local network, at least if you have more than one computer you want to connect to the same LAN :)</p>

<h2 id="why-openbsd">Why OpenBSD?</h2>
<p>In truth, you can get a similar setup with one of the other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BSD_operating_systems">BSD flavors</a> or one of the many different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">Linux distribution</a>, but <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> is specifically very well suited and designed for this kind of task. Not only does it come with all the needed software in the base install, but it also has significantly better security and tons of improved mitigations already build-in into the operating system. I <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/openbsd-is-fantastic.html">highly recommend</a> OpenBSD over any other operating system for this kind of task.</p>
<p>This guide is not going to show you how to install OpenBSD. If you haven't done that before I recommend you spin up some kind of virtual machine or see if you have some unused and supported hardware laying around you can play with. OpenBSD is one of the easiest and quickest operating systems to install. Don't be afraid of the non-gui approach, once you have tried it you will really appreciate the simplicity. Use the default settings when in doubt.</p>
<p>Before you endeavor on this journey make sure to reference the OpenBSD documentation! Not only is everything very well documented, but you will most likely find all the answers you need right there. Read the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/index.html">OpenBSD FAQ</a> and take a look at the different <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/">manual pages</a> for the software we're going to use.</p>
<p>Another really useful place to find general information about OpenBSD is the <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc">OpenBSD mailing list archives</a>. Also make sure to stay up to date with relevant information by subscribing to the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/mail.html">Announcements and security advisories</a> mailing list.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, please consider <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/donations.html">supporting OpenBSD</a>! Even if you don't use OpenBSD on a daily basis, but perhaps make use of <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> on Linux, then you're really using software from the OpenBSD project. Consider making a small, but steady donation to support the further development of all the great software the OpenBSD developers make!</p>

<h2 id="the-network">The network</h2>
<p>A router is basically a device that regulate network traffic between two or more separate networks. The router will ensure that network traffic intended for the local network doesn't run out into the wild on the Internet, and traffic on the Internet, that is not intended for your local network, stays on the Internet.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>A router is sometimes also referred to as a gateway, which generally is alright, but in truth a real gateway joins dissimilar systems, while a router joins similar networks. An example of a gateway would be a device that joins a PC network with a telecommunications network.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we're building a router and we have 4 networks of the same type to work with. One is the Internet and the other three are the internally segmented local area networks (LANs). Some people prefer to work with virtual LANs, but in this tutorial we're going to use the quad port NIC from the illustration above. You can achieve the same result by using multiple one port NICs if you prefer that, you just have to make sure that you have enough room and free PCI slots on the motherboard. You can also use the Ethernet port on the motherboard itself, but it depends on the driver and support for the device. I have had no problems using the Realtek PCI gigabit Ethernet controller that normally comes with many motherboards even though I recommend Intel over Realtek.</p>
<p>Of course you don't have to segment the network into several parts if you don't need that, and it will be very easy to change the settings from this guide, but I have decided to use this approach in order to show you how you can protect your children by segmenting their network into a separate LAN that not only gets ad and porn blocking using DNS blocking (all the segments gets that), but you can even whitelist the parts of the Internet you want them to have access to. The last part about whitelisting is difficult and generally not recommended unless your children requires only very limited access, but it is doable with some work, and the guide is going to show you one way you can do that.</p>
<p>This is an illustration of the network we're going to setup:</p>

After discussion with the FDA, the companies recently elected to drop the 32-case interim analysis and conduct the first interim analysis at a minimum of 62 cases. Upon the conclusion of those discussions, the evaluable case count reached 94 and the DMC performed its first analysis on all cases. </p>  <p>The case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates a vaccine efficacy rate above 90%, at seven days after the second dose. This means that protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the vaccination, which consists of a 2-dose schedule. As the study continues, the final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. The DMC has not reported any serious safety concerns and recommends that the study continues to collect additional safety and efficacy data as planned. The data will be discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide. </p>  <p>“Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial&nbsp;evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19,” said <strong>Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO.</strong> “We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen. With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis. We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks.”</p>  <p>“I want to thank the thousands of people who volunteered to participate in the clinical trial, our academic collaborators and investigators at the study sites, and our colleagues and collaborators around the world who are dedicating their time to this crucial endeavor,” added <strong>Bourla.</strong> “We could not have come this far without the tremendous commitment of everyone involved.”</p>  <p>“The first interim analysis of our global Phase 3 study provides evidence that a vaccine may effectively prevent COVID-19. This is a victory for innovation, science and a global collaborative effort,” said <strong>Prof. Ugur Sahin, BioNTech Co-founder and CEO.</strong> “When we embarked on this journey 10 months ago this is what we aspired to achieve. Especially today, while we are all in the midst of a second wave and many of us in lockdown, we appreciate even more how important this milestone is on our path towards ending this pandemic and for all of us to regain a sense of normality. We will continue to collect further data as the trial continues to enroll for a final analysis planned when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to make this important achievement possible.”</p>  <p>The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27 and has enrolled 43,538 participants to date, 38,955 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 8, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The trial is continuing to enroll and is expected to continue through the final analysis when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the primary efficacy endpoints evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accruing from seven days after the second dose, the final analysis now will include, with the approval of the FDA, new secondary endpoints evaluating efficacy based on cases accruing 14 days after the second dose as well. The companies believe that the addition of these secondary endpoints will help align data across all COVID-19 vaccine studies and allow for cross-trial learnings and comparisons between these novel vaccine platforms. The companies have posted an updated version of the study protocol at <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bE4RvEXc3amHdJ0LinFQkPyUCRxShL94rKlQWnVIuOebbWs0t_t1F1qSmc0deSfk8TsQTmqiZHqgYUA4_HoIG8cgZ-MTBQVX5ZbQ89L9eImlSxNuQzgmZ36Fp4CVqIu8sjS4aT-HPEktSLWmEhtRsQ==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus</u></a>. </p>  <p>Pfizer and BioNTech are continuing to accumulate safety data and currently estimate that a median of two months of safety data following the second (and final) dose of the vaccine candidate – the amount of safety data specified by the FDA in its guidance for potential Emergency Use Authorization – will be available by the third week of November. Additionally, participants will continue to be monitored for long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose.</p>  <p>Along with the efficacy data generated from the clinical trial, Pfizer and BioNTech are working to prepare the necessary safety and manufacturing data to submit to the FDA to demonstrate the safety and quality of the vaccine product produced. Based on supply projections, we expect to supply globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and manufacture up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-review publication.</p>  <p><strong>About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ Lives</strong></p>  <p>At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

It works by identifying key themes \u2014 or topics \u2014 based on the words or phrases in the data that have a similar meaning. Its versatility and ease-of-use have led to a variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"3772\"&gt;Be&lt;span id=\"rmm\"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;ng a form of unsupervised learning, topic modeling is useful when annotated or labeled data isn\u2019t available. This is helpful, as the majority of emerging text data isn\u2019t labeled, and labeling is time-consuming and expensive to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"030c\"&gt;For an easy-to-follow, intuitive explanation of topic modeling and its applications, see &lt;a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://highdemandskills.com/topic-modeling-intuitive/\"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"fb4a\"&gt;One of the shortcomings of topic modeling is that there\u2019s no guidance about the quality of topics produced. If you want to learn about how meaningful the topics are, you\u2019ll need to evaluate the topic model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"b937\"&gt;In this article, we\u2019ll look at topic model evaluation, what it is and how to do it. It\u2019s an important part of the topic modeling process that sometimes gets overlooked. For a topic model to be truly useful, some sort of evaluation is needed to understand how relevant the topics are for the purpose of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"b85d\"&gt;Topic model evaluation is the process of assessing how well a topic model does what it is designed for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"44ee\"&gt;When you run a topic model, you usually do it with a specific purpose in mind. It may be for document classification, to explore a set of unstructured texts, or some other analysis. As with any model, if you wish to know how effective it is at doing what it\u2019s designed for, you\u2019ll need to evaluate it. This is why topic model evaluation matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"e9c9\"&gt;Evaluating a topic model can help you decide if the model has captured the internal structure of a corpus (a collection of text documents). This can be particularly useful in tasks like e-discovery, where the effectiveness of a topic model can have implications for legal proceedings or other important matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"a51a\"&gt;More generally, topic model evaluation can help you answer questions like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id=\"b7ef\"&gt;Are the identified topics understandable?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=\"1d2d\"&gt;Are the topics coherent?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=\"325e\"&gt;Does the topic model serve the purpose it is being used for?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=\"da03\"&gt;Without some form of evaluation, you won\u2019t know how well your topic model is performing or if it\u2019s being used properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"c559\"&gt;Evaluating a topic model isn\u2019t always easy, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"3adc\"&gt;If a topic model is used for a measurable task, such as classification, then its effectiveness is relatively straightforward to calculate (eg. measure the proportion of successful classifications). But if the model is used for a more qualitative task, such as exploring the semantic themes in an unstructured corpus, then evaluation is more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"ff58\"&gt;In this article, we\u2019ll focus on evaluating topic models that do not have clearly measurable outcomes. These include topic models used for document exploration, content recommendation and e-discovery, amongst other use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=\"dc38\"&gt;E…</code></pre></div></div></div>

      <p>What we value is foundational to how we approach our lives, how we prioritise our time, and how we interact with one another. In society, in companies, in communities like families and friendship groups.</p>

<p>Our values already exist: in every group, there’s a set of shared or overlapping values. Perhaps you value being demonstratively affectionate to one another: your group chat is likely kind words, animal gifs, wishing each other luck and good vibes on stressful days, or arranging karaoke dates so you can sweetly serenade one another. Maybe you value learning, and that manifests through book recommendations, DMing each other links to thought-provoking articles, attending salons and watching documentaries together.</p>

<p>Often these values shift as the group changes, and as you change the group that you’re in. I find myself leaning harder into some of my values with a particular group of friends, and a different set with my family or my coworkers.</p>

<p>In companies, it’s fundamental that we’re able to talk coherently about what we value, especially if we want to preserve some of this sense of belonging as we scale. Culture is the manifestation of values, it’s the glue that binds us; to reinforce and steer this, we need to have a clear, shared understanding of what’s important to us all in how we work together.</p>

<p>A company’s mission, or a team’s mission, establishes what problem space is addressed; values and culture become the <em>how</em> underlying the business strategy to achieve the company’s mission.</p>

<p>I think it’s really interesting to observe the language that we use when talking about company values. People refer to “the right behaviours” or being a “good” employee. We’ve borrowed the language of ethics - and I don’t think this is a coincidence at all.</p>

<p>In fact, there are three frameworks in ethics that have striking parallels to how we set out what’s good or right in a company or business. One of these lends itself exceptionally well to framing company values.</p>



<p>Before we dive into my weird Good-Place-esque rundown of metaethics as applied to companies, I want to explore a little bit what makes a good set of values.</p>

<p>There’s a trope that every startup should have five pithy values that can be neatly painted onto the wall (and then a couple of pages explaining what each of them actually means!). And that is often the endpoint - something polished by a copywriter that gets thrown onto t-shirts or notebooks or painted on a wall back when a physical office felt important.</p>

<p>But often we miss a step. We get the polished pithy phrases, but don’t draw them from the right place. This process of understanding and surfacing what your team values has to be <em>descriptive</em>. It’s a weird, difficult, fun, generative, iterative journey of discovery. You’ll find the intrinsic qualities that you deem valuable in the people you all want to work with (smart, considerate), and the extrinsic qualities that you value in how you interact with one another (straightforward, open to early feedback).</p>

<p>This discovery process is so important to building a healthy and meaningful company culture. Values are so, so important - they’re what the culture is built on, they’re what bring us joy and meaning every day. But we dismiss them because so often they do end up just being a set of catchy but empty phrases painted on a wall.</p>

<p>I have two examples of pithy phrases masquerading as values which just aren’t useful:</p>

<p><em>Get shit done.</em>
This one baffles me because it provides no direction. What shit should I be getting done? What’s the best way to get it done? At what point is my shit done enough? Especially in the context of a company, where I get paid to do a job - my side of the employment contract is about getting shit done! You can tell me to value doing shit as much as you like, but this adds zero value when you consider that, contractually, as soon as I stop getting shit done, you’ll stop paying me!</p>

<p><em>Don’t be evil.</em>
I have a bunch of issues with this as a thing to value. Firstly, how are we defining evil? Secondly, can I do evil without being evil? What if it’s unintentional? Thirdly, is not being evil enough, or should I strive to be good? And if so, what is good? I used to say “be good, have fun” when I dropped my kid off at school in the mornings, but I’ve switched to “have fun, learn something” because it feels more directionally useful. I think “be good” sometimes reads as “don’t get told off”, and I’ve definitely been told off for doing what was right.</p>

<p>Honestly compared to these, if you’re going to paint something on your wall, I’d actually favour “live, laugh, love”. It’s more like a useful value statement than either of these - it’s clear that love and laughter are states to optimise for, which can at least guide the behaviours we choose. Tell me to “live, laugh, love” and my constraints are tighter than “don’t be evil”. Plus there’s already a bunch of wall decals on etsy!</p>



<p>Our values affect how we go about achieving things and interacting with others. They capture the quirks, traits and essences of the things that make your company and your community who they are.  For me, useful values have two properties: they are opinionated, and they guide behaviour.</p>

<p>The things that <em>you in particular</em> value have to take a perspective and a point of view. And it needs to be a meaningful point of view - where you can envisage a world where many very reasonable people take a conflicting point of view.</p>

<p>You know you have pinpointed genuinely useful values if you can use them to make decisions about what you do and how you do it. Particularly in high stress or difficult situations: for instance, how you approach interpersonal conflict or even conflicting priorities.</p>

<p>Both “don’t be evil” and “get shit done” fail on both counts - I can’t imagine anyone pasting the opposite on an office wall, and I can’t imagine solving a problem by using either. They are about as generic as you can be. Likewise “integrity” is not especially meaningful as a value; what would it mean to be a reasonable person who holds a value that’s contradictory to that?</p>

<p>“Move fast”, on the other hand, is absolutely meaningful. Depending on the context, you could choose to move fast; to be cautious; to take thoughtful and deliberate action; to prioritise perfection over speed. “Build to last” would take an opposing point of view, but be meaningful - as would “excellence always”. None of these three stances are objectively better than the others, which is great! Pick one and you now have a value that not only takes a perspective, but also influences how you work.</p>



<p>Our values delineate what we encourage and praise, and what is frowned upon or even punished. They set out what is right and what is wrong within the company. Values layer over the top of the ethical and moral norms of the society where you operate - like, the laws and regulatory principles and business governance.</p>

<p>When we internalise values as a sort of ethical system, it makes a lot of sense to adopt an ethics framework in order to establish how we want to think about values. Ethical <em>systems</em> concern themselves less with what specific acts are moral or immoral, and more with how we systematically determine this. So I want to focus less on what specific things we value, and more on how we frame values.</p>

<p>I’ll briefly outline three approaches to ethics from the western philosophical canon, and how the combination of the three gives us a strong framework for thinking about right and wrong in a company.</p>

<h2 id="categorical-imperatives-and-the-law">Categorical imperatives and the law</h2>

<p>One approach to ethics is through the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/#CatHypImp">categorical imperative</a>: ethics should be a system of commands which are always, unconditionally, universally the correct and right way to act.</p>

<p><em>“Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.”</em> Judaism and Christianity’s Ten Commandments take the form of categorical imperatives.</p>

<p>There are no exceptions to the imperative. If, as a collective, we set out that lying is wrong, then it is not ever permissible for anyone to lie. This is super clear cut, which appeals to those who like simplicity! But humans are messy. The workplace is ambiguous, the decisions we make in our jobs are nuanced. There are a lot of behaviours that are context-dependent, or require a trade-off. So the universal commandment approach can’t capture the delightful quirks of one company over another - they are adopted by everyone.</p>

<p>But there is something useful in considering this approach. Let’s assume that there is a subset of actions which are either good or bad, based on whether everyone should do it, or everyone should not do it. In a company context, this approach is really useful in two places: the first is laws, regulation and governance. For example, it is never acceptable to commit fraud. The second is process and policies. For example, in our company, it is never acceptable to bully or harass others.</p>

<p>I referenced “don’t be evil” earlier, and for me that falls into the categorical imperative category, as does “only hire the best”. But there’s a whole layer of nuance beneath these that we need to unpick to determine what they mean within a particular company - “the best” is subjective, we characterise it through traits that we deem valuable, and those just won’t apply to everyone.</p>

<h2 id="utilitarianism-and-stakeholder-benefit">Utilitarianism and stakeholder benefit</h2>

<p><em>“It is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong.”</em></p>

<p>A second approach to ethics is <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bentham/#PaiPle">utilitarianism</a> - where an act is good based entirely on its <em>consequences</em> and which way they swing happiness. In the context of a company, the clearest parallel is where a lot of what you do - the goals you set - optimise for stakeholder benefit (which includes profit and user happiness).</p>

<p>One of the difficulties with utilitarianism is that it is entirely based on consequences, intention has no role to play at all. This theory of ethics would judge someone’s actions good if …</p></div></div>

<p>Almost everything in the web is sent with <strong>http</strong> and even non-developers have seen it when using the internet as keyword
inside urls or links.</p>
<p>Http stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> and gives us the ability to transfer hypertext between a browser and a server.
This is a great technology that has been around almost since the invention of the web and is constantly evolving and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">offering more and more great features</a></p>

<p>As a developer you probably heard of http headers, at least in the moment you heard about the CORS policy.
This is a problem you must have heard about when developing websites.
But what exactly are http headers and what other ways are there to use them?</p>
<p>Let us first find out what they do and how you could use them. </p>
<p>When a browser requests a resource, for example a page of this blog, it asks the server with a request.
This request looks something like this: </p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://www.lorenzweiss.de/race_conditions_explained/"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  credentials<span>:</span> <span>"include"</span><span>,</span>
  headers<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    accept<span>:</span>
      <span>"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"accept-language"</span><span>:</span> <span>"en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"cache-control"</span><span>:</span> <span>"max-age=0"</span><span>,</span>

<p>So you can see the URL or location of the resource, some information about the request and also a lot of headers with some information about the request.
This is how your browser tells the server some more information about the request. For example what kind of data type it accepts or
how the client is handling the cache.</p>
<p>After sending the request, the server replies, and it also sets some headers in the reply, which could look like this: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>:authority: www.lorenzweiss.de
:method: GET
:path: /race_conditions_explained/
:scheme: https
accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br
accept-language: en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7
cache-control: max-age=0

sec-fetch-site: same-origin

upgrade-insecure-requests: 1
user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.70 Safari/537.36</code></pre></div>
<p>There is also some information that the server wants to tell the browser what to do with the resource, for example
if there are cookies, it must be determined which encoding was used, etc</p>
<p>Basically, in the http-context the headers for the communication of the browser and the server are used to extend the simple
Requests for resources. You could see it as the sheet of paper that is added on top of a package that you oder from an online store,
giving you more information about the context and the resource that you ordered.
Most of the headers have quite good defaults which you don't need to think of, but there are some headers that
can get quite important, like CORS headers. But there are so much more headers that you might never heard of which are very useful
and good to know how to use. </p>

<p>Do not worry, this article will not deal with CORS headers. The following http headers are those that are rarely used, but
can be really powerful and helpful to significantly improve the communication between a server and the browser. </p>
<p>So let's dig into it. Here are some headers that you can set and that are very useful and practical.</p>
<h2 id="if-range"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Range">If-Range</a><a href="#if-range" aria-label="if range permalink"></a></h2>
<h3>What and why?</h3>
<p>Imagine you start downloading a large resource, such as a video, an image, etc., and stop in between because of connection problems.
With <code>If-Range</code> you can tell the server if the representation is unchanged, to send the part(s) that are requested in Range.
Which means only the parts that were missing and not again the whole thing.</p>
<p>This can be very helpful when dealing with large resources and often bad connections as with mobile devices.
Because the resource can be downloaded in parts even if the connection is interrupted in between. </p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>It can either be used with a date when the resources were last modified, or with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</a>, which is a key to help if the resources was invalidated</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: &lt;day-name&gt;, &lt;day&gt; &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;hour&gt;:&lt;minute&gt;:&lt;second&gt; GMT
If-Range: &lt;etag&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h4>Example</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT </code></pre></div>
<h2 id="vary"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary">Vary</a><a href="#vary" aria-label="vary permalink"></a></h2>
<p><code>Vary</code> Comes from a time when the web or http was used for a variety of things and not just for web pages.<br>
It is based on the idea of using http to exchange information in many different formats.
How does it do that? Well, it tells the server in which header to find the information, how to present the information. </p>
<p>Nowadays it can be really helpful if you have different resources for different customers, for example
mobile, tablet or desktop.
Imagine three different images for the same resource are stored on the server, depending on the device.
Then you can simply use the <code>Vary</code> header to tell the server to check the device and then decide which image size to send. </p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>For the example with the device dependent images, you can simply pass the 'user agent' to tell the server
that it should check the user-agent for device information. </p>

<h4>How to use</h4>

<p>Just enter the header, the server must check before deciding which resource to send.</p>
<h2 id="content-disposition"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition">Content-Disposition</a><a href="#content-disposition" aria-label="content disposition permalink"></a></h2>
<p>If we go back to the example of a request to a server, for example to load this website, it is clear to the browser,
that it must <strong>display</strong> the resource of the answer.
But it can also be the case that the server sends a resource that the browser should automatically download to the user's computer,
like a picture or pdf etc.
A server can tell the browser what the browser should do with the attached resource via the <code>Content Disposition</code> header.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>With defining the <code>Content-disposition</code> to <code>attachment</code> the browser knows that this is a resource to download instead of just
show. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="data.pdf"</code></pre></div>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>You can define the header as <code>inline</code> or <code>attachment</code>, where `inline is always the default.  </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: &lt;inline | attachment&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="feature-policy"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy">Feature-Policy</a><a href="#feature-policy" aria-label="feature policy permalink"></a></h2>
<p>This is a fairly new header and therefore only supported by modern browsers (sorry to all IE users). However
I want to mention this anyway because I think it can be really helpful for some use cases.<br>
Basically, the <code>feature-policy tells the browser which features or apis the browser should provide to the document and its</code>iframes` to be used. </p>
<p>For example, it can ban all scripts or iframes etc. within this website to allow sensitive apis like the camera or microphone.</p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: &lt;directive&gt; &lt;allowlist&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>directive</code> is the name of the feature. You can see the full <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy#Directives">list of features here</a>
The <code>allowlist</code> defines the origins which are allowed to use the directive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose we want our website to use neither the microphone nor the camera. With this header the
document or a contained iframe cannot access these functions.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: microphone 'none'; camera 'none'</code></pre></div>
<h3>More Headers:</h3>
<p>Here are some more headers that are worth mentioning: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade-Insecure-Requests">Upgrade-Insecure-Requests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Age">Age</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Trailer">Trailer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">Location</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Https headers are great and also very useful! But sometimes they can be quite complex, and it's really hard to get an overview of what headers are available and what benefits they bring.
Also when developing a website, especially in the frontend, you don't come in contact with them too often, except maybe with the CORS headers.
But I think that this missed some possibilities. http headers represent the communication between the server and the
customers much better, and we all know that communication is the key to a good relationship.</p>
<p>I hope I could shed some light on the darkness of http headers for you. In case I missed a good and helpful header,
please do not hesitate to send me a mail or contact me in any way.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-10b1bd0a="" data-v-2ae295f5=""><p><em>Rust, not related to the video game also called Rust, is a promising systems programming language with novel features ideally suited for game development. Exposure and awareness within the game developer community, however, remains limited. In this post, I provide a gentle introduction to Rust and attempt to justify its place on your radar.</em></p>
<h2 id="a-short-history-lesson">A Short History Lesson</h2>
<p>What is Rust, and where did it come from? In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiWkMFE8uRE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this fantastic talk</a>, James Munns gives us a detailed oral history. Way back around 2010, Mozilla was frustrated by the state of development in Firefox, a massive software project  written mostly in C++. Despite best practices and an abundance of engineering talent, writing high-performance, parallelised, and memory-safe code, at that scale of complexity, remained fraught and error-prone.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, this predates the advent of C++11 (aka the 2011 edition) which heralded efforts to somewhat modernise the language. Even so, manual memory manipulation is easy to get wrong, and <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/18/we-need-a-safer-systems-programming-language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">research</a> from <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">multiple vendors</a> describes this category of error as responsible for 70% of security vulnerabilities. </p>
<p>Into this context steps Graydon Hoare, a Mozilla employee, introducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)#History" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a potential solution</a> to the roadblock: Rust, the hobby language he'd been tinkering with since 2006. In 2012, Mozilla would formally announce Servo, an experimental research project to re-imagine a browser engine built with memory safety and concurrency as first principles. And alongside it, Rust, the companion language to make it all possible.</p>
<p>These early days of Rust are described as a Cambrian explosion of ideas and wild experimentation. Concepts were liberally stolen from other languages, from C++ to OCaml, Haskell, Erlang, ML, C#, Ruby and more, reflecting the diverse pool of engineers working on the language at the time. Still, most in the industry, while admiring the optimism in taking such an ambitious moon shot, <a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2018/09/18/falling-in-love-with-rust/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">remained pessimistic</a> about the prospects of success. </p>
<p>2015 saw a major milestone, with the release of Rust v1.0. Perhaps as significant as the feature list, was the number of failed experiments left behind on the cutting room floor, the team unafraid to pare down the language to its quintessential elements. This was also the first time stability guarantees would be offered, a quality notoriously absent before. </p>
<p>Soon after, in 2016, Firefox <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/07/shipping-rust-in-firefox/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shipped its first production Rust code</a>. The industry and community started to take notice, and Rust began its impressive, and as yet unbroken, <del>four</del> <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">five year streak</a> as Stack Overflow's most beloved language. [<em>Thank you James Munns for pointing out it's now actually five years</em>]. </p>
<p>Right from the outset, Rust set out with a clear focus on   building an inclusive community. They, in turn, have contributed to Rust's impressive technical aptitude, but have also fostered a sense of reverence and fondness not often witnessed in other languages. Are they crazy zealots or onto something?</p>
<h2 id="why-rust">Why Rust?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The performance of C++ with the convenience of C#</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the first time Rust hijacked my attention. C++ enjoys a long-standing ubiquity, in part, due to its ability to express zero cost abstractions. As explained by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What you don't use, you don't pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn't hand code any better.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's easy to spot the relevancy to games. Making frame-rate while simulating entire worlds is a daunting performance challenge. Indeed, C++ underpins the bulk of game engines. There simply is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltCgzYcpFUI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">no other industrial language</a> that offers the same speed and low-level control, whilst writing programs in the large. </p>
<p>C++, however, suffers from the weight of its legacy. The accumulation of features over 40 years makes for a complex and intricate language. In the last decade modernisation of the standard has done well to uplift it from its C roots, but the experienced programmer must build up an arcane lore of which features are blessed, and which machinery is dangerous. As Stroustrup again describes:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes the language daunting and difficult to approach for beginners. In <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this blog post</a>, Rust contributor <em>withoutboats</em> defines an import quality about abstraction:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A zero cost abstraction, like all abstractions, must actually offer a better experience than the alternative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, of course, C++ offers a better time than your own hand wrought assembly. However, this is making the subtle point that it's competing against a secondary force: a more expensive abstraction that justifies its cost by being more comfortable and convenient.</p>
<p>We see this writ large in the rise of popular game engines that eschew the complexity of C++, the most notable being Unity. End users write code in C#, a more forgiving and ergonomic language, creating a boon in developer productivity and a reduction in iteration time.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-10-Unity-Interest.png" title="Unity interest over time in search trends"></p>
<p>In large codebases though, near the edge of the performance envelope, this trade-off begins to bite. The garbage collector eliminates an entire category of errors by removing responsibility for memory management from the end-user. However as its workload grows, so do periodic performance spikes antithetical to smooth gameplay.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-11-GC-spikes.png" title="Unity interest over time in search trends"></p>
<p>The experienced developer can still create a performant experience, however, this demands plugging the leaks in the abstraction. They must build a mental model of the machinery behind the curtain, a collection of arcane wisdom that bans many of the original conveniences, lest they disturb the garbage collector. </p>
<p>So development teams face a choice. Better resourced AAA studios generally choose Unreal or in-house engine tech built on C++, able to absorb the overhead for long term gain. Less resourced studios optimise for time to market, choosing Unity, or one of the many other accessible game making tools (Godot, Haxe, Game Maker, etc.). They often postpone performance concerns until after business eligibility is secured.   </p>
<p>Rust, however, for the first time, promises a third way. A world where it's possible to write zero cost abstractions without sacrificing higher-order elegance. </p>
<h3 id="ownership-based-memory">Ownership based memory</h3>
<p>To understand Rust's special sauce, we're going have to talk about ownership and how it handles memory. This is only a simple sketch, but <a href="http://intorust.com/tutorial/ownership/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">in-depth resources</a> exist for the curious. </p>
<p>Writing optimised code is often about taking the way we, as humans, naturally think of an idea or algorithm, and instead expressing it in terms that favour the computer. This act often harms the legibility and understanding of a program, which makes it much harder for us, the humans, to reason about its correctness. </p>
<p>In a manually managed language, like C, the hapless programmer is left responsible for the machinations of the machine. They must take great care to ensure data is appropriately loaded into memory before operation, and then responsibly disposed of afterwards. A difficult dance in which missteps either cause dramatic crashes or else subtle and hard to detect vulnerabilities. But these are the very same tools that allow careful users to tune performance.  </p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, garbage collection promises the programmer it will automatically deal with the problem on their behalf. They are now free to express code naturally, but in doing so, it ties hands behind their back. They no longer have, at least not without indirection, the levers needed to wring out maximal performance.</p>
<p>Rust begins from a different premise. Rather than hiding this complexity, it accepts that computers are hard for humans, and instead tries to save us from the dangerous bits. Users can still tune the machine, but with less rope to wrap around their necks. </p>
<p>In the same way that static typing exists, very clever people have figured out how to make the compiler eliminate a whole category of memory and concurrency errors. To achieve this, Rust makes a bargain with the developer: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm going to keep track of the lifetime of every piece of memory in your program for you. This way, I can detect the moment you're no longer using it and safely free it on your behalf. But in return, I'm going to need you to follow <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">strict rules</a> about the ownership of that memory. If you try to use it outside of the scope that owns it, my humourless friend here, the borrow checker, is going to make sure you don't hurt yourself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, like static typing, this lunch isn't free. Rust is known to have a steep learning curve, "fighting the borrow checker" becomes a right of passage. It takes time to learn this new paradigm. Ownership makes some familiar patterns difficult or impossible and demands new ones be learnt in their place. Perhaps we should revise our earlier statement as: "The performance of C++ with the <del>convenience</del> safety of C#"</p>
<h2 id="unpacking-rusts-popularity">Unpacking Rust's Popularity</h2>
<p>Early adopters have a selfish reason to extol the virtues of their chosen technology, as widespread adoption enhances the return on their risky investment. In this respect, while interest is high but opportunities for real-world exposure are limited, is it possible that Rust is cresting a wave of unearned hype? <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Not every javascript or python developer</a> interested in the language, for example, has a use case that merits the additional complexity.</p>
<p>To a developer standing on the shores of 2010, <code>git</code>, a new version control system with a steep learning curve, may have seemed like a risky investment. But, in the ensuing world of Github, it's hard to argue the effort was wasted, even if some workloads (i.e. large games) still require alternatives.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, how can we qualify Rust's popularity as a meaningful signal? Ultimately, we will only know by the volume of mud we've dug through in the trenches, and admittedly, it is far too early to collect this data for games. </p>
<p>In other industries, though, early reports of Rust are effusive. <a href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/how-microsoft-is-adopting-rust-e0f8816566ba" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mircosoft</a>, <a href="https://developers.libra.org/docs/community/coding-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-sponsorship-of-the-rust-project/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/rust/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a> all have Rust deployed in production.

<p>The majority of us in the present and in the immediate future <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/exactis-data-breach-paving-road-data-dystopia-us-gdpr">will face the issue of Privacy</a>. Consider this basic thought, which may sound like science fiction, but is actually quite present today: Thanks to the devices we wear now, <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/exactis-data-breach-paving-road-data-dystopia-us-gdpr">the harvesting of our biometric data</a> is a possibility. It is this thought process that led to this think piece on privacy and big data.</p>
<p>Corporations can get to know us far better than we know ourselves. They can then not just predict our feelings but also manipulate our feelings. Monitoring of our biometrics can make episodes like that of Cambridge Analytica’s data hacks prehistoric in comparison. </p>
<p>Remember that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/heres-much-google-facebook-really-think-youre-worth.html/">you are worth quite a bit of money to the social channels </a>you use. The podcast detailing the <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9IY09mTE41Mg&amp;ep=14&amp;episode=MjM0YjM1OTgtZTQ1Mi00NGZhLTkzYjUtMTQxMGJjZTY1NGE4">Congressional Antitrust Investigation on Tech Monopolies: Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple</a> gives a serious look at how powerful these big data companies are. The scale is astronomical. Amazon captures 70% of all retails in the United States. They literally have seven times the revenue of their next largest competitor. </p>
<p>Now imagine their cloud computing capabilities. Take stock of the number of iPhones that are there. We know that what you share on social media, and the information that you surrender is a Big Data Issue; and, consider the number of search results Google controls. There’s information about you being harvested. You should know how your information is being used. </p>
<h2>Some Background</h2>
<p>We hear of how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/steve-bannon-on-cambridge-analytica-facebook-data-is-for-sale-all-over-the-world">Steve Bannon used Facebook</a> to change politics and change culture. Facebook data, algorithms and narratives were his key weapons. These tools were used by the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cambridge-analytica-kogan-idUSKBN1GX2F6">Cambridge Analytica team to identify the dark triad</a> — Narcissism, Machiavellianism and Psychopathy — in people. We now know about the Russian interference in American politics. We know how data had been manipulated to channel the latent proclivities of racism and anti-Semitism within America to divide it. </p>
<p>The same podcast makes mention of a great knowledge-infused book, which is Shoshana Zuboff’s <a href="https://youtu.be/QL4bz3QXWEo">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>. In this book, Zuboff details the rise of a new form of power which will forever change our lives. By collecting behavioral data from their users, corporations have amassed an incomprehensibly large and detailed picture of our personal lives. They use this data to expand their corporate power and profitability. This, of course, has tremendous consequences for our privacy, but also for our political system.</p>

<p>Surveillance Capitalism is where it universally claims our private human experience as their free source of raw material. They take the rich predictive signals in our behavior and convert it into data. We hear of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/facebook-helped-advertisers-target-teens-who-feel-worthless/#:~:text=Leaked%202017%20document%20reveals%20FB,exploit%20teens'%20words%2C%20images.&amp;text=Facebook's%20secretive%20advertising%20practices%20became,of%20the%20company's%20Australian%20office.">Facebook executives who promote&nbsp;advertising campaigns that exploit Facebook users’ emotional states</a>. Facebook’s algorithms can determine, and&nbsp;allow&nbsp;advertisers to pinpoint, “moments when young people need a confidence boost.”&nbsp;97% of Facebook’s revenue comes from its online targeted advertising markets. These are wholly-owned and operated in this surveillance capitalist economic logic. </p>
<p>Readers of Cathy O’Neil’s Weapons of Math Destruction will be compelled to believe the potential dangers of big data. O’Neil, a mathematician, analyses how the use of big data and algorithms in a variety of fields. These include insurance, advertising, education, and policing. They can lead to decisions that harm the poor, reinforce racism, and amplify inequality. Mathematicians and statisticians were for a very long time studying our desires, movements, and spending power. This is the Big Data economy we are living in. </p>
<h2>Trust is Important </h2>
<p>Consumers are more conscious of their data privacy than ever. A recent <a href="https://tealium.com/resource/whitepaper/how-brands-can-prioritize-privacy-in-the-age-of-data/">Tealium study</a> on consumer data privacy found that 97% of consumers surveyed said they are somewhat or very concerned about protecting their data. <a href="https://www.accenture.com/t20171220T024439Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-68/Accenture-Global-Anthem-POV.pdf#zoom=50">Research by Accenture</a>&nbsp;shows that&nbsp;88% of<strong> </strong>consumers say companies that provide personalized experiences without compromising their trust are more appealing and can relate to their needs better than others.</p>
<p>We are focusing on Facebook on this particular blog post to quite a degree since it is the one singular social medium that is growing exponentially. One of the ways in which Facebook garners your data is with you revealing your data and your intentions via the act of publishing status updates and even commenting. You see, the act of commenting fulfills just one touchpoint in the process of these tech giants harvesting of data. Facebook built&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/" target="_blank">comments plugin</a>&nbsp;to allow users to leave comments on websites, blogs and forums through their Facebook accounts. It was expected to provide high-quality conversations over the internet but instead ended up spamming popular sites.</p>
<p>If you do use the Facebook Comments plugin, remember that your comments are a valuable content asset that shouldn’t be subject to <a href="https://ducttapemarketing.com/how-and-why-i-use-the-facebook-comments-plugin/">Facebook’s Terms of Service</a>, which basically says they can do whatever they want with them. An increasing amount of spam raises questions about how well the policy of malicious content online is going on. There are many misleading and offensive comments, usually attracting and persuading users towards a specific link to click it. These comments are often repetitive and can easily be identified as spam.</p>
<p>According to an estimation by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.similartech.com/technologies/facebook-comments">Similartech</a>&nbsp;more than 360,000 unique domains have installed Facebook Comments plugin. It is still not clear why and how the spam filters of Facebook failed to filter spam comments. <a href="https://www.similartech.com/technologies/facebook-comments">In 2015</a>, one of the security firms, Symantec reported scammers had been trying to affect the comments sections of Facebook to spread malware. </p>
<p>For more than two years now, Facebook has been working on its content-moderation efforts and the spamming in Facebook Comment boxes shows that problematic content still finds its way to escape the loopholes. Moreover, <a href="https://www-dailymail-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2525227/amp/Facebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16034519192504&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsciencetech%2Farticle-2525227%2FFacebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html">Facebook can track what </a><a href="https://www-dailymail-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2525227/amp/Facebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html?usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=16034519192504&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsciencetech%2Farticle-2525227%2FFacebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html">you</a><a href="https://www-dailymail-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2525227/amp/Facebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16034519192504&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsciencetech%2Farticle-2525227%2FFacebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html"> type</a>, even if you never post it.&nbsp;Data scientists can determine that a status or comment has been typed by tracking code in the HTML form element of each page.</p>
<h2>Read The Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>We live in a world where the concept of privacy already seems outdated. But that is largely because we’ve decided not to inquire about what happens when we trade it for convenience. The more connected you, and billions of others, are to Facebook, the more money Facebook makes by selling your personal information, and the more powerful it becomes.</p>
<p>The terms of service state,&nbsp;<em>We use the data we have — for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products — to personalize your experience.</em></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="746" height="634" src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DcrJMbSW0AAxJXC.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DcrJMbSW0AAxJXC.jpg 746w, https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DcrJMbSW0AAxJXC-300x255.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" data-srcset="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DcrJMbSW0AAxJXC.jpg 746w, https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DcrJMbSW0AAxJXC-300x255.jpg 300w" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DcrJMbSW0AAxJXC.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><a href="https://qz.com/1266835/facebooks-terms-of-service-translated-so-you-understand-your-data-and-privacy-settings/">Be wary of nebulous terms and promises</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, this means that Facebook uses every bit of personal information it can, collected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/how-facebook-tracks-you-even-when-youre-not-on-facebook/">both on and off Facebook</a>, to entice advertisers. The better the company knows you through the personal information you share with your friends and family, the more likely they are to be able to sell you stuff you want.</p>
<h2>Choose The Right to Privacy</h2>
<p>Big data is big business and value is created from customer insight. But, where is the moral line? What happens when companies cross that line? What if consumers could flip the equation to offer their data directly to the companies they trust? The future could be customer-monetized data.</p>
<p>We are the authors of our own destruction here since we don’t choose to be aware. If you participate in Facebook, should you not have some semblance of an expectation of privacy. The former Federal Trade Commission Chairperson Jon Leibowitz publicly stated, “We all agree that consumers don’t read privacy policies.”</p>
<p><a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/docs/gdpr">Ensure you choose privacy</a> and are aware of how technology plans on using your data. The only solution is being non-participatory. The solution is choosing not to be part of a pernicious agenda that can be defined as Surveillance Capitalism. </p>

<p>Saturday, November 7, 2020</p>
<p>After fixing the performance and scalability problems, we’re on our way to getting a stable Pijul. In this post, I explain what I’ve been up to in the recent months.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Pijul has always been advertised as a research project, trying to implement a theory of patches that would be sound and fast. This is an ambitious goal, and became even more ambitious than initially envisioned.</p>
<p>One of the hardest challenges is that source code is by essence stateful, which makes it much harder to iterate over algorithm designs, like normal research projecst need to. For example, in order to get from our last published version to our current design, we have gone through many different variants, and there wasn’t much to publish.</p>
<p>Moreover, the UX aspect is what matters most in the end, and testing it on a real world project is the only way to get it there. However, unlike in a compiler, where bootstrapping is done one step at a time, and previous versions are always available to compile your current one, a version control system has the additional problem that the previous versions might not always be easily accessible if there is a bug.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms I’ve heard since I realised that better datastructures were possible is that I was “working secretely”. I certainly understand this feeling, but this is based on a misunderstanding of how research works. When I first had the idea that I’m explaining in this post, I realised that a complete rewrite would be needed. But for a very long time, almost nothing other than unusable, unreadable prototypes happened.</p>
<p>Back then, there wasn’t much to show, since it wasn’t even clear that the basic datastructure would work. And even when they started working at a large enough scale, it took me quite a bit of testing on large repositories before they started actually working.</p>
<p>This also implies that there wasn’t much to show for quite a while, since the new algorithm wasn’t usable until very recently, and any repository started before now would have become obsolete in a matter of days.</p>
<p>There were also <a href="#a-personal-note">persoprofessional reasons</a> for this silence, described at the end of this post.</p>

<p>Pijul depends on two other projects I’ve started.</p>
<h3 id="sanakirja">Sanakirja</h3>
<p>One of these projects is Sanakirja, which is “just” a key-value store, but has the extra feature that databases can be cloned efficiently. I would have loved to just use an existing library, but there just isn’t any that has this cloning feature. However, the scope of Sanakirja is still quite modest, it does one thing and does it well. Obviously, it took some time to find the memory-management bugs, but I have good confidence that this is now done.</p>
<p>In previous releases of Pijul, databases were implemented with a single mmapped file containing the binary representation of B Trees. Despite their lower writing performance (compared to alternatives such as <em>Log-structured merge-trees</em>), and the complexity of the code for deletions, B Trees are very well suited to this use case: indeed, since they are trees, reference-counting the nodes is enough to implement efficient clones.</p>
<p>One of the remaining issues was that in order to grow the database, we needed to un-mmapped the file, grow it, and mmap it again. Since applying a single change in Pijul must be an atomic operation, we needed to cancel the transaction when that happened, and restart it with a bigger file.</p>
<p>Another issue is that I wanted the next libpijul to compile on platforms that don’t have mmap, such as WASM. However, if reallocating an mmapped file has a very low complexity (even though it does have a non-zero cost in terms of system calls), reallocating a chunk of memory often requires copying everything. This completely defeats the point of the algorithms in Pijul, which rely on a particular representation of the datastructures on the disk.</p>
<p>The main innovation in Sanakirja 0.13 is to use a vector of memory blocks (either in memory or mmapped from a file), of exponentially-increasing size. The overhead is just one extra indirection, the complexity of adding items is the same (since the operation of creating an extra block is $O(1)$). The exponentially-increasing sizes mean that the allocated memory is always at least half-full.</p>
<h3 id="thrussh">Thrussh</h3>
<p>The other one is Thrussh. That library implements the SSH protocol, and tries to handle a number of key formats. The former is a surprisingly easy goal, and keeping up with Tokio versions has historically been the hardest bit, while the latter is the most horrendous hydra-like task, with new heads and legacy formats showing up every time you think you’re done.</p>
<h2 id="how-repositories-used-to-work-and-still-do-to-some-extent">How repositories used to work (and still do, to some extent)</h2>
<p>Old-style repositories represented a single file by a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ of lines, where each vertex $v\in V$ represented a line, and an edge from $u \in V$ to $v\in V$, labelled by some change (also called patch) number $c$, could be read as “according to change $c$, line $u$ comes before $v$”.</p>
<p>This means that changes could introduce vertices and lines, as in the following example, where a line $D$ is introduced between $A$ and $B$:</p>
<p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/repos-line-add.svg">
</p>
<p>Here, the thick line represents the change from the file containing the lines $A$, $B$, $C$ to the file with the new line $D$.
An important feature to note is that <strong>vertices are uniquely identified</strong>, by the hash of the change that introduced them, along with a position in that change. This means that two lines with the same content, introduced by different changes, will be different. It also means that a lines keeps its identity, even if the change is applied in a totally different context.</p>
<p>Moreover, this system is append-only, in the sense that <em>deletions</em> are handled by a more sophisticated labelling of the edges. In the example above, if we want to delete line $D$, we just need to make a change mapping the edge introduced by $c_0$ to a deleted edge, which we label by the name $c_1$ of the change that introduces it:</p>
<p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/repos-line-del.svg">
</p>
<p>From now on, we call the full edges <strong>alive</strong>, and the dashed ones <strong>dead</strong>.</p>
<p>We have just described the two basic kinds of actions in Pijul. There are no other. One kind adds vertices to the graph, along with “alive” edges around them, and the other kind maps an existing edge label onto a different one.
In order to fully described the system, I also need to mention that the edge labels are given by two parameters: their status (alive, deleted, and a few others related to multiple files and technical details explained below) and the change that introduced them.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>
<p>This scheme allows to defines dependencies between changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a change $c$ adds a vertex, we must have its <em>“context”</em>, i.e. the lines before and after it, hence the changes that introduced these lines are in the dependencies of $c$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a change $c$ deletes a vertex, or in other words maps an existing edge introduced by a change $d$, then $c$ must depend on $d$.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this is just the minimal set of dependencies needed to make sense of the text edits. Hooks and scripts may add extra language-dependent dependencies based on semantics.</p>
<h3 id="are-edge-labels-minimal">Are edge labels minimal?</h3>
<p>Our goals is to find the smallest possible system, both for reasons of mathematical aesthetics (why store useless stuff?) and the other one for performance. Therefore, one immediate question comes to mind: why even keep the change number on the edges?</p>
<p>In order to answer that question, suppose we don’t keep the labels, meaning that the maps happen between statuses only. Then, consider the following two situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Change inverses</strong></p>
<p>The first issue happens when two authors delete a line in parallel, and one of the authors reverts their change. Applying these changes yields the following diagram, where the two deletions get merged into one, and the inverse applies to both:</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/inverse2.svg">
 </p>
<p>However, this is not what we expect, since one of the authors explicitly reverted the deletion, while the other performed the same deletion in parallel.
By keeping the labels, this is what we get instead:</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/inverse3.svg">
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Missing contexts</strong></p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, in the rest of this post, we name two users Alice (with pronouns “she/her”) and Bob (with pronouns “he/his”).</p>
<p>This situation, where Alice writes something in the middle of a paragraph $p$, while Bob deletes $p$ in parallel.
One issue here, is that the situation is not symmetric: when Bob applies Alice’s change, he can tell immediately that something is wrong, because the context of Alice’s edits is labelled as deleted in his repository.</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/known-vertices1.svg">
 </p>
<p>However, Alice’s situation is different: indeed, consider the case where instead of deleting $p$ <em>in parallel</em> of her changes, Bob deleted $p$ after applying Alice’s change. The edges deleted are exactly the same, but this is not a conflict, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/known-vertices2.svg">
 </p>
<p>The situation is further complicated by the fact that this system doesn’t behave symmetrically with the contexts above and below the new line. Indeed, if Bob deleted the <em>down context</em> of the line (i.e. if he deleted line $C$) instead of the <em>up context</em> (line $B$), Alice could detect the conflict, since in that case, $C$ would have both an alive and a dead edge pointing to it ($C$ is called a “zombie vertex” internally), as shown in the following diagram:</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/known-vertices0.svg">
 </p>
<p>Keeping the change identifiers on each edge allows us to solve this. In Pijul 0.12, Bob would add the labels of all the edges around the deleted lines to the dependencies of his change. Then, Alice can tell whether Bob knows of her change before applying it. The changes are conflict if and only if Bob doesn’t know of the new lines.</p>
<p>However, this behaviour was counter-intuitive, <a href="https://discourse.pijul.org/t/why-these-patches-dont-commute/449">as noted by @tae</a>.</p>
<p>A finer analysis of what dependencies are led to a different behaviour in the new Pijul. Changes now have two different sets of …</p></li></ul></div></div>

November 9, 2020 | https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/09/this-is-how-i-git/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/09/this-is-how-i-git/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Every now and then I get questions on how to work with git in a smooth way when developing, bug-fixing or extending curl – or how I do it. After all, I <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/10/26/working-open-source/" data-type="post" data-id="14901">work on open source full time</a> which means I have very frequent interactions with git (and GitHub). Simply put, I work with git all day long. Ordinary days, I issue git commands several hundred times.</p>



<p>I have a very simple approach and way of working with git in curl. This is how it works.</p>



<h2>command line</h2>



<p>I use git almost exclusively from the command line in a terminal. To help me see which branch I’m working in, I have this little bash helper script.</p>



<pre>brname () {
  a=$(<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2&gt;/dev/null</code>)
  if [ -n "$a" ]; then
    echo " [$a]"
  else
    echo ""
  fi
}
PS1="\u@\h:\w\$(brname)$ "</pre>



<p>That gives me a prompt that shows username, host name, the current working directory and the current checked out git branch.</p>



<p>In addition: I use Debian’s <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/debian/bash-completion/-/blob/master/README.md">bash command line completion</a> for git which is also really handy. It allows me to use tab to complete things like git commands and branch names. </p>



<h2>git config</h2>



<p>I of course also have my customized <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file to provide me with some convenient aliases and settings. My most commonly used git aliases are:</p>


<pre title="">st = status --short -uno
ci = commit
ca = commit --amend
caa = commit -a --amend
br = branch
co = checkout
df = diff
lg = log -p --pretty=fuller --abbrev-commit
lgg = log --pretty=fuller --abbrev-commit --stat
up = pull --rebase
latest = log @^{/RELEASE-NOTES:.synced}..
</pre>


<p>The ‘latest’ one is for listing all changes done to curl since the most recent RELEASE-NOTES “sync”. The others should hopefully be rather self-explanatory.</p>



<p>The config also sets <code>gpgsign = true</code>, enables mailmap and a few other things.</p>



<h2>master is clean and working</h2>



<p>The main curl development is done in the single <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">curl/curl</a> git repository (primarily hosted on GitHub). We keep the master branch the bleeding edge development tree and we work hard to always keep that working and functional. We do our releases off the master branch when that day comes (every eight weeks) and we provide “<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/snapshots/">daily snapshots</a>” from that branch, put together – yeah – daily.</p>



<p>When merging fixes and features into master, we avoid merge commits and use rebases and fast-forward as much as possible. This makes the branch very easy to browse, understand and work with – as it is 100% linear.</p>



<h2>Work on a fix or feature</h2>



<p>When I start something new, like work on a bug or trying out someone’s patch or similar, I first create a local branch off master and work in that. That is, I don’t work directly in the master branch. Branches are easy and quick to do and there’s no reason to shy away from having loads of them!</p>



<p>I typically name the branch prefixed with my GitHub user name, so that when I push them to the server it is noticeable who is the creator (and I can use the same branch name locally as I do remotely).</p>



<pre>$ git checkout -b bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</pre>



<p>Once I’ve reached somewhere, I commit to the branch. It can then end up one or more commits before I consider myself “done for now” with what I was set out to do.</p>



<p>I try not to leave the tree with any uncommitted changes – like if I take off for the day or even just leave for food or an extended break. This puts the repository in a state that allows me to easily switch over to another branch  when I get back – should I feel the need to. Plus, it’s better to commit and explain the change <em>before</em> the break rather than having to recall the details again when coming back.</p>



<h2>Never stash</h2>



<p>“git stash” is therefore not a command I ever use. I rather create a new branch and commit the (temporary?) work in there as a potential new line of work.</p>



<h2>Show it off and get reviews</h2>



<p>Yes I am the lead developer of the project but I still maintain the same work flow as everyone else. All changes, except the most minuscule ones, are done as pull requests on GitHub.</p>



<p>When I’m happy with the functionality in my local branch. When the bug seems to be fixed or the feature seems to be doing what it’s supposed to do and the test suite runs fine locally.</p>



<p>I then clean up the commit series with “<code>git rebase -i</code>” (or if it is a single commit I can instead use just “<code>git commit --amend</code>“).</p>



<p>The commit series should be a set of logical changes that are related to this change and not any more than necessary, but kept separate if they are separate. Each commit also gets its own proper commit message. Unrelated changes should be split out into its own separate branch and subsequent separate pull request.</p>



<pre>git push origin bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</pre>



<h2>Make the push a pull request</h2>



<p>On GitHub, I then make the newly pushed branch into a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pulls">pull request</a> (aka “a PR”). It will then become visible in the list of pull requests on the site for the curl source repository, it will be announced in the #curl IRC channel and everyone who follows the repository on GitHub will be notified accordingly.</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, a pull request kicks of a flood of CI jobs that will build and test the code in numerous different combinations and on several platforms, and the results of those tests will trickle in over the coming hours. When I write this, we have around 90 different CI jobs – per pull request – and something like 8 different code analyzers will scrutinize the change to see if there’s any obvious flaws in there.</p>

Graph snapped on November 5, 2020</figcaption></figure>



<h2>A branch in the actual curl/curl repo</h2>



<p>Most contributors who would work on curl would not do like me and make the branch in the curl repository itself, but would rather do them in their own forked version instead. The difference isn’t that big and I <em>could</em> of course also do it that way.</p>



<h2>After push, switch branch</h2>



<p>As it will take some time to get the full CI results from the PR to come in (generally a few hours), I switch over to the next branch with work on my agenda. On a normal work-day I can easily move over ten different branches, polish them and submit updates in their respective pull-requests.</p>



<p>I can go back to the&nbsp;master branch again with ‘<code>git checkout master</code>‘ and there I can “<code>git pull</code>” to get everything from upstream – like when my fellow developers have pushed stuff in the mean time.</p>



<h2>PR comments or CI alerts</h2>



<p>If a reviewer or a CI job find a mistake in one of my PRs, that becomes visible on GitHub and I get to work to handle it. To either fix the bug or discuss with the reviewer what the better approach might be.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, flaky CI jobs is a part of life so very often there ends up one or two red markers in the list of CI jobs that can be ignored as the test failures in them are there due to problems in the setup and not because of actual mistakes in the PR…</p>



<p>To get back to my branch for that PR again, I “<code>git checkout bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</code>“, and fix the issues.</p>



<p>I normally start out by doing follow-up commits that repair the immediate mistake and push them on the branch:</p>



<pre>git push origin <code>bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</code></pre>



<p>If the number of fixup commits gets large, or if the follow-up fixes aren’t small, I usually end up doing a squash to reduce the number of commits into a smaller, simpler set, and then force-push them to the branch.</p>



<p>The reason for that is to make the patch series easy to review, read and understand. When a commit series has too many commits that changes the previous commits, it becomes hard to review.</p>



<h2>Ripe to merge?</h2>



<p>When the pull request is ripe for merging (independently of who authored it), I switch over to the master branch again and I merge the pull request’s commits into it. In special cases I cherry-pick specific commits from the branch instead. When all the stuff has been yanked into master properly that should be there, I push the changes to the remote.</p>



<p>Usually, and especially if the pull request wasn’t done by me, I also go over the commit messages and polish them somewhat before I push everything. Commit messages should follow our style and mention not only which PR that it closes but also which issue it fixes and properly give credit to the bug reporter and all the helpers – using the right syntax so that our automatic tools can pick them up correctly!</p>



<p>As already mentioned above, I merge fast-forward or rebased into master. No merge commits.</p>



<h2>Never merge with GitHub!</h2>



<p>There’s a button GitHub that says “rebase and merge” that could theoretically be used for merging pull requests. I <em>never</em> use that (and if I could, I’d disable/hide it). The reasons are simply:</p>



<ol><li>I don’t feel that I have the proper control of the commit message(s)</li><li>I can’t select to squash a subset of the commits, only all or nothing</li><li>I often want to cleanup the author parts too before push, which the UI doesn’t allow</li></ol>



<p>The downside with not using the merge button is that the message in the  PR says “closed by [hash]” instead of “merged in…” which causes confusion to a fair amount of users who don’t realize it means that it actually means the same thing! I consider this is a (long-standing) GitHub UX flaw.</p>



<h2>Post merge</h2>



<p>If the branch has nothing to be kept around more, I delete the local branch again with “<code>git branch -d [name]</code>” and I remove it remotely too since it was completely merged there’s no reason to keep the work version left.</p>



<p>At any given point in time, I have some 20-30 different local branches alive using this approach so things I work on over time all live in their own branches and also submissions from various people that haven’t been merged into master yet exist in branches of various maturity levels. Out of those local branches, the number of concurrent pull requests I have in progress can be somewhere between just a few up to ten, twelve something.</p>



<h2>RELEASE-NOTES</h2>



<p>Not strictly related, but in order to keep interested people informed about what’s happening in the tree, we sync the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES">RELEASE-NOTES</a> file every once in a while. Maybe every 5-7 days or so. It …</p></div></div>

November 9, 2020 | https://www.rath.org/on-the-beauty-of-pythons-exitstack.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.rath.org/on-the-beauty-of-pythons-exitstack.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I believe Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack">ExitStack</a> feature does not get the recognition
it deserves. I think part of the reason for this is that its
documentation is somewhere deep down in the (already obscure)
<a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html">contextlib</a> module because formally ExitStack is just one of many
available context managers for Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement">with statement</a>. But
ExitStack deserves far more prominent notice than that. This post will
hopefully help with that.</p>
<p>So what makes ExitStack so important? In short, it's the best way to
handle allocation and release of external resources in Python.</p>
<div id="the-problem">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>The main challenge with external resources is that you have to release
them when you don't need them anymore -- and in particular you must
not forget to do so in all the alternate execution paths that may be
entered in case of error conditions.</p>
<p>Most languages implement error conditions as "exceptions" that can be
"caught" and handled (Python, Java, C++), or as special return values
that you need to check to determine if an error occured (C, Rust,
Go). Typically, code that needs to acquire and release external
resources then looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>res1</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_one</span><span>()</span>
<span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1</span>
    <span>res2</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_two</span><span>()</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span># do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
    <span>finally</span><span>:</span>
        <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res2</span><span>)</span>
<span>finally</span><span>:</span>
   <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res1</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>or, if the language doesn't have exceptions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>res1</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_one</span><span>();</span>
<span>if</span><span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>retval</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>goto</span> <span>error_out1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// do stuff with res1</span>
<span>res2</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_two</span><span>();</span>
<span>if</span><span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>retval</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
   <span>goto</span> <span>error_out2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
<span>retval</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>// ok</span>

<span>error_out2</span><span>:</span>
  <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res2</span><span>);</span>
<span>error_out1</span><span>:</span>
  <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res1</span><span>);</span>
<span>return</span> <span>retval</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This approach has three big problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The cleanup code is far away from the allocation code.</li>
<li>When the number of resources increases, indentation levels (or jump
labels) accumulate, making things hard to read.</li>
<li>Managing a dynamic number of resources this way is impossible.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Python, some of these issues can be alleviated by using the
<tt>with</tt> statement:</p>
<div><pre><span></span> <span>@contextlib.contextmanager</span>
 <span>def</span> <span>my_resource</span><span>(</span><span>id_</span><span>):</span>
     <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource</span><span>(</span><span>id_</span><span>)</span>
     <span>try</span><span>:</span>
         <span>yield</span> <span>res</span>
     <span>finally</span><span>:</span>
         <span>release_source</span><span>(</span><span>res</span><span>)</span>

<span>with</span> <span>my_resource</span><span>(</span><span>RES_ONE</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>res1</span><span>,</span> \
   <span>my_resource</span><span>(</span><span>RES_TWO</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>res2</span><span>:</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>However, this solution is far from optimal: you need to implement
resource-specific context managers (note that in the above example we
silently assumed that both resources can be acquired by the same
function), you can get rid of extra indentation only if you allocate
all the resources at the same time and live with an ugly continuation
line (no parenthesis allowed in this context), and you still need to
know the number of required resources ahead of time.</p>
<p>Over in the world of exception-less programming languages (no pun
intended), <a href="http://www.golang.org/">Go</a> has developed a different remedy: the <a href="http://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statement">defer statement</a>
defers execution of an expression until the enclosing
function returns. Using <tt>defer</tt>, the above example can be written
as:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>res1</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_one</span><span>()</span>
<span>if</span><span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>==</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>defer</span> <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res1</span><span>)</span>
<span>// do stuff with res1</span>
<span>res2</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_two</span><span>()</span>
<span>if</span><span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>==</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>defer</span> <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res2</span><span>)</span>
<span>// do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
<span>return</span> <span>0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is pretty nice: allocation and cleanup are kept close together,
no extra indentation or jump labels are required, and converting this
to a loop that dynamically acquires multiple resources would be
straightforward. But there are still some drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>To control when exactly a group of resources is getting released you
have to factor out into separate functions all parts of code that
access the respective resources.</li>
<li>You cannot "cancel" a deferred expression, so there is no way to
e.g. return a resource to the caller if no error occured.</li>
<li>There is no way to handle errors from the cleanup functions.</li>
<li><tt>defer</tt> is available in Go, but not in Python.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exitstack-to-the-rescue">
<h2>ExitStack to the rescue</h2>
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack">ExitStack</a> fixes all of the above issues, and adds some benefits on
top of it. An ExitStack is (as the name suggests) a stack of clean-up
functions. Adding a callback to the stack is the equivalent of calling
Go's <tt>defer</tt> statement. However, clean-up functions are not executed
when the function returns, but when execution leaves the <tt>with</tt>
block - and until then, the stack can also be emptied again.</p>
<p>Finally, clean-up functions itself may raise exceptions without
affecting execution of other clean-up functions. Even if multiple
clean-ups raise exceptions, you are will get a usable stacktrace.</p>
<p>Here's how to acquire multiple resources:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>with</span> <span>ExitStack</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>cm</span><span>:</span>
    <span>res1</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_one</span><span>()</span>
    <span>cm</span><span>.</span><span>callback</span><span>(</span><span>release_resource</span><span>,</span> <span>res1</span><span>)</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1</span>
    <span>res2</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_two</span><span>()</span>
    <span>cm</span><span>.</span><span>callback</span><span>(</span><span>release_resource</span><span>,</span> <span>res2</span><span>)</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that</p>
<ul>
<li>acquisition and release are close to each other</li>
<li>there's no extra indentation,</li>
<li>the pattern and it easily scales up to many resources (including a
dynamic number that's acquired in a loop)</li>
</ul>
<p>If there already is a context manager for your resource, there's also
a shortcut function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>with</span> <span>ExitStack</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>cm</span><span>:</span>
    <span>res1</span> <span>=</span> <span>cm</span><span>.</span><span>enter</span><span>(</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'first_file'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>))</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1</span>
    <span>res2</span> <span>=</span> <span>cm</span><span>.</span><span>enter</span><span>(</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'second_file'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>))</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To open a bunch of files and return them to the caller (without
leaking already opened files if a subsequent open fails):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>open_files</span><span>(</span><span>filelist</span><span>):</span>
    <span>fhs</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>ExitStack</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>cm</span><span>:</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>name</span> <span>in</span> <span>filelist</span><span>:</span>
            <span>fhs</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>cm</span><span>.</span><span>enter</span><span>(</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>)))</span>
        <span>cm</span><span>.</span><span>pop_all</span><span>()</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>fhs</span>
</pre></div>

<p>What if it were possible to write software capable of time travel? What if we could write software that was able to retrieve results from a computation solved sometime in the near future? What would this software look like? What problems could be solved?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle#Time_loop_logic">Time loop logic</a> is a hypothetical system of computation that exploits the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle">Novikov self-consistency principle</a>. In this system the computer is able to send the result of a computation backwards through time and rely upon the self-consistency principle to force the sent result to be correct. This futuristic concept might seem impossible now but I'd imagine trying to explain nuclear fission to a 3rd century blacksmith would seem equally impossible.</p>
<h2 id="writing-time-loop-software">Writing time loop software</h2>
<p>Building on the concept of time loop logic we are able to implement theoretical programming constructs to help better understand the concept of time travel in software. In the following examples we demonstrate what a time loop logic program might look like.</p>
<h3 id="an-event-loop">An event loop</h3>
<p>In the follow examples we'll be using the JavaScript programing language. JavaScript provides a single thread of execution for code to run in. The JavaScript virtual machine is constantly running an event loop. Each tick of this event loop represents a single cycle of code execution. Once this cycle is completed the next tick in the event loop will occur. In the popular <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> framework <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_nexttick_callback">an API is provided</a> to defer the execution of a block of code until the nextTick of the event loop occurs.</p>
<h4 id="node-js-process-nexttick-example">node.js process.nextTick() example</h4>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>foo</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>'foo'</span>);
}

process.nextTick(foo);
<span>console</span>.log(<span>'bar'</span>);
</code></pre><p>This will output:</p>
<pre><code><span>bar
</span><span>foo</span>
</code></pre><p>The same effect of <code>process.nextTick</code> can also be achieved using JavaScript's setTimeout command</p>
<pre><code>setTimeout<span>(<span>foo</span>, <span>0</span>)</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="node-js-process-prevtick-example">node.js process.prevTick() example</h4>
<p>Now let's imagine that instead of deferring a line of code until the next tick of the event loop we could instead push that code <em>backwards</em> to the <em>previous</em> tick of the event loop.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>foo</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>'foo'</span>);
}

<span>console</span>.log(<span>'bar'</span>);
process.prevTick(foo);
</code></pre><p>Outputs:</p>
<pre><code><span>foo</span>
bar
</code></pre><p>The same effect of <code>process.prevTick</code> can also be achieved using setTimeout with a negative value</p>
<pre><code>setTimeout<span>(<span>foo</span>, <span>-1</span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>Since all we are doing is logging a simple string to the console, this is a contrived example. However; building on the concept of <code>process.prevTick</code> we can begin to implement more complex time loop programs.</p>
<h2 id="brute-force-cracking-with-time-loops">Brute force cracking with time loops</h2>
<p>Let's assume a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute-force search</a> password cracking scenario. Imagine there is a login function which expects a password. We have access to a very large word dictionary in which our cracking software will sequentially attempt logins using every word in the dictionary as a password until a match is found.</p>
<p>Here is the code for our brute-force program</p>
<p><em>Note: It's important to remember that Novikov's self-consistency principle guarantees that the sequence of events generating the paradox in the following code has zero probability.</em></p>


<h2 id="prime-factors-with-time-loops">Prime Factors with time loops</h2>
<p>Using time-loop logic  prime factors can be calculated in polynomial time.</p>


<h2 id="zero-lag-instant-communication">Zero-lag / Instant Communication</h2>
<p>The theoretical application of time-loop logic is endless. Imagine a time-loop based communication protocol. This would mean zero millisecond latency. Imagine gaming, video broadcasting, and file sharing with instantaneous transfer and zero lag. Through exploiting self-consistency we know that data will be sent in the immediate future ( since the data has begun transferring from the source ) and that eventually the transmission will arrive at it's destination. As long as the data will eventually be received, we are able to send the result back from the future into the immediate present, removing the notion of latency or lag.</p>
<h2 id="time-loop-logic-and-novikov-s-self-consistency-principle">Time Loop Logic and Novikov's Self-Consistency Principle</h2>
<p>How is it actually possible to program a time loop? Based on the self-consistency principle and continuing advancements in quantum entanglement these types of mind-bending constructs are not very far away. It's very possible we'll see this type of software actively being developed within the next hundred years.</p>
<p>Time loop logic was first written about by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec">Hans Moravec</a> who is best known for his work in robotics and artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University. You can find Hans' original paper from 1991, "Time Travel and Computing", here: <a href="https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html">https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html</a>. I recommend reading the entire paper.</p>
<p>What we know from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve#General_relativity">general relativity</a> is that at a quantum level backwards time-travel is mathematically possible in certain solutions containing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve">closed timelike curves</a>. A closed timelike curve is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line">world-line</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifold#Lorentzian_manifold">Lorentzian manifold</a>. </p>
<p>Closed timelike curves ( CTCs ) pose a problem for physicists. The existence of CTCs introduces the notion of time travel being possible. If time travel is possible, we have now introduced the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox">time travel paradoxes</a> which can violate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)">causality</a>. Since it's generally accepted that we cannot violate causality in our universe we must be able to explain how closed time-like curves can exist.</p>
<p>In his self-consistency principle Novikov asserts that if an event exists that would give rise to a paradox, or to any "change" to the past whatsoever, then the probability of that event is zero. In short, it says that it is impossible to create time travel paradoxes. You can find the original paper here: <a href="http://authors.library.caltech.edu/3737">http://authors.library.caltech.edu/3737</a>. I recommend starting with reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle#History_of_the_principle">history of the principle</a>.</p>

<p>In order for time loop logic to return an answer instantaneously, we <em>must</em> ensure that the problem will run long enough into the future to <em>actually</em> calculate the result. If a problem takes sixty seconds to solve, the program must run for at least sixty seconds. Time-loop logic does <em>not</em> violate causality. We are able to retrieve the answer instantly because we have committed to spending sixty seconds in the future calculating the answer and sending it back.</p>
<p>This turns debugging time-loop logic into somewhat of an impossibility. Any bugs in a time loop indicate that sometime in the future a problem has occurred. <strong>This event may or may not be related to software.</strong> </p>
<p>Imagine a computer that utilized a time loop to brute force crack passwords ( as our code posted above did). I turn the machine on and request it cracks the password. The program doesn't work. Frustrated, I turn off the machine and complain to my co-worker Josh.</p>
<p>Josh turns on the machine and requests the password. The software works instantly cracking the password in under 1ms.</p>
<p>Bewildered, I ask Josh why the machine worked for him but not for me.</p>
<p>Josh replies, "It's actually quite simple. Using that computer it's going to take approximately 400 hours to brute force the password. After that 400 hours the CPU must recursively return the cracked password back in time until it reaches right now. I was able to get the answer instantly because I have decided to not turn this computer off for another 399 hours and 59 minutes. Simply put, you turned off the computer too quickly"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>In recent years there's been a steady growth in privacy focused companies. Some examples that have reached large-scale adoption are <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a>, <a href="https://signal.com/">Signal</a>, and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>. These are companies that have put privacy front and center to their value proposition and can be considered <em>privacy-preserving products</em>. I've come to beleive a goal of preserving user privacy is often inherently in tension with the goal of advancing user productivity.</p><p>What these services have in common is that they promise their users a higher degree of privacy relative to their competitors. Instead of the usual encryption in transit (protection from eavesdroppers) and encryption at rest (protection against unauthorized users), services like Signal and ProtonMail enable their users to hide data from anyone except the intended recipient, which — crucially — includes the service providers themselves.</p><p>This category of encryption is known as end-to-end encryption (e2e) and has found adopters in anyone from principled libertarians to journalists and human rights activitists whose lives may depend on their conversations remaining unwiretapped.</p><h2>Early privacy-preserving software was too difficult to use</h2><p>The canonical implementation of e2e for email is known as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and its reference implementation is GPG. GPG never reached mass adoption and there seems to be a myriad of reasons for that. The most salient reason, however, seems to be that to this day, it continues to be difficult to use. As the founder of Signal, Moxie Marlinspike <a href="https://moxie.org/2015/02/24/gpg-and-me.html">explains</a>, the spirit behind GPG was the following:</p><blockquote><p>Instead of developing opinionated software with a simple interface, GPG was written to be as powerful and flexible as possible.</p></blockquote><p>Powerful, flexible software written by nerds, unfortunately also tends to be prohibitively complex for normal users. Combined with the fact that <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">decentralized technology seems unable to quickly adapt to change</a>, the result has been a clunky solution that has, quite frankly, stayed clunky. With no feasible privacy-preserving alternative <!-- -->[1]<!-- -->, non-privacy preserving email providers became the norm.</p><h2>Surveillance capitalist companies will not encrypt your data, because they rely on being able to read it</h2><p>One such email provider, Gmail by Google, gained millions of users by offering a free plan. Their initial monetization strategy was scanning your emails and serving you personalized ads. Although they've stopped personalizing the ads, they're still scanning your email's contents to serve you a better experience across their services. Similarly, Facebook tracks what you do to shape your experience and keep you glued (they would say 'engaged') to their platform.</p><p>What unites platforms like Google and Facebook, is described by Professor Shoshana Zuboff as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>”. The business model of surveillance capitalist companies is to harvest personal data about you to build a model that predicts your behavior. These prediction models are packaged and sold as advertisement opportunities to companies eager to buy your attention. You might be the user, but you're not the customer — the advertisers are.</p><p>It should come as no surprise then, that none of these platforms has shipped with end-to-end encryption by default. Doing so would go against the incentives that undergird their very business model. Their ability to predict your behavior, and sell ads based on those predictions, hinges on their ability to harvest your data.</p><h2>Data is also collected to improve the service</h2><p>A company like Google has other business models of course. Google Workspace, aimed at businesses, is a collection of collaboration and productivity tools. This ranges from Google Docs, to chat, to video conferencing, and more. By offering this as a paid service, Google exposes itself to a different incentive, one where the customer and the user are now one and the same.</p><p>Even if you're both the user and the customer, your data is still being harvested. This data might not feed into personalized ads (because that’s no longer the primary business model) but rather into improving your experience. But as a business user, when does your experience improve? And as a service provider, how do you know what improves the experience?</p><h2>Improvements are productivity gains</h2><p>There's an inclination to think of improvements as things that help you do the thing you want to do quicker, better and/or with less frustration. We can go one step further and borrow some of the thinking used in economics and treat productivity simply as the ratio between outputs (salaries and corporate profits) and inputs (hours worked). Productivity increases if inputs can be decreased (for equal outputs) or outputs can be increased (for equal inputs). What's more, we would expect this quantity to improve along with advances in technology.</p><p>How does technology lead to increases in productivity? One obvious way is by making us more efficient. If some new technology saves us time doing a certain task (decreased input), all other things being equal, we’ll end up seeing those gains reflected in our outputs.</p><h2>Productivity gains are discovered, not planned</h2><p>What exactly are the things that increase efficiency? Here's where it gets tricky. In the realm of knowledge work, we don't always know where the gains will come from — that is, before they are made. We are still discovering new ways in which we can be more productive and especially so in the domain of collaborative productivity. An illustrative example of how productivity gains are discovered comes from Kevin A. Kwok's description of Figma's road to success.</p><p>In "Why Figma Wins", <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2020/06/19/why-figma-wins/">Kwok details</a> how the product team discovered a way to enable more efficient collaboration in the design process. That this potential existed wasn't at all  obvious to even those within the scene. While Sketch had broken new ground with their vector based design tool geared towards product designers, Figma took it to another level by taking many of the same (dare I say revolutionary) UX patterns and offering them in a web-native, multiplayer web application.</p><blockquote><p>The core insight of Figma is that design is larger than just designers. Design is all of the conversations between designers and PMs about what to build. It is the mocks and prototypes and the feedback on them. It is the handoff of specs and assets to engineers and how easy it is for them to implement them.</p></blockquote><p>As Kevin explains, Figma brought together the disparate disciplines that are involved in a design process into a synced browser window for everybody. This helped democratize design and remove a lot of friction that had existed before.</p><p>Not only did Figma push the frontier of productivity into new territory, it wasn’t obvious beforehand what that territory would look like. The lesson is that productivity improvements are won through a process of <em>discovery</em>. Kevin explains:</p><blockquote><p>As disciplines evolve, they figure out the social norms needed to operate better, build tools that can be shared across the industry, and invent abstractions that allow offloading more and more of the workload. They learn how to collaborate better, not just with each other but with all the other functions as well.</p></blockquote><p>Although there's some inherent uncertainty about what the productivity gains will look like (and where to look for them), there's no uncertainty about whether they will be made at all. If one thing can be counted on, it's the tech industry's relentless march towards higher productivity. The big tech platforms know this and don't shy away from investing heavily in innovation (discovery) in that direction.</p><h2>Productivity gains are unlocked by harvesting data</h2><p>Although there is some inherent tension between preserving privacy vs. allowing for a multiplayer mode like Figma, we can find even stronger tensions when it comes to harvesting data in favor of productivity gains.</p><p>A search feature relies on indexing your data. A recommendation feature relies on mining your browsing history. An autocomplete feature relies on what you (or other users) typed before.</p><p>All these potential features which are made possible through harvesting your user data are not available to privacy-preserving products. The user data isn't readable to them — and that's the whole point.</p><p>This creates a trade-off from the user's perspective. Whatever your particular motivation might be, as soon as you opt for a privacy-preserving service you're opting for a service that is not able to read your data, and by extension, not able to harvest it. Because the harvesting of data is what is driving many of the improvements in productivity, in choosing to preserve user privacy, these services are forgoing their ability to provide additional gains in productivity.</p><p>Historically, as we saw with the origins of GPG, there has always been additional friction involved in replicating a workflow in a privacy-preserving manner. Although using e2e services such as Signal and ProtonMail has become nearly frictionless, they lack many features their non-privacy preserving counterparts offer.</p><h2>The productivity gap between privacy-preserving and non-preserving services</h2><p>If you compare the productivity gains between privacy-preserving and non-preserving products from the perspective of the user, it's hard not to arrive at the conclusion that there’s a gap between the two — and it appears to be growing.</p><p>There is perhaps no better example of a feature which hinges on the ability to read user data than search. Although ProtonMail is reminiscent of Gmail in many ways, one area where it falls short is the absence of any ability to  search the contents of your emails. Search only works if the provider of such functionality can scan and index your content. It works even better if the provider is able to harvest search queries and use those to build predictive models (e.g. autocomplete and smart suggestions). These are features which make Gmail users more productive but aren't available to ProtonMail users <!-- -->[3]<!-- -->.</p><p>The absence of search might not be a dealbreaker for a …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>TL;DR: <strong>“Structured concurrency” refers to a way to structure async computations so that child operations are guaranteed to complete before their parents, just the way a function is guaranteed to complete before its caller.</strong> This sounds simple and boring, but in C++ it’s anything but. Structured concurrency — most notably, C++20 coroutines — has profound implications for the correctness and the simplicity of async architecture. It brings the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp?view=msvc-160">Modern C++ style</a> to our async programs by making async lifetimes correspond to ordinary C++ lexical scopes, eliminating the need for reference counting to manage object lifetime.</p>
<h2>Structured Programming and C++</h2>
<p>Back in the 1950’s, the nascent computing industry discovered structured programming: that high-level programming languages with lexical scopes, control structures, and subroutines resulted in programs that were far easier to read, write, and maintain than programming at the assembly level with test-and-jump instructions and <code>goto</code>. The advance was such a quantum leap that nobody talks about structured programming anymore; it’s just “programming”.</p>
<p>C++, more so than any other language, leverages structured programming to the hilt. The semantics of object lifetime mirror — and are tied to — the strict nesting of scopes; i.e., the <em>structure</em> of your code. Function activations nest, scopes nest, and object lifetimes nest. Objects’ lifetimes end with a scope’s closing curly brace, and objects are destroyed in the reverse order of their construction to preserve the strict nesting.</p>
<p>The Modern C++ programming style is built on this structured foundation. Objects have <em>value semantics</em> — they behave like the ints — and resources are cleaned up in destructors deterministically, which guarantees structurally that resources aren’t used after their lifetimes have ended. This is <em>very</em> important.</p>
<p>When we abandon this strict nesting of scopes and lifetimes — say, when we reference count an object on the heap, or when we use the singleton pattern — we are fighting against the strengths of the language rather than working with them.</p>
<h2>The Trouble With Threads</h2>
<p>Writing correct programs in the presence of concurrency is far more difficult than in single-threaded code. There are lots of reasons for this. One reason is that threads, like singletons and dynamically allocated objects, scoff at your puny nested scopes. Although you can use the Modern C++ style <em>within</em> a thread, when logic and lifetimes are scattered across threads, the hierarchical structure of your program is lost. The tools we use to manage complexity in single-threaded code — in particular, nested lifetimes tied to nested scopes — simply don’t translate to async code.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, let’s look at what happens when we take a simple synchronous function and make it asynchronous.</p>
<pre>void computeResult(State &amp; s);

int doThing() {
  State s;
  computeResult(s);
  return s.result;
}
</pre>
<p><code>doThing()</code> is simple enough. It declares some local state, calls a helper, then returns some result. Now imagine that we want to make both functions async, maybe because they take too long. No problem, let’s use Boost futures, which support continuation chaining:</p>
<pre>boost::future&lt;void&gt; computeResult(State &amp; s);

boost::future&lt;int&gt; doThing() {
  State s;
  auto fut = computeResult(s);
  return fut.then(
    [&amp;](auto&amp;&amp;) { return s.result; }); // OOPS
}
</pre>
<p>If you’ve programmed with futures before, you’re probably screaming, <em>“Nooooo!”</em> The <code>.then()</code> on the last line queues up some work to run after <code>computeResult()</code> completes. <code>doThing()</code> then returns the resulting future. The trouble is, when <code>doThing()</code> returns, the lifetime of the <code>State</code> object ends, <em>and the continuation is still referencing it</em>. That is now a dangling reference, and will likely cause a crash.</p>
<p>What has gone wrong? Futures let us compute with results that aren’t available yet, and the Boost flavor lets us chain continuations. But the continuation is a separate function with a separate scope. We often need to share data across those separate scopes. No more tidy nested scopes, no more nested lifetimes. We have to manage the lifetime of the state manually, something like this:</p>
<pre>boost::future&lt;void&gt;
computeResult(shared_ptr&lt;State&gt; s); // addref
                                    // the state

boost::future&lt;int&gt; doThing() {
  auto s = std::make_shared&lt;State&gt;();
  auto fut = computeResult(s);
  return fut.then(
    [s](auto&amp;&amp;) { return s.result; }); // addref
                                       // the state
}
</pre>
<p>Since both async operations refer to the state, they both need to share responsibility to keep it alive.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this is: <em>what is the lifetime of this asynchronous computation?</em> It starts when <code>doThing()</code> is called, but it doesn’t end until the continuation — the lambda passed to <code>future.then()</code> — returns. <em>There is no lexical scope that corresponds to that lifetime.</em> And that is the source of our woes.</p>
<h2>Unstructured Concurrency</h2>
<p>The story gets more complicated yet when we consider executors. Executors are handles to executions contexts that let you schedule work onto, say, a thread or thread pool. Many codebases have some notion of an executor, and some let you schedule things with a delay or with some other policy. This lets us do cool things, like move a computation from an IO thread pool to a CPU thread pool, or retry an async operation with a delay. Handy, but like <code>goto</code> it is a very low-level control structure that tends to obfuscate rather than clarify.</p>
<p>For instance, I recently came across an algorithm that uses executors and callbacks (called Listeners here) that retries the async allocation of some resource. Below is a greatly abridged version. It is described after the break.</p>
<pre>// This is a continuation that gets invoked when
// the async operation completes:
struct Manager::Listener : ListenerInterface {
  shared_ptr&lt;Manager&gt; manager_;
  executor executor_;
  size_t retriesCount_;

  void onSucceeded() override {
    /* ...yay, allocation succeeded... */
  }
  void onFailed() override {
    // When the allocation fails, post a retry
    // to the executor with a delay
    auto alloc = [manager = manager_]() {
      manager-&gt;allocate();
    };
    // Run "alloc" at some point in the future:
    executor_.execute_after(
      alloc, 10ms * (1 &lt;&lt; retriesCount_));
  }
};

// Try asynchronously allocating some resource
// with the above class as a continuation
void Manager::allocate() {
  // Have we already tried too many times?
  if (retriesCount_ &gt; kMaxRetries) {
    /* ...notify any observers that we failed */
    return;
  }

  // Try once more:
  ++retriesCount_;
  allocator_.doAllocate(
    make_shared&lt;Listener&gt;(
      shared_from_this(),
      executor_,
      retriesCount_));
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>allocate()</code> member function first checks to see if the operation has already been retried too many times. If not it calls a helper <code>doAllocate()</code> function, passing in a callback to be notified on either success or failure. On failure, the handler posts deferred work to the executor, which will call <code>allocate()</code> back, thus retrying the allocation with a delay.</p>
<p>This is a heavily stateful and rather circuitous async algorithm. The logic spans many functions and several objects, and the control and data flow is not obvious. Note the intricate ref-counting dance necessary to keep the objects alive. Posting the work to an executor makes it even harder. Executors in this code have no notion of continuations, so errors that happen during task execution have nowhere to go. The <code>allocate()</code> function can’t signal an error by throwing an exception if it wants any part of the program to be able to recover from the error. Error handling must be done manually and out-of-band. Ditto if we wanted to support cancellation.</p>
<p>This is <strong>unstructured concurrency</strong>: we queue up async operations in an <em>ad hoc</em> fashion; we chain dependent work, use continuations or “strand” executors to enforce sequential consistency; and we use strong and weak reference counts to keep data alive until we are certain it’s no longer needed. There is no formal notion of task A being a child of task B, no way to enforce that child tasks complete before their parents, and no one place in the code that we can point to and say, “Here is the algorithm.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you don’t mind the analogy, the hops through the executor are a bit like <code>goto</code> statements that are non-local in both time and space: “Jump to this point in the program, <em>X</em> milliseconds from now, on this particular thread.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That non-local discontinuity makes it hard to reason about correctness and efficiency. Scale unstructured concurrency up to whole programs handling lots of concurrent real-time events, and the incidental complexity of manually handling out-of-band asynchronous control and data flow, controlling concurrent access to shared state, and managing object lifetime becomes overwhelming.</p>
<h2>Structured Concurrency</h2>
<p>Recall that in the early days of computing, unstructured programming styles rapidly gave way to structured styles. With the addition of coroutines to C++, we are seeing a similar phase shift happening today to our asynchronous code. If we were to rewrite the above retry algorithm in terms of coroutines (using Lewis Baker’s popular <a href="https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro">cppcoro</a> library), it might look something like this:</p>
<pre>// Try asynchronously allocating some resource
// with retry:
cppcoro::task&lt;&gt; Manager::allocate() {
  // Retry the allocation up to kMaxRetries
  // times:
  for (int retriesCount = 1;
       retriesCount &lt;= kMaxRetries;
       ++retriesCount) {
    try {
      co_await allocator_.doAllocate();
      co_return; // success!
    } catch (...) {}

    // Oops, it failed. Yield the thread for a
    // bit and then retry:
    co_await scheduler_.schedule_after(
      10ms * (1 &lt;&lt; retriesCount));
  }

  // Error, too many retries
  throw std::runtime_error(
    "Resource allocation retry count exceeded.");
}
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: This replaces the <code>executor_</code> with a <code>scheduler_</code> that implements cppcoro’s <a href="https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro#delayedscheduler-concept">DelayedScheduler</a> concept.</p>
</blockquote>

I cannot set any other alarms or use any other means to ascertain the time.<ul><li>It is up to me to keep my phone charged so the alarm goes off.</li></ul></li><li>I cannot leave my apartment.</li></ol>











<p>I have no good reason. I just want to see if I am capable of doing it and what will happen. Some things I’m curious about:</p>



<ul><li>Do I have the willpower to get through the experiment?</li><li>Will I become disoriented from losing all sense of time?</li><li>Will I be able to stave off boredom with podcasts, audiobooks, and music on my phone?</li><li>Will I enter some sort of meditative state due to a lack of sensory input?</li><li><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/scientists-made-people-wear-blindfolds-for-4-days-the-resulting-hallucinations-were-incredible">Will I hallucinate</a>?</li><li>Will my non-sight senses heighten?</li><li>Will I hurt myself by falling or banging into something?</li><li>Will I sleep?</li><li>Will I eat? Is consuming caffeine a good idea (for entertainment) or a bad idea (energy with no direction)?</li><li>Will this experience make me more interested in being blind for a week? Or less?</li></ul>

<p>Attempt One started at 10:30 AM and failed at 1:13 PM. I purposefully took off my blindfold because I was worried that my multiple failures to input my Iphone’s password had resulted in a permanent lock or data wipe. But the password screen was just locked for a minute and all was well.</p>



<p>Given that I failed in the early afternoon, I considered restarting the experiment on another day in the morning. But I had already carved out a 24 hour period when I wouldn’t do any work or be disturbed, and it might have been a week or two longer before I got that opportunity again.</p>



<p>So I checked my messages, briefly went on Reddit, and then restarted.</p>

<p>Attempt Two was successful. I put on my blindfold at 1:23 PM on Thursday, November 5, 2020. I removed it at 1:28 PM on Friday, November 6.</p>



<p>It was an… interesting experience. I don’t recommend it, but I’m glad I did it. I’m not sure where to begin in describing it, especially since I couldn’t take notes, and part of the challenge was being confused. But I’ll do my best to break down the experience.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0818/3417/products/Les_Sublimes_Cashmere_Scarf_Dark_Blue_packshot_2048x.jpg?v=1539973736" alt="Large Cashmere Scarf in Dark Blue | Les Sublimes" width="427" height="427"></figure></div>



<h2><strong><span>Blindfold</span></strong></h2>



<p>To simulate blindness, I used a dark blue scarf as a blindfold. One layer wasn’t quite dark enough, so I folded it in half for extra light defense.</p>



<p>With the blindfold securely on, my vision was the same whether my eyes were open or closed. I kept my eyes closed 99.9% of the time since it was usually more comfortable and helped limit light. I occasionally opened my eyes to check the brightness level and to… I guess you could call it <em>stretch my eyelids.</em> They don’t feel good if you leave them closed for too long.</p>



<p>I couldn’t get a perfect scarf seal around my eyes, so sometimes when I tilted my head back while sitting I noticed a little light come into the bottom of my vision. To limit this, I often pinched the scarf around my nose in that position. But many/most blind people can see some light anyway, so I don’t think this was a significant violation of the experiment.</p>



<p>My eyes got quite dry under the scarf, so I applied moisturizer to this lids and sockets four or five times. I wanted to use eyedrops too, but there was no way to do so without failing the experiment.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Blindness</span></strong></h2>



<p>Initially, everything was black, but as the day went on and the sun went down, I could tell it was nighttime even through two layers of scarf and my eyelids. I’m not sure if I could tell because my eyes had adjusted to become extremely sensitive to light, or if there were other subtle signals (ie. noises, air temperature, circadian rhythms, etc.) which my body picked up on. As evidence of the latter, I could not see any difference between the tv being on or off, nor the refrigerator being opened or closed, even when I was sitting right in front of either.</p>



<p>What I saw depended on how I applied my focus. If I did focus on my vision, I’d see the typical blackness you get from closing your eyes, but it was never perfectly black nor uniform; there was always some odd movement and occasional coloring (whiteness, pale blue, or sometimes red). The most common distortions were a swirling or flowing whiteness, sort of like cream in coffee. I hoped that being blindfolded for so long would make the distortions more extreme, but for the most part it looked no different than what you’d see if you closed your eyes right now for ten minutes.</p>



<p>There was one exception. It must have been about 20+ hours into the experiment, and my eyes were itching, so I rubbed both of them at the same time over the scarf. If you rub your closed eyes and focus on your sight any time you can see some weird stuff, but this was far more extreme than usual. I remember my entire vision filling up with white bubbles which then broke and briefly returned to black. Then white lightning bolt shapes stretched across my sight, expanded to make my vision purely white, and then slowly faded back to black. The strangest thing about it was the <em>brightness</em>. I literally felt like I was staring into lights despite being blindfolded in a dark room. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 30 seconds, but my heart was racing.</p>



<p>More notable than what I saw was what I didn’t see. By default, I was lost in thought and I focused on nothing. In such a state, I didn’t even register my vision or notice the darkness. I <em>think</em> this made my imagination and mental visualization more acute. On occasion, I’d be deep in thought and I’d get the <em>brightness</em> sensation again because I’d be mentally picturing something so vividly that the inevitable return to darkness felt like shutting off the lights in my brain. I’ll explain more about this in the <strong>Three Phases</strong> section.</p>



<p>Sadly, I did not hallucinate, or at least not as far as I could tell.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Energy</span></strong></h2>



<p>This was the most surprising aspect of the experiment.</p>



<p>I read that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117902&amp;page=1#:~:text=Without%20light%20cues%20that%20the,as%20a%20result%2C%20researchers%20say.">blind people have trouble getting to sleep</a> because they don’t access any/enough light for their circadian rhythms. I seem to have the exact opposite problem. Without light, my body always thinks it’s time to sleep and has trouble doing anything else. Throughout most of the experiment, I felt extremely lethargic, lazy, and had to fight to stay awake.</p>



<p>I started my first failed experiment attempt at 10:30 AM. I had gotten 7.5 solid hours of sleep, I hadn’t done anything tiring the previous day, and I generally felt fine. Then I put on my blindfold, and within thirty minutes I was nodding off. I semi-slept for two hours before deciding to get an energy drink to get myself out of the funk. That worked, but as soon as it wore off, I was back in semi-sleep mode.</p>



<p>Even when I was firmly awake, I generally felt weak and lethargic. Movement around the apartment was annoying of course, but made so much more difficult by my energy levels. I ended up lying perfectly still in my comfy computer chair with my feet on a table 95% of the time. That is, when I wasn’t lying in bed.</p>



<p>On the other hand, when I removed my blindfold after 24 hours, I experienced a <em>burst</em> of energy. Seriously, it was like I had downed a double shot of espresso. It was like a switch had been flicked. The haziness and cobwebs were gone in an instant, and I felt the energy coursing through my body. I guess light has a big impact on me.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Movement</span></strong></h2>



<p>I moved exactly how you’d expect… clumsily.</p>



<p>For the most part, I slowly walked around my apartment with a hand out to feel for walls and edges. Sometimes I’d get lazy and crawl just so it was easier. I know my apartment well enough that it wasn’t hard to get around, but every once in awhile I’d lose track of where I was and would be left slowly swinging my arm around searching for anything. It’s not a pleasant sensation.</p>



<p>Before the experiment, I had planned to pace around for fun, or maybe even do some exercise with the free time. But the confusion and especially the lethargy stopped all that. I just sat in my chair and didn’t move unless I needed to get a drink, go to the bathroom, or sleep.</p>



<p>I kind of wish I had done the experiment in an unfamiliar environment to add to the movement challenge, but oh well.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Necessities</span></strong></h2>



<p>For food, I ate a big lunch at 10 AM before the experiment and then munched on dark chocolate throughout the night. I felt the heavy lethargy well before the lack of calories was an issue. I probably should have put some prepackaged meals in my fridge to eat, but I was worried about making a mess and not being able to clean up. Do I want ants? Because that’s how I get ants.</p>



<p>For drinks, I could manage to get to the kitchen and fill a cup with water when I needed to. I never took a full cup back to my chair just in case I knocked it over (clean up would be a nightmare). I also had some diet coke to serve as entertainment and put a little caffeine in me.</p>



<p>For the bathroom, I (a man) peed sitting down. I’m not ashamed to admit it.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Time</span></strong></h2>



<p>As part of the experiment, I never knew what time it was. This was intended to confuse me throughout the 24 hours, and it did, but it may have helped too. With no sense of time, it was easy to sit back and not think about it. Time drifted by and I existed. That was that.</p>



<p>I actually did ask Siri for the time once… it was late in the experiment, and it felt like I had put on the blindfold forever ago. As you’d expect, …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Travelers aboard a luxury TransAtlantic cruise have shared pictures that many in the crypto community believe could provide clues on the missing 4 billion dollars raised during the EOS ICO. </p>



<p>DoubleSpend’s own analysis based on the size of the box show that it could very well contain the amount in USDs that was raised in the year-long ICO.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="45d72c63-4641-3f9f-f271-8df897413c12"><p>Alright the future of work is here to stay and we all need to prepare for the best remote work practices. Regardless of what happens, work has changed forever, people will go back to the office surely, but the dynamic will now be a hybrid mode.<br>‍</p><p>So learning how to work remotely will be a skill in your arsenal that might just propel you to your next career promotion. If you've asked yourself the question "how to work from home" - you've reached the right place.<br>‍</p><h4>1) Create a routine</h4><p>If you want to succeed working from home or working remotely this is a must, which is why it's the top position. You need to build a system that builds a body clock. I used to get into the zone when I got onto the train and grabbed by morning coffee at my office, when I couldn't do this anymore I spiraled. This was until I started building an atomic habit again, micro habits that signal the mind for whats about to happen next. Nowadays my trigger is early morning juice, similarly so, build a routine. Get out of bed, go to the gym, have a process.<br>‍</p><h4>2) Have your creative work space</h4><p>Separate your living, from your office space. Even if it means working from a coffee shop. You need to keep your area of comfort for leisure and work for work. This is an important work tip as separation of concerns as well as "environments" make a significant difference to motivation. Pretty much the same reason people go to libraries when they can read at home</p><p>‍</p><h4>3) Set time boundaries</h4><p>Its very easy to be sucked into 24 hour work when working from home. One of the keys to working remotely is creating time boundaries. Employers may feel like you're available to message after work hours. In addition you might get FOMO from all the slack notifications. Fight the urge, set your boundaries. 80% of 130 people I spoke to said they were constantly fatigued from working from home. This is a very important tip amongst other work from home tips and tricks. Stay disciplined to time<br>‍</p><h4>4) Leave home</h4><p>How to be productive working from home ? Leave your home. Ironic - I know but cabin fever can creep into you. As humans we need social interaction and movement. Step away from your home, go for a walk, meet a friend or better yet exercise. This will stimulate both your body muscles as well as your brain. Feeling fresh air graze your face makes a big difference, especially when you're glued to your screen<br>‍</p><h4>5) Plan meetings with work colleagues</h4><p>We've been remote for nearly 1.5 years now and I always advice social meetings for working remotely. Catch up with any team-mate in the same city as you and make it a monthly if not weekly thing. Building bonds with people in real life not only helps you create long lasting relationships, but also helps you connect deeper with another person. 70% of communication is non - verbal, which you miss out over zoom calls.<br>‍</p><h4>6) Reduce distractions</h4><p>"Minimise the number of distractions you have in your office" - simple yet sage advice for working remotely. We've got a concentration span of 12 seconds, with slack messages going off every moment combined with our innate nature of not wanting to miss out on important conversations leads us to doing absolutely no work at all. I encourage you to embrace an async first work culture, tools like <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/">remoteworkly.co</a> help with async video meetings or even loom for screen recording.<br>‍</p><h4>7) Have no meeting Wednesdays</h4><p>Meets really hurt productivity. 72% of managers say meetings are a complete waste and 60% of employees think they will work better without meetings. This is the same reason Zoom fatigue is becoming a big issue, because you need to have your camera on and focus the entire time. Try encourage a culture where you have certain days with no meetings. Any conversation that needs to happen can occur in an asynchronous way, weather thats via tools like <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/">remoteworkly.co</a> or vidyard. If you're reporting bugs, use feedback tools like bugheard or <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/show">remoteworkly.co/show</a></p><h4><br>8)Avoid unwanted meetings with conversation bloat</h4><p>Focus on getting work done, try set a decorum where you can leave meetings you're not needed in anymore. Teams that embrace the concept of async communication will win. This will reduce anxiety within teams, improve culture and make sure the meetings that do happen are purely focused on value and outcome. This can be done using tools like <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/">remoteworkly.co</a> for async meetings and startups or even voice notes like recordify</p><h4><br>9)Start with the toughest task</h4><p>There's a science behind this but it works. We often think starting with easy tasks gives us the feeling of accomplishment and builds up momentum. There is some truth to this, however by the time you reach the tough/long task to complete you're left drained of energy and delay it to tomorrow, which never comes. Start with the toughest tasks, its the best way to be productive working from home<br>‍</p><h4>10)Over communicate</h4><p>There will be obvious disconnect between you and your team mates when you're remote. That is the nature of VoIP communication. So make sure you overcommunicate. This does not mean to spam people with 100 messages, but rather use video and tools that capture as much data as possible for you to make it easier for the other person to understand what you're doing without having to reach back to you."</p><h4><br>11)Leverage asynchronous communication</h4><p>My favorite tip in my list of remote work best practices. I strongly believe async communication is the way of the future. Leverage using async communication whenever and wherever possible without organizing impromptu/time blocking calls. There's several tools out there that let you take full advantage of async communication, <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/">remoteworkly</a>, <a href="http://loom.com/">loom</a>, <a href="http://vidyard.com/">vidyard</a>, <a href="http://marker.io/">marker</a> (for website feedback), <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/show">remoteworkly</a> (for QA feedback), <a href="http://trello.com/">trello</a>, <a href="http://asana.com/">asana<br>‍</a></p><h4>12)Use productivity hacks like pomodoro</h4><p>The pomodoro technique is one of the best productivity tips I came across. Its an old technique that lets you cut down your work into an investment reward balance. This builds another atomic habit loop where you learn to enjoy difficult tasks in anticipation of the reward. Your day is broken down into 25 minute work chunks of pure focus with 5 minute breaks, do this 4 times and then take a 20 minute break, rinse and repeat. Checkout timechi.com</p><h4><br>13)Share your project progress</h4><p>The easiest way to start working when you're feeling down or demotivated is by sharing your progress. Social accountability plays a big role in human motivation, something about putting our reputation at risk that kicks us in the behind. In addition, sharing your progress becomes a incredible feedback cycle, where you encourage others with your progress or cause them to reach out to you and motivate you to push faster. Lastly, having progress updates is a great way to look back and see how far you come, consequentially motivating you to work better</p><h4><br>14)Avoid jumping on impromptu phonecalls</h4><p>This rolls back to my earlier point about async conversations, Paul Graham mentioned that one of the downfalls of remote work is impromptu meetings where a large number of incredible ideas are usually generated is being robbed from todays workforce. Yes this is true, but on the flip side, most of the inefficiencies in working from an office came from these "tap on the shoulder" interruptions. I no longer pick up calls unless the message following up says "this is urgent", your concentration is sacred in 2020. Protect it at all costs.</p><h4><br>15)Set clear expectations for each day</h4><p>Employing a daily manifest of long term goals, short term goals, micro tasks as well as schedule has been a game changer in working remote. You almost get to "grade" each day in terms of the success you wanted to achieve and what you did achieve. This lets you work out what is the most effective work from home schedule for you. Each week, analyze the good days and bad days, pick up patterns that lead to bad days and those that lead to good days and optimize to focus on the good patterns.</p><h4><br>16Share with video whenever you can</h4><p>To prevent the feeling of isolation, use video software whenever you can. <a href="http://loom.com/">Loom</a> is a great place to begin, or even zoom for work meetings. I know it can be daunting at times, but it provides a great path to building deeper and more meaningful relationships with teams. PS - when you're chatting, look into the camera and not your screen. Makes double the impact</p><h4><br>17) Ask for one on one checkins</h4><p>Do NOT cancel your one on ones with your team mates, they're more important than every given there is no face to face relationship with your direct supervisor or subordinate. Use a template with a clear structure to find out how your team is doing, how things can be done better. This builds trust and encourages them to keep motivated even when people feel disconnected.<br>‍</p><h4>18) Bond with your team beyond work, get to learn about their family</h4><p>Use tools like <a href="http://donut.com/">donut</a> to encourage your team members to learn about each other. This is vital for new employees who don't have a chance to meet new people given you're restricted to a computer, donut runs introduction meetings between people. Encouraging that communication between new colleagues is a great way to improve team bond, morale and company culture</p><h4><br>19) Exercise</h4><p>Yes, do it. As human's we're not made to be seat potatoes. Despite how tasty potatoes are, you can't aspire to be one. Get out, hit the gym and exercise. The endorphins release as well as adrenaline rush you get post exercise is fundamental for peak performance. You won't find one successful person who doesn't preach for a daily exercise schedule</p><h4><br>20) Use noise filtering software</h4><p>Working at home with kids or even a dog can be very disturbing and sometimes embarrassing. Even though everyone is working remote, the noise of a grinder in the background whilst you're delivering your Q4 results can be quite distractive. Use tools like <a href="http://krisp.ai/">krisp</a> that magically cut out background noise and give you the confidence that regardless of who's speaking at the back, your colleagues won't be able to hear it.<br>‍</p><h4>21) Check in with 5 of your friends</h4><p>I assure you many of your friends will be …</p></div></div>

        <p>tl;dr — If you feel unfocused, grab a pen and paper and start writing your thoughts down.</p>
<p>Is there a question you are stuck on? A ambiguous goal you're trying to accomplish? Maybe a task you know you need to do but from which you keep getting distracted?</p>
<p><strong>Nothing will provide focus like pen and paper.</strong></p>
<p>It's all too easy these days to have a clear intention only to be sidetracked by the whirlpool of apps and services clawing for our attention on our devices.</p>
<p>It helps to take the time to groom our notification settings for importance and timeliness, but a digital device that we can use to complete nearly any task will never stand up to pen and paper in terms of it's ability to provide focus.</p>
<p>My thoughts are a constant whirlwind, I'm certainly more distractible than most, and interacting with nearly any online service only fuels that fire. So how can I get anything done if I'm unable to control my focus?</p>
<p><strong>Pen and paper.</strong> Whenever I catch myself stuck in the whirlpool, feeling not-great because I <em>know</em> I'm not doing what I want to be doing, or what I should be doing, I step away, grab pen and paper, and start writing.</p>
<p>The simple act of writing can focus my thoughts and attention in a way that nothing else can. Free from distractions, just a canvas to pour my thoughts into, and turn them into something with a sense of direction and purpose.</p>
<p>Writing is like a superpower to me. If there's any task I want to accomplish, the first step is always to write it down. Anytime I need to recenter myself on that task, I simply return to paper.</p>
<p>Throughout my life I've found that the simplest solutions are often the most powerful. So far I've found no simpler solution to start tackling any problem than to simply write it down, and then keep on writing.</p>

   the way things are described really resonate with me.
   available as a free pdf but i got a paper copy to support the authors after reading the
   first half.

<p><b><a href="http://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/">Linear Algebra and Learning from Data</a>
   by Gilbert Strang.</b>
</p>
<p>this is gilbert's most recent work. it's really great, he's such a good teacher, and
   <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/">his freely available lectures</a>
   are even better. it's a shorter text than his other classic intro below with
   more of a focus on how things are connected to modern machine learning techniques.

<p>this was my favorite linear algebra book for a long time before his 'learning from

	<div>
	  <p><span>The American people deserve an urgent, robust, and professional response to the growing public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. President-elect Biden believes that the federal government must act swiftly and aggressively to help protect and support our families, small businesses, first responders, and caregivers essential to help us face this challenge, those who are most vulnerable to health and economic impacts, and our broader communities – not to blame others or bail out corporations. </span></p>

<div data-module="" id="covid-19-2" data-new-section="false" data-id="covid-19-2">
  <div>
	<div>
	  <div>
	   <p>The Biden-Harris administration will always:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listen to science</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ensure public health decisions are informed by public health professionals</strong></li>
<li><strong>Promote trust, transparency, common purpose, and accountability in our government</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris have a seven-point plan to beat COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure all Americans have access to regular, reliable, and free testing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Double the number of drive-through testing sites.</li>
<li>Invest in next-generation testing, including at home tests and instant tests, so we can scale up our testing capacity by orders of magnitude.</li>
<li>Stand up a Pandemic Testing Board like Roosevelt’s War Production Board. It’s how we produced tanks, planes, uniforms, and supplies in record time, and it’s how we will produce and distribute tens of millions of tests.</li>
<li>Establish a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps to mobilize at least 100,000 Americans across the country with support from trusted local organizations in communities most at risk to perform culturally competent approaches to contact tracing and protecting at-risk populations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix personal protective equipment (PPE) problems for good.</strong></p>
<p>President-elect Joe Biden is taking responsibility and giving states, cities, tribes, and territories the critical supplies they need.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully use the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of masks, face shields, and other PPE so that the national supply of personal protective equipment exceeds demand and our stores and stockpiles — especially in hard-hit areas that serve disproportionately vulnerable populations — are fully replenished.</li>
<li>Build immediately toward a future, flexible American-sourced and manufactured capability to ensure we are not dependent on other countries in a crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Provide clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance for how communities should navigate the pandemic – and the resources for schools, small businesses, and families to make it through.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Social distancing is not a light switch. It is a dial. President-elect Biden will direct the CDC to provide specific evidence-based guidance for how to turn the dial up or down relative to the level of risk and degree of viral spread in a community, including when to open or close certain businesses, bars, restaurants, and other spaces; when to open or close schools, and what steps they need to take to make classrooms and facilities safe; appropriate restrictions on size of gatherings; when to issue stay-at-home restrictions.</li>
<li>Establish a renewable fund for state and local governments to help prevent budget shortfalls, which may cause states to face steep cuts to teachers and first responders.</li>
<li>Call on Congress to pass an emergency package to ensure schools have the additional resources they need to adapt effectively to COVID-19.</li>
<li>Provide a “restart package” that helps small businesses cover the costs of operating safely, including things like plexiglass and PPE.</li>
</ul>

	<div>
	  <div>
	   <p><strong>Plan for the effective, equitable distribution of treatments and vaccines — because development isn’t enough if they aren’t effectively distributed.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Invest $25 billion in a vaccine manufacturing and distribution plan that will guarantee it gets to every American, cost-free.</li>
<li>Ensure that politics plays no role in determining the safety and efficacy of any vaccine. The following 3 principles will guide the Biden-Harris administration: Put scientists in charge of all decisions on safety and efficacy; publicly release clinical data for any vaccine the FDA approves; and authorize career staff to write a written report for public review and permit them to appear before Congress and speak publicly uncensored.</li>
<li>Ensure everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected — in America receives the protection and care they deserve, and consumers are not price gouged as new drugs and therapies come to market.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protect older Americans and others at high risk.</strong></p>
<p>President-elect Biden understands that older Americans and others at high-risk are most vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force, as proposed by Vice President-elect Harris, to provide recommendations and oversight on disparities in the public health and economic response. At the end of this health crisis, it will transition to a permanent Infectious Disease Racial Disparities Task Force.</li>
<li>Create the Nationwide Pandemic Dashboard that Americans can check in real-time to help them gauge whether local transmission is actively occurring in their zip codes. This information is critical to helping all individuals, but especially older Americans and others at high risk, understand what level of precaution to take.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rebuild and expand defenses to predict, prevent, and mitigate pandemic threats, including those coming from China.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately restore the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, originally established by the Obama-Biden administration.</li>
<li>Immediately restore our relationship with the World Health Organization, which — while not perfect — is essential to coordinating a global response during a pandemic.</li>
<li>Re-launch and strengthen U.S. Agency for International Development’s pathogen-tracking program called PREDICT.</li>
<li>Expand the number of CDC’s deployed disease detectives so we have eyes and ears on the ground, including rebuilding the office in Beijing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implement mask mandates nationwide by working with governors and mayors and by asking the American people to do what they do best: step up in a time of crisis.</strong></p>
<p>Experts agree that tens of thousands of lives can be saved if Americans wear masks. President-elect Biden will continue to call on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every American to wear a mask when they are around people outside their household.</li>
<li>Every Governor to make that mandatory in their state.</li>
<li>Local authorities to also make it mandatory to buttress their state orders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we succeed in getting beyond this pandemic, we must ensure that the millions of Americans who suffer long-term side effects from COVID don’t face higher premiums or denial of health insurance because of this new pre-existing condition. The Biden-Harris Administration will work to ensure that the protections for those with pre-existing conditions that were won with Obamacare are protected. And, they will work to lower health care costs and expand access to quality, affordable health care through a Medicare-like public option.</p>

        by the network inside a protocol that is supported by the network.</p>
    <p>The following are some of terms used in this article:</p>
    <table id="col2-table">

      <p>So, why do we need <span>tunneling</span> ??? The following are some of the reasons:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p>To allow access to legacy applications or unsecure services such as IMAP, POP3, VNC, etc</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To implement a virtual private network (<span>VPN</span>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To allow access to services behind a firewall</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>There are <span>3</span> types of <span>SSH Tunnel</span> options as listed below:</p>
      <ol id="blue-ol">
        <li>
          <p><span>Local</span> Port Forwarding</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Remote</span> Port Forwarding</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Dynamic</span> Port Forwarding</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>We will discuss and demonstrate each of the above options in the following sections.</p>
    <p>Setup</p>
    <p>The setup will be on a Ubuntu 20.04 LTS based Linux desktop. For the demonstrations, we will create an environment with
        3 virtual machines running on the hypervisor <span>VirtualBox</span>.</p>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the environment setup:</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/ssh-tunnel-2.png" alt="Environment"></p><p>Environment</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following are some of the highlights of the 3 virtual machines:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p><span>vm-1</span> :: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB storage, Ubuntu 20.04 OS, and uses a single virtual network
            interface with <span>NAT</span> networking (<span>10.0.2.15</span>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>vm-2</span> :: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB storage, Ubuntu 20.04 OS, and uses a single virtual network
            interface with <span>Host-only</span> networking (<span>192.168.56.104</span>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>vm-3</span> :: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB storage, Ubuntu 20.04 OS, and uses a two separate virtual
            network interfaces - one with <span>NAT</span> networking (<span>10.0.2.4</span>) and the
            other with <span>Host-only</span> networking (<span>192.168.56.103</span>)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Open a Terminal window in each of the 3 virtual machines <span>vm-1</span> thru <span>vm-3</span>
        and install <span>Python Flask</span>, <span>Net Tools</span>, and <span>SSH Server
        </span> by executing the following command:</p>
    <p>$ sudo apt install python3-flask net-tools openssh-server -y</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Resources covering software development under Inferno are fairly scarce.</p>
<p>As such, this post aims to provide a start-to-finish demonstration of program development in Limbo inside Inferno.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This post assumes you’re using Inferno, specifically <a href="https://code.9front.org/hg/purgatorio/">purgatorio</a>, hosted under <code>linux/amd64</code> or similar.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to use Inferno under Docker as per the <code>INSTALL</code> file.</p>
<p>Other platforms are supported, but steps may differ here or there.</p>
<p>The rune <code>$</code> indicates a unix shell command under <code>bash</code>, probably.</p>
<p>The rune <code>;</code> or <code>%</code> indicates a command to be run from inside Inferno.</p>
<p>The final source from this post: <a href="https://github.com/henesy/socketh-limbo">https://github.com/henesy/socketh-limbo</a></p>
<p>This post will be an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/henesy/SocketH">SocketH</a> which was originally written in Go and has a few other implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/henesy/socketh-myr">https://github.com/henesy/socketh-myr</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/henesy/SocketS">https://github.com/henesy/SocketS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The original code isn’t great, but it gives a target for what we want to create.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Many, if not all, of these development steps prior to <em>running</em> the final Dis bytecode can be done from outside of Inferno.</p>
<p>The limbo compiler can be called as <code>limbo</code> and with the right workflow development may be more pleasant.</p>
<p>This post assumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development occurs inside of Inferno for the purpose of consistency</li>
<li>Some knowledge about imperative, C-like, language programming</li>
<li>Some knowledge about how unix-like systems work</li>
<li>Some knowledge about how C-like compiler and linker flows work</li>
<li>Knowledge about how to interact with a unix-like shell</li>
<li>Vague knowledge about Inferno, such as the fact Inferno exists ☺</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-inferno">Build Inferno</h3>
<p>Steps provided are targeted for <code>linux/amd64</code> as a host for Inferno.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://bitbucket.org/inferno-os/inferno-os/">Inferno</a> tree is hosted over <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://code.9front.org/hg/purgatorio/">purgatorio</a> fork is hosted by the 9front project over <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a>.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We can break this down a bit.</p>
<p><code>implement</code> declares a module by name.</p>
<p>A module definition must be provided indicating exported functions from the module:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">SocketH: module {
	init: fn(nil: ref Draw-&gt;Context, argv: list of string);
};
</code></pre></div><p>Note how a variable name of <code>nil</code> is used to drop assignment of a value.</p>
<p>The <code>init</code> function is special in shell-loaded Limbo programs and its signature <em>must</em> match what the shell expects the init function interface to be.</p>
<p>Functionally, <code>init</code> is equivalent to <code>main</code> in most other languages.</p>
<p><code>include</code> imports an external module’s definitions into our scope.</p>
<p><code>load</code> performs the dynamic loading of a module at runtime.</p>
<p><code>exit</code> performs the dynamic un-loading of a module at runtime.</p>
<p><code>raise</code> will throw an exception with a given string as its content.</p>
<p>We refer to names inside a module using the <code>-&gt;</code> operator.</p>
<p>We can jointly assign and declare in one step using the <code>:=</code> operator.</p>
<p>Curly braces are optional.</p>
<p>Semicolons are not.</p>
<p>Note the absence of a reserved <code>main</code> module. This is due to each <code>.dis</code> file, potentially an independent module, being theoretically loadable in its own right. A reserved name would cause significant issues with namespaces ☺.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-a-workflow">Setting up a workflow</h3>
<p>Compiling our program should be as straightforward as running the Limbo compiler against our source file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">% limbo socketh.b
% lc
.git/		LICENSE		socketh.b
.gitignore	README.md	socketh.dis
% socketh.dis
%
</code></pre></div><p>This program does nothing right now, but that’s fine.</p>
<p>Note how we can omit the <code>./</code> when running <code>.dis</code> programs.</p>
<p>Calling the limbo compiler each time is a bit of a pain, and if we start using commandline flags this will become tedious to type.</p>
<p>In acme, we could type the text we want to run in a tag or window and middle-click said text to run the compilation (or more!) on-demand. In Inferno, acme comes with a <code>Limbo</code> command in the default window tag, but that only works for one file.</p>
<p>We can simplify this process by writing a <s>makefile</s> <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/mk/">mkfile</a>!</p>
<p><code>mkfile</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">&lt;/mkconfig

DISBIN = /dis

TARG = socketh.dis

&lt;/mkfiles/mkdis
</code></pre></div><p>Mk semantics are similar to make with some changes.</p>
<p>How mk will behave inside Inferno using the <code>mkdis</code> mkfile as the trailing import:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mk can import outside mkfiles using the <code>&lt;</code> operator</li>
<li><code>mk</code> will call <code>mk all</code> which resolves to the <code>all</code> (default) target</li>
<li><code>mk install</code> calls the <code>all</code> target and copies the <code>TARG</code> file(s) to the <code>DISBIN</code> destination directory</li>
<li><code>mk clean</code> removes files such as <code>.dis</code> and <code>.sbl</code> from the working directory</li>
<li><code>mk nuke</code> calls the <code>clean</code> target as well as delete the ‘target’ files such as the <code>/dis/socketh</code> binary if the <code>install</code> target has been called</li>
</ul>
<p>A demonstration:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">% lc
.git/		LICENSE		mkfile
.gitignore	README.md	socketh.b
% mk
limbo -I/module -gw socketh.b
socketh.b:15: warning: argument argv not referenced
% lc
.git/		LICENSE		mkfile		socketh.dis
.gitignore	README.md	socketh.b	socketh.sbl
% mk install
rm -f /dis/socketh.dis &amp;&amp; cp socketh.dis /dis/socketh.dis
% mk clean
rm -f *.dis *.sbl
% whatis socketh
/dis/socketh.dis
% mk nuke
rm -f *.dis *.sbl
cd /dis; rm -f socketh.dis
% whatis socketh.dis
socketh.dis: not found
% lc
.git/		LICENSE		mkfile
.gitignore	README.md	socketh.b
%
</code></pre></div><p>Note the Limbo compiler flags being passed by default now for the <code>all</code> target.</p>
<p>At this point, I usually add <code>mk clean &amp;&amp; mk</code> to my acme tag and run that for multi-file or more complex Limbo programs. This flow is very similar to how I do development under Plan 9.</p>
<h3 id="common-patterns">Common patterns</h3>
<h4 id="commandline-flags">Commandline flags</h4>
<p>We can use <a href="https://seh.dev/limbo-intro/man.postnix.pw/purgatorio/2/arg">arg(2)</a> to process commandline flags:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>…</span>

<p>Like a tightly written function, I prefer to exit early if no work should be done. So, if you disagree with these definitions and assumptions, now’s a good time to stop reading.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable productivity:</strong> The maximum rate of quality work output, without loss to the wellbeing of the developer</li>
<li><strong>Quality work:</strong> Software that meets requirements, is valuable to users, is maintainable, and is as bug free as possible</li>
<li><strong>Attention:</strong> The limited mental capacity to focus on a task</li>
<li>Sustainable productivity is desired</li>
<li>Attention is essential to sustainable productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>My high-level workflow looks something like this: identify the problem to solve; think on the problem and let ideas percolate; research, discuss, and experiment with these ideas; implement and test the solution; deliver and maintain the solution.</p>
<p>This cycle could repeat many times in a day. Or I could spend days stuck on a single cycle step. Every step in this cycle requires attention. The more attention I can devote, the more cycles I can complete, and the more productive I am.</p>
<p>How long you can focus on a task varies by person. Some people are very good at it out of the box, some people, not so much. Regardless of the hand you were dealt, I believe that focus (the act of devoting your attention) is a skill, and like any skill, can be improved with practice.</p>
<p>So, how can you increase your attention reserves? The most bang for your buck is to organize your outside world in such a way that it’s distraction free as possible. Once you do that, you’ll have more time to practice, and therefore more time to get better.</p>
<p><strong>Build physical strength.</strong> The damage done by sitting 8+ hours a day is underrated. You need a way to offset this damage, especially if you plan to work in this field for decades. Opinions abound on this topic, but I personally prefer deadlifts. There are few movements more primal than picking a heavy object off the ground and standing up with it. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYREQkVtvEc">learn correct technique in little time</a>. I most like deadlifts because you can do them safely, at high weights, into old age. I also like the hand, back, and hip strength they give, to make it that much harder for sitting damage to have its way with you.</p>
<p><strong>Make your place of work boring and tidy.</strong> My office is a spare bedroom. The walls are blank. There’s no tv. There’s a desk, chair, laptop, laptop stand, keyboard, mouse, and mouse pad. There’s a window, which lets enough light in so that I don’t feel like I’m missing a beautiful day, but not too much light to cause screen glare. If I need to work with paper, it’s immediately filed somewhere when done. Like I said, boring and tidy.</p>
<p><strong>Make your smart phone dumb.</strong> My phone has all notifications disabled, except for calls and text messages. Well, and National Hurricane Center alerts, since I live in Louisiana. Unless you’re my wife, you know that I don’t respond to text messages immediately, that’s just how it is. I disabled my social media accounts some time ago. But if you have them, turning off notifications should help curve the urge to compulsively check them.</p>
<p><strong>Be an OS minimalist.</strong> Apps I use less commonly are a keypress combo away. Given this, my dock has only the apps I use on a daily basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>File system explorer</li>
<li>Internet browser</li>
<li>Terminal</li>
<li>Text editor for front-end code and notes</li>
<li>IDE for back-end code</li>
<li>IDE for database</li>
<li>Visual file differ for version control</li>
<li>Email client</li>
<li>Instant message client</li>
</ul>
<p>My desktop alternates between clean and dirty states. Files I’m currently working with live on the desktop. Then they’re filed away into sensible folders when done.</p>
<p><strong>Organize your browser bookmarks.</strong> When I read something useful that I may need to reference later, I file it under a general archive folder. Then more specific items get their own folders. Frequently accessed links are visible on my bookmarks bar under their own folder.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize meetings.</strong> Look, I know some things make sense to discuss face to face, or voice to voice. But if they don’t, then you don’t need a meeting. An email or instant message will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">The Eisenhower Method</a> to categorize your tasks.</strong> Imagine a grid of 4 quadrants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Important and Urgent</li>
<li>Important and Not Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important and Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important and Not Urgent</li>
</ul>
<p>Important and Urgent tasks have to be dealt with. For me, these are usually major production issues.</p>
<p>Important and Not Urgent tasks should absorb the bulk of your time. For me, this is the plain old development work of implementing features, fixing bugs, and making existing code more maintainable and performant. Also included are building relationships with others and planning ahead.</p>
<p>Not Important and Urgent tasks are nasty attention thieves. They shout out to you in immediacy, but offer little value in return. You know what these are for you. For me, these are most often lazily asked questions, where the asker did not do their due diligence, and expects a top-notch answer immediately. Also included are last-minute meetings, and over-talkative coworkers.</p>
<p>Not Important and Not Urgent tasks are usually not known to your users. Take internal documentation updates as an example. Thing is, they’re an investment in yourself, which means a more productive future “you”. So don’t forget to show them some love in your spare moments.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  
<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 08 November 2020</em></p><p>A few days ago I had the displeasure of helping a friend reinstall Windows on
their laptop, which had previously contained Ubuntu. The reason for their switch
isn’t that important – although I helpfully suggested keeping Linux, it was
their machine and their decision. I didn’t expect the process to be particularly
difficult. After all, I work on operating systems for a living now, so I didn’t
expect any trouble. But to my surprise, I encountered a nearly dystopian
situation before I even got to the desktop.</p>

<p>I started the process by creating a bootable USB from the ISO downloaded from
Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO">download page</a>. It feels weird writing that, but yes, the ISO
seems to be freely, easily downloaded. No product key was required to download,
or even install. The USB creation process was not easy (Microsoft suggests using
Windows to create the bootable USB, a chicken-and-egg problem if ever there was
one). It seems that the standard <code>dd</code> process used by every Linux vendor does
not work here – instead you need to get the correct magic incantations of
partition types and filesystems, and then copy files from the ISO file into the
USB. I ended up falling back to a tool called <a href="https://github.com/slacka/WoeUSB">WoeUSB</a> to do this process,
after three failed manual attempts.</p>

<p>The real fun started after I (finally) successfully booted from the USB and
started through the installation wizard. Cortana loudly greeted me, telling me
she’d walk me through the installation process using my voice. I must say that,
while I don’t really care to have a voice assistant guide me through OS
installation, I can see it helping a lot of folks out there, if it works
properly (I did not test it). I’m glad that Microsoft is at least trying this
out!</p>

<p>I went through the (impressively quick) installation process, and the laptop
automatically rebooted. It prompted me to connect to the Internet, which I
foolishly did. Directly after connecting to WiFi, the wizard asked me to login
with a Microsoft account!</p>

<p>I chuckled internally. “Classic Microsoft, asking for a silly cloud login just
to use Windows,” I thought. I don’t know my friend’s MS account login, and even
if I did I wouldn’t link their OS account to some cloud account!</p>

<p>I searched for the cancel button, but couldn’t find one. I tried to submit the
form with empty username and password, but that didn’t work. Realizing that I
might be trapped, I got my phone and fired up Google.  Surely, Microsoft
wouldn’t make it <em>impossible</em> to setup a new PC without linking it to their
cloud, right?</p>

<p>I found an <a href="https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/how-to-setup-windows-10-without-a-microsoft-account/">article</a> which said that, by disabling the Internet connection I
had just configured, I could skip the login process. So, I hit the back button
on the installer. The wizard animated for a moment as if it was working, and
then showed me the same login screen. No matter how many times I hit the back
button, the wizard did not let me go back to the Internet configuration page!</p>

<p>“They haven’t got me yet,” I thought. I held down the power button and rebooted
the computer. Certainly on reboot I would restart the process, and could skip
the Internet configuration, right?</p>

<p>The laptop rebooted to a Microsoft Account login page.</p>

<p>So, I did what any self-respecting, conscientious friend would do for a friend:
<strong>I reinstalled Windows all over again.</strong>  This time, during the setup wizard
after the reboot, I skipped configuring an Internet connection. I was greeted
with this page:</p>

<p><img src="https://brennan.io/images/win10-nointernet.png" alt="win10-nointernet"></p>

<p>This, to me, felt kind of chilling. After all, it’s not like I asked not to use
a MS account. All I did was decide not to configure Internet on my first boot,
which has nothing to do with linking a MS account. After all, maybe I just don’t
have Internet access at the moment, or maybe I forgot the WiFi password.  Why
should the installer lecture me about the benefits of a MS account when simply I
did not configure WiFi? It felt obvious that this was a bald-faced statement:
“we know you’re avoiding our login process, and in a few years we’ll get rid of
this loophole too. Welcome to the future!”</p>

<p>I clicked the text (which wasn’t highlighted as a link or as a button) which
said “Continue with limited setup”. This was an odd phrasing, given that none of
the operating system features I’m familiar with (scheduling processes, providing
a unified interface to hardware devices, etc) requires a cloud account.</p>

<p>At this point, I was allowed to create a “local account” for my friend, and
finish the setup. I was presented with a list of preferences, all helpfully
enabled by default:</p>

<p><img src="https://brennan.io/images/win10-privacy.png" alt="win10-privacy"></p>

<p>The irony here is beautiful. Ads “may be less relevant to you”. The only entity
this harms is Microsoft, being able to avertise at you less (within your very
<em>operating system</em>, no less). Why should they bill this as a negative?</p>

<p>After disabling all of the toggles, the desktop loaded for the first time, I
noticed the following at the bottom right:</p>

<p><img src="https://brennan.io/images/win10-edge.png" alt="win10-edge"></p>

<p>I used MS Edge to install Firefox, and closed it out. On reboot, the login
screen contained two advertisements (!!!) for MS Edge. I returned the laptop to
my friend, grateful I didn’t have to use this horror show of an operating
system.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-even-matter">Why does this even matter?</h2>

<p>I spend my workday working on operating systems. Don’t get me wrong, I’m new to
the field, and I have a lot to learn. But as far as I know, <strong>there is no
feature in a modern operating system which requires a cloud account login.</strong> (I
would love to be educated if this claim is false, please get in touch!)</p>

<p>I used to spend my career working on machine learning and data analysis. One
thing I remember from my “past life” is that <strong>there’s nothing better than
linking different types of identifiers together.</strong> If Microsoft can track you by
your “Windows installation ID” and also by your “Microsoft Account”, then <em>of
course</em> they want to link those two identifiers together.</p>

<p>More links means more data about you. What applications you run, what sites you
visit, etc. An operating system as at the root of what you trust when you use a
computer. Do you use online banking? Your operating system can read the password
to your bank account, the balances, and more, directly out of memory! I’m not
suggesting that Windows does that – I just want to illustrate the sort of trust
you implicitly use every time you login to your bank account on Windows (or Mac
OS for that matter). But maybe Microsoft just looks at how frequently you login
to your computer, or what sites you’re interested in. What DNS queries does your
OS resolve? What IP addresses have you used in the last 90 days?</p>

<p>All of the data which is obvious to your operating system, can be linked to your
personal identity when you connect it to a cloud account. Don’t get me wrong,
even if you don’t connect it to a cloud account, you still are getting
incredible amounts of telemetry and tracking recording your every move. But why
would you voluntarily give more links and data to Microsoft?</p>

<p>I don’t think most people understand the sort of data they’re giving over to
Microsoft when they login and use Windows. These dark patterns that Microsoft
employs are sickeningly obvious, and really difficult to avoid. Why would I
trust a company that tries to manipulate its customers into such total data
collection, to be responsible with the data it receives?</p>

<p>I can’t imagine how frustrating it must be to be an operating system developer
at Microsoft. I have a lot of respect for the operating system kernel they make.
It seems to be one of the few major non-Unix like kernels out there. It seems
fascinating and I’d love to learn more about it. But it must be frustrating to
see the product of your hard work go out packaged with software capable of
collecting and tracking your users’ every move, and thrown together with an
installer intent on forcing them to submit to this data collection.</p>

Invest into ASAP and build up that MOAT.</p><p><strong>FB / Social Media</strong><br>Its a hit or miss. Don't waste time curating the perfect Ad or post. Tim Doyle of Eucalyptus shared that his most profitable Ad was not some high quality video but rather a Doge meme.</p><p><strong>Velocity is everything</strong><br>When building companies you NEED to move fast, there is no alternative to it.</p><p><strong>Product</strong><br>Product led growth is the BEST type, its natural and doesn't feel forced.</p><p><strong>Distribution</strong><br>This is probably just as much if not more important than the content or product itself. Build with distribution in mind, articles / SEO or products.</p><p><strong>SLC</strong><br>NO ONE wants to use an MVP - stop using that mindset. Literally no one other than your Mum/Dad will use a "minimum" "viable" thing you build. Its 2020, the whole patchy product cycle doesn't exist. Aim for Simple, Loveable and Complete (or what I call Minimal Product for Impact) Introduce simple features that meet your north star and make sure they're complete.</p><p><strong>Cold Email</strong><br>Learn to master this, its a great skillset to have in building a company and distributing content.</p><p><strong>Feature Validation</strong><br>Before you build a feature, literally build a simple landing page, run some GAds to it for lifetime deals (this doesn't work always, but for some apps).</p><p><strong>Communicate</strong><br>Build every channel possible to communicate with your user as often as possible for as long as possible.</p><p><strong>No CC No Bueno</strong><br>UNTIL someone gives you their CC, you don't have validation. Do not take anything else as validation other than their CC.</p><p><strong>Timeframe</strong><br>Before you start, set a goal to hit, if you don't hit that goal, be quick to reflect. Build more or move on Last but the MOST important.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong><br>Almost 90% of all the "Super successful" founders attributed having a previous built audience as their reason for success. They built this audience through, podcasts, blogs, Youtube, Tiktok or even Newsletters. BUILD. AN. AUDIENCE. You have a higher chance of succeeding with a shit product and a large audience than vice versa For those that are keen.</p><p>All the best peeps!</p></div><p>-Vaibhav<br></p><blockquote><em><strong>Vaibhav</strong></em> has built several startups into Million Dollar businesses serving Millions of customers across the globe via five2one.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Big-O"><div>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2240" height="1260" src="https://www.danielleskosky.com/wp-content/uploads/media-uploads/bigO/bigo-banner.png" alt="Big O Banner"></figure></div>


<p>Big-O is pretty important.&nbsp; It is the metric that is used to describe the efficiency of algorithms.&nbsp; Having a thorough understanding of Big-O is crucial for ensuring that algorithms are as efficient as possible.&nbsp; Let’s learn more about this fundamental computer science topic.</p>


<h2>What is Big-O?</h2>


<p>Imagine that there is a ship builder.&nbsp; Her name is Andrea.&nbsp; She makes big ships and small ships for a port city.&nbsp; She can make the small ships pretty quickly, but the bigger ships take longer.&nbsp; The amount of&nbsp;<strong>time</strong> that it takes her to build a ship is proportional to the&nbsp;<strong>size</strong> of the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea is also a pirate.&nbsp; She is known to steal other peoples’ ships.&nbsp; She usually does her pirating in a port town that is 10 days worth of travel by land and 5 days of travel back with the stolen ship, so 15 days round trip.&nbsp; The port town that she pirates from always has the ship size that she is looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a customer asks Andrea to build a ship, she has two options.&nbsp; She can either build the ship or she could put on her pirate hat and go steal a ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if someone wants Andrea to build a ship for them, which option should Andrea choose?&nbsp; That’s right!&nbsp; It depends.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build the Ship: O(s):</strong>&nbsp; where s is the size of the ship.&nbsp; This is <strong>linear</strong> time.&nbsp; The time that it takes to build the ship increases linearly depending on the size of the ship.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Steal the Ship: O(1):&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>this is <strong>constant</strong> time.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter how big or small the ship is.&nbsp; It will always take Andrea 15 days to get the ship back to the customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>So Andrea should build the ship if she can get it done in less than 15 days.&nbsp; If the ship is big enough that it would take longer than 15 days to build, then Andrea should go steal the ship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a side note, this blog does not condone stealing and Andrea should really rethink her life of crime.</p>
<p>Here is a graph that represents the relationship between linear O(s) and constant O(1) time:</p>


<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="532" height="484" src="https://www.danielleskosky.com/wp-content/uploads/media-uploads/bigO/constant-linear.png" alt="Constant v linear"></figure></div>


<p>There are many more possible runtimes that can occur besides linear and constant.&nbsp; Here is a graph that shows some of the more commonly-used runtimes:</p>


<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1618" height="1130" src="https://www.danielleskosky.com/wp-content/uploads/media-uploads/bigO/complexity-chart.png" alt="Complexity Chart"></figure>


<p>The above complexity chart comes from the <a href="https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big-O Cheatsheet</a> website.&nbsp; Definitely a useful resource!</p>


<h2>The Three Cases</h2>


<p>Let’s use quick sort as an example.&nbsp; Quick sort picks a random element as a pivot and then swaps the values so that the elements less than the pivot appear before the elements that are greater than the pivot.&nbsp; Then it uses recursion to further sort the left and right sides.&nbsp; Learn more about quick sort <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best Case:</strong>&nbsp; The best case means that the algorithm is given the most ideal data.&nbsp; If all elements are equal in the array then quick sort will just have to traverse the array once.&nbsp; Traversing an array of <strong>N</strong> elements will give a runtime of&nbsp;<strong>O(N)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Worst Case:</strong>&nbsp; The worst case means that the algorithm is given the least ideal data.&nbsp; With quick sort, it could happen that the pivot is repeatedly the biggest element in the array.&nbsp; If this were to happen then instead of the subarray being recursively divided in half each time, the subbarray would only be reduced by one element.&nbsp; This would give a runtime of&nbsp;<strong>O(<b><i>N</i><sup>&nbsp;2</sup></b>)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Expected Case:</strong>&nbsp; Typically instead of having a worst case or a best case you are more likely to have an expected case.&nbsp; Sometimes the pivot will be high and sometimes the pivot will be low, but over time they will average each other out.&nbsp; This will give a runtime more close to&nbsp;<strong>O(N log N)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best case runtime usually isn’t of too much interest when analyzing an algorithm.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<strong>worst</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>expected&nbsp;</strong>cases are the ones that need to be considered.</p>


<h2>Space Complexity</h2>


<p>Space complexity is used to describe the total amount of memory that an algorithm uses in respect to the input size of the algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an algorithm requires an array of size <em>n</em>, this will require O(n) space.&nbsp; If there is a two dimensional array of size&nbsp;<em>n </em>by <em>n, </em>then O(n<sup>2</sup>) space is required.</p>


<h2>Some Useful Big-O Tips</h2>


<p>There are a couple of tips that you should keep in the back of your mind when you are working on finding the Big-O.&nbsp; Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No constants</strong></li>
<li><strong>No non-dominant terms</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consider multiple runtimes</strong></li>
</ul>


<h2>No Constants</h2>


<p>With Big-O time the constants are not taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big-O notation doesn’t care about constants because Big-O notation only describes the long-term growth rate of functions, rather than their absolute magnitudes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An algorithm that might seem to be <em>O(2N)</em> is actually only <em>O(N).&nbsp; </em>Here is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22188851/why-is-the-constant-always-dropped-from-big-o-analysis#:~:text=Big%2DO%20notation%20doesn't,rather%20than%20their%20absolute%20magnitudes.&amp;text=A%20function%20whose%20runtime%20is%20n2%20%2F%202%20will%20be,runtime%20is%20just%20n2." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack Overflow post</a> that does a pretty good job of describing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a look at some code:</p>

<pre title="">int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
for (int x : array) {
    if (x &lt; min) {
        min = x;
    }
    if (x &gt; max) {
        max = x;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The runtime is O(array.length) or O(N).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s take look at some more code:</p>

<pre title="">int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
for (int x : array) {
    if (x &lt; min) {
        min = x;
    }
}
for (int x : array) {
    if (x &gt; max) {
        max = x;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Your first intuition might to be assume that because there are two for loops that iterate the length of the array that the runtime must be O(2N).&nbsp; Don’t fall into this trap!&nbsp; The runtime is O(N).&nbsp; Remember to drop the constant!</p>


<h2>No Non-Dominant Terms</h2>


<p>What if you get a runtime like O(<i>N</i><sup>&nbsp;2</sup> + N)?&nbsp; What should we do then?&nbsp; Well, if you were able to deduce that we should drop the non-dominant term, then congratulations!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the runtime O(<i>N</i><sup>&nbsp;2</sup> + <i>N</i><sup>&nbsp;2</sup>).&nbsp; This is the same as O(2<i>N</i><sup>&nbsp;2</sup>).&nbsp; We know that we should not include constants in our runtimes.&nbsp; So if one of the <i>N</i><sup>&nbsp;2</sup> terms is ignored then we can ignore the N in O(<i>N</i><sup>&nbsp;2</sup> + N) as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>O(<i>N</i><sup>&nbsp;2</sup> + N) becomes O(<i>N</i><sup> 2</sup>).</li>
<li>O(N + logN) becomes O(N).</li>
<li>O(5*2<sup>N</sup> + 1000N<sup>100</sup>) becomes O(2<sup>N</sup>).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Consider Multiple Runtimes</h2>


<p>If we had to iterate through two arrays of the same length N then we could say that the runtime was O(N) (remember to drop constants!).&nbsp; However what happens if the arrays are of different lengths?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a look at some code:</p>

<pre title="">for (int a : arrA) {
    print(a);
}

for (int b : arrB) {
    print(b);
}
</pre>

<p>We are iterating through two arrays of different lengths.&nbsp; The runtime is O(A + B).&nbsp; Both runtime lengths must be considered!</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some more code:</p>

<pre title="">for (int a : arrA) {
    for (int b : arrB) {
        print(a + "," + b);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>If the arrays were of equal length we could say that the runtime was O(<i>N</i><sup>&nbsp;2</sup>).&nbsp; However, the arrays are different lengths.&nbsp; This means that for every element of A, arrB will be iterated through.&nbsp; This results in a runtime of <br>O(A * B).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><h3><a href="https://boredhacking.com/">Bored Hacking</a></h3></header><main><p>November 08, 2020<!-- --> | <b>4<!-- --> min read</b></p><div><p>Onboarding can be a very hectic and stressful time when you are starting a new job. New coworkers to meet, new codebases to learn, new languages to learn, new technologies, new processes, and the list can go on and on. Good onboarding materials and processes can go a long way when you’re first starting out. However, it shouldn’t just be a one way street. Onboarding should be a collaborative and incremental process that every new hire(and employee) actively contributes to. Things change from onboarding class to onboarding class, especially in a fast moving startup. It is therefore not only up to the existing members but also the new hires to contribute to the onboarding experience and documentation to keep it up to date and make it better overtime. Here are some recommendations for making onboarding not only productive for you but also better for future new hires.</p>
<h2>Take Your Time to Onboard</h2>
<p>Onboarding isn’t a race to the finish line. It can feel like you need to onboard as quickly as possible and be productive right away. However, you have to remember that Rome wasn’t built in a day and this time is important to build a good foundation for the rest of your time at the company. You don’t want to jump in before you’re ready and struggle to keep up. Take your time to properly onboard, and learn as much as you can during this time. Your team will be understanding that you are onboarding and shouldn’t feel like you need to be productive from day 1. Although there is generally a set time period for new hires to still be onboarding, the first month or two generally depending on your company. Take full advantage of your expected onboarding period. When you run into something you don’t know or haven’t seen before, take the time to really dig into it and learn it. Do your own research or ask teammates about it and make sure you fully understand it. Once again, this will pay off in the future and help you compound your knowledge as you continue to learn and work at the company.</p>
<h2>Write and Update Documentation</h2>
<p>As you are onboarding hopefully there is already some documentation on how to at the very least setup local development. Depending on your company, you may also have documentation on team specific information, common tasks, etc. Find out what your company uses to store documentation(Google Drive, Github, Notion, Confluence, Dropbox Paper, etc.) and look through it for even more documents. As you go through this documentation, if there’s anything that doesn’t make sense or is outdated make sure to update the documentation. And if you realize there isn’t any documentation for something you encountered then you should write it! Anything you do while onboarding that didn’t have clear directions or documentation, feel free to write it up yourself. Even once you are done onboarding, you should continue this. Every little improvement will benefit someone else down the road and make them productive quicker, multiplying your effect and increasing overall productivity.</p>
<h2>Take Notes During Onboarding</h2>
<p>Take notes of things that went well during your onboarding and things that could have gone better. These will be important for improving the situation for the next hire(s). Take these notes to your manager and talk through the good and bad. This will help the organization understand what they are doing well and what they can do to make it better for the next hire on your team. Your manager will want to make sure they are doing everything they can to help you onboard better and improve the situation for the future.</p>
<h2>Ask Questions</h2>
<p>Asking questions and getting good answers is incredibly important during onboarding. You may get blocked often while onboarding because there are a lot of unknowns and that’s okay. But don’t wait too long to unblock yourself. One big thing to remember is, you should never hesitate to reach out to someone because they seem too busy. They may be busy but they will normally make the time to help onboard new people. Although not all onboarding buddies may be okay with constant interruptions, it is reasonable that you should try and limit their context shifting. Therefore, setup time to talk with your onboarding buddy or teammate. Setting up time can help limit this but also ensure you get your questions answered. At first this should probably be a set time daily for the first week, but as you continue to onboard it can be less often.</p>
<h2>Good Onboarding and Helping Out New Hires is a 10X Situation</h2>
<p>The 10x engineer is often talked about in tech and seen as a unicorn of sorts. For those not familiar, it was commonly thought that a 10x engineer performed 10 times as efficiently as other engineers, performing the work of 10 engineers. However, I don’t think that a 10x engineer should only be more efficient but I think 10x engineers are engineers who help 10X the learning of other engineers as well. A 10x engineer helps their whole team be more efficient by teaching and mentoring them. This applies directly to onboarding and new hires. The faster new hires onboard the faster they can be productive. Spreading information to more people makes everyone better and creates a cycle of spreading information, which can lead not only to a 10x situation but a 100x situation where multiple people within your org are increasing their knowledge and productivity by 10x. The real “unicorn” engineers are the ones who lift up the whole organization or team, and onboarding is a key component of that. Everyone should realize the importance of a good onboarding period for new hires and how it can help the organization as a whole.</p></div><hr><ul><li><a rel="prev" href="https://boredhacking.com/starting-a-new-elixir-project/">Starting a new Elixir Project</a></li><li></li></ul></main></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="course-description"><a name="description"></a>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course is a second-year course for computer science majors. It is the primary data structures course in the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a>’s <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/">computer science</a> curriculum. Unlike many other data structure courses at other institutions, it is intended as the <em>third</em> course in sequence, meaning that students are expected to have taken two semesters of Java (or equivalent, although some of the examples are specifically from Java). The course focuses on how programs and data are represented from the high level down to the low level. For programs, we examine (from high to low): abstract data types, Java code, C++ code, C code, assembly (x86) code, and a customized machine language. For data, we examine (also from high to low): abstract data types, objects, primitive types, and how numbers are encoded (both floats (IEEE 754) and integers (two’s complement)). About two-thirds of this course is programming using C++. The remainder of this course uses other languages, including (in decreasing order): x86 assembly, IBCM (a machine language), C, Objective C, and shell scripting.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.abet.org/">ABET</a> course objects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand program representation from the high-level programming language perspective down to the underlying machine level representation, including: number representation, operations, conditionals, and control structures</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic and advanced abstract data types in C++ including: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs</li>
<li>Be able to evaluate asymptotic time and space complexity analysis of programs and data structure implementations using Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation and assess the suitability of a data structure for a particular problem</li>
<li>Understand the basic program execution model and the underlying computer hardware and software (fetch-execute cycle, memory hierarchy, operating system, compiler)</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic program control and data structures in an assembly language (loops, conditionals, subroutines and parameter passing modes, arrays)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdown"><a name="markdown"></a>Markdown</h2>
<p>The majority of the content in this repository was created using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. Unfortunately, the only standardized Markdown is very old (2004), and has limited support for many HTML features, such as tables. A simple conversion script in a Makefile is in the <a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/utils/index.html">utils</a> (<a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/index.md">md</a>) directory, which uses <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>. Assuming pandoc is installed, run <code>make markdown</code> in the root repo directory to re-create all the .html files from their associated .md files.</p>
<p>For all the Markdown files in this repository, both the original (.md) file and the HTML version (.html) are added to the repository, so that people who do not have Markdown installed can still view the contents of this repository.</p>
<p>Note that Github supports an enhanced version of Markdown, called <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">Github Flavored Markdown</a>, or GFM. This mostly pertains to this README file. In an effort to ensure compatibility with other Markdown programs (such as the one described here and what reveal.js uses), GFM specific features are generally avoided. One example is the use of anchors in this document – the HTML tags are included instead of using GFM’s version.</p>
<h2 id="source-code"><a name="sourcecode"></a>Source code</h2>
<p>All source code is formatted via <a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/">astyle</a> and then highlighted via <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/source-highlight.html">source-highlight</a>. Both the original file (foo.cpp) and the highlighted version (foo.cpp.html) are included in the repository. All links to source code will like to the .html, with a “(<a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/README.md">src</a>)” after it to link to the original source code. Utility scripts are provided to convert all the files in the <a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/utils/index.html">utils</a> (<a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/index.md">md</a>) directory. <code>make format</code> and <code>make highlight</code> can also be run to invoke the scripts.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>I wanted to share my journey from start to finish to restore a 1983 IBM Model F XT mechanical keyboard to it's former glory.  It includes the steps, mistakes, and additional hardware required to make it functional with a modern computer.  This blog post is dedicated to my dad for teaching me about computers.</p>
<p><img alt="original.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/original.jpg"></p>

<p>A few months ago, my dad asked if I was interested in taking ownership of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">IBM model 5150 PC</a>.  Without hesitation, I said "yes!".  The first project I wanted to tackle was to restore the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_F_keyboard">1983 Model F XT mechanical keyboard</a> keyboard.  In a sentimental and
journeyman/apprentice-sense, it felt like my dad was passing on the tools of his craft to continue the family line of
computer work and I couldn't pass that up.</p>
<p><img alt="datestamp.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/datestamp.jpg"></p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with the IBM Model F, <a href="https://www.modelfkeyboards.com/">modelfkeyboards.com</a> summarizes it
nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IBM Model F keyboards not only used the best switches, the materials used in their production (well over 5lbs of
steel and other metals) means they will be working as good as new when it’s time to pass it on to your grandchildren.
The problem...they just aren't made that way any more.  The IBM Model F was discontinued in the 1980's.  If you do
find a Model F, it will be some combination of dirty, broken and/or expensive, requiring hours of work to get it
working again!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tank of a keyboard weighs in at over 6 pounds, sounds like <a href="https://youtu.be/XTVeSCqYSmE?t=7">this</a>, and at the
time of production, retailed for $300-400 in 1982 ($800-1000 dollars adjusted in today's dollars!) according to this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Jds326gks">review</a>.</p>
<p>The restoration did take a few hours and fortunately none of it involved a soldering iron or replacing any of the
electrical or physical components because it was already in great functioning shape...a true testament to the design.
Even cooler, this blog post was typed up using the restored Model F keyboard!</p>

<p>Before beginning the project, I discovered <a href="https://www.clickykeyboards.com/">ClickyKeyboards</a>, a site "Specializing in
the restoration and collection of model M keyboards", the successor to the Model F.  On ClickyKeyboards, there is a
section dedicated to the adapters and converters that may be required to make older 5-pin DIN plug keyboards compatible
with modern USB ports.  One of the companies mentioned on ClickyKeyboards is
<a href="https://www.hagstromelectronics.com/">Hagstrom Electronics</a>, which sells keyboard encoders and protocol converters.
Without looking too closely at the other products, I quickly purchased the
<a href="https://www.hagstromelectronics.com/keyboard-encoder-ke18-xtat-ps2-shp.html">KE18-XTAT-PS/2</a> which "converts an XT
keyboard into a PS/2 protocol keyboard" for $55.  I was ecstatic that there was at least something to get me into PS/2
land, because at that point I knew I could easily find a PS/2 to USB converter.</p>
<p>After the KE18-XTAT-PS/2 arrived, I quickly fired up an ancient box (yes, that is Windows 2000!) with a PS/2 input on
the motherboard.  I tested all the keys to ensure they still worked and they did!  With confirmation that the keyboard
still worked, it was time to start the restoration.</p>
<p><img alt="win2000.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/win2000.jpg"></p>

<p><img alt="original2.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/original2.jpg"></p>
<p>The first step was to remove the metal casing and see what the state of the board was underneath the keys.  There was
years worth of debris, coffee stains, and gunk that had to be removed.  In addition, there were a few spots with
corrosion on the board that needed to be addressed.</p>
<p><img alt="preclean.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/preclean.jpg"></p>
<p>Once the casing was off, I utilized compressed air to clean out the key bunkers and get rid of any loose nastiness.
Next, I tried using rubbing alcohol and Q-tips to try and remove some of the stickier stuff, but that didn't
really work.</p>

<p>I borrowed a rotary tool to buff out the corrosion.  I used one of the provided bits that had soft plastic tentacles to
try and buff out the corroded spots as gently as possible.  There are likely better and more appropriate bits, but it
did the job.  The rotary tool's power and RPMs were a bit overkill even on the lowest setting.  Ideally, I would have
used one with fewer minimum RPMs and a more precise bit to get all the spots.</p>
<p><img alt="buffing_tool_and_bit.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/buffing_tool_and_bit.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="bit.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/bit.jpg"></p>
<p>I was using the rotary tool under a bright overhead desk lamp, and with the way the light was reflecting, I didn't
notice it was taking off the black finish and revealing the silver metal base.  At that point, I just decided to buff
off the finish where I could to make it look more uniform.  The silver metal is visible when the keys and cover are back
on it, but it looks fine.  Unfortunately, with the rotary head and bit size, I wasn't able to buff every last square
inch of the board, but I knew it'd be covered so I wasn't too concerned with it looking perfect.</p>
<p><img alt="allbuffed.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/allbuffed.jpg"></p>

<p><img alt="postbuffing.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/postbuffing.jpg"></p>
<p>There was still some residue stuck to the board that I wanted to remove.  I started out using a small eye glass
screwdriver to scrape it off, but it took some of the black finish off as well and didn't look that nice.  At that point,
a chemical pivot was required and I reached for the <a href="https://googone.com/">Goo Gone</a>, which I should have done from the
beginning.  The Goo Gone and a bit of elbow grease with Q-Tips did the trick in removing the stubborn gunk on the board.</p>
<p><img alt="postgoogone.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/postgoogone.jpg"></p>

<p>With the board in good shape, it was time to tackle the actual keys.  I first gave them a good wipe-down using desk
cleaning wipes, which removed most of the discoloration and stains.  However, they still didn't look as good as they
could, and I read that just soaking them in a bowl of dish soap and water for a few hours can do wonders...and it did.
They keys look brand new.</p>
<p><img alt="keybath.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/keybath.jpg"></p>
<p>One mistake I made after washing them was to not let them completely dry on the inside.  I placed the keys back on the
board too soon, and some water leaked onto a few of the springs causing a small amount of rusting (slightly visible in
the post-Goo Gone image).  I gave them another soap soak and used the compressed air to really get out the water.  I
also let them air dry for 1-2 days before putting them back on the board.</p>

<p>After successfully testing the actual keyboard and the restoration almost complete, it was time to search for a PS/2 to
USB cable.  On a whim, I was back on the Hagstrom Electronic site and noticed they already had a small box, the
<a href="https://www.hagstromelectronics.com/ke-xtusb-keyboard-encoder-shp.html">KE-XTUSB</a>, that converted the XT signal to USB,
and it was the same price.  They graciously allowed me to return the KE18-XTAT-PS/2 in exchange for the KE-XTUSB which
was the same price.  A few days later the KE-XTUSB arrived in the mail and I eagerly connected it to my current computer.</p>
<p><img alt="xtusb.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/xtusb.jpg"></p>

<p>Everything worked beautifully except for two keys.  The "s" key's spring mechanism would either not detect a key press
or would be stuck in the depressed state blasting "sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss" across the screen.  With a
bit of finagling, I got the key cap placed correctly so now it works like a champ.  The other key that has issues is the
accountant's "+" near the 10 key pad.  The spring had come off somehow and I super glued it back, but something still
isn't right and it fails to register key strokes.  Not a huge loss since "+" can be achieved with another key
combination.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm really impressed with how it looks and, when comparing it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2bAhxK76hc">this</a>
unboxing video of a never before opened Model F, it looks about the same!</p>

    <p>About three months ago I unconsciously or perhaps consciously lost interest in ham radio. This isn’t the first time this has happened to me, in fact this was what lead me to allow my license to lapse the first time in 2016. If it weren’t for a new coworker of mine showing interest in ham radio again after a twenty-five year absent; I presumably wouldn’t be writing this post now. His excitement about all of the recent advances that have been made since he was first license reminded me of the things I missed about ham radio. This forced me to reflect on the reasons that I stepped away from the hobby for nearly three months. After some time I narrowed it down to three primary reasons. Without further ado I present to you my three reasons I took a break from ham radio.</p>
<h2 id="1-2020-amsat-board-of-directors-election">1. 2020 AMSAT Board of Directors Election</h2>
<p>I love satellite operations! It was my primary reason for returning to the hobby earlier this year. Shortly after becoming licensed I joined AMSAT to support amateur radio in space. Little did I know there was an ongoing dispute among two newly elected board members and the rest of the board of directors. Apparently the dispute was over the access of to AMSAT’s finical records with the lengthy ordeal playing out like some pollical scandal with lawyers and secret audio recordings. The board of directors went as far as <a href="https://www.amsat.org/amsat-leadership-explains-2018-2020-legal-expenses/">releasing a statement</a> that was full of contempt for the two new directors. In turn Patrick Stoddard WD9EWK, one of the individuals at that center of this controversy <a href="http://amsat.wd9ewk.net/">released his own statement</a> on the events that transpired. All of this drama culminated with those who sided with Mr. Stoddard attempting replace three of the existing board members with there of their own candidates. Ultimately they were unsuccessful in their coup attempt, and I’ve exhausted all interest in being a part of AMSAT.</p>

<h2 id="2-limited-radio-budget--limited-operating-options">2. Limited Radio Budget = Limited Operating Options</h2>
<p>Whether you want to admit it or not, ham radio is an expensive hobby. Sure you can purchase a Baofeng handheld for thirty-five dollars, but to really take advantage of all your license privileges you need to shell out some cold hard cash for either an HF rig or an all mode VHF/UHF radio. Initially, I wanted to get on the air as quickly and cheaply as possible to try my hand at working a few of the FM satellites, as a result I purchased an Arrow Antenna II and the Wouxun KG-UV8D Plus. To make a long story short, the Wouxun radio was garbage. Don’t believe me <a href="https://www.kj7nzl.net/blog/wouxun-kg-uv8d-plus-fm-satellites/">check out my review of the Wouxun KG-UV8D Plus</a>. After some time of fooling around with that dumb thing, I decided to purchase a Yaesu FT3D and I’m glad I did. On a side note, I should absolutely do a review of that thing since I’ve had it for about three months now and I’ve explored most everything the radio has to offer. With the KG-UV8D I was limited in how I could operate. With just supporting FM I really only could use the thing for satellites outside of using it to connect to any of the local repeaters in the area. On the other hand the Yaesu FT3D allowed me the ability to expore APRS and C4FM AKA System Fussion. This however came at the cost of three times the price of the KG-UV8D. All told, even after selling my KG-UV8D, I am about $600 into the hobby with an Arrow Antenna II, Yaesu FT3D, and Comet Dual Band HT antenna. Even with this setup I’m only able play around with FM satellites, APRS, and simplex/repeaters. I would have loved exploring some of the other areas of the hobby when I jumped back in the spring of this year, but discretionary funds were spread out among different things at the time.</p>

<h2 id="3-life-just-got-in-the-way">3. Life Just Got in the Way</h2>
<p>This year 2020 has been an unusual year for me. Between a global pandemic and finishing some of my basement, I’ve been very busy. As a result I’ve had little free time. What free time I’ve possessed has been divided between multiple hobbies with amateur radio taking a back seat most of the time. It’s my own fault really since I set out earlier this year with the goal of exclusively working FM satellites. I initial assumed it would be effortless to make time through out my day for a quick ten to fifteen minute pass. It made sense at the time; take a brief break, make a couple of contacts, and back to what I was doing before hand. But it turns out that FM satellite QSOs are hard work This in turn lead me to get frustrated very quickly and wish I could operate at my own pace whenever I felt like it. Just so you know, rarely do two FM satellite passes line up back to back when you want them two giving you a thirty to forty minute window of time in which to have fun. Looking back on my journey into ham radio, both the first time and second time, I should have just gone the HF route from the get go. Since I didn’t, I feel like I set myself up for disappointment. With very little motivation and other competing priorities it’s no wonder why I stepped away from ham radio as long I did.</p>

<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3>
<p>So what does the future hold for me now that I’m interested in ham radio again? Well, Santa is coming to town, and he’s going to have a new Yaesu FTDX 3000 wrapped up under three for me. I’ll finally be able to dive head first into the world of HF. I have some ambitious plans too. I’d like to explore some of the lesser used digital modes like Hellschreiber, Olivia, and Contestia. I’ll still jump on the FT8 bandwagon, but ultimately I want to explore all the digital modes. I also want to <a href="https://www.kj7nzl.net/blog/learning-morse-code-series/">learn morse code</a>, which I’ve unsuccessfully started and begin working som CW. The Yaesu FTDX 3000 contains some exceptionally attractive features for CW operations that I really want to take advantage of. Another area that I’m going to focus on coming up soon will be building a MMDVM hotspot. Sure I could merely purchase a prebuilt one, but what the fun in that? All in all I think the rest of this year and next year is shaping up to be a excellent time for me to get back into ham radio.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>Last month VMWare released what they have called <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/10/announcing-the-esxi-arm-fling.html">ESXi Arm-fling.</a> This new release allows you to install the same ESXi you know and love on an ARM processor. VMWare has certified a few systems for datacenter use. They also have certified it for the Raspberry Pi 4, but only for what they call “Far Edge”.</p>
<p>Today we are going to perform the installation on a Raspberry Pi 8GB and do some testing. While we generally feel <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/introducing-project-tinyminimicro-home-lab-revolution/">ProjectTinyMiniMicro</a> may be a better option for some, there are many enthusiasts who sing the praises of the Raspberry Pi. The Pi has exceptional power efficiency, scalability, and a small footprint.<span id="more-48249"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_48251" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48251"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1-800x670.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4" width="696" height="583" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1-800x670.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1-358x300.jpg 358w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1-696x583.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1-502x420.jpg 502w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1.jpg 1014w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48251">Raspberry Pi 4 CanaKit and a LovePI PoE HAT</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before we continue, it is worth noting that this installation is a little bit different than other Raspberry Pi installations. We will need a total of <strong>three</strong> different pieces of storage to complete this installation. You need a microSD card for the firmware, but in this guide that is ALL the microSD card will be used for. Then you will need a USB thumb drive to act as your VMWare installer. Finally, you will need a place to install VMWare to. While it is possible to install it to your microSD card, that is not officially supported. Instead, you want to look at a USB based solution or a network solution such as PXE or iSCSI.</p>
<h2>Preparing our Pi for ESXi</h2>
<p>You will need to grab the<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/"> NOOBS </a>image and&nbsp;burn it to your microSD card if you did not buy a kit with it preinstalled as we had. To do so you can utilize the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>.</p>
<p>When the NOOBs installer boots up, select the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) option. You do not need the full desktop version. We are only using the OS to update the EEPROM and get some other updates out of the way.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48252" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48252"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-800x501.png" alt="N" width="696" height="436" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-800x501.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-400x251.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-696x436.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-670x420.png 670w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS.png 921w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48252">NOOBS Selecting Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit</figcaption></figure>
<p>When the installation is completed, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a
sudo reboot</code></pre>
<p>After you have completed the EEPROM update, we need to now update the firmware and switch to the community UEFI firmware. First, start by going to the Raspberry Pi <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware">Github page</a> and download the latest firmware. Next, go to pftf’s UEFI <a href="https://github.com/pftf/RPi4">Github page</a>, and download it as well.</p>
<p>Safely shutdown your Pi and take the microSD card out. Next, plug your microSD card into a computer and prepare to update the files on it. To get started, we need to format the RECOVERY partition and rename it UEFI:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48259" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48259"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format.png" alt="Format" width="251" height="460" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format.png 251w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format-164x300.png 164w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format-229x420.png 229w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48259">SD CARD Format for UEFI</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, drag and drop the new files from the <strong>boot folder in the firmware-master</strong> onto the <strong>SD card</strong>. Start by going to the firmware-master folder and selecting everything. Once completed, you must remove the four files starting with the name “kernel”:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48260"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kernel.png" alt="Kernel" width="605" height="87" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kernel.png 605w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kernel-400x58.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48260">VMware ESXi Raspberry Pi Kernel in firmware-master</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, do the same thing for the files from the <strong>UEFI firmware</strong>. Make sure you <strong>replace/overwrite</strong>&nbsp;the files with the updated ones.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48255" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48255"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-800x347.png" alt="UEFI" width="696" height="302" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-800x347.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-400x173.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-1536x666.png 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-696x302.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-1068x463.png 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-969x420.png 969w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI.png 1829w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48255">VMware ESXi Raspberry Pi UEFI Setup</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, open the config.txt file in the UEFI drive. We need to modify it by adding a line</p>
<pre><code>gpu_mem=32</code></pre>
<p>You can now put the SD card back into your RPI.</p>
<h2>Setting up ESXi for ARM</h2>
<p>To get started you will need to navigate to <a href="https://flings.vmware.com/esxi-arm-edition#summary">VMware’s page</a> for ESXi for ARM. Once there you will need to create an account and download the ISO. You will need to burn this ISO to a separate USB thumb drive. To burn it to the drive, you can utilize <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48258" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48258"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi.png" alt="Esxi" width="352" height="485" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi.png 419w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi-218x300.png 218w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi-305x420.png 305w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48258">Rufus Esxi for Raspberry Pi</figcaption></figure>
<p>After you have burned the ISO to your thumb drive, you need to plug it into your Pi and turn it on. You will see a new UEFI boot menu, press escape, and get into the UEFI to make any changes.</p>
<p>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager&nbsp;</strong>and then click <strong>Limit Ram to 3GB</strong> and change it to <strong>Disabled</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48262"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-800x557.png" alt="Unlimited RAM" width="696" height="485" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-800x557.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-400x279.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-696x485.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-603x420.png 603w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-100x70.png 100w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM.png 1034w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48262">Unlimited RAM</figcaption></figure>
<p>Press <strong>F10</strong> and save the change you made. Exit the UEFI and press <strong>Enter</strong> to boot to the USB drive. The system will then boot into the ESXi installer. One option for installing ESXi to an SSD, using something like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-SATA-USB-Cable-USB3S2SAT3CB/dp/B00HJZJI84/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=usb+to+sata+startech&amp;qid=1604788276&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySDJEUE9JUUgxQzlQJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTM2MTQ1RDA0VFA3V0lJUUZYJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3MzMzOTgzUzAwNTNCQkxWSk9XJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==">Startech USB3.0 to SATA adapter</a>. Another option is to install it to another USB thumb drive and use iSCSI storage for your VMs.</p>

<p>Select your disk, it has to be one other than the USB installer drive or the microSD card. Once you have selected your disk, the installer will format it and destructively remove all data. You need only to assign a password and installation will begin. When you are done, simply remove the installation media and reboot.</p>
<h2>Getting Started in VMware ESXi on the Pi</h2>
<p>To get started, open a web browser on another computer and point it to the IP of your Pi. Once there, you should see the familiar ESXi home page. For more information on setting up ESXi, please see our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/building-a-lab-part-3-configuring-vmware-esxi-and-truenas-core/">Building a Lab series</a>.</p>

<p>The first step we should do is to add our NTP servers. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Manage&nbsp;</strong>then to <strong>System</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and finally to <strong>Time and Date. </strong>Add some NTP servers, then click on&nbsp;<strong>Services&nbsp;</strong>and start the <strong>ntpd</strong> service.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48265"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/time-and-date-800x399.png" alt="Time And Date" width="696" height="347" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/time-and-date-800x399.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/time-and-date-400x200.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/time-and-date-696x347.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/time-and-date-842x420.png 842w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/time-and-date.png 1034w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48265">VMware ESXi on Arm Fling Time And Date</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you wanted to add iSCSI storage you can. For my testing, I added a 1TiB iSCSI LUN from my production TrueNAS Core box.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can add it to a vCenter just like a normal ESXi host. You simply right-click on a datacenter, press <strong>A</strong><strong>dd Host,&nbsp;</strong>type your IP address, credentials and select a license.</p>

<p>At this point, you are basically ready to get going with the VMware ESXi on Arm Fling using your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<h2>A Word on Some Limitations</h2>
<p>There are some limitations to this setup, however. As one example, ESXi on Arm cannot run X86 compatible operating systems. As a result, you will not be able to install Windows in the traditional sense. At this time Windows 10 for ARM is not supported. You will be able to install operating systems compiled for Arm, however. As a result, we see Ubuntu Server being a more popular guest OS than Windows Server.</p>
<p>Using ESXi on a Raspberry Pi in conjunction with something like Kubernetes makes for an interesting solution, however. This gives us tinkerers the ability to build an entire three node cluster on a single Raspberry Pi. While I certainly would not suggest doing this in production, it is a fantastic opportunity for learning and development.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>As Patrick stated in his piece <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/of-bbq-and-virtualization-large-nodes/">of BBQ and Virtualization</a>, large nodes make sense. With the advent of ESXi on Arm, we get to look at the other side of that picture. If you need a highly available solution for a lightweight application, you can use a cluster of Raspberry Pis to build a vSAN capable of obtaining that goal. Alternatively, if you are new to this world and just trying to learn, having ESXi available gives you access to what is used in the enterprise.</p>
<p>One of the coolest possibilities for this platform is for the Raspberry Pi to become a witness node for a cluster in vCenter. If you have two production x86 servers and are planning to build a vSAN, a RaspberryPi can be added as a witness node. This will effectively save you a ton of money by not having to buy a full-blown third server. Using a small node like this in the future can lower both up-front as well as operating costs over time due to the low power consumption. A note of warning, however. That is not an officially supported topology by VMWare, but it is certainly interesting! For those using other virtualization setups such as standard KVM on Linux clusters, this is a great use case as well.</p>

<p>With Apple switching to Arm, NVIDIA looking to <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-in-major-shift/">acquire</a> Arm, and <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/an-arm-opportunity-with-cloud-service-providers/2/">Cloud Providers</a> looking more at Arm, VMWare has made a strong move here. To be clear, it needed to do this as it was falling behind in the edge. Likewise, VMware is many years behind Amazon AWS in the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/what-is-a-dpu-a-data-processing-unit-quick-primer/">DPU</a> architecture but is catching up with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/vmware-project-monterey-esxi-on-arm-on-dpu/">VMware Project Monterey ESXi on Arm on DPU</a>. It may be harder to buy a DPU today to work with ESXi on Arm, but it is relatively low-cost to simply get a Raspberry Pi. I am personally excited to see what happens next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>It feels wrong to use a tool without knowing fully how it works. As programmers it is hard to accept that there is only so much that can fit into our noggins at once, but looking at code benchmarks or stack traces to see that some large amount of time is spent in some low-level C code always makes me wonder what is really going on in there. Maybe you’re like me and occasionally start to use the ‘Go to definition’ IDE feature on standard libraries, and after a second or two of searching your window fills with scary underscores and <code>#DEFINE</code>s of things you didn’t know existed, you think maybe this thing was auto-generated and no human would bother writing this header-file-hell. Unsatisfied you go back to whatever you were working on, no closer to understanding what’s <em>really</em> going on down there.</p> <p>For me I was always perplexed by <code>malloc</code>. It’s a simple function, you ask for memory and it gives it to you. But <em>how</em> could a C function do that? What on Earth does it mean to <em>allocate</em> memory? Isn’t it all there, sitting on the bus, just <strong>waiting</strong> for us to issue some good ‘ol <code>MOV</code> instructions? Even worse, it is used <em>everywhere</em>. Even if you aren’t using C there’s a good chance you’re using <code>malloc</code>, every time you create a new object in a language implemented in C, like <code>cpython</code> for instance. It isn’t the only way to acquire memory, but it sure is a popular one.</p> <p>So let’s take a look at <code>malloc</code>, it can’t be that complicated right? Here’s a simple <code>malloc</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>From this you may be able to figure out what <code>sbrk</code> does. It gives us a chunk of memory. Specifically it allocates program heap memory of a given size and returns a pointer to it. What exactly is “it” that is being pointed to? Let’s start printing stuff and find out.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>);</span>
<span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"[a: %p]</span><span>\n</span><span>[b: %p]</span><span>\n</span><span>[c: %p]</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <div><div><pre><code>&gt; [a: 0x1065b4064]
  [b: 0x1065b4064]
  [c: 0x1065b40c8]
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Looks like <code>b</code> is the same as <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> is <code>b + 100</code> bytes. So <code>sbrk</code> returns a pointer to whatever the last ‘tip’ of the program heap is, and if we give it a size in bytes it’ll move that ‘tip’ up. Meaning if we <code>sbrk</code> ourselves that 100 byte chunk we can do whatever we want with it knowing that the next time we <code>sbrk</code> ourselves some more memory, it’ll be 100 bytes farther along.</p> <p>This may not be too satisfying, we’ve replaced one magical function with another. However, in this case <code>sbrk</code> is a system call. It’s going to jump the CPU over to some assembly to execute (the instruction set implemented by your CPU is very likely to have a set of functions for interfacing with memory), at least now we’re talking to the kernel instead of wondering what’s going in the the C standard library.</p> <p>So that’s <code>malloc</code>, simple right? Well judging from the length of this article you can probably deduce otherwise. There’s more here, and for two reasons:</p> <ol> <li><code>sbrk</code> is absolutely ancient and super-deprecated. In fact if you run these snippets on macOS you’re going to get tons of warnings (but hey, it still works!). It doesn’t work with virtual memory and it isn’t thread-safe. However, its API is very simple to use and <code>malloc</code> at one point in time very likely was implemented using <code>sbrk</code>.</li> <li>This implementation of <code>malloc</code> is incorrect. The first reason why, which you may be able to guess, is that <code>sbrk</code> can fail. Memory is a finite resource.</li> </ol> <p>According to <code>man sbrk</code>, the call can return -1 if it fails, but <code>malloc</code> is supposed to return <code>NULL</code>. This is fixed easily enough.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>chunk_start</span> <span>=</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>chunk_start</span> <span>==</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>?</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>:</span> <span>chunk_start</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>One more thing. <code>malloc(0)</code> has special behavior, it needs to return <code>NULL</code> as well, otherwise you’d be able to get a pointer back from <code>malloc</code> that you didn’t actually allocate, and that would be weird.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>size</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
  <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>chunk_start</span> <span>=</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>chunk_start</span> <span>==</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>?</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>:</span> <span>chunk_start</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Great, now the user can actually know whether their memory request was fulfilled. We’re still missing something though, the result of our <code>malloc</code> doesn’t work with <code>free</code>. What <em>is</em> <code>free</code> exactly?</p> <p>According to <code>man free</code>, <code>free</code> will remove the allocation (“free”ing the space) from an input pointer that was previously returned from malloc. Now <code>sbrk</code> has a feature where when a negative input is passed to it, it will move the tip of the heap <em>down</em> instead of up. So effectively it allows us to push and pop from the program heap, because the heap is a stack and computer terminology is silly.</p> <p>Unfortunately this isn’t enough for us. Imagine a user does the following:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>500</span><span>);</span>
<span>// We can now call sbrk(-500) to free a.</span>
<span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span>
<span>// But how do we free a from here?</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This is the age-old problem of trying to delete something from the middle of the stack. We could pop everything off of the stack until we reach the memory we’re trying to delete (storing it somewhere else, we could even use the disk), then pop the item to delete, then push everything else back onto the stack. This would be miserably slow. We could also abandon the stack mentality and just use <code>memcpy</code> to copy over the old bytes. This would also be very slow, usually we expect <code>free</code> to take an insignificant amount of time to complete. In either of these cases, we’ve created a new problem: when shifting all of the old memory to utilize the newly free’d space, all of the pointers in the program refering to that old memory would be invalidated.</p> <p>It looks like we’re going to have take matters into our own hands. Maybe in the future we’ll have more memory than we know what to do with and never free anything. Until then we’ll need to do something clever. We have one thing going for us though, <code>malloc</code> always returns a pointer to <em>contiguous</em> memory. If we have a single “hole” of <code>free</code>d memory in the heap large enough to use somewhere, we can use it. It’s simply a matter, then, of us keeping track of the allocated chunks (and the “holes” created by <code>free</code>ing those chunks) ourselves.</p> <p>So maybe it was wrong to say earlier that <code>sbrk</code> “allocates” memory for us, because now it seems like it just moves some pointer and tells us where it used to be. The actual “allocation” part of <code>malloc</code> is something we’ll have to implement. Let’s set up a general outline of what we want to accomplish.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>chunk</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We want some way to model the heap, so a linked list sounds simple enough. We could extend it to create an actual stack, but it isn’t really needed here. Normally we’d implement a linked list using <code>malloc</code>, but we’re implementing <code>malloc</code> so we can’t really use that, can we? So let’s just sneak our data structure in with the user data. The general idea is that for every chunk of memory allocated by <code>malloc</code>, the we store a few bytes (specifically <code>sizeof(Chunk)</code>) of metadata about that chunk right beforehand. We could store a pointer in Chunk to the actual user memory, but since the memory is contiguous we can easily compute where the metadata ends and the user data begins. <code>free</code>ing then becomes super easy, we can just get the metadata and mark that it’s no longer allocated. The hard part is using that information.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// Allocates a new chunk right after 'prev'.</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>chunk</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>From here you can devise faster ways of doing this. The memory-speed tradeoff here is real, you can avoid scanning the heap every time by reserving a portion of the start of the heap for a hash map storing holes by size requirement, but then of course you’ve got less of the heap for the user. You also need to consider the size of this portion. You won’t be able to grow it, since then you’d be invalidating user pointers.</p> <p>If speed is less of a concern, you’d want to scan the entire heap rather than stopping at the first available hole. With the above implementation the user would often get back chunks of memory where the allocation is actually greater than they requested. If you scan the entire heap, you can look for the smallest hole that fits the requirements. Another way of doing this is to terminate the chunk to always fit the requested size, creating a new chunk for the leftover data. You’d have to make sure whatever leftover has enough room for the metadata fields.</p> <p>This is why the data stored in the pointer returned from <code>malloc</code> is uninitiliazed, it may have been a chunk from some previously requested memory.</p> <p>The last bit is where we actually build up the heap model:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>Chunk</span><span>*</span> <span>allocate_chunk</span><span>(</span><span>Chunk</span><span>*</span> <span>prev</span><span>,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><p>Adding context to thousands of dots</p><p> published:&nbsp; <time datetime="2020-10-21T00:00:00+00:00"> 21 October 2020 </time></p></header><p>Adding a map to your visuals is a great way to quickly understand the geographic information you're trying to investigate. Thankfully there are quite a few packages and libraries (like <a href="https://geopandas.org/">geopandas</a>, <a href="https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/">cartopy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rossant/smopy">smopy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/python-visualization/folium">folium</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/TileMapBase">tilemapbase</a>, or <a href="https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ipyleaflet</a>) that can make creating these visuals fairly straightforward and easy in your jupyter notebooks or whatever stack you're using.</p><p>For this essay though, I'll walk through the process of adding a base-map from OpenStreetMap to you're matplotlib visuals without using any of these libraries. In the end, we'll have a visual much like this (very messy) scatter-plot of buses as they service route 16 in New Orleans.</p><img alt="A plot of the ~466,000 position reports for buses servicing route 16 as they work their way up and down South Claiborne Avenue, between South Carrollton Avenue and Harrah's near the French Quarter." src="https://bryanbrattlof.com/adding-openstreetmaps-to-matplotlib/route-16-plot.png"><div id="how-it-works"><h2>How it Works</h2><p>The ability to add our base-map to our <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> visuals relies on matplotlib's <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html">imshow() function</a>, which internally uses the <a href="https://python-pillow.org/">Pillow library</a> to display images, or any other two dimensional scalar data we want (like <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html">numpy arrays</a>).</p><p>For example, if we download <a href="https://bryanbrattlof.com/pages/hi/profile.png">my self-portrait</a>, we can add the image to a plot using code like this:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>import</span> <span>pyplot</span> <span>as</span> <span>plt</span>

<span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imread</span><span>(</span><span>'path/to/my/self-portrait.png'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imshow</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>)</span>

<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>show</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div><p>Resulting in a matplotlib visual that looks like this:</p><p><img alt="A matplotlib plot of a self portrait (stick figure drawing) of Bryan Brattlof" src="https://bryanbrattlof.com/adding-openstreetmaps-to-matplotlib/self-portrait-plot.png"></p></div><div id="creating-the-map"><h2>Creating the Map</h2><p>The easiest way to generate the base-map for <code>plt.imshow()</code> is to use a mapping service. These mapping services use enormous amounts of raw computing power to take the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm">terabytes of map data</a> and render a map for us. Today there are quite a few services available online. The one I enjoy working with (and the one we will be using in this essay) is a free, community maintained service called <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>.</p></div><div id="tile-servers"><h2>Tile Servers</h2><p>To make updating and sharing their work easier, OpenStreetMap (and virtually all other mapping services) have split their maps into billions of tiny (256 pixel) sections, called tiles, that we can download individually from their tile servers.</p><p>OpenStreetMap has <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers">quite a few tile servers</a> that style or prioritize different map features with some having a slightly different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> to request tiles. For example the <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/toner/#12/29.9722/-90.1167">Stamen Toner Map</a> that I used in the first visual and prefer for it's simple color pallet.</p><p>For this essay though, we'll use the default tile server's API to request tiles:</p><div><pre><span></span>URL = "https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png".format
</pre></div><p>This string formatting function will replace the <code>{z}</code>, <code>{x}</code>, and <code>{y}</code> with the tile coordinates and zoom level of the tile we want to download, where:</p><ul><li><code>{z}</code> is the "zoom" level ranging from 0 to 18. Zoom 0 being the most "zoomed out" and needs only one tile to depict <a href="https://tile.openstreetmap.org/0/0/0.png">the entire world</a> at that level.</li><li><code>{x}</code> is the number of tiles from the left most tile of the map.</li><li>and <code>{y}</code> is the number of tiles from the top most tile of the map.</li></ul><p>Both <code>{x}</code> and <code>{y}</code> depend on the zoom level <code>{z}</code> we've chosen, with larger zoom levels requiring more tiles to render the map. To understand how to calculate which tiles we need for our data-set, we'll need to understand how mapping projections work.</p></div><div id="map-projections"><h2>Map Projections</h2><p>Without going too deep into mapping projections, OpenStreetMap (along with many other mapping services) needed a way to convert <span>(<i>lat</i>, <i>lon</i>)</span> coordinates into planer <span>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</span> coordinates which work with their maps. Sadly there is no perfect way to do this.</p><p>Google (and everyone else eventually) settled on a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator Projection</a> called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection">Web Mercator Projection</a> which simplifies the conversion by assuming the earth is a perfect sphere (it's not). This can (and does) lead to confusion in the final visuals and why many official bodies refuse to accept this standard.</p><p>The advantage of assuming the earth is a perfect sphere is that the equation to convert our GPS coordinates into Web Mercator coordinates is fairly straightforward. The <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenStreetMap Wiki</a> has the algorithm available in <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mercator">multiple programming languages</a>. Here is the one for Python:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>math</span>

</pre></div></div><div id="downloading-a-tile"><h2>Downloading A Tile</h2><p>Now we can use the <code>point_to_pixels()</code> function to calculate the number of pixels from the top-left corner of the OSM map from the GPS coordinates in our data-set at any <code>zoom</code> level, for example the French Quarter of New Orleans:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>zoom</span> <span>=</span> <span>16</span>

</pre></div><p>Dividing the number of pixels by <code>TILE_SIZE</code> will then give us the <code>{x}</code> and <code>{y}</code> that we need for the <code>URL()</code> function we created <a href="#tile-servers">a few sections ago</a> for the OpenStreetMap API.</p><div><pre><span></span><span>x_tiles</span><span>,</span> <span>y_tiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>/</span> <span>TILE_SIZE</span><span>),</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>y</span> <span>/</span> <span>TILE_SIZE</span><span>)</span>

There are many ways we can do this, all of them are valid. For simplicity though, I'll calculate the <span><i>min</i></span> and <span><i>max</i></span> of both the <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> columns in my <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> DataFrame:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>top</span><span>,</span> <span>bot</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>.</span><span>lat</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(),</span> <span>df</span><span>.</span><span>lat</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>()</span>

</pre></div><p>This gives us a bounding box (in GPS coordinates) that encompasses our entire data-set.</p><p>Next, just like we did in <a href="#downloading-a-tile">the last section</a>, we'll use the <code>point_to_pixels()</code> function to convert our GPS coordinates into Web Mercator coordinates.</p><div><pre><span></span><span>zoom</span> <span>=</span> <span>13</span>

</pre></div><p>That we can then divide by <code>TILE_SIZE</code> to calculate the minimum and maximum number of tiles we'll need to download for both the <code>{x}</code> and <code>{y}</code> arguments for the API:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>x0_tile</span><span>,</span> <span>y0_tile</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>x0</span> <span>/</span> <span>TILE_SIZE</span><span>),</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>y0</span> <span>/</span> <span>TILE_SIZE</span><span>)</span>

</pre></div><p>As a precaution, we'll add an <code>assert</code> statement to limit the number of tiles we can download and save us from the embarrassment of accidentally burdening OpenStreetMap tile servers.</p><div><pre><span></span><span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>x1_tile</span> <span>-</span> <span>x0_tile</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>y1_tile</span> <span>-</span> <span>y0_tile</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>"That's too many tiles!"</span>

This is because of the <code>math.ceil()</code> and <code>int()</code> functions we used to round the pixel coordinates into <code>{x}</code> and <code>{y}</code> tiles we used above. To get our image back to size we'll need to crop out the fractions of tiles not inside our bounding box.</p></div><div id="cropping-the-basemap"><h2>Cropping the Basemap</h2><p>To help my human-eyed brethren, I added some lines to our previous graphic to help understand what's going on. Essentially some fraction of each tile we've downloaded (outlined in black) will be used in our final visual (outlined in red) that we calculated in <a href="#stitching-tiles-together">the last section</a>. Our goal for this section is to trim the fraction of tiles outside of our red square.</p><p><img alt="A plot of New Orleans with black lines outlining each tile we downloaded from the tile servers overlaid with a red line representing the section of the map we wish to keep after we crop the image." src="https://bryanbrattlof.com/adding-openstreetmaps-to-matplotlib/basemap-cropping-lines.png"></p><p>To curtail our oversize image, we'll use pillow's <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.crop">Image.crop()</a> function, which takes a tuple <code>(left, top, right, bottom)</code> measured in pixels from the top left corner to crop our image.</p><p><a href="https://bryanbrattlof.com/adding-openstreetmaps-to-matplotlib/StitchingTilesTogether">From our work above</a>, we know the pixel coordinates of the red square is defined as <code>x0, y0</code> and <code>x1, y1</code>.

We can start by setting a <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html">matplotlib subplots()</a> and a <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter.html">scatter()</a> plot for the <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> columns in our pandas DataFrames:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>fig</span><span>,</span> <span>ax</span> <span>=</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>subplots</span><span>()</span>

<p>💡 TL;DR Trustpilot and Glassdoor are PR agencies for companies. Not impartial review platforms for customers. This creates a challenging incentive problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trustpilot enables customers to review companies and Glassdoor enables employees to review companies. They have similar and fascinating business models. Let’s dive into Trustpilot.</p>
<p><strong>How does Trustpilot work?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s imagine you are setting up an online physiotherapy clinic called StiffNecks.com. To build your reputation as a clinic you create a Trustpilot page. The first client comes along, has a great experience, and you send them an email to the Trustpilot page asking them to leave a review. The client had a great experience and writes a lovely review of StiffNecks.com rating it 5/5 stars. BOOM your Trustpilot page now has a 3.5/5 “TrustScore”. Wait, what?!</p>
<p>With that 3.5/5 rating, TrustPilot now has you hostage. They use a <a href="https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/201748946-TrustScore-explained-How-is-the-TrustScore-calculated-">Bayesian average</a> to calculate the TrustScore which takes into account how old the reviews are, the frequency you collect reviews, and they start you with a lovely 7 reviews of 3.5 for good measure. In other words, they control what your reputation is. And they charge businesses for this service with incentives misaligned from the business and definitely the customer.</p>
<p>Let’s jump back to StiffNecks.com. You now have anxiety from the yellow 3.5/5 score staring at you and so with each new customer, you do your best to push them towards Trustpilot. Eventually, (with about 10x5 star reviews) you get past the dreaded 4/5 threshold beyond which no customer dares to buy. But with each new review, it signals to customers that this is a valid reflection of your business’s reputation. And did I forget that you get penalised if the frequency of collecting reviews decreases. No stopping now. A few days later you get a call from Trustpilot agent offering the paid service.</p>
<p><strong>Where do the incentives go wrong?</strong></p>
<p>The immediate incentive is for Trustpilot to charge businesses more. Pretty easy to do when they directly control a business’s reputation. How can Trustpilot charge more? By either threatening to reduce their reputation or helping them to improve their score.</p>
<p>How do you help a company improve their score? At the moment Trustpilot uses widgets to show reviews and tools to collect reviews. But… there’s also strong incentives for Trustpilot to curate/remove negative reviews. Something that is already happening at Glassdoor (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24789865">anecdotal evidence here</a>).</p>
<p>What does this mean for the customer? Believing in Trustpilot as a measure of reputation is a crucial part of their flywheel. But there’s much stronger incentives to be on the side of helping paying businesses have an artificially high score.</p>
<p><strong>How can Trustpilot remedy this?</strong></p>
<p>I think Trustpilot is an awesome service for consumers but the incentive problem is tough… For Trustpilot to truly fix the incentive problem they would need to be directly aligned with the reviewer. But the obvious business models such as a paywalling reviews would strongly interfere with their flywheel.</p>
<p>It’s possible to continue charging businesses. But Trustpilot would need to play the long game - not fudging the reviews at any cost. Instead, continuing to be a forcing function for businesses to treat their customers better, and thus improve their score. But, moderating reviews is hard because customer experience is subjective and Trustpilot does not have proper validation for who has and has not been a customer. Solutions to the verification problem seem feasible, such as the Facebook retargeting mechanism of sharing a hashed list of their customer emails.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix: The Trustpilot flywheel</strong></p>
<p>More companies email customers to leave reviews on Trustpilot → More customers leave reviews → More customers trust and use Trustpilot → More companies sign up to Trustpilot → More companies email customers to leave reviews on Trustpilot → …</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

<p>2020-11-08</p>
<p>This is a little demonstration of how little you need to host your own git
repositories and have a modest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</a>
system for them. All you need is a unixy
server you can ssh into, but arguably you can try this out locally as well.
We will use Redis at one point to queue tasks, but
strictly speaking this can be achieved without additional software. To keep things
simple this will only work with one repository, since this is only describing a
pattern.</p>
<p>The source code to all of that follows below can be found <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Estchris/tiny-ci">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Hosting bare git repositories</h2>
<p>Assuming you can ssh into a server and create a directory, this is all you need
to create a shareable git repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ git init --bare
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally you are using a distinct user for it (named <code>git</code>) and have it set to
use <code>git-shell</code> as its default shell. By convention bare repositories are stored
in directories which end in <code>.git</code>. You can now clone this repository from your
machine with:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone ssh://git@host.example.com/~git/repo.git
</code></pre>
<h2>post-receive hooks</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#post-receive">post-receive hook</a> is an executable which can do some work as soon as something new was pushed to the repository. We will use an executable shell script which needs to go inside the <code>hooks</code> directory of the (bare) repository on the server side.</p>
<p>Now the most trivial thing to do would be to do the actual work in here, but this would block the <code>git push</code> on the client side, so we just want to enqueue a new job, return a handle and exit. If what you do takes only a short amount of time, you can stop here. Alternatively you can use this repository for deployments only, by defining it as a separate remote. But the goal here is to have tests run on every push, so we will split the job creation from the actual run.</p>
<p>This is where Redis comes into play for the job queueing. We will assume redis is installed and running and we will use redis-cli to access it from the script. We will use two data structures: a list of jobs waiting to be executed, referenced by a UUID we will generate and a hash where we can store the git revision and the state associated to a given job, as well as its output.</p>
<p>Note that git is passing three arguments to the script via stdin: the old revision before the push, the new revision and the current ref.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
while read -r _ newrev ref
do
	id=$(uuid)
	echo "Starting CI job $id"
	redis-cli hset "$id" rev "$newrev" &gt;/dev/null
	redis-cli hset "$id" ref "$ref" &gt;/dev/null
	redis-cli lpush jobs "$id" &gt;/dev/null
done
</code></pre>
<h2>Defining build jobs</h2>
<p>By convention our system will run whatever is in an executable script named <code>ci.sh</code>. The drawback is that this only works with trusted systems and access to the repository needs to be guarded to prevent random code execution. The big advantage is that we don't need to come up with a job definition DSL or cumbersome file format.</p>
<p>Our convention will also be that the script will be passed one argument: the name of the git ref, so we can decide what to do based on the branch we are on.</p>
<p>Let's just put this into a file named <code>ci.sh</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

# the git ref gets passed in as the only argument
ref="$1"

# pretend we're running tests
echo "running tests"

# only deploy if we're on the main branch
[[ "$ref" == "refs/heads/main" ]] &amp;&amp; echo "Deploying"
</code></pre>
<h2>The build runner</h2>
<p>Now that jobs are queued the last piece missing is a job runner. We will make use of Redis' <a href="https://redis.io/commands/blpop">BLPOP command</a> to block until the jobs list has a new job for us. That job id will give us the revision we need to check out and will allow us to write back the output and status of the job.</p>
<p>Note that, as discussed, this assumes a repository called <code>test</code> is already checked out right next to the script.</p>
<p>tiny-ci.sh</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

# ./runner.sh is supposed to run on the server where your git repository lives

# the logic in here will run in an infinite loop:
# * (block and) wait for a job
# * run it
while :
do

# Announce that we're waiting
echo "Job runner waiting"

# We are using https://redis.io/commands/blpop to block until we have a new
# message on the "jobs" list. We use `tail` to get the last line because the
# output of BLPOP is of the form "list-that-got-an-element\nelement"
jobid=$(redis-cli blpop jobs 0 | tail -n 1)

# The message we received will have the job uuid
echo "Running job $jobid"

# Get the git revision we're supposed to check out
rev=$(redis-cli hget "${jobid}" "rev")
echo Checking out revision "$rev"

# Get the git ref
ref=$(redis-cli hget "${jobid}" "ref")

# Prepare the repository (hardcoded path) by getting that commit
cd test || exit; git fetch &amp;&amp; git reset --hard "$rev";

# Actually runs the job and saves the output
if ! output=$(./ci.sh "$ref" 2&gt;&amp;1);
then
    status="failed";
else
    status="success";
fi;

# Update the result status
redis-cli hset "${jobid}" "status" $status;

# Update the job output
redis-cli hset "${jobid}" "output" "$output";

echo "Job ${jobid} done"

done
</code></pre>
<h2>Running it</h2>
<p>Summing up:</p>
<ul>
<li>there's a bare git repository somewhere, called <code>test.git</code></li>
<li>we can clone the empty repo (or create a new one and add the respective remote)</li>
<li>on the server hosting the git repository we clone <code>test.git</code> into <code>test</code> and place <code>tiny-ci.sh</code> next to it</li>
<li>we run builds by starting <code>tiny-ci.sh</code> on the server hosting the repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if we <code>git push</code> a new commit to the <code>main</code> branch with the <code>ci.sh</code> file from above, the output will return the job id</p>
<pre><code>Enumerating objects: 5, done.
...
remote: Starting CI job dab82634-21cc-11eb-b3b3-9b8767dff47c
</code></pre>
<h2>Checking build status</h2>
<p>Knowing a job uuid, the easiest way to get the status
of a build is by using the <code>--csv</code> style output of the <a href="https://redis.io/commands/hgetall">HGETALL</a> command of redis.</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh example.com redis-cli --csv hgetall $JOB_UUID
"rev","f0706ea18a22031f84619b1161c8fbdb0dcd6850","ref","refs/heads/master","status","success","output","running tests\nDeploying"
</code></pre>
<h2>Possible further improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>multi-repo support</strong></p>
<p>This would mean changes to the <code>post-receive</code> hook to put jobs in a list named <code>job-${REPONAME}</code> and then have the worker also react based on that. Notice how <code>redis-cli blpop</code> takes several lists to watch and will also return the name of the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>job cleanup</strong></p>
<p>Creating a key for every job pollutes the redis database unnecesarily. Enqueuing the job could be done via <a href="https://redis.io/commands/setex">SETEX</a> so that the keys go away after one hour / one day / one week. The purpose of Redis here is short term storage and not long-term archival of job results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>more workers</strong></p>
<p>Scaling to multiple workers on the same machine would need different working folders (and some process isolation depending on the tasks run in there). Scaling to multiple machines would need access to a central redis instance for job distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>worker isolation / sandboxing</strong></p>
<p>For more complex tasks some kind of process and file-system isolation is necessary. The worker could spin up VMs or Docker containers. The build system used on <a href="https://builds.sr.ht/">builds.sr.ht</a> for instance uses a <a href="https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/installation.md#security-model">Docker container run as an unprivileged user in a KVM qemu machine</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>timestamps</strong></p>
<p>For convenience you would definitely want timestamps for every operation. This also allows to list queries like "the last five jobs" or to do maintenance on job results based on their time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>notifications</strong></p>
<p>Any CI system will have some form of notifications and the simplest form would be to do something in the script, right at the end. But this covers only the success case, so a better approach would be to create a notification queue and have a notification worker react on that.</p>
</li>

                <p>Indian food and grocery chain Big Basket was reported to have fallen prey to a data breach, with details of two crore of its customers reportedly being put up for sale on the dark web.&nbsp;</p><p>The retail giant known for online sale and delivery of groceries was founded in 2011 and offers its services across the country. Online grocery shopping became all the more popular in India ever since the country was placed under lockdown in light of the COVID 19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>According to researchers at Cyble, the data breach was discovered during a routine sweep of the dark web on Friday. Cyble, in an official update on their website, stated that the data was being offered for sale for USD 40,000. Based on the data examined so far, Cyble believes that it was hacked from Big Basket servers in mid-October this year.&nbsp;</p><p>“The leak contains a database portion, with the table name ‘member_member’. The size of the SQL file is 15 GB, containing close to 20 Million user data. More specifically, this includes names, email IDs, password hashes, contact numbers (mobile + phone), addresses, date of birth, location, and IP addresses of login, among many others,” Cyble update said.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyble founder Beenu Arora told CySpy India that inquiries were still underway regarding the threat actor who was offering the data for sale, and that all the details regarding the incident had been shared with Big Basket.&nbsp;</p><p>CySpy India has reached out to Big Basket for comment and their response will be added to this article as soon as it is received.</p><p>Cyble has acquired the data and published it on its indexing website - AmiBreached - where users who suspect that their details might be part of the leaked data can check for the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span>Update</span></strong>: We got a call this evening from someone who runs App Review. They apologized for the experience we had, then told us they've accepted our appeal and won't be removing iSH from the store tomorrow. We'll stay in contact with them to work out details. Thanks everyone for your support!
</p>


<p>On Monday, October 26th, just four days after we launched iSH on the App Store, we received a call from Apple informing us that they had found our app noncompliant with section 2.5.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines and that they would remove the app from sale if we did not submit a satisfactory update within two weeks. Despite our best efforts, we do not believe we will be able to bring iSH into compliance by tomorrow, the conclusion of this 14 day period, and we expect iSH to no longer be available to download from the App Store after that time. We are working our hardest to get iSH back on the App Store as soon as possible and hope for your understanding and support as we navigate our next steps in this process.</p>

<p>Thanks for using iSH!<br>
Theodore Dubois, Saagar Jha &amp; Martin Persson</p>

<h2 id="why-is-ish-being-removed">Why is iSH being removed?</h2>
<p>Apple believes iSH is not compliant with section 2.5.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines, which governs applications which download and run executable code. Specifically, they believe that iSH “is not self-contained and has remote package updating functionality”, and suggest that we should “remove the remote network activity functionality which could allow for remote code importing into the app, such as wget or curl, or other remote network commands”. Additional communication with Apple has indicated that they believe that iSH is a security concern if we allow any sort of code importing by the user.</p>

<p><strong>We believe iSH is fully compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines.</strong> <a href="https://saagarjha.com/blog/2020/11/08/fixing-section-2-5-2/">Saagar has written</a> a more detailed analysis of why we believe this rejection is incorrect, how we believe Apple has misinterpreted and misapplied this rule to our app, and describe how 2.5.2’s poor wording coupled with the review team being unable to review functionality of scripting applications leads to mistaken classifications like these. At a high level, Apple has selectively targeted iSH using section 2.5.2 without fullying understanding our application, their own guidelines, or the consequences of what they are asking and how they affect the App Store ecosystem as a whole. <strong>Consistent enforcement of Apple’s incorrect interpretation would require the removal of all scripting apps, including many of the most popular applications in the App Store and some of Apple’s own applications.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-done-to-get-ish-back-on-the-app-store">What have we done to get iSH back on the App Store?</h2>
<p>We’ve been working for the last two weeks to try to keep iSH available without interruptions. We have drafted numerous appeals, requests for clarifications, rule modifications, and explanatory emails. We’ve been on the phone with Apple for hours. Unfortunately, even with this we have been unable to resolve the issue, and the process has been significantly more stressful than we would have liked it to be. Theodore, the primary iSH liaison to Apple, <a href="https://tbodt.com/2020/11/08/app-review-experiences.html">has written about</a> how this process should be improved.</p>

<p>Our first interaction with the App Store review team actually dates back to May, not October: we wanted to know what Apple thought of iSH, since we weren’t sure how the rules would be enforced for it. Of course, iSH complies with the letter of the guidelines, but review found it to violate 2.5.2 because it could download Linux executable code. The problem appeared that apk lets you install packages, so we decided to remove it and work on other features to make the app more useful in its absence. We submitted this updated build in October and this was what is currently on the App Store.</p>

<p>After our build was flagged for noncompliance, we went through the usual review process: we first asked for clarification, and then after we realized that the rule was being misapplied we submitted a rule change request and of course appealed the decision as well. As the deadline approached we sent off an email to Phil Schiller as well detailing our situation. Unfortunately none of this led anywhere, which brings up to our current situation today.</p>

<h2 id="does-this-mean-i-cant-use-ish-anymore">Does this mean I can’t use iSH anymore?</h2>
<p>No, not at all. However, it will mean that you will no longer be able to get iSH from the App Store, which is something which we would still like to be able to provide. The App Store remains the easiest and most popular method of software distribution on iOS, and we’re working hard to save iSH’s listing because we think the app should have a permanent spot there for users who prefer this method of distribution.</p>

<p>Removal of iSH’s listing on the App Store should not affect your use of iSH if you download the app before it is removed. We have not received any compliance messages from Apple regarding <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/97i7KM8O">our TestFlight beta</a>, so we plan to continue offering prerelease versions of iSH there for up to 10,000 beta testers.</p>

<p>Precompiled builds of iSH (distributed as IPA files) will <a href="https://github.com/ish-app/ish/releases">remain available on GitHub</a> for <a href="https://ish.app/altstore">installation through AltStore</a> and for jailbroken users. Advanced users are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/ish-app/ish#build-for-ios">build iSH</a> themselves—it’s free and open source and always will be!</p>

<p><strong><span>Update</span>: <a href="https://twitter.com/a_Shell_iOS/status/1325526061099196416">a-Shell has mentioned</a> that they have received a similar rejection notice. Apple may be running extra review for scripting apps.</strong></p>

<p>The Dell XPS reads and drops file on the primary disk during the booting and
BIOS upgrade process. Namely, it drops:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>/boot/EFI/Dell/Bios/Recovery/BIOS_PRE.rcv</code></li>
  <li><code>/boot/EFI/Dell/Bios/Recovery/BIOS_CUR.RCV</code></li>
</ol>

<p>These files are used by a process called BIOS Recovery Tool. On the XPS 9370,
<a href="https://www.dell.com/support/article/en-us/sln300716/how-to-recover-the-bios-on-a-dell-computer-or-tablet">BIOS Recovery 3</a>
is used.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>BIOS_PRE.rcv</code> is used for F2/F12 recovery.
<code>BIOS_CUR.rcv</code> is used only during the process of flash update failures. After the successful FW update <code>BIOS_CUR.rcv</code> is always copied to <code>BIOS_PRE.rcv</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When <code>BIOS_PRE.rcv</code> is corrupted, the BIOS crashes. Triggering this bug prevents
the laptop from accessing the boot menu and accessing the BIOS. The only way to
recover from the exploit is to unplug the exploited boot device. If the exploit is
done on the internal disk, this means that you need to disassemble the laptop.</p>

<p>When “Bios Recovery from Hard Drive” is disabled, recovery (and the exploit) only works from USB stick / USB hard drive.</p>

<h2 id="a-tale-of-failure">A tale of failure</h2>

<p>This writeup is not your usual exploit writeup. I am not an experienced
attacker, especially not against a blackbox such as my laptop’s BIOS. So how did
I end up finding it?</p>

<p>It all started while I was benchmarking my laptop’s internal drive using <code>fio</code>. I
simply wrote <code>randrw</code> instead of <code>randread</code> and thus overwrote a part of my
own hard drive. This part mostly included my boot partition and the two aforementioned BIOS
files.</p>

<p>Luckily, I already had a live Arch Linux USB key to repair everything. My plan was
simple: reboot, fix, reboot. That doesn’t sound so hard!</p>

<p><img src="https://sayr.us/assets/images/20minutesadventure.jpg" alt="Reboot and fix. Twenty minutes adventure."></p>

<p>After rebooting, I could not access a single BIOS Menu. Everything either froze
on a black screen, or on “Preparing one-time boot menu”. If I was unable to boot
anything or access the BIOS setup, I was not going to be able to fix my problem.</p>

<p>At that time, I didn’t know I found a bug in the BIOS, only that I somehow
fucked up so hard that my laptop was bricked. So I contacted the Dell support,
because I should not be able to brick my laptop like this! They agreed that it
was not supposed to happen and offered me a replacement.</p>

<h3 id="backups-and-a-surprise">Backups and a surprise</h3>

<p>Before sending back my laptop, I wished to recover what I was working on as it
had yet to be pushed. So I took the NVMe out of the laptop and put it in another
machine to dump a disk image. Right after removing the NVMe, I could access the
Bios and even boot on my USB stick.</p>

<p>Was my NVMe broken? From another computer, I could access any file on it. The
boot partition was indeed corrupted but the content of the LUKS partition was
sane.</p>

<p>Well then, if it’s not hardware, is it something on the drive? I dumped a full
disk image on an external HDD, tried to boot it on my laptop and <strong>boom</strong>. I
just reproduced the bug I had earlier on another drive.</p>

<p>I couldn’t miss the chance to play with what I had found so I kept a full disk
image as a backup of my data and another as a way to trigger the bug.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-culprit">Finding the culprit</h3>

<p>Now that I had a disk image that triggered the bug, it was time to investigate.
At that point, the only information I had were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I wrote random bytes on my disk, including in the partitions table, the boot
partition, and part of my encrypted disk</li>
  <li>Something on the disk is definitely messing up with the BIOS</li>
  <li>Duplicating the disk image and plugging it in as a USB Disk triggers the bug</li>
</ul>

<p>I assumed that bytes inside my encrypted partition were not the cause as the
BIOS had no reason to read them and they were valid when read from another
computer. Hopefully, it is not broken hardware either.</p>

<h4 id="partitions-table">Partitions table</h4>

<p>My first guess was that my partitions table was invalid and something broke
while enumerating tables. For instance, I might have been listing a partition
offset outside of the disk size, or an invalid size.</p>

<p>To verify that, I created a new partition table from scratch and copied the boot
partition content (files) and tried to boot.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: <strong>Still broken.</strong></p>

<p>Even better, I did not copy my encrypted partition so the bug was definitely
triggered by something inside the boot partition!</p>

<h4 id="boot-partition">Boot partition</h4>

<p>Obviously, there was something in my boot partition that triggered the bug. But
why would the BIOS read the content of the boot partition? Silly me, I did not
know that BIOS recovery from hard drive was a thing. As far as I knew, it might
have been coming from anything: an invalid folder name, a corrupted file or even
a hard-link to an invalid INode…</p>

<p><em>Obviously not an invalid hard-link as I just did copy the files and there were
no hard-links on this new drive…</em></p>

<p>I was lacking the experience in this kind of bug so the easiest way for me was
to proceed by elimination:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Delete a folder</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Try to boot</li>
  <li>If it boots, restore only this folder, and apply Step 1 to the content of this
folder</li>
  <li>If it does not boot, simply go back to Step 1</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat</strong> until there is only a single file or folder remaining that triggers
the bug</li>
</ul>

<p>I deleted files using this method until I found out that deleting the
<code>/boot/EFI/Dell/Bios/Recovery</code> folder fixed the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed !</strong></p>

<p>At this point, I notified Dell about the bug and sent them the two files that
were triggering the bug. The BIOS being closed source, it would be time
consuming to find:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What the format of <code>BIOS_PRE.rcv</code> and <code>BIOS_CUR.rcv</code> was (looking at
Dell’s documentation, <em>it might just be a Windows executable</em>)</li>
  <li>What field in that file triggers the bug</li>
</ul>

<p>I might have been able to <code>hexdiff</code> a working file with the broken one, to
highlight the differences. However, that would not have given me a better
understanding of the issue. From there, Dell took over and we now have access to
the result of the investigation: <strong>Improper Exception Handling</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

<ul>
  <li>12 August 2019: Message sent to secure@dell.com without the PoC</li>
  <li>13 August 2019: Answer from Dell asking for more details</li>
  <li>11 September 2019: Message sent to secure@dell.com with steps to reproduce,
including a small disk image and the broken files.</li>
  <li>12 September 2019: Answer from Dell with the ticket number</li>
  <li>26 September 2019: Dell confirmed the problem exists</li>
  <li>January 2020: Dell plans to try to release a patch in April</li>
  <li>April 2020: Dell plans to publish the patch end of May</li>
  <li>May 2020: Dell plans to publish the patch beginning of July</li>
  <li>19 August 2020: Bios 1.13.1 released with the patch</li>
  <li>29 September 2020: Dell notifies me a Security Advisory was published</li>
  <li>16 October 2020: Dell updates the CVE score as the CVE does not require physical access, only high privileges</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>

<p>The story might have begun as a scary <em>do your backups</em> story, but it ends without
any data-loss and with a reported vulnerability. Overall, it was a lot of fun and
a fine addition to my collection.</p>

<p>Perhaps next time we’ll talk about how to destroy the displayed image on my
monitor using only a JPEG file or making a video input detected as HDR by
squeezing the DisplayPort cable.</p>

    <h3>how we pay for software</h3>

    <p>Quality software costs money to make.</p>

    <p>The tech industry has backed itself into a corner in the last couple decades by implying to users that software doesn’t cost much. Google led the charge here, by providing a series of useful and well-made applications like Gmail, Google Maps, and its core search product for free. They aren’t free, of course: users ”pay“ with their attention and personal data for advertisements.</p>

    <p>Paying with attention and personal data is probably a good trade for search and maps, maybe less so for email. But it’s not a model that fits professional and creative tools.</p>

    <p>Here are three proven models for paying for software:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Ad-supported software.</strong> Only really appropriate for pure-consumer products that are attention-oriented to begin with (e.g. social media). Requires huge scale since <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Twitters-ARPU-average-revenue-per-user">each user is only worth a few bucks</a>. Because the user is the product rather than the customer, the user’s needs are not the priority of the business.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Software bundled with hardware or content.</strong> End users seem to be fine with paying directly for hardware (smartphone, laptop) or content (Netflix, Spotify). In these examples the software is a huge part of what you’re paying for—a Mac without macOS is just an overpriced PC, and Netflix without its excellent browsing and playback software is just cloud storage media stocked with MP4 files. Yet few people think of themselves as paying for macOS or Netflix’s app.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://adamwiggins.com/making-computers-better/spotify-pricing.png" alt="pricing page for Spotify">

      <figcaption>
        <svg width="50" height="10" viewBox="0 0 50 10" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <rect width="50" height="10" rx="2.5" fill="#298070"></rect>
        </svg>

        <p><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/">Spotify’s pricing</a> demonstrates the common price range for individually-purchased subscriptions: $5/month on the low end, $15/month on the high end.</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>B2B SaaS.</strong> ”Business-to-business software-as-a-service“ is a mouthful, but represents a a beautiful, pure, and simple payment model for software. A business has a problem; a software creator offers a web-based product that solves the problem; the business purchases directly from the creator, and continues to pay as long as they have the problem and the product is good. Interests are aligned, and the no-middleman nature of the web means software creators have a direct relationship with their customers. Everybody wins. That’s why there’s so many success stories here: Slack, GitHub, Mailchimp, Atlassian, Zoom, Notion, and Carta just to name a few.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I seek a world with a great diversity of lovingly-crafted software for niche audiences. But niche is not possible with ad-supported which requires huge scale to work, and hardware and content licensing have massive up-front capital costs that imply financing models not compatible with small-scale.</p>

    <p>Happily, B2B SaaS is having its <a href="https://microconf.com/">revolution for small independents</a> right now. So what’s the equivalent of that for pro creator tools like <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">video editing</a> or <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview">writing</a> or <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">knowledge management</a>? Can we have something as beautiful and pure as B2B SaaS but for individuals as well as businesses, and for desktop, mobile, and other native apps?</p>

    <p>And indeed there does seem to be movement toward subscription-priced prosumer products in the $5 –&nbsp;$15/month range. See
      established players like
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/individual/plans-comparison">Dropbox</a>,
      <a href="https://evernote.com/compare-plans">Evernote</a>,
      <a href="https://ulysses.app/get/">Ulysses</a> and
      <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/buy/">OmniFocus</a>;
      plus up-and-comers like

    <p>As a <strike>user</strike> customer, I like the idea of finding a few great tools that empower my work and paying for them directly. That gives me confidence the product will serve my needs long-term, because I’m the customer.</p>

    <p>And this doesn’t mean a bigger budget for my tech product purchases overall: I can subtract these subscriptions from the money I previously spent on a new phone and laptop every two years, then buy new hardware a little less often. Right now I think great software is more important than hardware advances, much as I love shiny new devices.</p>

    <p>As a software creator, I love the idea of serving a niche of customers who are deeply connected with the product I’m making and get lots of value from it. It has that pure, direct, and personal relationship we see in B2B SaaS, but maybe even more initimate because these are personal tools.</p>

    <p>Ok sounds good—but now the next problem with a direct-payment model. If we’re going to make software subscriptions work, we as creators have to address the sharp edges and <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/misnomers">subscription fatigue</a> people may experience maintaining a stack of software subscriptions.</p>

    <p>Individuals are cautious about recurring billing due to poorly-designed—even <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003499613-Cancel-your-subscription">borderline scammy</a>—subscription buying, renewal, and canceling experiences. The reference worst-case scenario are gym memberships or mobile phone contracts: being trapped in a recurring payment that no longer fits your needs, and being forced to navigate a customer service maze to try to downgrade or cancel.</p>

    <p>So how can we give customers a great experience with subscriptions? A few proposals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Treat the <strong>buying experience as part of your product</strong>. Make it easy for prospective customers to see what they will get; making buying easy and fun; show them love afterward, not just a ”you’re all set“ dialog and nothing else.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Make it <strong>easy to cancel</strong> at any moment. Canceling should be as smooth as purchasing initially. For bonus points, give a refund for any unused portion of purchased time.</p></li>
      <li><p>For longer-cycle payments (e.g. annual), give <strong>heads-up notifications before payment</strong> so that users are not surprised. Direct them on how they can cancel with just a couple of clicks. You shouldn’t want any money from someone who is no longer getting value from your product.</p></li>

      <li><p>Don’t treat lapsed or canceled subscriptions as strangers or defectors. Instead, <strong>consider them alumni and offer them your respect</strong> and maybe even some extra perks.

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Beyond prosumer subscriptions, I’m happy to see products experimenting with models appropriate to their domain, like the ski app <a href="https://twitter.com/parrots/status/1314192830500347906">Slopes offering</a> packs of day passes; time-based notes app <a href="https://medium.com/@drewmccormack/cash-cow-revisited-4c2185e2b3d8">Agenda</a> with feature unlock based on subscription time windows; and <a href="https://www.komoot.com/product">Komoot</a> with hiking region budles for sale.</p>

    <p>One last one I find especially promising is the half-crowdfunding, half-early-purchase model that’s seen success with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/earlyaccessfaq/?snr=1_200_200_Early+Access">video games</a>, <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/kickstarter-film-projects/">films</a>, and <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/about">typefaces</a>. This blurs the distinctions between customer, investor, and donor. When you buy a Steam Early Access game you’re saying not just ”I want to purchase this product“ but also ”I believe in this product and the team behind it; I want it to exist; and I’m willing to risk a bit of my money to make that happen.“ And maybe: ”I like getting to give early feedback and influence the outcome of the finished product.“ <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/support/">Wikipedia with its pure patronage model</a> and <a href="https://www.are.na/roadmap">Are.na with its earnings transparency</a> are variations on this theme.</p>

    <p><strong>The world we have:</strong> Almost all software is paid for by (1) ads and selling personal data (2) bundling software with hardware or content or (3) business-purchased subscriptions. As a result, the type of software we have is limited to what will fit in those boxes.</p>

    <p><strong>The world I want:</strong> A wide diversity of funding and payment models for pure software products. Prosumer subscriptions are commonplace; users feel great about buying tools that matter to them; and they get a great experience when buying and canceling. Crowdfunding, patronage, and many other models flourish and individual products can choose the model that best fits them and their customers.</p>

	<div>

		<p><span>During recent research into the life of Machiavelli something began to become quite clear to me. We weren’t always, universally, socially, communally or even personally, political. That is to say, it’s only recently that it’s become commonplace to declare oneself as left, right, Republican, Democrat, Labour, Conservative, Centrist, Reactionary, Socialist, Red, Blue, x-pilled, y-pilled etc. In terms of human history this way of </span><span><em><span>being</span></em></span><span> – as a political-being, or even as homo-politicus – is </span><span><em><span>extremely</span></em></span><span> new. The very idea of a left/right split/spectrum comes from where people sat during the French Revolution, when members of the National Assembly divided themselves into those in support of the king (right) and supporters of the Revolution (left). Arguably this is one and only time that the idea of a left/right spectrum has ever made sense. Since then </span><span><em><span>both</span></em></span><span> ‘directions’ signal virtue to various camps and striate one into relatively specific ways of thinking. The year we’re roughly talking about here is 1789, that’s round that all up and say – for clarity’s sake – we’ve been political ‘beings’ for just over 200 years. Once again, humans in their current evolutionary iteration have been around for 200,000 years. So we’ve had this political chip on our shoulders for roughly 0.1% of our entire lifetime. Of course, you could argue that for a large amount of that time we haven’t exactly had the infrastructure to allow for what we now commonly understand as politics or political economy, but we </span><span><em><span>have</span></em></span><span> had that for a few thousand years at least, so even going by that metric, the notion of a political-being or of a political-human is still quite new. </span></p>
<p><span>It seems to me the reason for the original (non) position, wherein man wasn’t apolitical, nor anti-political, but simply detached from the political, wasn’t due to some oppression (though some would argue otherwise)[1], nor was it really to do with any ignorance; it was largely because in relation to man’s daily life, the specific political on-goings didn’t matter to him. I would argue that this is still true, we’re just all caught up in status and popularity games. </span></p>
<p><span>The very idea that within contemporary (Western) society one could be ‘detached’ from politics seems absurd, that’s how tight of a grasp it has on our lives. A grasp which is ever-tightened by the popular rhetoric surrounding politics. Society in general seems to unconsciously believe that they now have some kind of duty to </span><span><em><span>be</span></em></span><span> political, they must be in a certain camp, they must have certain opinions on various matters, and most of all, they must </span><span><em><span>care</span></em></span><span> in a specifically political way. I’m here to say that this way of thinking and being is complete bullshit, and it slowly leads one to misery and submission. There are a lot of factors as to why someone might feel compelled to constantly </span><span><em><span>be</span></em></span><span> political, largely emanating from one’s perpetual attachment to media. The two most heinous forms of media are – of course – social and mainstream. Primarily because, once you actually begin to think about what these terms actually mean, like most things in modernity, they no longer make any sense whatsoever. Let’s begin with ‘social media’.</span></p>
<p><span>We all apparently ‘know’ what social media is, which is another way of saying we understand it. I’ll admit, I don’t really understand social media, and I never have. The basic reasons as to why it’s so popular are of course clear, on average humans quite like attention, they quite like having a say and they quite like boasting about their lives. However, I would ask this? If it wasn’t </span><span><em><span>for</span></em></span><span> social media, and its invasive societally pressuring structures, would you actually </span><span><em><span>want</span></em></span><span> to express certain opinions? Would you even have them? Would you have even thought about them? Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn’t, be honest with yourself. If no one was looking, and you had no proof anyone </span><span><em><span>had</span></em></span><span> looked, would you expend energy on the various political and social tasks you do? Ok, so this then begs the question, why the hell </span><span><em><span>do</span></em></span><span> we want to express these opinions? Well, for that you need a mainstream current which tells you the correct, conventional and confirmative way to </span><span><em><span>be.</span></em></span><span> Enter the mainstream media. Such an idea of a ‘mainstream’ is already idiotic. There can’t be such a thing because we all live in different areas of the world, within different cultures, within different families, with different values, within different contexts, and so, the job the mainstream media then is to subsume all of these alternative ways of being and differing value systems into one relatively homogenous lump, which is then there’s to mold as they wish. I’d insert here Ted Kaczynski’s ‘critique’ of ‘multiculturalism’, though it’s less a critique and more of a deconstruction. Kaczynski’s point is that there isn’t really any such thing as ‘multiculturalism’ as it’s sold to us. The overt idea is that multiple diverse cultures live amongst one another, learn from each other and share their cultures for the betterment of all. Kaczynski makes it clear that this is </span><span><em><span>not</span></em></span><span> what happens within contemporary multiculturalism, all that really happens is that every culture is subsumed into the exact same culture of middle-class consumerist aspiration, and perhaps allowed to retain any cultural aesthetic which might be deemed profitable by their new culture of consumerist aspiration. The exact same thing happens with mainstream media. One begins with a variety of views, opinions, values, outlooks, perspectives and contexts which have been grown organically, from their local surroundings and upbringing, these are then pushed through the conformity thresher of mainstream media, cherry-picked for their applicability for submission, and what’s left are deemed dangerous, archaic, bad, fascist, radical, silly, absurd, weird, not-normal, odd or perhaps just too common-sensical for them to remain.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the </span><span><em><span>exact</span></em></span><span> same process happens with the idea of a ‘political-human’ with a few minor alterations. Much like homo-criminalis, or homo-economicus, once the suffix is assumed </span><span><em><span>a priori</span></em></span><span> as a </span><span><em><span>way</span></em></span><span> of being – man </span><span><em><span>can</span></em></span><span> be a criminal, or man </span><span><em><span>can</span></em></span><span> be economical. There’s no longer such a thing as a man detached entirely from criminality or the economy, there is only a man who is </span><span><em><span>not</span></em></span><span> a criminal, or a man who acts within the economy in a </span><span><em><span>different</span></em></span><span> way than what is preferred. The exact same thing happens with political man. Once a political-outlook, a political-perspective or a political-reality is assumed as the given reality, everything is then filtered through politics in some manner. Then there is no longer such a thing as a entirely unpolitical man, only a man who is deemed ignorant of politics, someone who is seen as turning a blind eye or as simply too lazy to investigate that which they </span><span><em><span>should</span></em></span><span> be. The language here is the problem. Foucault makes this point clear with homo-criminalis and homo-economicus, once the ontology is taken as a given, no one is </span><span><em><span>not</span></em></span><span> of it, but simply seen as not part of a certain section of it. Men are not men, they are either criminals or </span><span><em><span>not-</span></em></span><span>criminals, we are not ourselves we are either economizing or </span><span><em><span>not-</span></em></span><span>economizing, either way, we’re still tethered to a way of being we had no say in.</span></p>
<p><span>Well I’m here to say that this is complete and utter crap. If you want to go get involved in politics, then be my guest, but do NOT assume that just because I don’t care about a certain topic, opinion or perspective that I am immediately the antagonist of that position. There is a difference between a hostile apathy, in which one truly doesn’t care about the plight of others and a detachment within one simply is not involved. Of course, any </span><span><em><span>involved</span></em></span><span> are going to disagree. ‘It’s your duty!’ they will cry. ‘Do you not care about the world!’ they will shriek. ‘How can you just do nothing?’ they will plead. Actually, I am doing something, I’m not expending my energy on a status game which largely exists to inflate various egos and create jobs. Lest we forget that politicians are </span><span><em><span>workers</span></em></span><span>, to be a politician is a </span><span><em><span>job</span></em></span><span>, and by the looks of it, quite a cushy one at that. </span></p>
<p><span>Being </span><span><em><span>detached</span></em></span><span> from politics isn’t </span><span><em><span>not caring</span></em></span><span> about those things you left behind, in fact, it’s arguably the opposite. As soon as a charitable organization, a communal effort or a group event becomes politicized, I am instantly skeptical of its agenda, why? Well, because since when did helping others, loving thy neighbor or creating something helpful </span><span><em><span>have</span></em></span><span> to be seen through a political lens. Call me a soppy-sod, but buying a homeless person some food, donating to a local charity or helping out in a local event isn’t – and doesn’t have to be – a specifically political move or motivation, and if it is, you’re doing so to cater to your own narcissism. What </span><span><em><span>are</span></em></span><span> these acts then? Well, they are what they are. You help someone because they need help, you do something because it needs doing, you create because something needs creating; once sincere acts are filtered through the malicious gauze of politics they are usually lost entirely, abused into a self-congratulatory mutation. </span></p>
<p><span>Ok, maybe you’re with me, but you’re starting to think…’Ok, so what do I…</span><span><em><span>do?</span></em></span><span>‘ Isn’t that the point? Up until now, for many people, each and every act they undertook was done primarily from a political position as opposed to the multitude of other (healthier) perspectives that exist. What do you do? Do what you’d like and what you understand to be right. </span></p>
<p><span>“Ah yes Meta, but if we ‘do nothing’ as you propose, wont we be simply bolstering support for whichever party is in the running to win?” You’re still thinking politically, why does it </span><span><em><span>actually</span></em></span><span> matter to you? If I support X I’ve entered into a system which is so unfathomably corrupt, confused and rife with personality that I will never </span><span><em><span>truly</span></em></span><span> know what it is my vote is doing. It is NOT an apathy, an ignorance or a superiority. It is a detachment. It is one unclipping themselves from a perspective they never asked for in the first place. The years upon years spent drooling …</span></p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s no secret that this year has been a testing year on all fronts of our waking lives, leading us to ‘get out of our comfort zones’ and learn to adapt in vastly changing times. Subsequently, most employees have had to work remotely to some capacity (if not fully remotely), and we’ve all had to learn how to improve our work-life balance while finding new ways to still be as efficient as before in our professional lives.</p><p>Needless to say, today you do not need to be tech-savvy to adjust to the digital world. The key to surviving and succeeding in this world is to make sure you’re prepared with the necessary online tools, mindset, and time management skills.</p><p>Below is a list of tips to help you thrive in a digital workforce:</p><h2>1. Make sure you have a strong internet connection</h2><p>This may seem like a no-brainer, but possibly the first thing you need to make sure you have when working remotely is a strong internet connection. This will help ensure you’re always accessible to your colleagues, therefore able to carry out your daily tasks and duties without interruption. Depending on your household and the number of devices you have connected to your WIFI, you may need to upgrade your internet package so you have a fast and reliable connection.</p><p>Just as in the traditional work environment, it’s important to collaborate with your co-workers and management, and poor internet connection may hinder that. Luckily, most service providers provide affordable internet bundle packages that will cater to your needs without breaking your bank balance.</p><h2>2. Invest in good office furniture and computer equipment</h2><p>Following some basic, yet essential ergonomics tips can improve your efficiency, reduce fatigue and strain to your back and neck, and facilitate proper posture. That’s why it’s important to invest in comfortable and adjustable furniture just as much as it is to have reliable computer equipment and updated software to complete your home office setup.</p><p>When working an eight-hour day or more, maintaining proper posture while sitting is crucial, not only for immediate benefits but for long-term damage you may cause to your back if you do not adopt the correct seating posture with adequate lower back support. Adjustable chairs and tables are a must-have to help ease pressure and body discomfort while working.</p><p>What often goes overlooked is the importance of taking care of your eyes. Protect your eyes from digital eye strain with an anti-blue light screen protector for your laptop or display monitor and you’ll disrupt the chances of sleep deprivation, fatigue, and risk of macular degeneration.</p><h2>3. Have a dedicated workspace</h2><p>Apart from helping you curb unnecessary distractions from the TV, social media, or dare I say: your kids, having a dedicated workspace is necessary to help improve productivity and creativity. Usually, when you go to the office it’s easier to get into ‘work-mode’ since you’re in an environment that induces productivity, but when working from home, you have to put in a little more effort to stay focused and motivated. Avoid working from your bed, the couch, or anywhere else that may lead to inattentiveness and interruptions to the work at hand.</p><p>Working remotely is a benefit that requires both accountability and responsibility as an employee, so creating an environment that promotes efficiency<strong></strong>goes a long way. Even if you don’t have the luxury of having an actual office at home you can still dedicate a certain ‘work-zone’ (preferably close to a window so you can enjoy the benefits of fresh air and natural light) in a quiet part of your home.</p><h2>4. Take breaks</h2><p>Don’t be hesitant to take breaks during the day. Taking regular short breaks will help keep your productivity at a high as well as help you feel constantly recharged and engaged. These could include short breaks to meditate for 5-10 minutes, having coffee, stretching, or simply just walking around to increase your blood circulation. Incorporate the 20-20-20 rule into your schedule: Take a 20-second break every 20 minutes by looking at things at least 20 feet away.</p><p>You can set reminders on your phone to help you remember to get up and walk. You can even get creative and strategic in your approach and place certain equipment (like the printer for instance) in another room to necessitate getting up and walking.</p><h2>5. Keep learning and improving your skills.</h2><p>Continuously upgrading your knowledge and skills will not only help keep you relevant in your respective field but will also help you map out your career progression. In an ever-changing job market and surplus in demand for remote work, you need to be marketable to progress. The more skilled and experienced you are, the wider your opportunities and growth prospects.</p><p>There are amazing free online learning materials you can take advantage of, or find reasonably affordable online courses. Even reading books on self-improvement, motivation, and success will help to keep you driven and inspired.</p><h2>6. Engage with colleagues and maintain positive professional relationships</h2><p>One of the downsides of working remotely is that you lose the benefits of building rapport with colleagues and your managers, which can result in life-long and beneficial professional connections.</p><p>You spend 8 hours of the day working, so it’s important to have healthy relations with the people you work with so that you feel level-headed and motivated to work. Something as simple as a good morning message to using professional and friendly jargon to communicate will help facilitate solid and positive relationships.</p><p>Be proactive and participate actively in meetings, after-work activities (provided you’re protecting yourself and others by social distancing and wearing a mask), and any other engagement activities offered. Be mindful to respect each other's diversities but also know when to not distract your co-workers as you must always maintain a professional demeanor. This will help to build trust, mutual respect, and open communication amongst each other, and bring about teamwork.</p><h2>7. Disconnect and know when to ‘call it a day’</h2><p>Time is valuable, and so are you! In order to be the best employee you can be, you need to learn to take care of yourself and your health, including your mental health. In a cut-throat work environment where we’re constantly being graded on our performance, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and work to an excess.</p><p>Follow a strict work schedule but know when it’s time to ‘switch off’ and relax. If you find yourself unable to disconnect, practice managing your time better throughout the day so you’re able to finish your work on time. This will help reduce stress and improve the quality of your sleep.</p><p>Working overtime is necessary in certain cases, but downfall into the trap where you don’t give yourself (and your family and loved ones) the time to live and enjoy your life. Remember, the most productive employees are the ones who are well-rested and feel motivated to work.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>When "progress" is backwards</h2>

<p>20 Oct 2020 15:58 UTC</p>
<p>Lately I see many developments in the linux FOSS world that sell themselves as progress, but are actually hugely annoying and counter-productive.</p>

<p>Counter-productive to a point where they actually cause major regressions, costs, and as in the case of GTK+3 ruin user experience and the possibility that we'll ever enjoy "The year of the Linux desktop".</p>

<h2>Showcase 1: GTK+3</h2>

<p>GTK+2 used to be <em>the</em> GUI toolkit for Linux desktop applications.
It is highly customizable, reasonably lightweight and programmable from C, which means almost any scripting language can interface to it too.</p>

<p>Rather than improving the existing toolkit code in a backwards-compatible manner, <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/">its developers</a> decided to introduce many breaking API changes which require a major porting effort to make an existing codebase compatible with the successor GTK+3, and keeping support for GTK+2 while supporting GTK+3 at the same time typically involves a lot of #ifdef clutter in the source base which not many developers are willing to maintain.</p>

<p>Additionally GTK+3 made away with a lot of user-customizable themeing options, effectively rendering useless most of the existing themes that took considerable developer effort for their creation.
Here's a <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/gtk3-regressions-from-a-gtk2-perspective/19511">list of issues</a> users are complaining about.</p>

<p>Due to the effort required to port a GTK+2 application to use GTK+3, many finished GUI application projects will never be ported due to lack of manpower, lost interest of the main developer or his untimely demise.
An example of such a program is the excellent audio editor <a href="http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/">sweep</a> which has seen its last release in 2008.
With Linux distros removing support for GTK+2, these apps are basically lost in the void of time.</p>

<p>The other option for distros is to keep both the (unmaintained) GTK+2 and GTK+3 in their repositories so GTK+2-only apps can still be used, however that causes the user of these apps to require basically the double amount of disk and RAM space as both toolkits need to live next to each other. Also this will only work as long as there are no breaking changes in the Glib library which both toolkits are built upon.</p>

<p>Even worse, due to the irritation the GTK+3 move caused to developers, many switched to QT4 or QT5, which requires use of C++, so a typical linux distro now has a mix of GTK+2, GTK+3, GTK+4, QT4 and QT5 applications, where each toolkit consumes considerable resources.</p>

<p>Microsoft (TM) knows better and sees backwards compatibility as the holy grail and underlying root cause of its success and market position. Any 25 year old Win32 GUI application from the Win95 era still works without issues on the latest Windows (TM) release. They even still support 16bit MS-DOS apps using some built-in emulator.</p>

<p>From MS' perspective, the freedesktop.org decision makers played into their hands when they decided to make GTK+3 a completely different beast.
Of course, we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">taught to never believe in malice but in stupidity</a>, so it is unthinkable that there was actually a real conspiracy and monetary compensations behind this move.
Otherwise we would be conspiracy theorist nuts, right ?</p>

<h2>Showcase 2: python3</h2>

<p>Python is a hugely successful programming/scripting language used by probably millions of programmers.</p>

<p>Whereas python2 development has been very stable for many years, python3 changes at the blink of an eye. It's not uncommon to find that after an update of python3 to the next release, existing code no longer works as expected.</p>

<p>Many developers such as myself prefer to use a stable development environment over one that is as volatile as python3.</p>

<p>With the decision to <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-announce-list@python.org/thread/OFCIETIXLX34X7FVK5B5WPZH22HXV342/">EOL python2</a> thousands of py2-based applications will experience the same fate as GTK+2 applications without maintainer: they will be rendered obsolete and disappear from the distro repositories. This may happen quicker than one would expect, as python by default provides bindings to the system's OpenSSL library, which has a history of making backwards-incompatible changes. At the very least, once the web agrees on a new TLS standard, python2 will be rendered completely useless.</p>

<p>Porting python2 to python3 isn't usually as involving as GTK+2 to GTK+3, but due to the dynamic nature of python the syntax checker can't catch all code issues automatically so many issues will be experienced at runtime in cornercases, causing the ported application to throw a backtrace and stopping execution, which can have grave consequences.</p>

<p>Many companies have <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/jpmorgans-athena-has-35-million-lines-of-python-code-and-wont-be-updated-to-python-3-in-time/">millions of line of code still in python2</a> and will have to produce quite some sweat and expenses to make it compatible to python3.</p>

<h2>Showcase 3: ip vs ifconfig</h2>

<p>Once one had learned his handful of ifconfig and route commands to configure a Linux' box network connections, one could comfortably manage this aspect across all distros. Not any longer, someone had the glorious idea to declare ifconfig and friends obsolete and provide a new, more "powerful" tool to do its job: <code>ip</code>.</p>

<p>The command for bringing up a network device is now <code>ip link set dev eth1 up</code> vs the older <code>ifconfig eth1 up</code>. Does this really look like progress?
Worst, the documentation of the tool is non-intuitive so one basically has to google for examples that show the translation from one command to the other.</p>

<p>The same critics apply to <code>iw</code> vs <code>iwconfig</code>.</p>

<h2>Showcase 4: ethernet adapter renaming by systemd/udev</h2>

<p>Latest systemd-based distros come up with network interface names such as <code>enx78e7d1ea46da</code> or <code>vethb817d6a</code>, instead of the traditional <code>eth0</code>.
The interface names assigned by default on Ubuntu 20 are so long a regular human can't even remember them, any configuration attempt requires one to copy/paste the name from <code>ip a</code> output.
Yet almost every distro goes along with this <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/">Poettering/freedesktop.org-dictated</a> nonsense.</p>

<h2>Showcase 5: CMake, meson, and $BUILDSYSTEMOFTHEDAY</h2>

<p>While the traditional buildsystem used on UNIX, <code>autoconf</code>, has its warts, it was designed in such a way that only the application developer required the full set of tools, whereas the consumer requires only a POSIX compatible shell environment and a <code>make</code> program.</p>

<p>More "modern" build systems like <code>cmake</code> and <code>meson</code> don't give a damn about the dependencies a user has to install, in fact according to <a href="https://kevstras.com/programming/2017/12/18/meson.html">this</a>, <code>meson</code> authors claimed it to be one of their goals to force users to have a bleeding edge version of python3 installed so it can be universally assumed as a given.</p>

<p><code>CMake</code> is written in C++, consists of 70+ MB of extracted sources and requires an impressive amount of time to build from source. Built with debug information, it takes up 434 MB of my harddisk space as of version 3.9.3.
It's primary raison-d'etre is its support for the Microsoft (TM) Visual Studio (R) (TM) solution files, so Windows (TM) people can compile stuff from source with a few clicks.</p>

<p>The two of them have in common that they threw over board the well-known user interface to configure and make and invented their own NIH solution, which requires the user to learn yet another way to build his applications.</p>

<p>Both of these build systems seem to have either acquired a cult following just like systemd, or someone is paying trolls to show up on github with pull requests to replace GNU autoconf with either of those, for example <a href="https://github.com/containers/crun/issues/495">1</a> <a href="https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/pull/968">2</a> .
Interestingly also, GNOME, which is tightly connected to freedesktop.org, has made it one of its goals to <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/MesonPorting">switch all components to meson</a>.
Their porting effort involves almost every key component in the Linux desktop stack, including cairo, pango, fontconfig, freetype, and dozens of others. What might be the agenda behind this effort?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We live in an era where in the FOSS world one constantly has to relearn things, switch to new, supposedly "better", but more bloated solutions, and is generally left with the impression that someone is pulling the rug from below one's feet.
Many of the key changes in this area have been rammed through by a small set of decision makers, often closely related to Red Hat/Gnome/freedesktop.org.
We're buying this "progress" at a high cost, and one can't avoid asking oneself whether there's more to the story than meets the eye.
Never forget, Red Hat and Microsoft (TM) are <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/partners/microsoft">partners</a> and might even have the same shareholders.</p>

Doing this is tricky in a React app that uses server side rendering (SSR) because client and server rendering work quite differently: Client render is async so data can be loaded inside components when they render, but server render is completely synchronous - the data must be loaded before render happens.</p><p data-reactid="57">Data loading is, of course, async. The client component-centric data loading pattern is nice, but it's incompatible with synchronous server render. React simply has no mechanism to wait for data to load when components render on SSR. There's a further problem too: React also provides no built-in way to hydrate data loaded during SSR into client state on first render. This is also up to you to implement.</p><p data-reactid="58">So, full stack data loading in React is a tricky problem. A couple of solutions have emerged:</p><ol data-reactid="59"><li data-reactid="60"><p data-reactid="61">Load data at the route level, instead of the component level, then pass data to all components under the route. Works on SSR since the route is known in the request, so data can be loaded before render begins. Can be implemented by piecing together router and state manager libraries.</p></li><li data-reactid="62"><p data-reactid="63">Use a framework that wraps React and abstracts the problem away, perhaps by providing a framework-specific async data loading function for components that works on SSR, and also takes care of hydrating state on the client.</p></li></ol><p data-reactid="64">React Frontload aims to provide a third way - the component-centric data loading pattern available full stack, but without having to buy into a whole framework just to get this feature. It's just a small library that solves this one problem, and can be used in any React stack.</p><p data-reactid="68">Here's an example of loading data into a component with React Frontload</p><p><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-405d26435b59c98dcb8b"><div><p>It was Monday at 9:58 PM, and I finished a CAD assignment with the help of my TA. Nick is a great dude, not only because of how helpful and knowledgeable he is but because of his willingness to explain the fundamentals of CAD and engineering until one deeply understands it.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s become a routine when I finish the assignments, we talk about life, economics, psychology, and anything that comes our way. In our conversation, the topic of competition came up.&nbsp;</p><p>He tells me when he applied to colleges, he avoided the “famous” and “prestigious” places from the East Coast because of the overfocus on competition, and the lack of focus on what you’re genuinely curious about.&nbsp;</p><p>He says, “Students don’t do what they like or what they want to learn more about, rather they tend to do what they’re good at because the school, parents, friends, etc tell them to.”</p><p>As soon as he said that, sparks started happening in my head, and I was ready to share my response about the dangers of competition.&nbsp;</p><p>Competition is great [1], yet I avoid it as much as possible. Competing with others can lead you to an unhealthy path where you end up doing what you thought would make you a winner, and not what would make you enjoy what you do.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick tells me that often being the best and competing with others can often lead to putting other people down. In zero-sum games, if I win, that means you have to lose. There are plenty of cases where it's positive-sum, where no one wins at someone else’s expense.&nbsp;</p><p>I avoid competition [2] because if you want what other people want 1) it becomes harder to get what you want, and 2) even if you win or get what you wanted, you may realize that was not what you wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn’t have to be this way, as there are many alternatives to thrive without putting other people down and doing things you want to do by following your curiosity and interests.&nbsp;</p><p>How?</p><p><strong>You uniquely define what you do in a way that no one else is doing it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you are passionate about entrepreneurship, you can’t call yourself an “entrepreneur.” You need to go deeper. For instance, if you are an entrepreneur, define the areas, the people who you work with, where you work, how you work, and why you work.&nbsp;</p><p>You might be an entrepreneur focused on the well-being of the environment and human life in the southern parts of the country who is trying to implement Algae-based biofuel on tractors. That’s specific and you can go even deeper like the states, the brand of the tractors, and the type of algae.&nbsp;</p><p>Or if you like writing, you can’t call yourself a “writer.” See within and start unburying. You could write about how the sophisticated Roman city of Pompeii affected how we think about building and designing cities in the 20th and 21st centuries.&nbsp;</p><p>I know you may feel uncomfortable being that specific because you may think: 1) You’re passionate about more topics, 2) You may lose opportunities, 3) You may not like being that specific.&nbsp;</p><p>Frankly, that’s how I feel too. However, I can define what I do in such a unique way so I can see where to go or what to do. I don’t have to follow it and can always change it. In my case, I didn’t even worry about it, and I followed what interested me and what seemed curious.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve realized that following your genuine curiosity is the best way to avoid competition and win (whatever that means for you).&nbsp;</p><p>I followed my curiosity and I can look back at the essays. Although they may seem like different topics, they all have one purpose: making my readers more optimistic, ambitious, and curious.&nbsp;</p><p>Define what you do uniquely so you have no competition. That way, you’ll win without winning and without other people down.&nbsp;</p><p>And that was only ten minutes of one of my chats with Nick. Our conversations get more interesting every week. If you’d like to hear more about them, join hundreds of people in the <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank"><strong><em>Weekly Memos</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>[1] I’m not talking about “Market Competition.” I’m referring to competition at a personal and an individual level.</p><p>[2] I don’t just avoid competition for the sake of avoiding it. But if I find myself competing for no reason, it could be a sign that I’m not thinking for myself. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604669904171_5110"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), sign up for my <a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">Weekly Memos</a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out. Better than having to check the site!</p></div></div>]]>

</p>

<p>This year, we saw a dazzling application of machine learning. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">The OpenAI GPT-2</a> exhibited impressive ability of writing coherent and passionate essays that exceed what we anticipated current language models are able to produce. The GPT-2 wasn’t a particularly novel architecture – it’s architecture is very similar to the decoder-only transformer. The GPT2 was, however, a very large, transformer-based language model trained on a massive dataset. In this post, we’ll look at the architecture that enabled the model to produce its results. We will go into the depths of its self-attention layer. And then we’ll look at applications for the decoder-only transformer beyond language modeling.</p>

<p>My goal here is to also supplement my earlier post, <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">The Illustrated Transformer</a>, with more visuals explaining the inner-workings of transformers, and how they’ve evolved since the original paper. My hope is that this visual language will hopefully make it easier to explain later Transformer-based models as their inner-workings continue to evolve.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-gpt2-and-language-modeling-">Part #1: GPT2 And Language Modeling <a href="#part-1-got-and-language-modeling" name="part-1-got-and-language-modeling">#</a></h2>

<p>So what exactly is a language model?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-language-model">What is a Language Model</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/">The Illustrated Word2vec</a>, we’ve looked at what a language model is – basically a machine learning model that is able to look at part of a sentence and predict the next word. The most famous language models are smartphone keyboards that suggest the next word based on what you’ve currently typed.</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/word2vec/swiftkey-keyboard.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>In this sense, we can say that the GPT-2 is basically the next word prediction feature of a keyboard app, but one that is much larger and more sophisticated than what your phone has. The GPT-2 was trained on a massive 40GB dataset called WebText that the OpenAI researchers crawled from the internet as part of the research effort. To compare in terms of storage size, the keyboard app I use, SwiftKey, takes up 78MBs of space. The smallest variant of the trained GPT-2, takes up 500MBs of storage to store all of its parameters. The largest GPT-2 variant is 13 times the size so it could take up more than 6.5 GBs of storage space.</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt2-sizes.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>One great way to experiment with GPT-2 is using the <a href="https://gpt2.apps.allenai.org/?text=Joel%20is">AllenAI GPT-2 Explorer</a>. It uses GPT-2 to display ten possible predictions for the next word (alongside their probability score). You can select a word then see the next list of predictions to continue writing the passage.</p>

<h3 id="transformers-for-language-modeling">Transformers for Language Modeling</h3>

<p>As we’ve seen in The <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">Illustrated Transformer</a>, the original transformer model is made up of an encoder and decoder – each is a stack of what we can call transformer blocks. That architecture was appropriate because the model tackled machine translation  – a problem where encoder-decoder architectures have been successful in the past.</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/transformer-encoder-decoder.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>A lot of the subsequent research work saw the architecture shed either the encoder or decoder, and use just one stack of transformer blocks – stacking them up as high as practically possible, feeding them massive amounts of training text, and throwing vast amounts of compute at them (hundreds of thousands of dollars to train some of these language models, likely millions in the case of <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/">AlphaStar</a>).</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt-2-transformer-xl-bert-3.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>How high can we stack up these blocks? It turns out that’s one of the main distinguishing factors between the different GPT2 model sizes:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt2-sizes-hyperparameters-3.png">
  <br>
</p>

<h3 id="one-difference-from-bert">One Difference From BERT</h3>
<blockquote>
<strong>First Law of Robotics</strong><br>
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
</blockquote>

<p>The GPT-2 is built using transformer decoder blocks. BERT, on the other hand, uses transformer encoder blocks. We will examine the difference in a following section. But one key difference between the two is that GPT2, like traditional language models, outputs one token at a time. Let’s for example prompt a well-trained GPT-2 to recite the first law of robotics:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/gpt-2-output.gif">
  <br>
</p>

<p>The way these models actually work is that after each token is produced, that token is added to the sequence of inputs. And that new sequence becomes the input to the model in its next step. This is an idea called “auto-regression”. This is one of the ideas that <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">made RNNs unreasonably effective</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/gpt-2-autoregression-2.gif">
  <br>
</p>

<p>The GPT2, and some later models like TransformerXL and XLNet are auto-regressive in nature. BERT is not. That is a trade off. In losing auto-regression, BERT gained the ability to incorporate the context on both sides of a word to gain better results. XLNet brings back autoregression while finding an alternative way to incorporate the context on both sides.</p>

<h3 id="the-evolution-of-the-transformer-block">The Evolution of the Transformer Block</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">initial transformer paper</a> introduced two types of transformer blocks:</p>

<h4 id="the-encoder-block">The Encoder Block</h4>

<p>First is the encoder block:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/transformer-encoder-block-2.png">
  <br>
  An encoder block from the original transformer paper can take inputs up until a certain max sequence length (e.g. 512 tokens). It's okay if an input sequence is shorter than this limit, we can just pad the rest of the sequence.
</p>

<h4 id="the-decoder-block">The Decoder Block</h4>
<p>Second, there’s the decoder block which has a small architectural variation from the encoder block – a layer to allow it to pay attention to specific segments from the encoder:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/transformer-decoder-block-2.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>One key difference in the self-attention layer here, is that it masks future tokens – not by changing the word to [mask] like BERT, but by interfering in the self-attention calculation blocking information from tokens that are to the right of the position being calculated.</p>

<p>If, for example, we’re to highlight the path of position #4, we can see that it is only allowed to attend to the present and previous tokens:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/transformer-decoder-block-self-attention-2.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>It’s important that the distinction between self-attention (what BERT uses) and masked self-attention (what GPT-2 uses) is clear. A normal self-attention block allows a position to peak at tokens to its right. Masked self-attention prevents that from happening:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/self-attention-and-masked-self-attention.png">
  <br>
</p>

<h4 id="the-decoder-only-block">The Decoder-Only Block</h4>
<p>Subsequent to the original paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf">Generating Wikipedia by Summarizing Long Sequences</a> proposed another arrangement of the transformer block that is capable of doing language modeling. This model threw away the Transformer encoder. For that reason, let’s call the model the “Transformer-Decoder”. This early transformer-based language model was made up of a stack of six transformer decoder blocks:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/transformer-decoder-intro.png">
  <br>
  The decoder blocks are identical. I have expanded the first one so you can see its self-attention layer is the masked variant. Notice that the model now can address up to 4,000 tokens in a certain segment -- a massive upgrade from the 512 in the original transformer.
</p>

<p>These blocks were very similar to the original decoder blocks, except they did away with that second self-attention layer. A similar architecture was examined in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04444.pdf">Character-Level Language Modeling with Deeper Self-Attention</a> to create a language model that predicts one letter/character at a time.</p>

<p>The OpenAI GPT-2 model uses these decoder-only blocks.</p>

<h3 id="crash-course-in-brain-surgery-looking-inside-gpt-2">Crash Course in Brain Surgery: Looking Inside GPT-2</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look inside and you will see,
The words are cutting deep inside my brain.
Thunder burning, quickly burning,
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah.
~<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgie_(band)">Budgie</a></strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Let’s lay a trained GPT-2 on our surgery table and look at how it works.</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt-2-layers-2.png">
  <br>
  The GPT-2 can process 1024 tokens. Each token flows through all the decoder blocks along its own path.
</p>

<p>The simplest way to run a trained GPT-2 is to allow it to ramble on its own (which is technically called <em>generating unconditional samples</em>) – alternatively, we can give it a prompt to have it speak about a certain topic (a.k.a generating <em>interactive conditional samples</em>). In the rambling case, we can simply hand it the start token and have it start generating words (the trained model uses <code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code> as its start token. Let’s call it <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> instead).</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt2-simple-output-2.gif"></p>
</div>

<p>The model only has one input token, so that path would be the only active one. The token is processed successively through all the layers, then a vector is produced along that path. That vector can be scored against the model’s vocabulary (all the words the model knows, 50,000 words in the case of GPT-2). In this case we selected the token with the highest probability, ‘the’. But we can certainly mix things up – you know how if you keep clicking the suggested word in your keyboard app, it sometimes can stuck in repetitive loops where the only way out is if you click the second or third suggested word. The same can happen here. GPT-2 has a parameter called top-k that we can use to have the model consider sampling words other than the top word (which is the case when top-k = 1).</p>

<p>In the next step, we add the output from the first step to our input sequence, and have the model make its next prediction:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt-2-simple-output-3.gif">
  <br>
</p>

<p>Notice that the second path is the only that’s active in this calculation. Each layer of GPT-2 has retained its own interpretation of the first token and will use it in processing the second token (we’ll get into more detail about this in the following section about self-attention). GPT-2 does not re-interpret the first token in light of the second token.</p>

<h3 id="a-deeper-look-inside">A Deeper Look Inside</h3>

<h4 id="input-encoding">Input Encoding</h4>
<p>Let’s look at more details to get to know the model more intimately. Let’s start from the input. As in other NLP models we’ve discussed before, the model looks up the …</p></div></div>

<p>Of all the changes I’ve seen over GoCardless’ adolescence, one of the most
impactful has been collecting all our data into a single place.</p>

<p>Thanks to an extraordinary effort across many teams, we went from all our data
being inside a single Postgres database to all our data sources- Postgres,
MySQL, Salesforce, Slack, even our HR platform- being loaded into datasets
inside <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">Google BigQuery</a>.</p>

<p>For those who haven’t worked with a setup like this, it’s difficult to overstate
how transformational it can be. Tools like BigQuery can analyse terabytes of
data in seconds, making complex analysis a casual exercise.</p>

<p>I think this is really cool, and I’m going to try convincing you by sharing an
example where 2hrs of analysis helped prioritise 2-4 weeks of engineering work.
We’ll end up with query that joins across two very different datasources, which
you can preview at this post’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/lawrencejones/5850c75ecdcbb77492c9e37d11076643">sample Gist</a>.</p>



<p>As some background, GoCardless <a href="https://developer.gocardless.com/api-reference/#appendix-webhooks">sends webhooks</a> to
integrators, informing them whenever something happens to their account.</p>

<p>An example of a payment created event might look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"EV001X2XMQXG73"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"resource_type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"payments"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"submitted"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"links"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"payment"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"PM000ESVVBV1R3"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"organisation"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"OR00002CC2G5CG"</span><span>
  </span><span>},</span><span>
  </span><span>"details"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"origin"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gocardless"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"cause"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"payment_submitted"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"bank_account_id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"BA00006XZ7SRNV"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"description"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Payment submitted to the banks. As a result, it can no longer be cancelled."</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’ll notice that the event speaks only of the payment ID (<code>PM000ESVVBV1R3</code>)
rather than providing a copy of the payment inline. This omission is deliberate,
intended to encourage integrators to reach back to the <a href="https://developer.gocardless.com/api-reference/">GoCardless
API</a> to fetch the most up-to-date version of a resource instead
of using potentially stale data.</p>

<p>But this means GoCardless does the work to serialize and send the webhook, just
for the receiver to come back the GoCardless API and request the full version of
these resources:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/connected-data-sequence-diagram.png" alt="API integrator making requests in response to webhooks">
  <figcaption>
    API integrator making requests in response to webhooks
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In questioning optimisations, we wondered whether we should <strong>fully serialize
resources into the webhook payload,</strong> instead of referencing them by ID,
allowing an integrator to avoid calling back into our API.</p>

<p>Before we ever consider this, though, we need to know how many API requests
could be attributed to this behaviour. Without the data, we could be vastly
overestimating the number of integrators who make requests in this manner.</p>



<p>Our goal is to understand if these webhook callback requests consume a
significant amount of our API capacity. If the cost is negligible, then it makes
more sense to prioritise work to optimise our API than to remove this workload.</p>

<p>We really want to understand the <strong>percentage of API work (seconds spent
responding) that goes to webhook callback requests</strong>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing if a request made by an integrator is
in response to receiving a webhook. We have no telemetry–nor can I imagine what
this would look like–that could tell us “I’m <code>GET’ing /payments/PM123</code> because I
just saw <code>PM123</code> in a webhook”.</p>

<p>While we can’t be certain, we can make some assumptions about user behaviour
that can help us guess a relationship. You’ll find examples of these assumptions
in a load of useful metrics, such as the Google GSuite team’s definition of user
uptime: <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/02/26/meaningful-availability/">Meaningful
Availability</a>.</p>

<p>Because we encourage integrators to use webhooks over polling, it’s reasonable
to assume any request for a specific resource immediately after creation is in
response to a webhook. After all, how would you know the ID unless you’d been
told?</p>

<p>With this, we can say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requests are considered webhook related if they access a specific resource,
and were made within 3 minutes of sending a webhook that referenced the same
resource</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we explore our data to see how we can use this.</p>



<p>The thrust of this article is that a connected dataset is worth more than the
sum of its parts. By exporting such a variety of data sources in BigQuery, we
can combine them in ways that aren’t practical to predict in advance.</p>

<p>We’ll combine two such sources to answer our question: the <code>webhooks</code> table of
our relational Postgres database, and HTTP request logs.</p>

<h2 id="webhooks"><code>webhooks</code></h2>

<p>As a developer configuring webhooks, it’s really useful to see what is being
sent. Often you screw up the endpoint or your receiver is failing for some
reason, problems that become clear when you can see things from the senders
perspective.</p>

<p>For this reason, we have a view in the GoCardless dashboard that shows exactly
this:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/connected-data-webhooks.png" alt="GoCardless dashboard showing a list of sent webhooks">
  <figcaption>
    Developer page in the GoCardless dashboard, showing a log of sent webhooks
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To provide this view, we store webhook requests and responses in a <code>webhooks</code>
table of the database that powers our API. Each <code>webhooks</code> row has a
<code>request_body</code> field, which is a string containing the JSON body of the request,
in which we’ll find our resource IDs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>psql=&gt; select id, url, request_body from webhooks limit 1;
-[ RECORD 1]+-----------------------------------------------------------
id           | WB0001J9R226EM
url          | https://webhook.site/f345c389-a70a-48e1-8548-9bf2efea5fbc
request_body | {
                 "events": [{
                   "id": "EV001X3873HCX9",
                   "links": {
                     "payment": "PM000EWZC0KAJX"
                   },
                   ...,
                 }]
               }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This Postgres database belongs to our monolithic payments service, an
application which powers a significant part of our product. Unsurprisingly, this
was one of the first data sources exported to BigQuery, so we can easily use
this table for our analysis.</p>

<h2 id="merchant_activity"><code>merchant_activity</code></h2>

<p>To analyse API requests, we’d normally reach for HTTP logs from our servers.
GoCardless uses Elasticsearch to store application logs, which are collected
from the <code>STDOUT</code> of processes.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch encourages you to think about your logging schema- if you don’t,
you tend to lose logs. As much pain as this caused, our push for standardising
log schemas meant writing a tool that could <strong>intercept the application logs</strong>
and <strong>push them into BigQuery was an easy win</strong>.</p>

<p>The application log we’re interested in is the <code>merchant_activity</code> event, which
you can think of as a plain HTTP request log-line with additional information
added after authentication. We’re interested in GET requests to specific
resources, something like <code>GET /payments/PM123</code>. For these requests, we log a
<code>resource_id</code> field specifying the resource accessed, looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"_log_timestamp"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2020-10-30 16:21:14.818 UTC"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"method"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"GET"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"handler"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Routes::Payments::Show"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"duration"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0.024530284"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"resource_id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"PM000EWZC0KAJX"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>



<p>Now we have our data, we can begin crunching it. If it’s easier, you can see the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/lawrencejones/5850c75ecdcbb77492c9e37d11076643#file-query-sql">full BigQuery query here</a>, and I’ll explain piece-by-piece
below.</p>

<p>We’re aiming to produce a dataset of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>timestamp,</strong> group requests by the minute (eg. <code>2020-10-29 00:01:00 UTC</code>)</li>
  <li><strong>duration,</strong> sum of all request durations in seconds (eg. 436.4s)</li>
  <li><strong>webhook_work_duration,</strong> sum of all webhook callback request durations (eg. 5.95s)</li>
  <li><strong>work_ratio,</strong> fraction of work for webhook callbacks (1.36%)</li>
</ul>

<p>First, we need to extract the resource IDs from our <code>webhooks</code> table where the
JSON request body is stored as a string in the <code>request_body</code> field.
Manipulating large blobs of JSON isn’t that SQL friendly, but thankfully
BigQuery supports Javascript functions (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions#javascript-udf-structure">BigQuery: Standard SQL user-defined
functions</a>) which can much more flexibly use
this JSON.</p>

<p>We’ll define a function <code>extractIDs</code>, which can pull all the references resource
IDs from the <code>request_body</code> field:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/*
extractIDs takes the webhook request payload, which is structured like so:
{
  "events": [
    { "links": { "&lt;resource-name&gt;": "RES123", ... } },
    ...,
  ]
}

And extracts the unique set of resource IDs referenced by the webhook.

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMP</span> <span>FUNCTION</span>
  <span>extractIDs</span><span>(</span><span>json</span> <span>STRING</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNS</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>&gt;</span>

  return [
    ... new Set(
      JSON.parse(json)["</span><span>events</span><span>"]
        .map(e=&gt;Object.values(e["</span><span>links</span><span>"]))
        .flat()
    )
  ];
</span><span>""</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once defined, we can use this function natively inside of any standard SQL
query. We’re going to want to create a CTE called <code>webhook_resources</code>, which
takes each row from <code>webhooks</code> and generates a new row per resource ID inside
the <code>webhooks.request_body</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>WITH</span>
  <span>-- Expand each webhook into a row per resource ID from the request_body</span>
  <span>-- payload. Use the Javascript extractIDs function to parse all the events,</span>
  <span>-- then UNNEST the parsed array into separate rows.</span>
  <span>webhook_resources</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>id</span><span>,</span>
    <span>created_at</span><span>,</span>
    <span>resource_id</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span>
      <span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>created_at</span><span>,</span>
      <span>extractIDs</span><span>(</span><span>request_body</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>resource_ids</span>
    <span>FROM</span>
      <span>webhooks</span> <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>webhook_resources</span>
    <span>-- UNNEST transforms the array of resources IDs into a row per resource ID,</span>
    <span>-- while the CROSS JOIN finds every pairing from the original webhook (1) to</span>
    <span>-- every resource ID (n).</span>
    <span>CROSS</span> <span>JOIN</span>
    <span>UNNEST</span><span>(</span><span>resource_ids</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>resource_id</span>
  <span>),</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That gets us the webhook resources, and this is where we’re about to leverage
the <strong>connected data concept</strong> to join our Postgres data (<code>webhooks</code>) onto
application logs (<code>merchant_activity</code>).</p>

<p>We’ll join the two sources on a condition that expresses our previous
assumption: that requests are webhook related if they happen within 3m of
sending a webhook that referenced the request resource.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>-- Join each HTTP request log onto webhook_resources. Set the</span>
  <span>-- webhook_work_duration field to be the duration of the request, if we can</span>
  <span>-- find a webhook that was sent within 3m either side of the request.</span>
  <span>requests</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>merchant_activity</span><span>.</span><span>_log_timestamp</span> <span>AS</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>,</span>

    <span>(</span>
      <span>CASE</span> <span>webhook_resources</span><span>.</span><span>resource_id</span> <span>IS</span> <span>NULL</span>

                Random (history): Veterans' (Armsistice) Day            </p>
                    <div>
                 <p>102 years ago on 11 November 1918 the Armistice with Germany was signed ending the Great War. All was quiet on the Western front. The guns of August had led to the mechanized slaughter of millions. The armistice did not end the conflict; it only delayed the resolution another 30 years or so. </p>
<p>On this day we remember all veterans of wars who go out and do the dirty work for the rest of us. It's the old men who always start wars. It's the rich, lazy and indolent who refuse to fight them. It's the veterans who respond to the call.</p>
<p>We remember you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Here's an apt poem from the earlier Crimean War by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I<br>
Half a league, half a league,<br>
Half a league onward,<br>
All in the valley of Death<br>
Rode the six hundred.<br>
“Forward, the Light Brigade!<br>
Charge for the guns!” he said.<br>
Into the valley of Death<br>
Rode the six hundred.</p>
<p>II<br>
“Forward, the Light Brigade!”<br>
Was there a man dismayed?<br>
Not though the soldier knew<br>
Someone had ...</p>            </div>

<div>
    <main>
            <article>
    
    <div>
            <p>Close your eyes and think about these situations:</p><p>Situation one: Imagine you are on your way to work on a Monday morning. You take the regular metro (or subway or bus), which is extremely crowded. Five minutes after you get in, you notice that an older woman loses her balance and falls. She gets hurt and is crying in pain. By the looks, it might be a severe injury.</p><p>What would you do?</p><p>Before you read on, please take a second to visualize what you would do for the older woman.</p><p>Situation two- It is the same as above. The only difference is that the injured person is not an older stranger, but one of your parents.</p><p>What would you do now? Would it be any different from the first situation?</p><p>I believe that a lot of people would help the older woman from the first situation to a certain extent. Maybe they take her to the closest hospital, or they call the emergency services, or they call someone from her phone. And the situation would end there.</p><p>In the second case, most would probably take their parent to the hospital, take the day off from work, and stay with their parent until they get the necessary treatment and recover fully.</p><p>As expected, the level of <em>ownership</em> is much higher in the second case compared to the first.</p><p>In the first instance, the person worked towards a short term goal or an instant output - get the injured person immediate help. In the second case, the person fought for a longer-term goal and an <em>outcome - </em>help the parent get <em>whatever</em> they need to recover.</p><p>The above set of actions sound apparent, because in one situation, the wounded is a stranger, and in the second, they are a parent. But that is not the point. The point is that the same person can operate at different levels of ownership depending on how much they care about the outcome.</p><p>Great product managers genuinely care about the problems they solve and the solutions they deliver. Great product managers also have an exceptionally high level of ownership.</p><p>Let us understand the advantages of being a high ownership PM:</p><ol><li><strong>Confidence and trust. </strong>Direct manager, peers, and seniors will have very high confidence in those who consistently own and deliver results. They will be the most coveted team member or leader for critical and complex tasks.</li><li><strong>Better decision making. </strong>High ownership individuals have the "do whatever it takes" attitude. Getting things done requires excellent decision making. PMs who are ownership driven create systems and processes to enable and improve their decisions.</li><li><strong>Bigger and stronger network.</strong> Most business-critical decisions require alignment across multiple leaders and teams. High ownership PMs build and leverage relationships to expedite the process of making difficult decisions.</li><li><strong>Create a positive and happy culture in the organization. </strong>Great PMs are self-motivated and deliver positive results, which builds a success-driven culture - something that every employer desires.</li><li><strong>Create a meaningful and visible impact. </strong>As long as PMs are working on the right tasks - which great PMs always do - their work will create a positive impact on their team and the organization.</li></ol><p>At this stage, you might be asking yourself - "How do I become (more) ownership driven?" And, we have the answer to that question, which I will share in the next post.</p><p>For now, I leave you with one of Gary W. Keller's quote, that summarizes the importance of <em>ownership</em>.</p><blockquote>Taking complete ownership of your outcomes by holding no one but yourself responsible for them is the most powerful thing you can do to drive your success.</blockquote>

<p>After several years in development, Jaguar and Land Rover are the first carmakers to integrate Silentium’s ‘Active Acoustics’ software in three of their new vehicles, meaning the technology is now available for car buyers to experience. Active road noise cancellation removes 90% of unwanted noise across a broad band of frequencies – from 20Hz up to 1kHz – providing a quieter and more refined experience for occupants, and therefore preventing driver fatigue.</p>
<p>In addition to wellbeing benefits, Silentium’s Active Acoustics technology offers vehicle manufacturers a way to reduce their reliance on costly passive noise damping and insulation materials, and reduce vehicle weight – an increasingly important R&amp;D factor as the industry enters a new era of electro-mobility.</p>
<p>Anthony Manias, Head of Automotive at Silentium, commented: “<em>Active Acoustics will change the way car manufacturers reduce, cancel and enhance sound inside their vehicles, and how customers perceive and interact with these sounds. Silentium has proven that it can make broadband in-car noise cancellation work – now the duty is on carmakers to adopt the technology and ensure their customers can enjoy the benefits.”</em></p>
<p><img src="https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="756" srcset="https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1.jpg 1000w, https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1-768x581.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><strong>How active noise cancellation works</strong></p>
<p>Silentium’s industry-first technology is similar to that found in a pair of high-end noise-cancelling headphones, but more advanced as it manipulates a larger amount of air. Up to six strategically positioned accelerometers on a vehicle’s chassis monitor unwanted road noise and send a signal to an on-board control unit with Silentium’s software, which plays an equivalent anti-noise signal through the vehicle’s speaker system. The pressure waves from both the unwanted exterior noise and manufactured anti-noise reach occupants’ eardrums at exactly the same time and cancel each other out.</p>
<p>Silentium’s Active Acoustics software can reduce, cancel and enhance sound inside any vehicle, improving occupant comfort, safety and wellbeing, and creating a more enjoyable environment for all.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>One thing I do multiple times a day is browsing my company’s GitHub organization repositories.<br>
My process for opening these repositories in the browser is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Chrome</li>
<li>Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> to focus the address bar</li>
<li>Start typing the GitHub repository name</li>
<li>Look for the page suggestion and click on it</li>
</ul>
<p>This flow works well for repositories that I have starred as bookmarks or that I browsed recently…<br>
…But because I’m a total sucker for Alfred, today I wasted almost an hour moving this process into an Alfred workflow.</p>
<p><span>

<h2>The Action Plan</h2>
<p>Knowing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire repository list is huge and doesn’t change often</li>
<li>I wanted the Alfred repository search result to be instant</li>
</ul>
<p>Making an API request to filter the repositories each time I invoke the Alfred workflow wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>So I decided to 1) download the entire repository list into a JSON file, 2) transform it into an Alred-compatible format, and 3) use the <a href="https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-fuzzy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alfred’s fuzzy search helper</a> to filter the results.</p>
<h2>Creating the GitHub repository list</h2>
<p>First of all, I <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">created a GitHub API token with a scope to access the repositories list</a>.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="github repo access" title="github repo access" src="https://mmazzarolo.com/static/5debf06855fa8eef2379c163d8d95943/fcda8/github-repo-access.png" srcset="https://mmazzarolo.com/static/5debf06855fa8eef2379c163d8d95943/12f09/github-repo-access.png 148w,

<blockquote>
<p>TIL: Selecting all the “repo” sub-scopes is not the same as selecting the entire scope — which is needed to use the API token to get the list of all the private repositories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GitHub API pagination has a limit of 200 items per page. I needed to fetch way more than 200 repositories, so I modified <a href="https://gist.github.com/mbohun/b161521b2440b9f08b59" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this cool (but outdated) bash script</a> to fetch all of them in a single command and print them out to the console:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>${<span>#</span>@}</span> -lt <span>2</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"usage: <span>$0</span> [your github credentials as 'user:token'] [REST expression]"</span>
    <span>exit</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>fi</span>

<span>GITHUB_CREDENTIALS</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span>
<span>GITHUB_API_REST</span><span>=</span><span>$2</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> -z <span>"<span>$last_page</span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    
    rest_call <span>"https://api.github.com<span>${GITHUB_API_REST}</span>?per_page=200"</span>
<span>else</span>

    <span>done</span>
<span>fi</span>

<span>cat</span> <span>$TMPFILE</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I named the script <code>githubapi-get.sh</code> and used it this way:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
githubapi-get.sh <span>"{USERNAME}:{TOKEN}"</span> <span>"/orgs/{ORGANIZATION}/repos"</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/my-company-repos.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>FYI, you can also run it this way to get all the repositories you have access to (both on your personal account and on other organization accounts):</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
githubapi-get.sh <span>"{USERNAME}:{TOKEN}"</span> <span>"/user/repos"</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/my-github-repos.txt</code></pre></div>
<h2>Making the repository list compatible with Alfred</h2>
<p>To populate the Alfred list filter, for each repo I extracted the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: Unique identifier for the item which allows Alfred to learn about this item for subsequent sorting and ordering of the user’s actioned results. I used the repository ID (<code>id</code>).</li>
<li><code>arg</code>: The argument which is passed through the workflow to open it in the browser. I used the repository URL (<code>html_url</code>).</li>
<li><code>title</code>: The title displayed in the result row. I used the repository name (<code>name</code>).</li>
<li><code>subtitle</code>: The subtitle displayed in the result row. I used the repository description (<code>description</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the following <code>jq</code> script:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>cat</span> ~/my-company-repos.txt <span>|</span> jq -s <span>'.[] | map({ arg: .html_url, uid: .id, title: .name, subtitle: .description }) | { items: . }'</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/my-company-repos.json</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>jq</code> script generates a <code>~/my-company-repos.json</code> file compatible with the <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/json/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alfred Script Filter JSON format</a>.</p>
<h2>Creating the Alfred workflow</h2>
<p>The Alfred standard script filtering doesn’t have a good fuzzy search option — which I really wanted given the huge amount of repositories.</p>
<p>As a workaround, I used <a href="https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-fuzzy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">alfred-fuzzy</a>, a Python helper script for Alfred that replaces the “Alfred filters results” option with fuzzy search.</p>
<p>Here’s what I did, step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new empty Alfred workflow</li>
<li>Right-click on the created workflow ⭢ “Open in Finder”</li>
<li>In the workflow directory, copy and paste both <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deanishe/alfred-fuzzy/master/fuzzy.py" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fuzzy.py</a> and <code>my-company-repos.json</code>.</li>
<li>In the workflow, create the following “Script Filter”:
<span>

<li>In the workflow, create the following “Open URL” action:

    </span></li>
<li>In the workflow, connect the “Script Filter” to the “Open URL” action:
<span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="workflow 2" title="workflow 2" src="https://mmazzarolo.com/static/ca9a91ea4b4aed993050fc92f0780f4d/fcda8/workflow-2.png" srcset="https://mmazzarolo.com/static/ca9a91ea4b4aed993050fc92f0780f4d/12f09/workflow-2.png 148w,

    </span></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it.
I can now invoke the workflow using the keyword set in the “Script Filter” action and fuzzy search the repo I’m interested in.</p>
<p>Alfred is also smart enough to keep track of my workflow usage, surfacing the most clicked results to the top of the list 💥</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the workflow can be improved in several ways (e.g.: auto-update the repository list after n days)… but I’m happy enough with the current result for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Before</h2><p>It seems so obvious in hindsight. Here in Poland, people have been guessing it ever since the pandemic breakout: in private conversations, in random threads on social media, in comments under governmental information outlets. It seemed a&nbsp;matter of time before someone came up with something like this. In fact, on one Sunday evening in October, I&nbsp;found myself flabbergasted that apparently no one yet has.</p><p>I&nbsp;doled out $4 for a&nbsp;domain, <a href="http://koronalotek.pl/">koronalotek.pl</a> (can be translated as “coronalotto” or “coronalottery” – occurrences of the name on Twitter date back at least as far as April), and fired up a&nbsp;REPL. A&nbsp;few hours and 250 Clojure LOCs later, the site was up.</p><p>I&nbsp;wanted it to&nbsp;be as simple as possible. A&nbsp;form with two fields: “your name” and “how many cases tomorrow?” A&nbsp;top-ten list of today’s winners, sorted by the absolute difference between the guess and the actual number of cases, as <a href="https://twitter.com/mz_gov_pl">reported daily on Twitter</a> by the Polish Ministry of Health. The official number, prominently displayed. And that’s all.</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek.png"></p><p>On 17 October, I&nbsp;posted the link on my Facebook and Twitter feeds, and waited. The stream of guesses started to&nbsp;trickle in.</p><h2>After</h2><p>It never grew to&nbsp;be more than a&nbsp;stream, but it hasn’t gone completely unnoticed either.</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-g1.png"></p><p>The above plot shows daily number of accepted guesses (i.e., those that were used to&nbsp;generate the next day’s winners) over time – a&nbsp;metric of popularity. Each day’s number means guesses cast in the 24 hours up until 10:30 (Warsaw time) on that day, which is when the official numbers are published by the Ministry of Health.</p><p>I’ve been filtering out automated submissions, as well as excess manual submissions by the same IP that seemed to&nbsp;skew the results too much – I’ve arbitrarily set the “excess” threshold at 10. The missing datapoint for 19 October is not a&nbsp;zero, but a&nbsp;N/A: I’ve lost that datapoint due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;glitch. More on this below.</p><p>The interest peaked on October 23, with more than a&nbsp;thousand guesses for that day (I&nbsp;think it was reposted by someone with a&nbsp;significant outreach back then), and has been slowly declining since.</p><p>I&nbsp;have privately received some feedback. One person has pointed out that they found the site distasteful and that making fun of pandemic tragedies made them uncomfortable. (I&nbsp;empathise; for me it’s not so much making fun as it is a&nbsp;coping mechanism—a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;put distance between my thoughts and the difficult times we’re in and to&nbsp;keep fears at bay.) Some people, however, have thanked me for making them smile when they guessed more or less correctly.</p><p>Back to&nbsp;data. Being a&nbsp;data junkie, I&nbsp;looked at what I&nbsp;had been collecting. First things first: how accurate is the collective predictive power of the guessers?</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-g2.png"></p><p>Quite accurate, in fact! Data for this plot has only been slightly preprocessed, by filtering out “unreasonable” guesses that don’t fall within the range <code>[100; 50000]</code>.</p><p>People have over- and underguesstimated the number of new cases, but not by much. There were only a&nbsp;few occasions where the actual case count didn’t fall within one standard deviation of the mean of guesses (represented by the whiskers around blue bars on the plot). Granted, the daily standard deviation tends to&nbsp;be large (on the order of a&nbsp;few thousand), but still, I’m impressed. A&nbsp;paper on estimating the growth of pandemic based on coronalottery results coming soon to&nbsp;a&nbsp;journal near you! ;-)</p><p>Just for the heck of it, I’ve also been looking at individual votes. Specifically, names. Here’s a&nbsp;snapshot of unique guessers’ names sorted by decreasing length, on 23 October. (NSFW warning: expletives ahead!)</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-names.jpg"></p><p>Let me translate a&nbsp;few of these for those of you who don’t speak Polish:</p><p>1 is “Sasin has fucked over 70 million zlotys for elections that didn’t take place and was never held responsible.” This alludes to&nbsp;the <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/05/27/70-million-zloty-bill-for-polands-abandoned-presidential-election/">ghost election in Poland</a> from May. This news had gone memetic, going so far as Minister Sasin’s name being ironically used as a&nbsp;dimensionless unit of 70 million (think Avogadro’s number). You’ll discover the same theme in #2, #3, #5, and others.</p><p>6 is “CT {Constitutional Tribunal}, you focking botch, stop repressing my abortion”. Just a&nbsp;day before, the Polish constitutional court (whose current legality is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Tribunal_(Poland)#2015%E2%80%93present:_Polish_Constitutional_Court_crisis">disputed at best</a>) has <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/10/22/constitutional-court-ruling-ends-almost-all-legal-abortion-in-poland/">decreed a&nbsp;ban on almost all legal abortion</a> in Poland, giving rise to&nbsp;<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/31/europe/poland-abortion-protests-scli-intl/index.html">the biggest street protests in decades</a>.</p><p>Not all is political: 4 is “Why study for the exam if we’re not gonna survive until November anyway?”.

		<h2>Introduction to Makefiles</h2><p>
    I often use Makefiles in some of my projects.<br>
    I really like the flexibility it gives, and I often find myself writing a Makefile instead of a simple shell script to automatize tasks.
</p>
<p>
    So here's a little crash course.<br>
    I'll obviously only cover the basics, but I hope this will give you a good idea on how you could improve your workflows using Makefiles.
</p>
<h3>About Make</h3>
<p>
    Make was developed in 1976 mainly as a build automation tool, to produce executable files or libraries from source code.
</p>
<p>
    While it excels as a build system, it can also be used for a lot of different things.<br>
    If you do write shell scripts to automatize certain tasks, you'll be able to use Makefiles instead.<br>
    As we're going to see, a Makefile can have several advantages over a regular shell script.
</p>
<p>
    This tutorial will only be focused on the GNU version of Make, as it's the most widely used and the most powerful.
</p>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>
    First of all, when you invoke the <code>make</code> command, it will look for a file named <code>Makefile</code> in the current working directory.<br>
    This is the default, but note that a specific Makefile can be used with the <code>-f</code> flag, followed by the file name or path.
</p>
<p>
    If such a file is found, it will by default execute the <code>all</code> target.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Make is target-based system.</strong><br>
    Your Makefile can specify multiple targets, and targets may be executed individually when invoking <code>make</code>. But more on this later.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For now, we'll just start by creating a basic <em>hello world</em> example.</strong>
</p>
<h4>hello, world</h4>
<p>
    In some directory, create a file called <code>Makefile</code> with the following content:
</p>
<pre>all:
    
    echo "hello, world"
</pre>
<p>
    <code>all</code> is the target name. Target definitions are followed by a colon sign.<br>
    As mentioned earlier, <code>make</code> will by default look for a target called <code>all</code>. So this is our main entry point.
</p>
<p>
    Inside the target, you'll simply execute shell commands.  
    Here, we print the <em>hello, world</em> string, using the shell's builtin <code>echo</code> command.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note that target commands need to be indented with at least a single tab.</strong><br>
    <strong>While spaces can be used elsewhere for indentation, tabulation is mandatory inside a target.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Now from a command prompt, <code>cd</code> to that directory and type <code>make</code>.
</p>
<p>
    <code>make</code> will read the <code>Makefile</code>, and execute the <code>all</code> target, giving the following output:
</p>
<pre>echo "hello, world"
hello, world
</pre>
<p>    
    As you can see, <code>make</code> will first print the full command, before printing any output.<br>
    This can be disabled by using an <code>@</code> sign before the command:
</p>
<pre>all:
    
    @echo "hello, world"
</pre>
<p>
    Now the output is simply:
</p>
<pre>hello, world
</pre>
<h4>Additional targets</h4>
<p>
    You can define as many targets as you want.<br>
    For instance:
</p>
<pre>all:
    
    @echo "hello, world"

foo:
    
    @echo "hello, foo"

bar:
    
    @echo "hello, bar"
</pre>
<p>
    While invoking <code>make</code> will still only execute the <code>all</code> target, the <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code> targets can be executed individually by specifying their names:
</p>
<pre>$ make
hello, world

$ make foo
hello, foo

$ make bar
hello, bar
</pre>
<h4>Target dependencies</h4>
<p>
    A target may depend on another target, or on multiple other targets.<br>
    This is called a <strong>prerequisite</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Prerequisites follows the target name:
</p>
<pre>foo: bar
    
    @echo "hello, foo"
</pre>
<p>
    Here, the <code>foo</code> target depends on <code>bar</code>. This means that when <code>foo</code> is about to be executed, <code>bar</code> will be executed first.
</p>
<p>
    Multiple prerequisites are simply separated by a space:
</p>
<pre>foo: bar all
    
    @echo "hello, foo"
</pre>
<p>
    Here, upon executing <code>foo</code>, <code>make</code> will start by executing <code>bar</code>, then <code>all</code>, and finally <code>foo</code>.
</p>
<p>
    And obviously, chaining works too:
</p>
<pre>all: foo
    
    @echo "hello, world"

foo: bar
    
    @echo "hello, foo"

bar:
    
    @echo "hello, bar"
</pre>
<p>
    <code>all</code> depends on <code>foo</code>, which depends on <code>bar</code>. So when invoking <code>make</code>, you'll get the following output:
</p>
<pre>hello, bar
hello, foo
hello, world
</pre>
<p>    
    And you can also manually execute <code>foo</code> by typing <code>make foo</code>, which will give:
</p>
<pre>hello, bar
hello, foo
</pre>
<h4>Error handling</h4>
<p>
    <strong>A very nice thing about <code>make</code> is that it does error handling for you.</strong><br>
    If a command returns a <strong>non-zero</strong> exit status, <code>make</code> will report the error and <strong>abort execution</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    This means that if a command fails inside some target (which may be a prerequisite of another target), the whole execution will stop.<br>
    So you don't have to do any manual error checking, as you would/should do with a shell script.
</p>
<p>
    For instance:
</p>
<pre>all: foo
    
    @echo "hello, world"

foo: bar
    
    @echo "hello, foo"

bar:
    
    @echo "Executing false"
    @false
    @echo "hello, bar"
</pre>
<p>
    Note that in the <code>bar</code> target, we execute the shell's <code>false</code> command, which always returns a non-zero exit status.<br>
    Now if we invoke <code>main</code>, we'll get the following output:
</p>
<pre>Executing false
make: *** [bar] Error 1
</pre>
<p>
    <code>make</code> will execute <code>all</code>, which needs to execute <code>foo</code>, which needs to execute <code>bar</code>.  
    <code>bar</code> will print the first message, and then execute the <code>false</code> command.
</p>
<p>
    As it returns a non-zero exit status, this is detected as an error, and execution is stopped.<br>
    The remaining message in <code>bar</code> will not be printed, and the <code>foo</code> and <code>all</code> targets won't be executed.
</p>
<h4>Debugging</h4>
<p>
    Also note that you can obtain detailed informations about how <code>make</code> reads your Makefile using the <code>--debug</code> flag.<br>
    With the previous example:
</p>
<pre>$ make --debug
Reading makefiles...
Updating goal targets....
    File `all' does not exist.
        File `foo' does not exist.
            File `bar' does not exist.
        Must remake target `bar'.
Executing false
make: *** [bar] Error 1
</pre>
<h4>Variables</h4>
<p>
    You can also define variables inside your Makefile.<br>
    Variables are defined outside targets, and can be referred to with a <code>$</code> sign and parenthesis:
</p>
<pre>HELLO := hello, world

all:

    @echo "$(HELLO)"
</pre>
<p>
    Variables may also be overridden when invoking <code>make</code>, giving extra flexibility.<br>
    For instance, with the example above:
</p>
<pre>$ make HELLO="This is a test"
This is a test
</pre>
<p>
    We'll cover more about variables later.
</p>
<h3>Real life example - Build system</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Now that we have covered the basics, let's take a more useful example.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We'll create a simple build system for the C programming language.<br>
    The goal is to compile C source files, and to produce an executable.
</p>
<p>
    We'll start by a very simple build system, and work on it step by step to achieve a more generic one.
</p>
<h4>Project structure</h4>
<p>
    Here's the basic project structure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>build</code> (directory)</li>
    <li><code>Makefile</code></li>
    <li>
        <code>source</code> (directory)
        <ul>
            <li><code>main.c</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    We have a <code>build</code> directory for the final executable and temporary files, the Makefile, and a <code>source</code> directory with a single <code>main.c</code> file.
</p>
<p>
The <code>main.c</code> file is a basic <em>hello world</em> program:
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main( void )
{
    printf( "hello, world\n" );
    
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<h4>Producing a simple executable</h4>
<p>
    We'll start with a very simple <code>Makefile</code> that invokes the <code>clang</code> C compiler.<br>
    You can obviously replace it with <code>gcc</code> if you want:
</p>
<pre>all:
    
    @clang -Wall -Werror source/main.c -o build/main
</pre>
<p>
    When invoking <code>make</code>, it will compile the <code>source/main.c</code> and produce an executable in <code>build/main</code>.<br>
    Dead simple.
</p>
<h4>Compiling multiple files</h4>
<p>
    Now let's say we want to compile multiple C files to produce the executable.
</p>
<p>
    We'll first create a function named <code>hello</code> in the <code>source/hello.c</code> file:
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "hello.h"

void hello( void )
{
    printf( "hello, world\n" );
}
</pre>
<p>
    And we'll also add the corresponding header in <code>source/hello.h</code> with the function prototype:
</p>
<pre>#ifndef HELLO_H
#define HELLO_H

void hello( void );

#endif
</pre>
<p>
    Our <code>main.c</code> file will then call the <code>hello</code> function:
</p>
<pre>#include "hello.h"

int main( void )
{
    hello();
    
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
    Now the <code>Makefile</code> could simply be:
</p>
<pre>all:

    @clang -Wall -Werror source/hello.c source/main.c -o build/main
</pre>
<p>
    However, this is not really flexible, and this is usually not how individual files are compiled.<br>
    Instead, we'll produce an <strong>object file</strong> for each C source file, and <strong>link them together</strong> to produce the final executable:
</p>
<pre>all:

    @clang -Wall -Werror -c source/hello.c -o build/hello.o
    @clang -Wall -Werror -c source/main.c -o build/main.o
    @clang -Wall -Werror build/hello.o build/main.o -o build/main
</pre>
<p>
    Note the additional <code>-c</code> flag, needed to tell the compiler to produce an unlinked object file, instead of an executable.
</p>
<p>
    But we obviously want the compilation to happen in separate targets, so we'll create a specific target for each C source file.<br>
    The <code>all</code> target will depend on these, and be responsible for linking the executable:
</p>
<pre>all: main hello
    
    @clang -Wall -Werror build/hello.o build/main.o -o build/main
    
main:
    
    @clang -Wall -Werror -c source/main.c -o build/main.o
    
hello:
    
    @clang -Wall -Werror -c source/hello.c -o build/hello.o
</pre>
<p>
    Also notice that the compiler flags (<code>-Wall -Werror</code>) are now repeated in each target.<br>
    Time to create a variable:
</p>
<pre>CFLAGS := -Wall -Werror

all: main hello
    
    @clang $(CFLAGS) build/hello.o build/main.o -o build/main
    
main:
    
    @clang $(CFLAGS) -c source/main.c -o build/main.o
    
hello:
    
    @clang $(CFLAGS) -c source/hello.c -o build/hello.o
</pre>
<p>
    This is obviously better, and it also mean we can now override the compiler flags when invoking <code>make</code>:
</p>
<pre>$ make CFLAGS=-Weverything
</pre>
<p>
    It might also be a good idea to create a variable for the compiler itself:
</p>
<pre>CC     := clang
CFLAGS := -Wall -Werror

all: main hello
    
    @$(CC) $(CFLAGS) build/hello.o build/main.o -o build/main
    
main:
    
    @$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c source/main.c -o build/main.o
    
hello:
    
    @$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c source/hello.c -o build/hello.o
</pre>
<p>
    So if you want to use <code>gcc</code> instead of <code>clang</code>, you can simply use:
</p>
<pre>$ make CC=gcc
</pre>
<p>
    And we should also add some output:
</p>
<pre>    
CC     := clang
CFLAGS := -Wall -Werror

all: main hello
    
    @echo "Linking executable"
    @$(CC) $(CFLAGS) build/hello.o build/main.o -o build/main
    
main:
    
    @echo "Compiling main.c"
    @$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c source/main.c …</pre></div></div>

November 8, 2020 | https://denvaar.github.io/articles/problem_solving_example.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://denvaar.github.io/articles/problem_solving_example.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>âœ�ï¸� Going meta - Working through a programming problem to understand problem solving techniques.</p><div>
        <p>The technical skills of computer programming fall under two broad categories, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The first category includes things like learning language syntax, constructs, and patterns. I would summarize it as the ability to connect and utilize the myriad, "tools of the trade" -- languages, frameworks, APIs, libraries -- to create software. There's usually tutorials for these things.</p>
<p>The second category includes things that are a little bit harder to put your finger on, but can probably be best described as problem solving. It's the ability to analyze, troubleshoot, debug, or solve a problem. It's the ability to reason with abstract ideas and turn them into code.</p>
<p>There is for sure some overlap between these two categories, but this is how I like to think about it.</p>
<p>It's hard to be specific about what it takes to be good at problem solving. I believe that's because we all have a slightly different perception of the world around us. Everyone learns differently. There must, however, be at least some techniques that I might learn from you, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Problems like the one I am about to share can be great tools for learning about problem solving. This one's from Project Euler. My intention is not to simply spoil the answer. I want to share my process of figuring it out, with the hope of being able to pinpoint some specific strategies that can be used to solve all kinds of problems.</p>
<h2 id="thechallenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>You can find the original problem statement <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=79">here</a>. It's short, so take a moment to read through.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The challenge is to determine what the shortest possible secret number is. Here's an excerpt from the keylogger file.</p>
<pre><code>...
160
689
716
731
736
...
</code></pre>
<h2 id="firststeps">First steps</h2>
<p>I began by sitting down with pencil and paper to write some numbers from the list. Writing helps me begin to think about the problem.</p>
<p>I thought about what these numbers in the list could tell me about the secret number. Maybe I could find a way to at least figure out its length. There are about fifty numbers in the list, so maybe that number is somehow correlated to the secret number.</p>
<p>These were a few of the questions going through my head. If the answers seem super obvious to you, then congratulations, you might be smarter than me. What's most important during the first steps is that you ask questions.</p>
<p>I realized pretty quickly that no, the length of the list I was given didn't tell me much, but you've got to start somewhere. Next, my thoughts turned to the fact that each number was three digits long.</p>
<p><em>What if I was given a list of two-digit numbers, or even a list of just one-digit numbers? What could that tell me about the length of the secret number? Is there something special about three-digit numbers in particular?</em> These were valuable questions to ask, because it helped me to simplify the problem.</p>
<p>I made a list of one-digit numbers and tried to think about how I might be able to solve the same problem with that instead.</p>
<pre><code>6
2
1
0
</code></pre>
<p>Given a list like this as clues, I could say for certain that the secret number has at least a 6,2,1, and 0, but I also loose essential information about the problem: The order that the numbers appear in. A list of one-digit numbers is too ambiguous. The secret number could be <code>6210</code>, <code>2601</code>, or any other combination, and I would have no way of knowing which one is correct.</p>
<p>A list of two-digit numbers might be nice. It's less to think about, yet is still able to convey the needed information. From this point forward, I decided to think about the list as two-digit numbers, rather than three-digit numbers.</p>
<h2 id="possibleoptionmaintainasortedarray">Possible option: Maintain a sorted array</h2>
<p>At this point, I still wasn't sure how to solve the problem on paper, so I decided to try and work backwards. I wrote down a random number and then picked a few pairs of digits from it to try and reconstruct my own version of the problem. I decided to go through each number in the list and write down the digits as if they were being inserted into some kind of array.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I realized an approach like this would not be very practical because it still leaves room for ambiguity.</p>
<p>In the example above, its clear that 5 is before 2, but if I continue to add the digits from the next number, I can't tell if the 1 should come before or after the 5. It's the same problem for the 8: I know it should come before the 2, but the data says nothing about if it should be before or after the 1, or the 5.</p>
<p>Even if I had another data point to disambiguate the clues -- <code>51</code>, for example -- sure, it would tell me that the 1 is in the correct spot between 5 and 2, but I already get the feeling that trying to write code to account for switching numbers around in an array is not going to be practical, and that there is probably an easier way.</p>
<p>Writing it out this way helped me realize that the help of some sort of data structure would be useful for solving this problem.</p>
<p>So now the question is, <em>what kind of data structure could help model this problem?</em> To help with this decision, I thought about what data is actually provided in the problem. Using the example above, the list of numbers reads as:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 "comes before" 2</li>
<li>1 "comes before" 2</li>
<li>8 "comes before" 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Each number in the list provides helpful clues, but the problem is that it's difficult to keep track of how each clue ultimately fits together. I tried to think of some kind of data structure that would be able to represent each clue individually, but also as a whole.</p>
<p>A directed graph seems to be a pretty natural fit to represent this information. Each node could be a digit, and the edges between nodes could represent the relationship between them.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I felt good about using a graph to solve the problem, but there were still some questions that I had to figure out.</p>
<ul>
<li>How would I know when the graph has enough information to to be able to get the secret number? In other words, how can I know when my answer is conclusive?</li>
<li>How could the graph be read or interpreted programmatically to produce the secret number?</li>
<li>What if a secret number had more than one of the same digit? Would that ruin my approach?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtoknowwhentheanswerisconclusive">How to know when the answer is conclusive</h2>
<p>To help answer this question I used the same technique of creating a simplified version of the problem and working backwards. Pretend now that 157 is the secret number. How many edges between the nodes would it take to definitively say that 1 comes before both 5 and 7, and 5 comes before 7? The answer is three edges for this particular graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example, the order is known when number of edges are equal to the number of nodes. <em>Is it that simple? Can we know what the secret number is if the number of edges are equal to the number of nodes?</em></p>
<p>In this example, yes, but it doesn't hold true for the general case. By creating more examples, I start to find a relationship between the number of nodes, and the number of edges. Have a look at what four and five-digit secret numbers look like as a graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After drawing a few of these, I could begin to see a pattern emerge. As the number of nodes increase, the number of edges increase like, <code>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ..</code>.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to look for patterns, because it means that there's an equation which can be used to represent some aspect of the problem. Here the pattern showed me what condition to use in order to know when my answer could be considered conclusive. This is the equation that represents that pattern, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_6.png"></p>
<h2 id="readingthegraphtofindtheanswer">Reading the graph to find the answer</h2>
<p>A hand-drawn graph helps to visualize the approach of solving this problem, but I knew that I would also need to keep in mind how the graph could be represented with code. Specifically, how to programmatically traverse the graph to produce a result.</p>
<p>After staring at the examples for a bit longer, I realized an obvious and helpful property about the graph.</p>
<p>The nodes with the most outward edges come before those with less outward edges. Additionally, the number of edges for each node differ by exactly one. This means that the first digit of the secret number should have the most outward edges, while the last digit would not have any outward edges.</p>
<p>This property made logical sense to me, and was something that could be easily translated into code.</p>
<h2 id="duplicatedigits">Duplicate digits</h2>
<p>A secret number with more than one of the same digit could cause problems with my approach. This was something that worried me as I was working, because it was not clear how to know which two nodes to put the edge between. For example, take a look at 1030 as the secret number, and imagine the digits given in the following order:</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are multiple ways to draw the graph because there are two 0's. There should still be only one "correct" way. Creating a correct graph might depend on the order in which the digits are given. I might need to think of some way to backtrack and re-connect nodes in order to end up with the correct graph.</p>
<p>The correct and incorrect graphs can be compared to understand how exactly they differ. The incorrect graph has a circular dependency: 3 comes before both the orange and blue 0's, but then the blue 0 comes before 3, which is contradictory.</p>
<p>Another difference is that the correct version is the only one that satisfies the property mentioned above, where the number of each node's edges differ by exactly one. This property should always be true for any secret number modeled with the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At this point, I decided to put the question of duplicate digits on hold. It looked like this would break the approach that I had planned to use. I think its possible to figure out, but it was unclear if this use case needed to be supported at all.</p>
<p>My plan was now to turn my ideas into code to see if it would produce the correct answer.</p>
<h2 id="translateideastocode">Translate ideas to code</h2>
<p>This part went by pretty quickly because I had formed a good understanding of the problem, as well as an approach for how to solve it. I picked Python for no particular reason, …</p></div></div>

				<p><strong><span size="6" color="#5040ae"><em>W</em></span></strong>e previously covered average lifetime value by looking at actual past purchase lifetimes.&nbsp; There is however an alternative formulation that is widely used that doesn't look necessarily at averaging each individual lifetime value, but instead just uses the averages in customer behavior.&nbsp; Let us elaborate with each formula.<br></p>  <h2><span size="4">The Average Order Size</span><br></h2>  <p>The Average Order size is given by&nbsp; AO = Total Revenue / Number of Orders. This treats all orders from everyone the same, as if they came from each individual equally.<br></p>  <h2><span size="4">The Average Frequency Of Orders</span></h2>  <p>The Average Frequency of Orders is given by AF = Number of Customers / Number of Purchases.&nbsp; This doesn't measure true frequency because you don't know the actual time between purchases.<br></p>  <h2><span size="4">The Average Lifetime</span></h2>  <p>The Average Lifetime is given by AL = sum of Customer Lifetimes / Number of Customers.&nbsp; However, because you can't necessarily wait 20 years to see the total customer lifetimes, it is sometimes suggested to use 1 / churn rate percentage to estimate this value.<br></p>  <h2><span size="4">The Average Customer Lifetime Value</span></h2>  <p>The Average Customer Lifetime Value is then given by AvgCLV = AO*AF*AL.&nbsp; It is just the previous formulas multiplied with each other to get the "average" in lifetime value.<br></p>  <h2><span size="4">Correlated Values and Problems with using the "<em>Average</em>"</span><br></h2>  <p>The above formula, while simple, has a few glaring flaws that are not fixable.&nbsp; Customers don't behave like the average, and the "average" lifetime value will be terribly misleading.&nbsp; When you multiple the averages together, you assume that each factor AO, AF,&nbsp; and AL are statistically independent.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are not.&nbsp; When the customer is a high lifetime value customer, the Average Order sizes are larger, the Average Frequency is greater, and the Average Lifetime is greater, for example.&nbsp; When the customer is a low lifetime value customer, the Average Order sizes are smaller, the Average Frequency is less, and the Average Lifetime is shorter, for example.<br></p>  <p>Let's work through an example where we can see the effect of correlation on the "average" lifetime value.&nbsp; For simplicity, assume the correlation is perfect, which won't be too far from the actual case.&nbsp; These numbers come from a Starbucks case study.&nbsp; For Starbucks, the average frequency is AF = 4.2 visits per week.&nbsp; The average order size is AO = $4.05 per visit.&nbsp; The estimated lifetime is 20 years, so AL = 52 weeks * 20 years.&nbsp; This gives the Average Customer Lifetime Value as<br></p>  <p>AvgCLV = $4.05*4.2*52*20 = $17,690.40<br></p>  <p>We can look at the correlation effect as equivalent to adding an extra term inside the formula for Average Customer Lifetime Value</p>  <p>AvgCLV = (AO+x)(AF+x)(AL+x)</p>  <p>When a customer is high lifetime value customer, x is added to all the base values.&nbsp; When a customer is a low lifetime value customer, you can think of subtracting x from all the base values.&nbsp; Now let us look at what happens to the Starbucks customer when they are a high value lifetime customer by assuming it raises all the values by 20%.<br></p>  <p>HighAvgCLV = ($4.05*1.2)*(4.2*1.2)*(52*20*1.2) = $ 30,569.01<br></p>  <p>This value is almost twice the baseline. And let's look similarly at what happens when the Starbucks customer is a low value lifetime customer by lowering all the values by 20%.<br></p>  <p>LowAvgCLV = ($4.05*0.8)*(4.2*0.8)*(52*20*0.8) = $9,057.48<br></p>  <p>This value is almost half the baseline value.&nbsp; High and Low value customers might not be a problem with there were an equal number of both types, but if you recall the L-Shaped distribution from the previous post on "Why The Average Customer Lifetime Value is Not Enough", the majority of customers come from the low value of the distribution with a long tail, since roughly 80% of revenue is generated by only 20% of the customers.<br></p>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.revenueforesight.com/uploads/1/3/4/4/134486339/clv-presentation-4-001_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>The real-world effect of correlation on the terms in the "average" lifetime value AvgCLV = AO*AF*AL, is to make the calculation highly biased and misleading by making the L-shaped distribution have greater extremes in the tails and making it more L-shaped.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the true lifetime value of customers affects the profitability of your business, you cannot depend on the "average" formulas. Given that there is a cost to acquiring customers (through ads and incentives), then knowing the true lifetime values is a key piece of information that you need for your business.<br></p>  <p>We can help you with discovering what the true lifetime value is of each and every customer in your business, because we have AI software that forecasts what each individual customer's lifetime value will be, and what their stream of future purchase values will be, with high accuracy, early in their life.&nbsp; Contact us for a demo.<br></p>

    <div>
        <div>
            <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an important piece of the cloud puzzle and it’s usually a source of headaches from a security point of view. Let’s try to give some pointers from a blue team perspective.</p>

<p>If you are a security team that just inherited a bunch of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) accounts, this guide is for you.</p>

<h2 id="identities-and-roles">Identities and Roles</h2>

<p>IAM revolves around the concept of <strong>identity</strong>: an (authenticated) entity to which authorization grants are applied.</p>

<h3 id="members">Members</h3>

<p>In Google Cloud, identities are called <strong>members</strong> and are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>User</strong>: defined by a Google Account</li>
<li>A <strong>Group</strong>: defined by a Google Group</li>
<li>A <strong>domain</strong>: a super group representing all accounts under a gsuite/workspace domain</li>
<li>A <strong>Service Account</strong>: an account for an application rather than an end user</li>
</ul>

<p>To make things spicier, there are also two special members that you are going to hate and you want to make sure they will <em>never be used</em> (unless valid business reasons):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>allAuthenticatedUsers</strong>: a special group comprised of everyone on earth with a google account (yes)</li>
<li><strong>allUser</strong>: anyone on the internet, authenticated or not</li>
</ul>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>scan your IAM policies and make sure that <code>allAuthenticatedUsers</code> and <code>allUsers</code> are never used</li>
<li>or even better, set up an organizational policy to only allow members from your gsuite/workspace domain</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>

<p>You assign (bind) a Role to a Member to grant that identity access to a resource. An example role is  <code>resourcemanager.projectCreator</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcloud iam roles list
…
---
description: Access to create new GCP projects.
etag: AA==
name: roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
stage: GA
title: Project Creator
---
…
</code></pre>

<p>Roles are a set of <em>permissions</em> grouped together, each one representing a fine grained operation. You can’t assign permissions directly to members.</p>

<p>An example permission would be <code>resource manager.projects.create</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcloud iam roles describe roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
description: Access to create new GCP projects.
etag: AA==
includedPermissions:
- resourcemanager.organizations.get
- resourcemanager.projects.create
name: roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
stage: GA
title: Project Creator
</code></pre>

<p>Usually, every cloud service will come with a dedicated set of Roles (<a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/stricter-access-control-to-gcr/">not for Google Container Registry</a>).</p>

<h3 id="custom-roles">Custom Roles</h3>

<p>As a rule of thumb <strong>stick to standard roles</strong>, but if you have to bind a role to a member in a high level policy you might want to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles">use a custom role</a>. Custom Roles allows you to group together the specific set of permissions you need.</p>

<p>They are helpful to maintain least privilege because a role bind on a high level policy (like the Organization one) will affect way more resources.</p>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use standard roles when the number of affected resources is limited</li>
<li>Use custom roles when the authorization grant affect too many resources</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="primitive-roles">Primitive Roles</h3>

<p>There are a bunch of roles you should be wary of: <em>primitive roles</em>. These are <code>Owner</code>, <code>Editor</code> and <code>Viewer</code>. When they are bind on the Project IAM policy they translate to admin, write and read access to everything inside that project.</p>

<p>You want to be wary for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The set of permissions change over time: when Google release new cloud services, permissions for such services are included in the primitive roles. This means <strong>you have an authorization grant that change over time and you have no control over</strong>. No bueno.</li>
<li><strong>They are a bridge to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists">Access Control List</a></strong> (ACL). ACL are the legacy authorization system for some storage services such as Buckets and Bigquery. In such resources you can assign ACL grants to whoever is bind to a primitive role in the Project. This relationship <strong>adds complexity when trying to understand the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">blast radius</a></strong> of a member.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can’t escape using a primitive role, bind them to members that you will use only in “break the glass” scenarios. In practice, you don’t want a team doing their day to day operations as <code>Owners</code>.</p>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid primitive roles</li>
<li>Do not use Access Control Lists (ACL)</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2 id="iam-policies-and-where-to-find-them">IAM Policies (and where to find them)</h2>

<p>Roles are bind to members in an IAM Policy. Policies are organized in hierarchical layers (from top to bottom):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Organization</strong></li>
<li><strong>Folder</strong></li>
<li><strong>Project</strong></li>
<li>Specific Resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bindings will be inherited from top to bottom.</p>

<p>So if you assign <code>Storage Admin</code> to a service account in the Organization IAM Policy, the same grant will be applied to everything down (don’t do that).</p>

<p>You obviously want to be extra careful when binding roles high in the hierarchy as the authorization grant will be quite large. That’s why it’s a good idea to use custom roles to shrink it to just the permissions you need.</p>

<p>Some specific cloud resources, such as Buckets, have their own IAM policy. These are easy to overlook because they don’t have a consistent place in the google cloud admin interface.</p>

<p>The best way to <strong>get visibility over all IAM policies</strong> is to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/">create a Cloud Asset Inventory (CAI) dump</a>. CAI is, in my opinion, <strong>the most useful thing in GCP</strong>. It’s an API that will generate a json (or bigquery) dump of all the resources and IAM Policies you are currently running.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do on day one is to set up periodical CAI dumps, and then build your detections on top of them.</p>

<h3 id="maintain-the-principle-of-least-privilege">Maintain the principle of least privilege</h3>

<p>The second best thing is to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/recommender-overview">use the IAM Recommender</a>: a service that monitors how role bindings are actually used to make sure you are not over granting them.</p>

<p>Another helpful trick to know is that you can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview">attach conditions to role bindings</a>. For example you can set an expiration time, or you can scope down the binding to affect only certain resources matching a pattern.</p>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>The higher in the IAM hierarchy, the wider the scope of the authorization grant: use sporadically, be a gatekeeper.</li>
<li>Set up Cloud Asset Inventory to not miss anything</li>
<li>Use the IAM Recommender</li>
<li>Use IAM Conditions</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2 id="notes-on-service-accounts">Notes on Service Accounts</h2>

<p>Service accounts can be of two types: google managed and user managed.</p>

<p>A user managed service account is one you manually create. To use it, you need to create a private key and embed it into your application. A service account can have multiple keys.</p>

<p><strong>Service Account keys lifecycle is your responsibility</strong>: they never really expires, are hard to audit (you don’t see which key has been used from the audit logs). From day one you should start thinking how to keep track of them.</p>

<p>Personally I am a fan of wrapping keys creation into an internal service for your developers to use, but I understand it’s not always possible.</p>

<p>The best alternative is to <strong>use google managed service accounts</strong>. For example each project will come with a default service account that is used by Google Compute Engine (GCE) services (if the GCE API is enabled).</p>

<p>This means that virtual machines will transparently be identified by that service account, and they are authorized to request short-lived authorization tokens from the internal metadata service. You can configure them to use a service account of your choice and <strong>no keys are involved</strong>.</p>


<div><p>
Pro tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Become a gatekeeper for provisioning Service Accounts keys</li>
<li>Use the identity of the virtual machines whenever possible</li>
<li>Are you running Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)? Take a look at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a></li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/google-cloud-service-accounts-security-best-practices/">service accounts best practices</a></li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>To recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>scan your IAM policies and make sure that <code>allAuthenticatedUsers</code> and <code>allUsers</code> are never used</li>
<li>or even better, set up an organizational policy to only allow members from your gsuite/workspace domain</li>
<li>Use standard roles when the number of affected resources is limited</li>
<li>Use custom roles when the authorization grant affect too many resources</li>
<li>Avoid primitive roles</li>
<li>Do not use Access Control Lists (ACL)</li>
<li>The higher in the IAM hierarchy, the wider the scope of the authorization grant: use sporadically, be a gatekeeper.</li>
<li>Set up Cloud Asset Inventory to not miss anything</li>
<li>Adhere to the least privilege principle with the IAM Recommender and IAM Conditions</li>
<li>Become a gatekeeper for provisioning Service Accounts keys</li>
<li>Use the identity of the virtual machines whenever possible</li>
<li>Are you running Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)? Take a look at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a></li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/google-cloud-service-accounts-security-best-practices/">service accounts best practices</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot more to say about IAM governance and security best practices. This article’s purpose is to give a high level overview of the main security considerations.</p>

<h3>Nov 8 2020</h3>


<p>Since I was 7 years old, I have wanted a LEGO Mindstorms robot. I will admit that in the later years it was mainly that I wanted to prove to myself that I got somewhere as it seemed so infinitely expensive back when I was younger…</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bitcynth/status/1319956429252513792" title="Tweet about it"><img src="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/g1ZkG7sMAD" alt="LEGO Robot Inventor"></a></p>

<p>Well I finally got one!</p>

<p>I knew this thing had some capability to run <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> since that was mentioned in the product description quite predominantly, which sounded like a pretty hackable platform.</p>

<p>However, shortly after opening the box, I realized that this wasn’t at all just an update to the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-mindstorms-ev3-31313">Mindstorms EV3</a>. Apparently the Robot Inventor was a slightly more expensive thing with less features and using a LiPo battery instead of AA cells.</p>

<p>Luckily I ordered it via the store’s website which means that by law I can return it within 14 days for any reason, and it allows me to open the box for inspection.</p>

<p>So after convincing some stubborn store employee that this is not a consumable product (which would remove my right to open the box), I got it returned and ordered the EV3.</p>

<p>Then two days later I finally had the thing which I have wanted for so long.</p>

<p>While I was waiting for the EV3, I was looking around at how it did MicroPython as it had this paragraph on the downloads page.</p>

<pre><code>You can now use your EV3 Brick to unleash the power of Python programming using MicroPython. Simply install the EV3 MicroPython image onto any micro SD card and boot up your EV3 Brick from it to start programming straight away. 
</code></pre>

<p>After just a few minutes of searching I found <a href="https://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a> which is an open source community project that allows you to run Debian on it!</p>

<p>It appears to be really well made and apparently good enough for LEGO to provide <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3">official builds</a> of it, which is what they use for MicroPython support.</p>

<p>So I just went ahead and downloaded and flashed the disk image to a microSD card with <code>dd</code>.
I then plugged in the microSD card into the EV3 controller and turned it on…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/rC3JqPiBNA" alt="EV3 kernel dmesg"></p>

<p>To my surprise, after applying power I was pleased to see kernel dmesg output scrolling out on the LCD of the EV3 on the first try!</p>

<pre><code>robot@ev3dev:~$ uname -a
Linux ev3dev 4.14.117-ev3dev-2.3.5-ev3 #1 PREEMPT Sat Mar 7 12:54:39 CST 2020 armv5tejl GNU/Linux

robot@ev3dev:~$ cat /etc/os-release 
PRETTY_NAME="ev3dev-stretch"
NAME="ev3dev-stretch"
ID=ev3dev
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="http://www.ev3dev.org"
SUPPORT_URL="http://www.ev3dev.org/support"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues"
</code></pre>

<p>After playing around with it for about two minutes, I realized something… this thing runs Debian with a pretty damn complete package repository (it has ~64000 packages and normal amd64 Debian has ~66000 packages), can this thing run BIRD?</p>

<p>I assumed that if the ARM926EJ-S CPU can run Debian and stuff it can probably run a very minimal BIRD config, however I wasn’t so sure about the 56MB of RAM.</p>

<p>But well you won’t know if you don’t try :p</p>

<p>So I just went ahead and typed <code>sudo apt install bird</code> and pressed enter…</p>

<pre><code>robot@ev3dev:~$ sudo apt install bird
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Suggested packages:
  bird-doc
</code></pre>

<p>(this was actually painfully slow as this thing doesn’t have a powerful CPU in the slightest)</p>

<p>As soon as I saw <code>bird-doc</code> I realized that yes it did at least have BIRD in the repo so that was a good first step.</p>

<p>I am only installing BIRD 1.6.3 here as it will probably use less resources than BIRD 2 if I only run the IPv6 daemon and disable the IPv4 daemon.</p>

<p>I then wrote a <a href="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/gv3GvwzBGH">quick little bird config</a> to let the EV3 (AS202314) announce 2a0d:1a45:666::/48 to my home router (AS210089), and the home router will then deal with the rest.</p>

<p>I applied that and wrote the other end of the config on my home router and applied that too.</p>

<p>Then I went to the <a href="http://lg.ring.nlnog.net/">NLNOG RING Looking Glass</a> and I saw the /48 show up as announced by AS202314!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/KVCU9bynjB" alt="NLNOG RING Looking Glass"></p>

<p>I then sent it to a friend who pointed out only about half of his sources could see the route, and well turns out I forgot to give AS202314 an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure">RPKI ROA</a> for the prefix, so I added that.</p>

<p>Then just for demo purposes I installed nginx which worked surprisingly well, so then I had a website I could access at http://[2a0d:1a45:666::]/ <sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This was surprisingly easy to get working. Hats off to the <a href="https://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a> people for making this Debian derivative for the EV3.</p>

<p>While having the EV3 sitting there announcing a /48 of IPv6 is not useful in itself, this shows off how flexible the platform is. The fact that I can do this silly thing means that I can do much cooler things that don’t involve BGP on this, like running web servers and other things.</p>

<p>If this was to your liking then maybe you will find my other posts interesting, and you can also find my smaller projects and ramblings on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcynth">@bitcynth</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/Benjojo12">Ben Cox</a> and <a href="https://www.mollymiller.net/">Molly Miller</a> for the help in editing this blog post.</p>

<h2>Log Collection</h2>



<p>It contains a basic log, time, source system and a message. For example, when we look at the content of the “/var/log/auth.log” file on an Ubuntu server, we can see the source, time and message information.</p>



<figure><img src="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log.png" alt="" srcset="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log.png 685w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log-300x22.png 300w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log-330x24.png 330w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px"></figure>



<p>Logs are generally collected in the following 2 ways:</p>



<ul><li>Log Agents</li><li>Agentless</li></ul>



<p>We created online lab for investigation SIEM alerts. If you are interested, you can try for free on <a href="https://letsdefend.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">letsdefend.io</a></p>



<h3>Log Agents</h3>



<p>In order to implement this method, a log agent software is required. Agents often have parsing, log rotation, buffering, log integrity, encryption, conversion features. In other words, this agent software can take action on the logs it collects before forwarding them to the target.</p>



<p>For example, with the agent software, we can divide a log with “username: LetsDefend; account: Administrator” into 2 parts and forward it as:</p>



<ul><li>message1 = “username: LetsDefend”&nbsp;</li><li>message2 = “account: Administrator”</li></ul>



<p><strong>Syslog</strong></p>



<p>It is a very popular network protocol for log transfers. It can work with both UDP and TCP, and can optionally be encrypted with TLS. Some devices that support syslog: Switch, Router, IDS, Firewall, Linux, Mac, Windows devices can become syslog supported with additional software.</p>



<p>If you want to forward your log with Syslog, you will need to parsing in syslog format.</p>



<p>Syslog Format:</p>



<p>Timestamp – Source Device – Facility – Severity – Message Number – Message Text</p>



<figure><img src="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/09fig02.gif" alt=""><figcaption><em>https://flylib.com/books/1/297/1/html/2/images/1587051583/graphics/09fig02.gif</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Also, the maximum packet size that can be sent with Syslog UDP is 1024 bytes. For TCP it is 4096 bytes.</p>



<p><strong>3. Party Agents</strong></p>



<p>Most SIEM products have their own agent software. 3rd party agents have more capabilities than syslog because of the features they support. Some agents:</p>



<p><strong>Splunk: </strong>universal forwarder</p>



<p><strong>ArcSight</strong>: ArcSight Connectors</p>



<p>These agents are easy to integrate into SIEM and have parsing features.</p>



<p><strong>Open Source Agents</strong></p>



<p>They are generally agents that provide basic needs comfortably. However, it may not be as effective as the agent of the SIEM product itself. (Ease of installation, integration, additional features etc.)</p>



<p>Popular open source agents:</p>



<ul><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beats </a></li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://nxlog.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NXLog </a></li></ul>



<h3>Agentless</h3>



<p>Agentless log sending process is sometimes preferred as there is no installation and update cost. Usually, logs are sent by connecting to the target with SSH or WMI.</p>



<p>For this method, the username and password of the log server are required, therefore there is a risk of the password being stolen.</p>



<p>Easier to prepare and manage than the agent method. However, it has limited capabilities and credentials are wrapped in the network.</p>



<h3>Manual Collection</h3>



<p>Sometimes there are logs that you cannot collect with existing agent software. For example, if you cannot read the logs of a cloud-based application with the agent, you may need to write your own script</p>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<p>As you can see, there are various ways to collect logs. These are agents and agentless. In cases where the agents on the market are not sufficient, you should write your own scripts.</p>

I was brought up with the mindset that if something is doable, it cannot be hard. A mindset which compels you to find harder and harder challenges.</p><p>That all changed when Flex, the Techstars company I co-founded didn’t work out. It broke me.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>What surprised me was that the network, “give first” and all of the opportunity that comes with it is great when you’re on the up but awkward, uncomfortable and at times “crickets” on the down.</p><p>Part of this I now realise is because when you’re in failure mode, you’re insufferable to everyone around you.</p><p>You carry this huge weight on your shoulders that you put on others every time you meet like a wounded animal, limping around looking to be put down.</p><p>I’m not sure if everyone has gone through this, but for me I suffered through thoughts like:<br>Will I be ever successful?<br>Will I ever be happy?<br>Will I ever have another good idea?<br>Was my idea good?<br>Can I have good Ideas?<br>Can I be good at anything?</p><p>I came to learn these can be called cognitive distortions, and the best way to stop them is to write them down and use reason and logic to disprove them.</p><p>Everyone just tells you its okay, put in their perspective, you’ll work it out - This whole experience was incredibly frustrating, how could a non founder possibly relate to the level of aspiration I had taken away from me. What is a well meaning attempt at helping often comes across as people shrugging you off.</p><p>There was a limit to what my coach could do because I convinced myself he hadn’t experienced it. How could he possibly understand what was left behind after this huge emotional debt bubble deflated.</p><p>I sought out others who’s companies had died, or who had been ousted from their own boards but it was hard to match with other failures because it was either a sufferfest of two people feeling sorry for themselves or one of you values success more than the other and you judge the others’ failure.</p><p>I didn't grieve, I tried to re-inflate the bubble inside me.</p><p>I didn’t get angry, I just wanted to get better, I just wanted to feel better without putting in the work.</p><p>I turned to reading, thinking that with over a century of modern business practices surely titans have recovered from this. Reading a gazillion business biographies, literature I now know to pop science schlop, did not help. In fact it made it worse.&nbsp;</p><p>I remember reading Lean In and it slid me into depression. How did Sheryl Sandberg career magically line up at the end? Was I on the right track? How do I get on track? Where is the track? What is the track?</p><p>I would openly talk about imposter syndrome to explain why I approached work and decisions the way I did, and came to learn that:</p><ul><li>Outside of tech many people have never heard of the concept<br></li><li>People who had, did not understand it<br></li><li>Many people thought imposter syndrome was in fact the Dunning Kruger effect and thus I was admitting to them I was a fraud.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For me, the voices in my head eventually did die off. Normalcy came about a year later when I realised I was talking about and writing about my experiences from a perspective of wisdom rather than re-hashing scar tissue.</p><p>Serendipitously after this point, I was gifted the book - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-Smart-People-Fail-Rebuilding/dp/0140178112" target="_blank">When Smart People Fail </a>by another Techstars founder whose grandmother had gifted her the book after she had experienced a set back. A set back which ultimately led to the founding of her Techstars company.</p><p>Where was this book when I failed? While a subjectively unnecessary read, I read it anyway. In my personal opinion, it was probably the best thing I’ve ever read on dealing with personal failure.</p><p>I think it would have saved me months of anguish had I read it earlier, and while I truly love helping entrepreneurs and makers - my goto advice now, when someone has experienced failure and is looking for guidance is - read this book.</p><p>I think Techstars should gift this to every founder that fails, whether they leave their company, are forced out or go insolvent.</p><p>Between stories of failure, to understanding the core stages of grief that one must go through - there is something in the book for everyone.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Key things the book taught me:</p><ul><li>Failure is subjective to the victim</li><li>Failure has stages of grief that you must go through - if you skip any, you will experience prolonged pain. I can first hand attest to this.</li><li>If we treat success as a binary outcome, everything we sacrifice in the pursuit of success is meaningless when we fail.</li></ul><p>The third point is something I embraced over the year that followed. Clearly others think I have experience/advice/wisdom/ideas to share so there is value there and it made it all much less painful. If success is binary, those of us who don’t make it, lose many years of our lives for nothing.</p><p>This is a stance I fully reject and I thank Jen and the book for really teaching me this.</p><p>In full realisation of this final point - <a href="https://www.mquinn.online/failures.html">I’m committing to my failures in public.</a> We’ll see how long I can keep it up for, but for every project that didn’t hit the goal, the ideas that crash landed and the products that went unloved I’m keeping a record because these failures are not a waste of life, they are the stepping stones that when looking back in 20 years will all make sense.</p><p>Show me someone without failure and I’ll show you someone without learning.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Thanks to everyone that listened to me moan for a year about my failures.</p><p>A special thanks to fellow Techstars founder Sarah Tuneberg who gave me perspective through the journey, <span>Techstars founder&nbsp;</span>Jen Saxton who gifted me “When smart people fail” and my wife for supporting me while I put myself back together.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]>

November 8, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/jaccard-minhash | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/jaccard-minhash">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Set similarity measure finds its application spanning the Computer Science spectrum; some applications being - user segmentation, finding near-duplicate webpages/documents, clustering, recommendation generation, sequence alignment, and many more. In this essay, we take a detailed look into a set-similarity measure called - Jaccard's Similarity Coefficient and how its computation can be optimized using a neat technique called MinHash.</p>

<p>Jaccard Similarity Coefficient quantifies how similar two <em>finite</em> sets really are and is defined as the size of their intersection divided by the size of their union. This similarity measure is very intuitive and we can clearly see that it is a real-valued measure bounded in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98461673-302d7180-21d4-11eb-9722-41f473c1fe84.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98461673-302d7180-21d4-11eb-9722-41f473c1fe84.png"></p>
<p>The coefficient is <code>0</code> when the two sets are mutually exclusive (disjoint) and it is <code>1</code> when the sets are equal. Below we see the one-line python function that computes this similarity measure.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>similarity_jaccard</span><span>(a: set, b: set)</span> -&gt; float:</span>
    <span>return</span> len(a.intersection(b)) / len(a.union(b))
</code></pre>
<h2>Jaccard Similarity Coefficient as Probability</h2>
<p>Jaccard Coefficient can also be interpreted as the probability that an element picked at random from the universal set <code>U</code> is present in both sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98462221-8dc3bd00-21d8-11eb-95bf-5a9267e88b97.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98462221-8dc3bd00-21d8-11eb-95bf-5a9267e88b97.png"></p>
<p>Another analogy for this probability is the chances of throwing a dart and it hitting the intersection. Thus we see how we can transform the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient into a simple probability statement. This will come in very handy when we try to optimize the computation at scale.</p>
<h2>Problem at Scale</h2>
<p>Computing Jaccard Similarity Coefficient is very simple, all we require is a union operation and an intersection operation on the participating sets. But these computations go haywire when things run at scale.</p>
<p>Computing set similarity is usually a subproblem fitting in a bigger picture, for example, near-duplicate detection which finds near-duplicate articles across millions of documents. When we tokenize the documents and apply raw Jaccard Similarity Coefficient for every two combinations of documents we find that the computation will take <a href="https://mccormickml.com/2015/06/12/minhash-tutorial-with-python-code/">years</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of finding the true value for this coefficient, we can rely on an approximation if we can get a considerable speedup and this is where a technique called MinHash fits well.</p>

<p>MinHash algorithm gives us a fast approximation to the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient between any two finite sets. Instead of computing the unions and the intersections every single time, this method once creates <em>MinHash Signature</em> for each set and use it to approximate the coefficient.</p>
<h2>Computing single MinHash</h2>
<p>MinHash <code>h</code> of the set <code>S</code> is the index of the first element, from a permuted Universal Set, that is present in the set <code>S</code>. But since permutation is a computation heavy operation especially for large sets we use a hashing/mapping function that typically reorders the elements using simple math operation. One such hashing function is</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463097-f7df6080-21de-11eb-8b61-a84ff7ad85de.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463097-f7df6080-21de-11eb-8b61-a84ff7ad85de.png"></p>
<p>If <code>u</code> is the total number of elements in the Universal Set <code>U</code> then <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are the random integers less than <code>u</code> and <code>c</code> is the prime number slightly higher than <code>u</code>.  A sample permute function could be</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>permute_fn</span><span>(x: int)</span> -&gt; int:</span>
    <span>return</span> (<span>23</span> * x + <span>67</span>) % <span>199</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have defined permutation as a simple mathematical operation that spits out the new row index, we can find MinHash of a set as the element that has the minimum new row number. Hence we can define the MinHash function as</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>minhash</span><span>(s: set)</span> -&gt; int:</span>
    <span>return</span> min([permute_fn(e) <span>for</span> e <span>in</span> s])
</code></pre>
<h2>A surprising property of MinHash</h2>
<p>MinHash has a surprising property, according to which, the probability that the MinHash of random permutation produces the same value for the two sets equals the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient of those sets.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463732-8229c380-21e3-11eb-9b26-04ec08bc8753.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463732-8229c380-21e3-11eb-9b26-04ec08bc8753.png"></p>
<p>The above equality holds true because the probability of MinHash of two sets to be the same is the number of elements present in both the sets divided by the total number of elements in both the sets combined; which in fact is the definition of Jaccard Similarity Coefficient.</p>
<p>Hence to approximate Similarity Coefficient using MinHash all we have to do is find the Probability of MinHash of two sets to be the same, and this is where the MinHash Signature comes in to play.</p>
<h2>MinHash Signature</h2>
<p>MinHash Signature of a set <code>S</code> is a collection of <code>k</code> MinHash values corresponding to <code>k</code> different MinHash functions. The size <code>k</code> depends on the error tolerance, keeping it higher leads to more accurate approximations.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>minhash_signature</span><span>(s: set)</span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> [minhash(s) <span>for</span> minhash <span>in</span> minhash_fns]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>MinHash functions usually differ in the permutation parameters i.e. coefficients <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now in order to compute <code>Pr[h(A) = h(B)]</code> we have to compare the MinHash Signature of the participating sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> and find how many values in their signatures match; dividing this number by the number of hash functions <code>k</code> will give the required probability and in turn an approximation of Jaccard Similarity Coefficient.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>similarity_minhash</span><span>(a: set, b: set)</span> -&gt; float:</span>
    sign_a = minhash_signature(a)
    sign_b = minhash_signature(b)
    <span>return</span> sum([<span>1</span> <span>for</span> a, b <span>in</span> zip(sign_a, sign_b) <span>if</span> a == b]) / len(sign_a)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>MinHash Signature could well be computed just once per set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus to compute set similarity, we need not perform heavy computation like Union and Intersection and that too across millions of sets at scale, rather we can simply compare <code>k</code> items of in their signatures and get a fairly good estimate of it.</p>

<p>In order to find how close the estimate is we compute the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient and its approximate using MinHash on two disjoint sets having equal cardinality. One of the sets will undergo a transition where one element of it will be replaced with one element of the other set. So with time, the sets will go from disjoint to being equal.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98465023-860e1380-21ec-11eb-8813-7cb6920bc1fd.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98465023-860e1380-21ec-11eb-8813-7cb6920bc1fd.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows the two plots and we can clearly see that the MinHash technique provides a fairly good estimate of Jaccard Similarity Coefficient with much fewer computations.</p>

In the United States, the cold war has been declared officially over and a young Bill Clinton is set to become the 42nd president of America. The space shuttle Atlantis takes off from Cape Canaveral with meteorological instruments to study global warming as the resources tied up in the costly cold war are freed for nobler pursuits. In South Africa, white citizens vote for political reforms to end apartheid, the struggle of the past two years is coming to an end. On the British Isles, the most famous speculative attack in history has been carried out on the British Pound by a group of investors masterminded by Hungarian-American financier George Soros. On ‘Black Wednesday’ 16 September 1992, investors sell massive amounts of British Pounds, expecting a devaluation- a drop in the price of the pound against other currencies. The Bank of England buys £4 billion in order to keep the demand for the pound high, but by the next day the value of the pound has fallen by more than 10%. The Bank reports a loss of £3.3 billion, a third of which George Soros gets to keep.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2001. The September 11 attacks have just taken place prompting the formation of four new security agencies and a war on terror that would last for over a decade.
What do these two events have in common? Two things. Firstly, they are both ‘black swan’ events. ‘Black swan’ is a termed coined by Lebanese-American statistician Nicholas Nassim Taleb to describe events that have low probabilities of happening and cannot be predicted. They usually have major effects and are often wrongly explained away by historians and analysts who have the benefit of hindsight. In other words, events that seem obvious when viewed from a perspective further in time, but are unpredictable by observers in the present. Examples include; World war 1, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the housing crisis of 2008, and Donald Trump’s election.</p>

<p>More interestingly, both of these events may not have happened today. This due to the advances being made in the prediction of rare events in the field of Machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of the Artificial intelligence discipline that automates analytical model building. A model is a simple structure that captures all the features of more complicated real-world situations.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603549165479/1VwKMKpzR.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="file-20190409-2931-2n3fgx.jpg"></p>
<p>Machine learning is currently being considered in predicting future cyber-terrorist attacks, and is already being used to anticipate sudden changes in stock prices here, and here.</p>
<p>While Machine learning already has so many applications today in almost every sphere of human life; </p>
<ol>
<li>Technology (virtual assistants and self-driving cars) </li>
<li>Banking (fraud detection)</li>
<li>Marketing (adaptive online ads)</li>
</ol>
<p>A number of criticisms have yet to be addressed by proponents of machine learning in black swan event prediction such as;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Delusional turkeys:</strong> Algorithms predict events based on past data, which is well… from the past. This has been likened to Inductive reasoning, a generalization of which is the anecdotal turkey predicting that the farmer will not kill it, based on past data which holds up until thanksgiving.</li>
<li><strong>Fighting fire with fire:</strong> Other critics have pointed out that the stock market is very complex and responds to the actions which members take. This means that algorithms that predict what humans do right now, will eventually have to predict what other algorithms will do as more traders resort to Machine learning. Eventually those algorithms will also have to predict what other algorithms predict that other algorithms will do. The same reasoning applies to terrorist attacks. What happens when the terrorists resort to machine learning?</li>
<li><strong>The enemy within:</strong> Other critics have yet opined that machines are incapable of predicting black swan events and instead are most likely to cause one like in the 2010 flash crash. This carries greater implications in predicting terrorist attacks. Implications such as strained diplomatic relations or even war.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, while the pros and cons of machine learning have not yet been fully measured, we can only say two things with the exact minimum degree of certainty with which you might be comfortable, that machine learning will predict black swan events or that it will itself be absolved as a factor in the black hole that is the quest for the prediction of black swan events. But whatever the case, like with google maps, there is no wrong turn and there certainly is no going back now.</p>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We started this series with <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">an overview of the CPython VM</a>. We learned that to run a Python program, CPython first compiles it to bytecode, and we studied how the compiler works in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">part two</a>. <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">Last time</a> we stepped through the CPython source code starting with the <code>main()</code> function until we reached the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. The main reason why we spent time studying these things was to prepare for the discussion that we start today. The goal of this discussion is to understand how CPython does what we tell it to do, that is, how it executes the bytecode to which the code we write compiles.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h3>Starting point</h3>
<p>Let's briefly recall what we learned in the previous parts. We tell CPython what to do by writing Python code. The CPython VM, however, understands only Python bytecode. This is the job of the compiler to translate Python code to bytecode. The compiler stores bytecode in a code object, which is a structure that fully describes what a code block, like a module or a function, does. To execute a code object, CPython first creates a state of execution for it called a frame object. Then it passes a frame object to a frame evaluation function to perform the actual computation. The default frame evaluation function is <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Python/ceval.c#L889">Python/ceval.c</a>. This function implements the core of the CPython VM. Namely, it implements the logic for the execution of Python bytecode. So, this function is what we're going to study today.</p>
<p>To understand how <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> works, it is crucial to have an idea of what its input, a frame object, is. A frame object is a Python object defined by the following C struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// typedef struct _frame PyFrameObject; in other place</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>_frame</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject_VAR_HEAD</span>

    <span>/* Next free slot in f_valuestack.  Frame creation sets to f_valuestack.</span>

    <span>char</span> <span>f_trace_lines</span><span>;</span>         <span>/* Emit per-line trace events? */</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>f_trace_opcodes</span><span>;</span>       <span>/* Emit per-opcode trace events? */</span>

    <span>/* Borrowed reference to a generator, or NULL */</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>f_gen</span><span>;</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>f_lasti</span><span>;</span>                <span>/* Last instruction if called */</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>f_lineno</span><span>;</span>               <span>/* Current line number */</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>f_iblock</span><span>;</span>               <span>/* index in f_blockstack */</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>f_executing</span><span>;</span>           <span>/* whether the frame is still executing */</span>
    <span>PyTryBlock</span> <span>f_blockstack</span><span>[</span><span>CO_MAXBLOCKS</span><span>];</span> <span>/* for try and loop blocks */</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>f_localsplus</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>  <span>/* locals+stack, dynamically sized */</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>f_code</code> field of a frame object points to a code object. A code object is also a Python object. Here's its definition:</p>

<p>The most important field of a code object is <code>co_code</code>. It's a pointer to a Python bytes object representing the bytecode. The bytecode is a sequence of two-byte instructions: one byte for an opcode and one byte for an argument.</p>
<p>Don't worry if some members of the above structures are still a mystery to you. We'll see what they are used for as we move forward in our attempt to understand how the CPython VM executes the bytecode.</p>
<h3>Overview of the evaluation loop</h3>
<p>The problem of executing Python bytecode may seem a no-brainer to you. Indeed, all the VM has to do is to iterate over the instructions and to act according to them. And this is what essentially <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> does. It contains an infinite <code>for (;;)</code> loop that we refer to as the evaluation loop. Inside that loop there is a giant <code>switch</code> statement over all possible opcodes. Each opcode has a corresponding <code>case</code> block containing the code for executing that opcode. The bytecode is represented by an array of 16-bit unsigned integers, one integer per instruction. The VM keeps track of the next instruction to be executed using the <code>next_instr</code> variable, which is a pointer to the array of instructions. At the start of each iteration of the evaluation loop, the VM calculates the next opcode and its argument by taking the least significant and the most significant byte of the next instruction respectively and increments <code>next_instr</code>. The <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> function is nearly 3000 lines long, but its essence can be captured by the following simplified version:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyObject</span><span>*</span>
<span>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault</span><span>(</span><span>PyThreadState</span> <span>*</span><span>tstate</span><span>,</span> <span>PyFrameObject</span> <span>*</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>throwflag</span><span>)</span>

        <span>oparg</span> <span>=</span> <span>_Py_OPARG</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>);</span>
        <span>next_instr</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>

        <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>opcode</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>NOP</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>FAST_DISPATCH</span><span>();</span> <span>// more on this later</span>
            <span>}</span>

            <span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>LOAD_FAST</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// ... code for loading local variable</span>
            <span>}</span>

            <span>// ... 117 more cases for every possible opcode</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>// ... error handling</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// ... termination</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a more realistic picture, let's discuss some of the omitted pieces in more detail.</p>
<h4>reasons to suspend the loop</h4>
<p>From time to time, the currently running thread stops executing the bytecode to do something else or to do nothing. This can happen due to one of the four reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are signals to handle. When you register a function as a signal handler using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.signal"><code>signal.signal()</code></a>, CPython stores this function in the array of handlers. The function that will actually be called when a thread receives a signal is <code>signal_handler()</code> (it's passed to the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"><code>sigaction()</code></a> library function on Unix-like systems). When called, <code>signal_handler()</code> sets a boolean variable telling that the function in the array of handlers corresponding to the received signal has to be called. Periodically, the main thread of the main interpreter calls the tripped handlers.</li>
<li>There are pending calls to call. Pending calls is a mechanism that allows to schedule a function to be executed from the main thread. This mechanism is exposed by the Python/C API via the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_AddPendingCall"><code>Py_AddPendingCall()</code></a> function.</li>
<li>The asynchronous exception is raised. The asynchronous exception is an exception set in one thread from another. This can be done using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc"><code>PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc()</code></a> function provided by the Python/C API.</li>
<li>The currently running thread is requested to drop the GIL. When it sees such a request, it drops the GIL and waits until it acquires the GIL again.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPython has indicators for each of these events. The variable indicating that there are handlers to call is a member of <code>runtime-&gt;ceval</code>, which is a <code>_ceval_runtime_state</code> struct:</p></div></div>

<p>In this series of posts, I will introduce you to the most popular software architecture types. But before we delve into the most common variants, let us talk about software architecture itself.</p>



<h2><strong>What is software architecture?</strong></h2>



<p>It is tough to write simply for such a complex topic as software architecture but let me try my best.</p>



<p>A software system is made up of individual elements. Elements could be databases, application servers, message brokers, load balancers, etc.</p>



<p>Each element has its properties and characteristics. Between these elements, there are relationships.</p>



<p>The way we structure these elements and their relationships, we call software architecture.</p>



<p>By defining such a structure, we aim to gain some benefits. Quality attributes define and describe these benefits, and it is essential to remember that they are not business logic related.</p>



<p>Software architecture is the skeleton of your application. Once you start implementation, it is tough to change it, so the right decision for architecture is crucial in the early phase of the project.</p>



<h2><strong>Quality attributes</strong></h2>



<p>Though quality attributes are not functionality requirements, they mainly arise from the functional requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By defining requirements for a software product, the business aims to enhance some competitive advantages.</p>



<p>In the best-case scenario, quality attributes gathering should come from those competitive advantages.</p>



<p>A simple example. Back in the days, I worked in a company that wanted to develop a new retail system. The business analysis showed that most of our main competitor’s customers do not like their system because it was always online. The user couldn’t even check product stocks in case of an internet outage.</p>



<p>For our new product to be competitive in the market, we had to aim for a competitive advantage. Our system had to work offline during internet outages and sync all recorded operations when the internet is back.</p>



<p>We, developers, translated that requirement into the <strong>availability</strong> quality attribute.</p>



<p>Sometimes quality attributes don’t come from requirements. Some quality attributes are enforced by constraints. Constraints could be different, from the dev team’s experience level to government regulations.</p>



<p>And last but not least, quality attributes should be measurable and testable.</p>



<h3><strong>Some of the most popular quality attributes:</strong></h3>



<h4>Availability</h4>



<p>It defines to what level the system is available to perform its tasks. Availability expands on the notion of reliability. Systems with high availability tend to be resilient to faults and errors (well, to most of them). High availability systems implement methods for fault detection and recovery.</p>



<h4>Modifiability</h4>



<p>Modifiability defines how well a system can adapt to changes. Technologies change, business requirements change. High modifiability software should be able to embrace new changes by reducing change costs and risks.</p>



<h4>Interoperability</h4>



<p>No system can live in total isolation. Interoperability quality attribute measures to what degree a software system can “communicate” with other software systems. Systems with high interoperability tend to have very well defined interfaces and implement widely accepted standards and communication protocols.</p>



<h4>Security</h4>



<p>The security of a system could be viewed from three different angles. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Confidentiality â€“ is the data well secured from users who don’t have the right to access it.</p>



<p>Availability â€“ is the data available when needed.</p>



<p>Integrity â€“ is the data well secured, so tampering and deletion are not possible.</p>



<h4>Performance</h4>



<p>Well, performance is all about time. This quality attribute aims to put an upper execution time limit to the system’s tasks (no matter if the user or internal mechanisms initiate them).</p>



<h4>Testability</h4>



<p>Testability defines to what degree a system can be <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/10/24/how-to-write-a-good-unit-tests/">tested</a>. How well business and technical requirements can be simulated, observed, and analyzed. High testability systems provide a high level of isolation and abstraction of its modules.</p>



<h4>Usability</h4>



<p>Usability is about how easy it is for the user to perform tasks in the system.</p>



<p>Sound simple but believe me, usability is a real pain. Usability is even bigger pain when we talk about systems with very complex business logic and processes.</p>



<p>Every user comes with his own previous experience and opinions. That’s why usability is often based on compromises for the greater good ðŸ˜Š.</p>



<p>For more comprehensive list you can check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>What is the difference between software architecture and software design?</strong></h2>



<p>While software architecture aims to define the structure and relationships of the different system elements (considering all the present constraints), the software design focuses on their specific implementation.</p>



<p>If a software architecture specifies that we will have microservices with async internal communication, the software design will define how this will be implemented.</p>



<p>Do we use RabitMQ or Mass Transit, or something other? What is the format of our messages? How will the data models reflect the bounded context we have defined? The software design answers all these questions.</p>



<h2><strong>Architecting for performance (example)</strong></h2>



<p>Let us see how a quality attribute requirement affects system architecture.</p>



<p>We have a potential client who wants a very fast (performance quality attribute) reporting system.</p>



<p>The client should make decisions fast so that the reporting system’s speed is a competitive advantage for his business.</p>



<p>Currently, the client has two different systems. He queries them when he needs some data (using their operational databases, which degrade performance additionally) and combines the extracted data in an ugly excel report.</p>



<p>Back in the days, that approach worked perfectly for him, but now, this is becoming a bottleneck when his business is much bigger.</p>



<p>Our company “Drink beer and code Ltd.” receives invite to solve the problem.</p>



<p>After a complete analysis of the case, the developers come with the solution. According to the research, they think that a report’s average execution time could be lowered to 1500 ms (yeahâ€¦).</p>



<p>At this stage, dev team will not change current systems. Either way, they work well to meet the customer’s needs, and he doesn’t want to change them.</p>



<p>The Dev team plans to deploy a new SQL Server. The server will have a new analytics database and two replicated copies of the other systems’ operational databases.</p>



<p>Operational database replication is event-based.</p>



<p>A worker service extracts the data from the replicated databases, transforms it appropriately for the analytics database, and loads it into the analytics database.</p>



<p>The analytics database design is structured and optimized for the format of the needed reports. <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/10/04/optimizing-sql-queries-sometimes-two-queries-are-better-than-one/">Querying</a> the database will be very fast.</p>



<p>Finally, we have a reporting application reading the data over the analytics database and visualizing it in beautiful tables and charts.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>Even with that oversimplistic example, we can see that we have introduced new elements and relationships between them to meet the desired quality attribute metric.</p>



<p>We also faced the constraint that the old systems enforced over our technical decision.</p>



<p>But in the end, we achieved the desired performance and that enhanced our client’s competitive advantage.</p>

                    <p>In many aspects of our lives, we rely on those in positions of power to lead us. The role of leaders becomes especially salient in times of uncertainty. Throughout your life, you’ve probably seen several ways leaders can respond to challenging and ambiguous situations. A transformational leader can see the opportunities in turmoil and inspire people to follow them to a better future. On the other hand, an incompetent leader will leave you to deal with everything alone. In the worst-case scenario, a destructive leader will see the potential for self-enhancement and exploit others to maximize their gain. </p><figure><img src="https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png" alt="" srcset="https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 600w, https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 1000w, https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 1069w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>4 Clues to Identify a Destructive Leader</figcaption></figure><h3 id="people-leave-managers-not-companies-">People leave managers, not companies.</h3><p>Incompetent and destructive leaders both create negative consequences, but the distinction between the two is essential. An incompetent leader may lack the compelling charisma to engage others to follow, but we wouldn’t call someone lacking charisma actively destructive. A <a href="https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199755615.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199755615-e-014">destructive leader</a> intentionally and systematically behaves in a way that violates the organization’s members and stakeholders’ best interests. The extent of damage that a destructive leader can cause often goes unnoticed until it is too late (e.g., Enron), but there are clues you can look for to help you identify destructive leaders earlier. These clues reflect behaviors and attitudes that can reveal the destructive nature of an otherwise seemingly competent leader.</p><h3 id="what-causes-destructive-leadership-patterns">What causes destructive leadership patterns?</h3><p>Everyone has some characteristics that are annoying to someone who prefers a different way of behaving and working. These characteristics are inherited in our DNA and influenced by the environment in which we grew up. The genetic influence was passed down from generation to generation and is a product of evolution that helped your ancestors survive the environments they encountered. And they can help you too, as long as they don’t become distorted from early experiences of chronic fear. </p><p>In destructive leadership, typical behavior patterns become distorted into extremes powered by the brain’s more primitive parts under such circumstances. When this happens, we are in fear-mode, and a blend of fear reactions becomes our norm. These distorted patterns become habitual, and our responses to others become unhealthy. For example, suppose we experienced excessive criticism in our early development. In that case, our ego will record a perception of being diminished by important caregivers and sense that our very survival depends on not being criticized. In this case, we may learn to strive excessively for superiority to alleviate the fear of feeling inferior in our assessment of ourselves.</p><p>While a reactive pattern like this helped us survive the precise environment we were born into, in a global world, that same pattern may not. The brain’s brilliant design constructs a set of behaviors that will ensure our survival in whatever we experience in the development years to maturity. But if we move to an entirely new environment as an adult, the patterns that served us before may not translate into helpful practices somewhere else. </p><h3 id="the-reason-anxiety-and-stress-are-at-an-all-time-high-">The reason anxiety and stress are at an all-time high.</h3><p>In the last century, this phenomenon has become even more complicated. With the advancement of technology comes exposure to human systems all over the world. Transportation enables moving to any part of the globe in a day or two. As we move about rapidly from one culture to another, we find ourselves unable to understand why we are perceived positively in one environment and the opposite in another. No wonder anxiety and stress are at an all-time high, especially for those who interact in global companies. Adaptation to other cultures becomes a necessity, making self-awareness and emotional intelligence some of the most critical skill sets of our time. </p><h3 id="first-look-for-the-underlying-intention-">First, look for the underlying intention.</h3><p>Because all human systems are imperfect, and most parents do the best they can do, many of us have traces of fear behaviors that can drive others nuts. There are a few prototypical examples of these types of behaviors, including, but not limited to </p><ul><li>The constant worrier who is always second-guessing themselves,</li><li>The storyteller who seems to live in an ideal world no one else can relate to,</li><li>The dominant driver who wants everything to go their way,</li><li>The prideful judge who doesn’t realize they can’t possibly know everything there is to know about everything. </li></ul><p>When we’re talking about destructive leadership, we’re not merely referring to annoying habits unless they have become very extreme or painfully frequent. Destructive leaders have little interest in how they are perceived, so they are rarely interested in how they could improve. </p><h3 id="destructive-leaders-are-single-mindedly-self-interested-">Destructive leaders are single-mindedly self-interested.</h3><p>Generally, healthy leaders may have annoying habits, but when you look beneath the surface, two things are different: </p><ol><li>They adopt a mindset that conveys they care about their impact on others and are willing to listen, learn, and exert the choice and character to change.</li><li>They hold a positive intention toward others and work for the good of the mission and the enterprise they serve. </li></ol><p>On the other hand, destructive leaders are either:</p><ol><li>Un-coachable because they adopt a rigid mindset that conveys they don’t care about their impact on others and will use their authority to manipulate others to bend to their will. They imply, “I am who I am, so deal with it.”</li><li>They have a hidden ulterior motive for wanting and using power to serve themselves at the expense of others, the mission, or the enterprise. </li></ol><p>So, as we lay out the four clues of destructive leaders, keep two things in mind. Do you have a hunch that they are well-intended, and are they willing to work on themselves? If the answer to both is affirmative, they are probably not destructive, but just like you and me, they are trying to serve their company and grow as best they can. In these circumstances, we can mind our own business and work on our self-improvement plan rather than thinking about how annoying they are. After all, it’s temporary unless they are genuinely destructive. And then you must do everything in your power to remove them from your company, or they could take the whole thing down. </p><h3 id="clue-1-behaviors-or-words-that-imply-i-m-kind-of-a-big-deal-">Clue 1: Behaviors or words that imply “I’m kind of a big deal!”</h3><p><strong>Excessive fabrication and exaggeration that is nowhere near the truth. </strong></p><p>This destructive pattern arises from an inner identity that seeks to resolve a childhood dilemma about not getting enough attention from caregivers, so they do not feel special. This dilemma results in insatiable attention-seeking and an inflated need to be special, unique, or novel. The inner fear is feeling trapped in the loneliness or sadness of not being “special” enough to those who matter. Because they perceive being attention-deprived or unworthy, they feel shame, and it becomes so painful, they rebel from authority figures whom they believe could not be trusted. Instead of following appropriately, they become rebellious and provocative, conning others to go along with their fantastic plans. </p><h3 id="clues-you-will-notice-">Clues you will notice: </h3><ul><li>Exaggeration of the truth to the point of fantasy</li><li>Unapologetic self-promoting and self-aggrandizing</li><li>Excessive talking to dominate others</li><li>Pontification and fabrication of elaborate stories</li><li>Disrespect for authority figures</li><li>Disregard for rules that are contrary to their aims</li><li>Automatically dismiss ideas from others</li><li>An insatiable need to be the center of attention</li><li>Terminally individualistic, unique, or novel</li><li>External image is unusually extreme in some way</li></ul><h3 id="results-in-a-chaotic-climate">Results in a Chaotic Climate</h3><p>These destructive leaders are challenging to work with because they demand attention but don’t want the restrictions that come with being front and center. When they are in the limelight, it can be exceedingly uncomfortable because they also unconsciously fail to believe they are impressive enough. So they attract attention, initiate excessive activity, and then thwart the attention this draws. This pattern makes them unpredictable, so the shadow of the climate they create around them is chaotic and confusing for others. </p><h3 id="clue-2-behaviors-or-words-that-imply-none-of-this-is-my-fault-">Clue 2: Behaviors or words that imply “None of this is my fault!”</h3><p><strong>Excessive conflict-avoidance by deflecting personal responsibility. </strong></p><p>This destructive pattern arises from an inner identity that seeks to resolve a childhood dilemma about not getting enough approval and acceptance. This dilemma results in insatiable approval-seeking and an excessive need to be liked by everyone, even strangers. The inner fear is to be rejected or ridiculed by others as unlovable by those who matter. Because they perceive being unacceptable to others, they feel powerless and unworthy of care. This experience can become painful and they are unable to communicate or ask others for what they need because they don’t feel they deserve it. They defer to those in authority roles and suffer quietly in dependence, hopelessness, and seen as “needy” for any shred of approval. </p><h3 id="clues-you-will-notice--1">Clues you will notice:</h3><ul><li>Complaining, blaming, gossiping about others</li><li>Disgruntled resentment of those in authority</li><li>Giving up their power and being dependent on others</li><li>Come across as “needy” and draining</li><li>Asking others to decide and then resenting it</li><li>Avoiding leadership to avoid culpability later</li><li>Unconsciously inviting others to dominate them</li><li>Blaming others for being the “bully”</li><li>Desire to be the “nice” or “good” one</li><li>An insatiable need to be liked, accepted, included</li></ul><h3 id="results-in-a-conflict-averse-climate">Results in a Conflict Averse Climate </h3><p>These destructive leaders are challenging to work with because they put extreme energy into taking care of or helping others with an unstated expectation that there will be a reward in return. For example, they take care of someone with the expectation that the other person will take the responsibility of making decisions for them. However, they may not tell the other person this expectation. There is an unconscious …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

A few weeks ago I've shown you how simple Clojure's
<a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() is, even compared to Keras. I've also mentioned
that it's superfast. Here's how fast it is on the GPU!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc0a2ae3">
<h2 id="orgc0a2ae3">TL;DR Much faster than Keras+TensorFlow on the GPU, too!</h2>
<div id="text-orgc0a2ae3">
<p>
In the <a href="https://dragan.rocks/articles/20/Going-faster-than-TensorFlow-with-Clojure">previous article</a>, we have only compared the libraries on the CPU.
Deep Diamond was considerably faster: 368 seconds vs 509 seconds. Most readers were intrigued,
but, being skeptical as they should be, they complained that CPU performance doesn't matter
anyway, since everybody uses GPU for training convolution networks;
let's do the GPU comparison then.
</p>

<p>
Both Deep Diamond, and Keras with TensorFlow, use <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn">Nvidia's cuDNN</a> low level performance
library under the hood, and any difference is due to the higher-level implementation.
</p>

<p>
Deep Diamond completes this training in <b>21</b> seconds while Keras + TensorFlow takes <b>35</b> seconds.
The gap even increased in favor of Deep Diamond! Now the ratio is <b>1.67</b>, in place of 1.38 on the CPU.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>You may or may not have heard about the release of the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk">terraform cdk</a> (short for cloud development kit). It’s HashiCorps answer to the aws cdk. In the words of the projects readme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CDK (Cloud Development Kit) for Terraform allows developers to use familiar programming languages to define cloud infrastructure and provision it through HashiCorp Terraform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s try this out shall we?</p>
<p>To get the full developer experience, make sure you have <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support">typescript support installed for your IDE</a></p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<h3>Generating the boilerplate</h3>
<p>Let’s open our terminal and install install cdktf-cli:</p>

<p>Next we’ll initialize the project</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>mkdir</span> hello-cdktf
<span>cd</span> hello-cdktf
cdktf init --template<span>=</span><span>"typescript"</span> --local</code></pre></div>
<p>Answer the two configuration questions and the project boilerplate will be generated.</p>
<p>Now we should see a <code>main.ts</code> file with the following contents in our folder:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Construct <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'constructs'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> App<span>,</span> TerraformStack <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'cdktf'</span><span>;</span>

<span>class</span> <span>MyStack</span> <span>extends</span> <span>TerraformStack</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>scope<span>:</span> Construct<span>,</span> name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>(</span>scope<span>,</span> name<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>const</span> app <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>new</span> <span>MyStack</span><span>(</span>app<span>,</span> <span>'hello-cdktf2'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
app<span>.</span><span>synth</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Adding a provider package and importing modules from it</h3>
<p>After generation finishes you’ll see a message in the console listing instructions of what to do next. To add the prebuilt aws provider (which also gives us all the modules and types that we might want).</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> -a @cdktf/provider-aws</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you can import modules from <code>@cdktf/provider-aws</code> such as <code>AwsProvider</code> and others. We’ll go for the <code>AwsProvider</code>, <code>LambdaFunction</code> and <code>IamRole</code>. Add this at the top of your file:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> AwsProvider<span>,</span> LambdaFunction<span>,</span> IamRole <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@cdktf/provider-aws'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then create an AwsProvider in your stack:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>AwsProvider</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>,</span> <span>'aws'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  region<span>:</span> <span>'eu-west-2'</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Adding a lambda function to our stack</h3>
<p>To create a lambda we need to define an IAM role at first. Boring, but made easier by autocomplete of cours. Anyway here’s the default policy:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>const</span> roleForLambda <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>IamRole</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>,</span> <span>'iam-role-for-lambda'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>'iam-role-for-lambda'</span><span>,</span>
  assumeRolePolicy<span>:</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    <span>"Version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span>
        <span>"Action"</span><span>:</span> <span>"sts:AssumeRole"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"Principal"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>"Service"</span><span>:</span> <span>"lambda.amazonaws.com"</span>
        <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Allow"</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can add a lambda function to the stack like this:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>LambdaFunction</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>,</span> <span>'hello-world'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  filename<span>:</span> process<span>.</span><span>cwd</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>'hello-world.zip'</span>
  functionName<span>:</span> <span>'hello-world'</span><span>,</span>
  handler<span>:</span> <span>'index.handler'</span><span>,</span>
  runtime<span>:</span> <span>'nodejs12.x'</span><span>,</span>
  role<span>:</span> roleForLambda<span>.</span>arn<span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will need to zip your lambda function - which is usually a separate step before running terraform. For example sake, let’s say you have a file in your project named <code>hello-world.js</code>:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span> hello<span>:</span> world <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then zip your lambda <code>zip -r lambda.zip hello-world.js</code></p>
<h3>Deploying your stack</h3>
<p>Before you deploy don’t forget need to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html">have your aws credentials in your path</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have everything ready you can deploy your stack with <code>cdktf deploy</code>. This command will display an execution plan and ask you if you want to deploy. Press the <code>Y</code> and <code>Enter</code> key to deploy.</p>
<p>Any errors at this stage should be farely self-explanatory. If they don’t make sense, google the error message - other people have likely run into the same problem.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you’re a terraform user and you’ve used the <code>lambda_function</code> module before, you’ll notice that the configuration is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when you run <code>cdktf synth</code> cdktf compiles your javascript/typescript modules into terraforms alternative <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax-json.html"><code>JSON</code> configuration syntax</a>.</p>
<p>This is an extremely powerful feature of terraform’s design since it can be a compile target not just for javascript and typescript, but any kind of language. The open source community could add it’s own language compilers.</p>
<p>Why not write one in rust? 😅</p></section></div>]]>

		<p>In 1998, I had some extra time while others were reading for final exams of the senior high school, and got into digital signal processing. I wrote as I learned, and here is the result. It is not entirely accurate in places but may serve as a nice tutorial into the world of audio DSP.

<h2><a name="dspstuff_1">Foreword</a></h2>
<p>This is written for the audio digital signal processing enthusiasts (as the title suggests ;) and others who need practical information on the subject. If you don't have this as a "linear reading experience" and encounter difficulties, check if there's something to help you out in the previous chapters.</p>
<p>In filter frequency response plots, linear frequency and magnitude scales are used. Page changes are designed for 60+ lines/page printers.</p>
<p>Chapter "Shuffling IIR equations" is written by my big brother Kalle. And, thanks to Timo Tossavainen for sharing his DSP knowledge!</p>

<h2><a name="dspstuff_2">About sampled sound</a></h2>
<p>Note that "sample" can mean (1) a sampled sound or (2) a samplepoint!</p>
<p>Sampled sound data is a pile of samples, amplitude values taken from the actual sound wave. Sampling rate is the frequency of the "shots". For example, if the frequency is 44100, 44100 samples have been taken in one second.</p>
<p>Here's an example of sampling:</p>
<pre>                                           _0---0_
                                         _/       --0__
        0_                __0---0__    _0              -0---0___
          \_          _-0-         -0--                         0-__
        +---0==-+--=0---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---0==-+---+
               -0--                                                    -0_
                                                                          --0
                                            &lt;---&gt;
                                        1/Samplerate</pre>
<p>The original sound is the curve, and "0"s are the sampled points. The horizontal straight line is the zero level.</p>
<p>A sampled sound can only represent frequencies up to half the samplerate. This is called the Nyquist frequency. An easy proof: You need to have stored at least two samplepoints per wave cycle, the top and the bottom of the wave to be able to reconstruct it later on:</p>
<pre>        0\     /0\     /0\     /0\     /0\     /0\     /0\     /0\     /0\
          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
        +-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+
          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
           \0/     \0/     \0/     \0/     \0/     \0/     \0/     \0/     \0</pre>
<p>If you try to include above Nyquist frequencies in your sampled sound, all you get is extra distortion as they appear as lower frequencies.</p>
<h2><a name="dspstuff_3">Adding two sine waves together</a></h2>
<p>A Sound consists of frequency components. They all look exactly like sine waves, but they have different frequencies, phases and amplitudes. Let's look at a single frequency:</p>
<pre>                | __        __        __        __      |
                |/  \      /  \      /  \      /  \     |
                /----\----/----\----/----\----/----\----/
                |     \__/      \__/      \__/      \__/|
                |                                       |</pre>
<p>Now, we take the same frequency from another sound and notice that it has the same amplitude, but the opposite (rotated 180 degrees) phase.</p>
<pre>                |      __        __        __        __ |
                |     /  \      /  \      /  \      /  \|
                \----/----\----/----\----/----\----/----\
                |\__/      \__/      \__/      \__/     |
                |                                       |</pre>
<p>Merging two signals is done simply by adding them together. If we do the same with these two sine waves, the result will be:</p>
<pre>                |                                       |
                |                                       |
                +=======================================+
                |                                       |
                |                                       |</pre>
<p>It gets silent. If we think of other cases, where the phase difference is less than 180 degrees, we get sine waves that all have different amplitudes and phases, but the same frequency.</p>
<p>Here's the way to calculate the phase and the amplitude of the resulting sinewave... Convert the amplitude and phase into one complex number, where angle is the phase, and absolute value the amplitude.</p>
<pre>        amplitude*e^(i*phase) = amplitude*cos(phase)+i*amplitude*sin(phase)</pre>
<p>If you do this to both of the sinewaves, you can add them together as complex numbers.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>        (Wave A) amplitude 1, phase 0, (Wave B) amplitude 1, phase 90 degrees

                   _---|---_         _---0---_         _---|---_ 0
                  /    |    \       /    |    \       /    |    \
                 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
                -|-----+-----0- + -|-----+-----|- = -|-----+-----|-
                 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
                  \_   |   _/       \_   |   _/       \_   |   _/
                    ---|---           ---|---           ---|---</pre>
<p>As you see, the phase of the new sine wave is 45 degrees and the amplitude sqrt(1^2+1^2) = sqrt(2) = about 1.4</p>
<p>It is very important that you understand this, because in many cases, it is more practical to present the amplitude and the phase of a frequency as a complex number.</p>
<p>When adding two sampled sounds together, you may actually wipe out some frequencies, those that had opposite phases and equal amplitudes. The average amplitude of the resulting sound is (for independent originals) sqrt(a^2+b^2) where a and b are the amplitudes of the original signals.</p>
<h2><a name="dspstuff_4">What's a filter?</a></h2>
<p>The main use of a filter is to scale the amplitudes of the frequency components in a sound. For example, a "lowpass filter" mutes all frequency components above the "cutoff frequency", in other words, multiplies the amplitudes by 0. It lets through all the frequencies below the cutoff frequency unattenuated.</p>
<h3>Magnitude</h3>
<p>If you investigate the behaviour of a lowpass filter by driving various sinewaves of different frequencies through it, and measure the amplifications, you get the "magnitude frequency response". Here's a plot of the magnitude frequency response curve of a lowpass filter:</p>

<p>Frequency is on the "-" axis and amplification on the "|" axis. As you see, the amplification (= scaling) of the frequencies below the cutoff frequency is 1. So, their amplitudes are not affected in any way. But the amplitudes of frequencies above the cutoff frequency get multiplied by zero so they vanish.</p>
<p>Filters never add any new frequency components to the sound. They can only scale the amplitudes of already existing frequencies. For example, if you have a completely quiet sample, you can't get any sound out of it by filtering. Also, if you have a sine wave sample and filter it, the result will still be the same sine wave, only maybe with different amplitude and phase - no other frequencies can appear.</p>
<h3>Phase</h3>
<p>Professionals never get tired of reminding us how important it is not to forget the phase. The frequency components in a sound have their amplitudes and... phases. If we take a sine wave and a cosine wave, we see that they look alike, but they have a phase difference of pi/2, one fourth of a full cycle. Also, when you play them, they sound alike. But, try wearing a headset and play the sinewave on the left channel and the cosine wave on the right channel. Now you hear the difference!</p>
<p>Phase itself doesn't contain important information for us so it's not heard, but the phase difference, of a frequency, between the two ears can be used in estimating the position of the origin of the sound so it's heard.</p>
<p>Filters have a magnitude frequency response, but they also have a phase frequency response. Here's an example curve that could be from a lowpass filter:</p>
<pre>              +pi-+-----------------------------------------------------+
                  |                    ___                              |
                  |      _________-----   \                             |

                  |                                                     |

                 0Hz                Cutoff frequency                   max</pre>

<p><em>NOTE TO OUR READERS: Journalist Hajo Schumacher, who conducted this interview, and former politician Silvana Koch-Mehrin have known each other for many years. It is on the basis of this mutual trust that Koch-Mehrin responded to the questions that many of our readers found to be impertinent and unsettling. We apologize for not having been clear about their rapport from the very beginning.</em></p>
</section>


<section>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Ms. Koch-Mehrin, you were diagnosed with breast cancer last fall. How are you doing today?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I'm doing well, thank you. I feel healthy. And the prognoses look good; it will likely stay that way.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What physical and psychological effects did your experience leave you with.</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> So much has changed that "leave" is the wrong word. Cancer diagnosis, mastectomy, chemo and radiation therapy: It is an existential experience. Very little is like it was before, both physically and psychologically. But it's not worse, just different.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Can you give us an example?</p>
</section>


<section>
<p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> The side effects I experienced from chemo included a runny and bloody nose, my eyes would tear up and I had to constantly clear my throat. Picking up and holding small things became difficult and I experienced a loss of feeling in my fingertips. My hair, eyebrows and eyelashes fell out. "Before," I took those things, and the ability to do things, for granted. Now, I see it as a gift.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Describe the moment when you received your diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I can precisely recall every detail - the vase on the table, the pictures and books on the shelf. I was in the United States for work and was sitting in a friend's office when my doctor called me: cancer. It was a shock because I felt so healthy. I thought it was just my normal annual checkup. Simply uttering the sentence "I have cancer" sounded to me like "I am dying." Still, even after the telephone call, I went to all of the meetings on my schedule. I was like a robot, which is probably a protective mechanism. The doctor's optimism helped me a great deal in getting over the shock. I can only urge all women, even if you're under 50, to please get screened regularly. The stage at which cancer is discovered makes a huge difference.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Is breast cancer more taboo than other varieties of cancer?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> When people learn from somebody that he or she has cancer, they often fall silent. They don't know what to say. And how should they? "You'll be fine" sounds rather desperate and doesn't help the person who is sick. We live in a society that suppresses things: We still ignore illness and death far too often. Because of that, many women remain silent about their breast cancer diagnosis. On the one hand, they do so because they themselves are shaken up, but also because they want to spare others from having to talk about something they simply can't talk about.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> You were long seen as a kind of superwoman during your political career with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), combining career and family, with never a hair out of place. You were also fond of playing that role. How has breast cancer changed your feeling of femininity?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> Do I hear the male perspective seeping through? Long hair on the head and no hair on the legs? Only a woman if you have breasts? That's nonsense. Take a look at the self-confident women at #goingflat or #onebreastpride. That is a kind of femininity that has nothing to do with conventions. I admire it.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> You haven't given an interview for nine years. Are you considering a return to politics?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> If I wanted to return to politics, I certainly wouldn't do so with an interview. My focus is elsewhere entirely. I decided to do this interview to address the silence surrounding cancer and to encourage openness in dealing with serious illnesses.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What did you find particularly helpful during the most difficult times?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I was overwhelmed by the readiness to help, the warmth and the empathy I experienced from family and friends, but also from people whom I hardly knew. My husband and brother shaved their hair off in solidarity. Particularly in moments of despondence, I found it encouraging to hear about how open other women were about their illness.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How great is the danger of remission?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> There isn't a single day when I don't think of cancer. The statistical improbability of remission is certainly reassuring, but every checkup sets me off on an emotional rollercoaster.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How did you tell your daughters about your diagnosis?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I was open and honest with them because I wanted them to continue trusting me.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What were the most difficult moments?</p>
</section>
<blockquote>

<p>"I wanted to be strong for my children."</p>

</blockquote>
<section>
<p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> The first and last chemotherapy sessions were extremely challenging. At the first one, I was so afraid of the side effects that I almost went crazy. By the last session, my mental strength was almost completely used up. I didn't want to do it anymore. I was only able to make it through because I wanted to be strong for my children.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What aspects of the experience did you underestimate?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> That it is a marathon. The treatment goes on for so long, it was almost nine months for me, and it is difficult. And afterwards, it still isn't over. A small example: fingernails take months to grow back normally. And I will be facing regular follow-up appointments for the next 10 years. Plus, some side effects are permanent.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What were the most important lessons you learned?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> For the first time in my life, I really became acquainted with fear. And I had to learn how to deal with it. It's easy for me to say, but it's not easy to do.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Whether you wanted to or not, you fulfilled the classic stereotypes of the blond during your political career. What was it like to be bald and have to wear a wig?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I missed these kinds of questions so much …</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> … it is my pleasure.</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> Promoting clichés is apparently still part of the standard repertoire of journalism. The virologist Sandra Ciesek is a token woman at the side of Christian Drosten, of course. In the Reykjavik Index, which measures the influence stereotypes have on opinions, Germany doesn't do particularly well. Such questions, which subconsciously strengthen prejudices, contribute to that.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Fine, but you were pretty good at the blond game. You knew very well that in a male-dominated party such as the FDP, you got a lot of attention and that you wouldn't have risen through the ranks so quickly if you had been a man. That is exactly why those who were envious of you abandoned you in 2011 and were happy to see you fall. Did your illness change any of your political positions?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> Everyone should have access to first-class health care, irrespective of how much money they have. COVID-19 has made us all realize how vulnerable we are.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> You sound like the Social Democratic health expert Karl Lauterbach.</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> Take a look at what (Free Democrat) Daniel Bahr proposed back when he was health minister: a legally mandated health-care system rooted in liberalism. It was an intelligent and affordable program that put the focus on the patient.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Do you miss the FDP?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> Some fellow party members became real friends of mine, and I've stayed in touch with a lot of them, even if most are no longer active in politics. I am still convinced that Germany needs a strong liberal party. But I am no longer engaged in party politics. Today, I work with and for women politicians around the world in a strictly non-partisan manner. I am head of Women Political Leaders, a foundation which aims at increasing both the number and the influence of women in politics.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Will you vote for the FDP in the general election next year?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I will always vote for a liberal party.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Many cancer patients look for reasons why they fell ill, whether it be stress or an unhealthy lifestyle. What explanation did you come up with?</p>

<p>"The most important thing is that the women in question feel good about the decision they make, and not whether others like it or not."</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> It is pretty much impossible to not search for potential causes. There have been huge advances in treatments and cures for breast cancer, but the "why" question has never been adequately answered. The pill is a blessing, because it provides women with self-determination. But I'm not the only one furious at the fact that even 50 years after the pill's introduction, hormones are the focus of contraception, even though the correlation with breast cancer is clear and proven. The focus must be more squarely on women's health.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The Reykjavik Global Forum, which is organized by your foundation every year, recognizes initiatives that are important for women. This year, the prize has been awarded to the pink ribbon, the symbol for the fight against breast cancer. Why?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> The pink ribbon, which was introduced exactly 30 years ago, is now a global symbol of the fight against breast cancer. Because women - and now also men – have joined together around the world for the fight, it has been a huge success story. Many women are now able to survive breast cancer because it has been possible to destigmatize the illness, collect donations, finance research and improve treatments. That is what we are recognizing. Prize recipients are the American Nancy Brinker, the first to use the pink ribbon back in the 1990s, and Vigdís Finnbogadóttir of Iceland, a breast cancer survivor and activist in addition to being the first female head of state in the world.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The Berlin-based music journalist Anja Caspary is extremely open about her double mastectomy, not shying away from wearing tight tops in public, which confuses some. What do you think about her confrontational strategy?</p><p><strong>Koch-Me…</strong></p></section></div></section></div></div>

            <h4>One week of NixOS</h4><p>
            Reading time: 4 minutes.
            </p><p>As you may have seen I on Mastodon, I am testing NixOS for over a week now and here is a few comments about how the distro works and what doesn’t work for me.</p>










<p>First, everything is NixOS is declared in a configuration file located at <code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> where you declare packages you want to install, services to start, udev rules, ECT, you get it.</p>
<p>This is the first very weird thing as you don’t really install packages with the CLI directly (even if you can), instead you modify the config file and rebuild the system with <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code>.</p>
<p>NixOS is made in such a way that everything aims to be reproducible. An example: if you want to get the exact same setup as I have, you can just take <a href="https://forge.tedomum.net/jae/nixos-configs">my configs repo</a>, clone it on your NixOS installation, run <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code> and voilà, you will have the exact same programs as me installed in the same way with the same version (roughly).</p>
<p>In this distro, adding a user is really easy and goes like this:</p>

There, we are installing per-user packages because yes, NixOS supports that, any user can have its own packages that others users can’t access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Correction from <em>hvdijk</em> on Hacker News, “<em>Other users can access those packages if they want to. Those packages won’t show up in other users' $PATH, so other users will not be affected by them, but they could see what’s in /nix/store if they wanted to. This matters when you’re thinking of putting private data (such as an encryption key) in a package: it’s vital that you don’t do that on a multi-user system.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Configuring NixOS for a daily use is at the end very easy (although I am getting some trouble to get Ledger Live working; which is the biggest problem I’ve had so far).</p>
<p>Now, let’s talk about where I got some trouble.
As you may know it, I am a dev and every day I need to compile, test, run and so on.
NixOS gave me some trouble to only run some programs from source such as <a href="https://element.io/">Element Desktop</a> or <a href="https://img.tedomum.net/">TeDomum IMG</a> as the way the system is built, lots of directories are read-only and programs can’t be installed globally through NPM or PIP.
I ended up using Docker to build the apps (even if it took a bit more time).</p>
<p>Needless to say, almost every other project worked.
If you want NodeJS to start a project for instance, you can just do <code>nix-shell -p nodejs</code> and here you go, a shell with nodejs installed, ready to do what you want.</p>
<p>At the end, NixOS brings very interesting concepts such as a really great reproducibility but new users can feel lost as its way to work is really different from conventional Linux distributions.
I’ll give NixOS more time and write a follow-up in some time to see how everything went.</p>
<p>If you want to give it a shot, the <a href="https://nixos.org/">official NixOS website awaits you</a>!</p>
<p>That’s all for today,
I’ll see you next time!

<h2>Going down the time machine rabbit hole…</h2>



<p>I love the fact that MacOS comes with TimeMachine built-in, and I also really appreciate its simplicity. It makes backups easy and accessible even for non-technical people. It gets messy though if you also want to have real offsite backups however.</p>



<p>TimeMachine works great with a USB external HD, but things get tricky over the network.</p>



<p>I own a small Synology NAS, and I managed to mount a TimeMachine volume and get it to backup to that volume. The problem started when the volume size started to grow. I could set a quota on the volume, but for some strange reason, when the quota is reached, TimeMachine just started failing without a clear reason. There’s no way to tell TimeMachine to only keep X versions, or keep disk storage below a certain threshold. It’s <em>supposed</em> to prune backups automatically, but seems to fail with my network volume.</p>



<h2>tmutil to the rescue</h2>



<p>After a bit of digging, I discovered a useful command-line utility that helps managing TimeMachine. <code>tmutil</code> lets you list your backups and also delete specific backups. I could manually easily prune the oldest backup of TimeMachine using <code>tmutil listbackups | head -1 | xargs -I {} sudo tmutil delete "{}"</code>.</p>



<p>How difficult could it be to automate this script so it runs regularly and keeps X copies?</p>



<h2>The script</h2>



<p>The script itself was pretty simple. Please don’t bash my bash skills, but I hope the code is clear and seems to do the job</p>


<pre title="">#!/bin/bash

# keeps backups for up to 7 days
KEEP=7

function timestamp() {
    date -jf '%F-%H%M%S' "$1" '+%s'
}

LAST_BACKUP=$(/usr/bin/tmutil listbackups | /usr/bin/tail -n1)
LAST_BACKUP_DATE=$(basename "$LAST_BACKUP")
LAST_TIMESTAMP=$(timestamp $LAST_BACKUP_DATE)

OLDEST_BACKUP=$(/usr/bin/tmutil listbackups | /usr/bin/head -n1)
OLDEST_BACKUP_DATE=$(basename "$OLDEST_BACKUP")
OLDEST_TIMESTAMP=$(timestamp $OLDEST_BACKUP_DATE)

DIFF=$(( ($LAST_TIMESTAMP - $OLDEST_TIMESTAMP) / (24*3600) ))

while [[ $DIFF &gt; $KEEP ]]; do
    echo "cleaning"
    sudo tmutil delete "$OLDEST_BACKUP"
    OLDEST_BACKUP=$(/usr/bin/tmutil listbackups | /usr/bin/head -n1)    
    OLDEST_BACKUP_DATE=$(basename "$OLDEST_BACKUP")
    OLDEST_TIMESTAMP=$(timestamp $OLDEST_BACKUP_DATE)
    DIFF=$(( ($LAST_TIMESTAMP - $OLDEST_TIMESTAMP) / (24*3600) ))
done
</pre>


<p>Easy-peasy, right? There were two problems left to solve:</p>



<ol><li>run this script on schedule, let’s say once a day or once a week</li><li>make sure we can run this as root, so we don’t need to use <code>sudo</code> (or avoid the password prompt if we do run sudo)</li></ol>



<h2>How difficult can it be?</h2>



<p>Running scheduled jobs on MacOS is quite a bit different from Linux. You could still somehow use a cron job, but it’s not recommended, might be deprecated, and generally not the “right way” to do things. You are supposed to create a <code>launchd</code> script… Ok, so without digging too deep, here’s a simple launchd file for running a command every 24 hours. You need to place this file under <code>~/Library/LaunchAgents/</code> and give it a name like <code>org.whatever.script-name.plist</code></p>


<pre title="">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;!-- The label should be the same as the filename without the extension --&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;org.whatever.script-name&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;!-- Specify how to run your program here --&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/path/to/code/timemachine-cleanup.sh&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;!-- Run every 24 hours --&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;integer&gt;86400&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;!-- seconds --&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</pre>


<p>Then you would need to run this command, so the launchd script gets scheduled</p>



<p><code>launchctl load org.whatever.script-name.plist</code></p>



<p>note: if you need to stop your script from running, you can use the same command, but with <code>unload</code> instead to unload it.</p>



<h2>First problem: Run as root</h2>



<p>The first problem is that this job now runs as your own user id. This is fixable if you move the file to the global /Library/LaunchAgents, make the owner of the file root and use sudo to load it.  It runs as root, but tmutil now fails. Why? because some tools/operations like tmutil require something called Full Disk Access (FDA). </p>



<h2>Second problem: Full Disk Access</h2>



<p>Here’s an interesting post explaining <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/02/15/why-privileged-commands-may-never-be-allowed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why some privileged commands are not allowed on MacOS</a>, and a few <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/338213/how-to-run-a-launchagent-that-runs-a-script-which-causes-failures-because-of-sys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problems/workarounds being suggested </a>on StackOverflow’s Ask Different.</p>



<p>You can get those commands to run from your terminal, if you add your terminal to the list of allowed apps with Full Disk Access</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="853" height="758" src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/CleanShot-2020-11-08-at-10.15.10.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/CleanShot-2020-11-08-at-10.15.10.png 853w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/CleanShot-2020-11-08-at-10.15.10-300x267.png 300w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/CleanShot-2020-11-08-at-10.15.10-768x682.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"></figure>



<p>The problem however, is that for some strange reason, you cannot simply add your script to the list. Or you could add it, but it will still be blocked. I have no clue why.</p>



<h2>Workaround: wrap your script as an app</h2>



<p>You could use Automator.app or Script Editor to do that. You can then add this wrapper app to give it Full Disk Access permissions. That works, but then there’s no way to make it run as root. So we’re back to the first problem again… :-/</p>



<h2>Workaround #2: sudoers with NOPASSWD</h2>



<p>So we won’t run it as root, but use sudo. Then we’re prompted for a password, which we tried to avoid for a scheduled job.</p>



<p>We can however add any specific command to be allowed to run with sudo without a password. We’ll run <code>sudo visudo</code> and then edit the file to add this line:</p>



<p><code>myuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tmutil</code></p>



<p>If you want to be even more secure, you can include the sha256 hash of tmutil. First get the hash by running <code>sha256sum /usr/bin/tmutil</code> and then adding this sha to your sudoers file. Mine looks like this</p>



<p><code>myuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: sha256:57a753bd2bef425205684630a676765913e1adca7ec0a9d73c205e4da32488c6 /usr/bin/tmutil</code></p>



<h2>Alternatives to app wrapper</h2>



<p>One thing I noticed with the wrapper app is that when it launches, it’s visible on my desktop. It could even grab my input for a moment, which is slightly annoying. It also felt weird to have a whole app just to wrap a script to give it Full Disk Access.</p>



<p>One alternative mentioned on the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/338213/how-to-run-a-launchagent-that-runs-a-script-which-causes-failures-because-of-sys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">linked StackOverflow page</a> above is to compile a binary app to wrap your shell script. I didn’t try it, since I am not using any compiled languages regularly.</p>



<p>Another thing I did try and will probably end up using is launching the script via the terminal. How? I already have passwordless (public key) SSH remote login access set up on my Mac. So I simply modified the launchd script slightly so it launches my script via ssh</p>


<pre title="">&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;ssh&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;myuser@myhost.local&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/path/to/code/timemachine-cleanup.sh&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
</pre>


<p>Since terminal is already set with FDA, this seems to work :)</p>



<p>It’s a bit of an awkward workaround to ssh to your own host with your own user in order to run a script, but it’s not that much different from compiling a binary to wrap your script, or wrapping it in an “app”.</p>



<h2>Why TimeMachine?</h2>



<p>I guess some people might rightfully question why I’m using TimeMachine and not a more flexible backup tool for Mac. I did consider it and tested a couple of options like CarbonCopyCloner and others. As far as I could tell, none of the commercial backup tools can create a full machine image on a remote network storage like TimeMachine does. If you know of something that does this, please let me know!</p>



<p>… and for those backup freaks out there: No. the Synology volume isn’t my only backup copy. I then also run restic to clone the TimeMachine volume to Backblaze B2 for offsite safekeeping.</p>

<section>
    
    <article>
        <p>I've been writing on this blog for about 2 years now. This has been the longest I've stuck on to the same <em>technology stack</em> for my blog. I've previously jumped from a Jekyll based static site to a Medium blog before finally settling for <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>I've been using Hugo since 2018 but I don't recall as to <em>why</em> I went ahead with it. Maybe it was increasingly popular at that time and everyone touted Hugo as <em>the</em> solution to Static Site Generator (referred to as SSG from here on). There are 1000s of SSGs and at least a dozen of websites which lists all the SSGs out there. This is crazy by any standards. Hugo started as a generic blog generator but over the years it has become a <em>website generator</em>. It's no longer aimed at people who just want to have a small little static website/blog but supports all the use cases for people building full-fledged static websites. IMHO these two goals are overarching however this has resulted in a simple project to become incredibly complex over time.</p>
<h3 id="tipping-point">Tipping Point</h3>
<p>Anyway, so I wanted to change the look of the homepage on my website so I decided to look at Hugo's documentation. Hugo's documentation is great for someone who knows what exactly are they looking for. The documentation is so huge that you simply cannot grok it in one evening. I had zero ideas on how to customise the damn homepage of my blog and after spending hours buried in the documentation I was able to kind of figure the solution but it was unintuitive, to say the least. Apparently, to override any template from the theme, you have to mirror the directory structure of the theme in your root directory. Which meant, I needed to look at the source code of the theme, figure out the project structure, copy-paste all the folder names and put my override of <code>index.html</code> there. Which, BTW <strong>magically</strong> overrides it. This whole magic thing is BS and I am being strongly opinionated here.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to do something in Hugo. Different theme authors use different styles, which makes the whole thing even more complex. It also means for my customisations to work across themes, well you guessed it right: <strong>it's impossible</strong>.</p>
<p>Recently I discovered that I was unable to preview my Hugo website locally without internet because I had a Twitter <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#tweet">shortcode</a> in one of my blog post (which makes an API call to Twitter to render a nice card preview). The site completely failed to render instead of just logging a warning. Bollocks.</p>
<p>The tipping point for me, however, was when the theme I was using stopped working with the latest version of Hugo at that point. So, picture this -- You make dozens of custom changes and then one update just <em>breaks</em> your website. Now not only you have to fix your shit but the theme you were using, you've to make upstream changes to the theme or maintain your own fork. And no, this is not a one-off experience. Hugo upgrades are a joke, they are known to break very very often.</p>
<p>I was done at this point. I didn't want to deal with this BS of continuously fighting the generator for my blog.</p>
<h3 id="a-fresh-change">A fresh change</h3>
<p>Being a practitioner of <a href="https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">Yak Shaving</a>, I discussed the idea of a "tinyhugo" with <a href="https://nadh.in/">Kailash</a> and <a href="https://www.saratchandra.in/">Sarat</a>. We'd arrived at a spec and I started writing some code to pander to my NIH syndrome.</p>
<p>However, I was still not convinced that a simpler solution doesn't exist. I spent countless hours exploring other alternatives. I'd used <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a>, <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> before finally stumbling upon <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> from HN/Lobster discussions. I've got to say, the landing page gave a <em>fresh</em> feeling - one that I've not seen with any other alternatives. In fact quite opposite to the Eleventy landing page which looks like an over-engineered piece of software to generate websites (Not hating on it, there might be use cases for it, but the JS tooling and dependency system is something that I would not want to touch with a 10ft pole).</p>
<p>Zola's primary appeal to me was that like Hugo it's extremely fast and comes as a single binary no dependency package. I looked at the docs the first impression was they are concise enough to get a basic idea. Zola is strongly opinionated, even to the extent of dictating a project structure and sometimes filenames too. I actually preferred this over the <em>magic</em> Hugo does. In less than 2 hours I was able to port the home page of my blog (and tweak it to my liking) in Zola. I decided to abandon my own <code>tinyhugo</code> attempt because for the very fact Zola fits my needs very well.</p>
<p>The thing that I really loved about Zola is how it enforces a separation between <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/">Section</a> and <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/">Pages</a>. The section represents a "collection" of posts. So a <em>blog</em> can be a section, and I can have another section called "Book Reviews". I could easily tell Zola where to look for the templates by specifying the same in <code>content/book_reviews/_index.md</code>. I don't have to read Hugo docs or do <em>Google-fu</em> to figure this out, it's right there in the docs and very apparent.</p>
<p>For the record, I still don't know how to customise different templates for different sections in Hugo, but I couldn't care less.</p>
<h3 id="migration">Migration</h3>
<p>The migration was pretty straightforward -- I had to copy the <code>content folder</code>s of my blog (which are just a bunch of <code>.md</code> fikes) and replace <code>YAML</code> frontmatter to <code>TOML</code>. There were a few variable changes that I needed to do manually but since they were a manageable 20-25 posts, I did it by hand. I could potentially automate but then rabbit deep in the rabbit hole of Yak Shaving. The good part was that I was able to retain the same URL structure for my new blog because the URL scheme was based on the file paths.</p>
<p>I spent some time porting <a href="https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink">hugo-ink</a> to Zola and did minor CSS tweaks to it. Zola uses the Terra language for templating and it's much more pleasing to eyes than the Go Template syntax. Zola comes with pretty neat features like Search, RSS/Atom Feeds, Syntax Highlighting and SASS-&gt;CSS Processors.</p>
<p>What took me time however was to figure out how to get <code>opengraph</code> tags in each page. Hugo provides nifty <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/opengraph.html">template</a> for this use case but Zola is pretty barebones like that. People who care a lot about SEO need to spend some extra efforts here.</p>
<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>Zola is still a pretty new kid on the block but the author shares the same frustration about Hugo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it personally drives me insane, to the point of writing my own template engine and static site generator. Yes, this is a bit biased. -- <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola#-explanations">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also reflects in the issues/PRs I've seen for Zola and the author is opinionated about not adding features which would make Zola complicated. Overall I am very happy with the switch and it was long due. I feel more confident in tweaking certain sections of my website. I plan to open-source the current theme in the next few days.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://git.mrkaran.dev/karan/website">Source Code</a> of this website if you'd like to explore how this website is built.</p>
<p>Fin!</p>

<![CDATA[Parsing the Infamous Japanese Postal CSV]]>
            </title>

November 7, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/posuto.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/posuto.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last year I released <a href="https://github.com/polm/posuto">posuto</a>, a package presenting Japanese postal code
data in an easy-to-use format. It's based on <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/kogaki-zip.html">data released by Japan
Post</a>, which is infamous for being widely used but hard to parse.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/806ae69c/postcharacter.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/806ae69c/img/postcharacter.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>This adorable character by <a href="https://www.irasutoya.com/2019/08/blog-post_590.html">Irasutoya</a> is cute, but the raw postal CSV data is not.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>I first became aware of the postal data when I entered my postal code in an
online form and it auto-completed my address as "XXX-borough (except the
following buildings)". I had no idea what that parenthetical was referring to,
so I looked for a common source of postal data, found the CSV, and found the
issue.  It turns out the CSV file contains parenthetical notes for anyone
reading the CSV file and makes reference to the order of the rows.</p>
<p>This causes problems. The data is mainly useful one row at a time, where the
parenthetical is meaningless. Since CSV is a field-delimited format, there's
also no need for parentheticals - you could just add a note field.</p>
<p>This is only one of many issues with <code>ken_all.csv</code>. You can find people
complaining about it regularly <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ken_all.csv&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">on Twitter</a>, and there was
even briefly <a href="http://ken-all.hatenadiary.com/">a blog</a> just collecting posts from all over the web
about it. A <a href="https://twitter.com/bulkneets/status/1259457777862184966">particularly amusing tweet</a> describes people who expect
computers to bend to the will of humans being punished in Hell by having to
parse <code>ken_all.csv</code> forever.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/readme.html">README</a> for the file explains that lines with overly long fields will be
broken up into multiple lines. Specifically, if the neighborhood name is over
38 characters, or if the half-width katakana (<em>half-width katakana</em>)
pronunciation field is over 76 characters, the line will be split into two
lines. The overly-long neighborhood field will be continued and all other
fields will be duplicated. This is an abbreviated sample of what that looks
like:</p>
<pre><code>12345,Tokyo,Minato,This place name is really
12345,Tokyo,Minato,very long it didn't fit in
12345,Tokyo,Minato,a single line so we had to 
12345,Tokyo,Minato,split it
</code></pre>
<p>The motivation for this is not explained. Maybe there was a fixed-width buffer
for storing a line somewhere thirty years ago. I used to process CSV and other
files from hundreds of different providers at an old job and I saw many
horrors, but I've never seen this particular formatting choice anywhere else.
It should also be noted that while the length limits are as stated, the
location where line breaks are inserted in long lines appears random, occurring
neither at the character limit nor at normal word boundaries.</p>
<p>It's worth noting not all the issues with the CSV are inherently technical;
postal codes are always complicated. The postal code with the most rows in the
CSV - a stunning 66 - is 〒452-0961, which refers to the <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%98%A5%E6%97%A5%E7%94%BA_(%E6%84%9B%E7%9F%A5%E7%9C%8C)">Haruhi region</a> of
Kiyosu City in Aichi Prefecture. This has that many lines because every
neighborhood gets a separate line. (This particular case may be related to Haruhi
having been the smallest town by area in Japan from 2006 until 2009, when it
was incorporated into Kiyosu City.)</p>
<p>In contrast, the longest <em>continued</em> line, using the line break rules above, is
the entry for 〒602-8368 or 〒602-8374, both with eight lines. These are both in
one of a few areas in Kyoto that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system#Kyoto">a unique, bizarre system of
intersection-based addressing</a>. The entry looks a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code>12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"North Town (Up Lower Godsroad from"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"the West, Down Turtle Street from the"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"East, Up Old Temple Road from the"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"West)"
</code></pre>
<p>I have used quoted fields here, but the actual CSV doesn't quote fields and
instead uses a different kind of comma.</p>
<p>There are other issues. There are catch-all postal codes for many areas, where
the neighborhood is given as "except the following", and the only thing to do
is look for that exact string and exclude it. There's a variety of similar
strings, and it's hard to be sure I've caught them all.</p>
<p>An example of another comment is 一円. Normally this would mean "one yen", but
it also means "the area surrounding", and is a note in the CSV that should be
removed from neighborhood names, <em>except</em> for exactly one neighborhood in Shiga where
that's actually the name (〒522-0317).</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/roman.html">separate romaji file</a> offered by JP Post. It's updated
less frequently than the main files, is often out of sync, and the provided
romaji are extremely low quality. For the moment I'm still providing the data
in posuto in the name of consistency, but honestly you should just use
<a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/cutlet-python-romaji-converter.html">cutlet</a>. To give an example of bad romaji:</p>
<pre><code>大手町 JAビル
OTEMACHI JIEIEIBIRU
</code></pre>
<p>What's happening here is that "JA" is being converted to the phonetic reading
in Japanese, "ジェイエイ". Then ジェ, which is written "large ji small e" but
pronounced "je", is being converted to "jie" by treating the small character as
though it were large, and the other characters are translated as-is, turning
something already in the latin alphabet into alphabet soup. For contrast,
cutlet has no problem converting "JAビル" into "JA building" (case handling
admittedly needs some work still). Similar issues turn "Roppongi Hills" into
"Roppongihiruzu", and "Sweden Hills" into "Suedenhiruzu".</p>
<p>Anyway, dealing with the file was a humbling lesson in the amount of complexity
it's possible to pack into one place. I've glossed over many details, but you
can find them covered in posuto's README.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/polm/posuto">posuto</a> as a library, or if you're not using Python, just
download the pre-processed JSON and make use of that. If you find a good use
for it I'd be delighted to hear about it.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you need a Win3.1 or DOS program to copy the data onto an IBM H
floppy disk, just check the bottom of <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/kogaki-zip.html">JP Post's page</a> - they've
got you covered. Ψ</p>

The only real latecomers were the web view components, no big deal for me here.</p><h3 id="before">Before</h3><h4 id="javascript">JavaScript</h4><pre><code><span>const </span><span>navbar </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.querySelector(</span><span>'.navbar'</span><span>);

             but determines at which point it sticks */
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3><p>The workaround with <span>JS</span> is no more. Yay!</p><p>Also notice how little code is actually needed now? Two CSS properties and the job is done.</p><hr><h2 id="service-workers">Service Workers</h2><p>Also in 2018 I played with <a href="https://markentier.tech/posts/2018/04/progressive-web-app/">Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</a>. The whole blog was one. A few days ago I teared down all of it. At the core of PWAs sit <a href="https://serviceworke.rs/">Service Workers (SW)</a>, though you can use SW also without building an app. And that's what I was aiming for, but in the end my home-grown dynamic cache solution was more annoying to me than helpful for anyone else. Every time I updated anything here, I had to wait and/or force refresh to see the result. I'm sure some people probably see visual inconsistencies due to a still running service worker in their browser. If you do, try to force clear all data for this website.</p><p>Long story short: if you do not build a web <strong>app</strong>, you most likely do not need service workers. So yet another thing down from the <span>JS</span> list.</p><p>No <em>before/after</em> comparison here, but several precious kilobytes of JavaScript shaved off by removing them.</p><hr><h2 id="sqip-svg-lqip">SQIP (SVG LQIP)</h2><p><em>Woa, what are all these random acronyms here?</em> Don't worry, the simple answer is:</p><p>If you have images and they are not very small in file size, you maybe want to provide a temporary placeholder with very low resolution and quality. This is pretty useful for slow internet connections; living here in Germany I know how difficult this situation can be. That thing called internet is still very Neuland to us. 🤦</p><p>Anyway, <code>SQIP</code> can be translated with »<code>SVG</code>-based <code>LQIP</code>.«</p><p><code>SVG</code> are Scalable Vector Graphics, an image format I really love a lot, my logo is done with it (<a href="https://markentier.tech/posts/2018/05/minimalism-focus-clean-redesign/">I wrote about it a while ago</a>).</p><p>LQIP finally stands for <em>»Low Quality Image Placeholders«</em> and is based on an algorithm to find primitive shapes to describe the source image. Basically try to find only a few triangles, rectangles, circles, ellipsis, and other low poly shapes. It is also an art form in its own, you can enjoy some <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive#static-animation">nice examples there</a>. The advantage of SVG is that it is made to encode such figures in very few characters of human readable text, so a less complex image for a placeholder can be written in one kilobyte or less.</p><p>Compared to the original high resolution image which can easily weigh half a megabyte and more this is great. You can reserve the space in your page and very early in the loading process display some visual hint that there will be a proper picture soon. Especially for types which do not support progessive loading (as JPEG can) using SQIP/LQIP placeholders makes a lot of sense.</p><p>In this scenario at first it was not really about saving frontend <span>JS</span>, more about saving it on the backend site and replacing it with something else. Unfortunately in between some code creeped into the frontend anyway.</p><p>But what happened that this beautiful technique fell out of favor with me?</p><h3 id="picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></h3><p>Enter another interesting HTML tag combo: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></a> with <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>.</p><p>So one reason to use small low quality placeholders is because before such tags became a thing we solely relied on a single <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and some trickery with CSS (and sometimes aided by sprinkles of JavaScript). I tried to avoid <span>JS</span> completely, but of course I had to use some styling hacks eventually.</p><p>The essence of it was some style attached to the image in question:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>img </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"highres-and-heavy.png"
     </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>background-size</span><span>: </span><span>cover</span><span>;
            </span><span>background-image</span><span>: </span><span>url</span><span>(</span><span>'data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2…'</span><span>);</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Usually in some post processing all style attributes were collected
     into a &lt;style&gt; tag or CSS file. --&gt;
</span></code></pre><p>The JavaScript entered this scenery at one point: after I used images with transparency. Sadly with this background image workaround you would've seen the low quality placeholder through the transparent parts, and this was extremly ugly to be honest. I could not stand it and deployed some snippet to trigger a background removal once the actual image was loaded:</p><pre><code><span>// remove the background image styling, so transparent images won't have
// strange SQIP artefacts shining through
</span><span>document</span><span>.querySelectorAll(
  </span><span>"img[loading=lazy][class]:not(.thumbnail):not(.loaded)"
</span><span>).forEach((</span><span>img</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
  </span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>onload </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>_event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>img.className </span><span>= </span><span>"loaded"</span><span>;
});
</span><span>document</span><span>.querySelectorAll(
  </span><span>"img[loading=lazy].thumbnail:not(.loaded)"
</span><span>).forEach((</span><span>img</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
  </span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>onload </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>_event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>img.className </span><span>= </span><span>"thumbnail loaded"</span><span>;
});
</span></code></pre><p>Theoretically it would have been tolerable, but I noticed some strange behaviour once I started wrapping my images into <code>picture</code> tags.</p><p>Let's <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">shave the yak</a> a bit further to understand why.</p><h4 id="webp-and-avif">WEBP and AVIF</h4><p><em>Come on, more acronyms?</em> I'm sorry, the web is a place with a lot of them.</p><p>All you need to know for now is that both of them are pretty modern image formats with quite good (lossy) compression rates while keeping a respectable quality. <a href="https://caniuse.com/webp"><code>WEBP</code></a> has been around for some time and most of the browsers do support it. <a href="https://caniuse.com/avif"><code>AVIF</code></a> is extremly new and right now only Chrome since version 85 and Opera 71 can display them. Firefox has a configuration flag, maybe they will enable it by default pretty soon.</p><p>So the current situation is that I have my original image (PNG or JPEG in most cases), a WEBP version, an AVIF version, and the SQIP placeholder. How do I deal with it? Back to our <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> tag:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>picture</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>source </span><span>srcset</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.avif" </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/avif"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>source </span><span>srcset</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.webp" </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/webp"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>img </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.png"
       </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/* SQIP data: see example above */</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>picture</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><p>You can also use source sets for different view sizes based on media queries, but in my case I'm mainly concerned about supporting different image formats. My idea is to prioritize the formats with the smallest file size first, and given the compression ratios the order is usually: AVIF, WEBP, PNG/JPG. Not in every case will this be true; WEBP does not always have better savings then a decently compressed JPEG for example. AVIF has not disappointed so far, but sadly a part of my visitors will not see the effect yet.</p><p>What did not really happen anymore was a display of the placeholder before the final image was loaded. I experimented for quite some time until I realized that I do not want to spent more energy any further.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.png" alt="Size comparison of an example image; PNG original (22 KB), WEBP (14 KB, 37% saved), AVIF (7.3 KB, 67% saved)" width="1024" height="120" loading="lazy"></picture></p><p>I made a <em>risk-return tradeoff</em> compromise and got rid of SQIP altogether. For the growing number of AVIF support the images are sometimes significantly smaller which makes it acceptable to allow for some display delay anyway.</p><p>In the following screenshot the JPEG was the source photo. The PNG was created for some transparency stuff; of course, for photos this format does not really make a lot of sense in general. Sadly also WEBP fails to compete in this scenario. That's why I have to make this picture group generation a bit smarter soon to reorder based on the actual file …</p></div></div>

<p>Recently I’ve got into the idea of building a personal platform for myself. By that I mean a system which makes it easy to distribute new things I’m working on and a way to grow the group of people who could be interested in what I’m working on.</p>



<h2>How I’m going about building a platform</h2>



<ol><li>Leveraging what I already have<ol><li>I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjRhOxof_h24gemf8If3Klw?view_as=subscriber">YouTube channel</a> with a following</li><li>I have a network from my personal and professional life</li></ol></li><li>More content<ol><li>This blog</li><li>“Computer Security: Attacking and defending web apps” course on Udemy (because my most successful content on YouTube is about Cyber Security and I’ve had a lot of demand for making a video on how to write shell code)</li><li><a href="https://scenario95.com/">Scenario95</a></li></ol></li><li>Creating a pipeline which I use for all new content<ol><li>Send an email to followers of my platform</li><li>Sharing on several platforms including: Facebook, HackerNews, Reddit, Twitter, and LinkedIn</li></ol></li></ol>



<h2>Why I’m doing this?</h2>



<p>When coming up with new ideas I’ve noticed that I often base them around what I already have access to and natural advantages I’ve got. For example when on a course topic for Udemy, I referred to the YouTube video which I released 4 years ago… and I’ve realised that since finishing university I haven’t done a good job of continuing to create things like this.</p>







<p>This is something I’m new to and and still learning the ropes so if you’ve got any advice please leave it in the comments below. </p>



<p>If you want to follow my adventure then subscribe to my platform! </p>

                    <p>I had a problem. I wanted public documentation with open collaboration, but I couldn't afford most of the products out there. As a startup we need to keep lean, and adding a paid documentation/knowledge base service is an expense I don't want to have to try to recover.</p><p>So we're moving all of our product documentation into public Github repositories, as it's the cheapest option with it being free 😉</p><p>The first repository is here, for our Signata MFA product: <a href="https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs">https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs</a></p><h3 id="why-github">Why Github?</h3><p>As much as I find it frustrating to write documentation in markdown (writing is easy, dealing with screenshots is clunky), the benefits of having a publicly accessible repository for documentation far outweighs my frustration.</p><p>I want to make sure documentation isn't sitting behind paywalls or needing a sign up. In fact, forcing people to sign up to read it has created a ton of accounts in our system that don't actually get used, which is an inconvenience for both parties.</p><p>The best part of putting it into Github is now there's the ability to collaborate - if you find a problem, or ambiguous statement, or you want something added, you can now directly interact with the content to submit pull requests or open issues.</p><p>We've also put a link to the documentation onto the Signata MFA website in a few places, which you'll also notice has undergone some rebranding:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/11/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image.png 600w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image.png 1000w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/11/image.png 1458w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It's actually quite expensive to run an online knowledgebase in most instances. <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a> would've been the ideal choice, but it's only free for open source projects, and at this stage we don't yet have plans to open source our products. I could've spun up a self-hosted service like Dokuwiki, but that would be an additional $10/month of operating costs, as well as the administrative overhead for keeping it up to date.</p><p>An alternative we thought about was to use publicly accessible Google Docs, but they lose the ability to be indexed by search engines for people to actually find these guides. There's not much use to public documentation if it's not actually discoverable by the public.</p><h3 id="signata-mfa-presentation">Signata MFA Presentation</h3><p>I've also thrown a presentation that we put together about Signata MFA into the repository as well. <a href="https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs/blob/main/signata-mfa-overview-presentation.pdf">You can find it here</a> - it'll give you a quick overview of the product, it's capabilities, it's pricing, and how to get in contact with us.</p><p>Have you looked at Signata MFA? <a href="https://mfa.signata.net/">You can check it out by clicking here</a>. You can try it for free for a month, no credit card required.</p>

<p>In 1790, the gap between the smallest and largest states was about 10x. Today, the most populous state, California, is about 70x more populous than the least populous state, Wyoming. A resident of California, New York, Florida, or Texas has no effective impact on the Senate impact, and a resident of a smaller state Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, the Dakotas, Delaware, Rhode Island, or Maine has a disproportionate impact on the Senate.</p>
<p>While the Electoral College favors smaller states as well, it is still mostly driven by membership in the House of Representatives, which is proportionate to population. That’s unfair—the popular vote loser became president in 2000 and 2016— but it’s far less unfair than the even-more-undemocratic Senate.</p>
<p><strong>The Senate has become the defining slow-motion crisis of American democracy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The US Senate could be the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/senate-washington-dc-puerto-rico-statehood-filibuster-obama-biden-racist.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">most structurally racist institution</a>.</strong> In the 1960s, Black people from the South <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3162/036298006X201869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">migrated to populous Northern states</a>, eroding their political representation in the Senate. Similarly, recent decades have seen <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3162/036298006X201869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">growing Latinx populations in urban areas</a>, primarily located in populous states. As a result, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/opinion/dc-puerto-rico-statehood-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">David Leonhardt found</a> that whites have 0.35 Senators per million people, Blacks have 0.26, Asian-Americans 0.25, and Latinos just 0.19.</li>
<li><strong>Partisanship and rule changes have caused the problem to boil over.</strong> According to <a href="https://govtrackinsider.com/the-senate-has-never-been-as-un-democratic-as-it-was-in-2017-2018-and-minority-rule-could-801e1046af28" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a 2018 analysis</a>, the Senate has never been as undemocratic as it was in 2017-2018. According to this analysis, “in 2017, for the first time, the Senate’s decisions were often made by a coalition of states representing less than half of the country’s population. The median share of senators supporting passed bills, confirmed judges and agency leaders, and other matters dropped to 58% (the lowest since 1930), with those senators representing just 49.5% of the U.S. population (the lowest ever)!”</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time for us to revisit the Connecticut Compromise, the Devil’s Bargain that allowed for the adoption of the Constitution at the expense of a democratic Senate.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-role-of-the-senate"><a href="#whats-the-role-of-the-senate" aria-label="whats the role of the senate permalink"></a>What’s the Role of the Senate?</h2>
<p>The Senate is a smaller, more deliberative body than the House of Representatives. You have to be 30 years old to run for the Senate, and in 1790, you would have had an average life expectancy of about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2885717/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">45 years</a>. Indeed, “Senator” comes from the Latin word “senex,” which means “senior” or “old man.”</p>
<p>Senators run on staggered 6-year terms, not the 2-year term of the House. That means that their terms exceed presidential terms and—unlike representatives—they don’t have to run in every election. While there are 435 representatives in the House, there are only 100 senators. Unlike members of the House, Senate representatives were meant to be appointed by the state legislatures, a process that changed after the 17th amendment in 1913. This meant that the Senate was meant to be a kind of U.N.-but-with-teeth for 13 (and now 50) coequal sovereigns.</p>
<p>These features—insulation from short-term political pressure and a more selective and deliberative group of representatives—are unrelated to the two-per-state design of the US Senate, and don’t benefit from it.</p>
<h2 id="the-connecticut-compromise-was-pragmatic-but-not-wise"><a href="#the-connecticut-compromise-was-pragmatic-but-not-wise" aria-label="the connecticut compromise was pragmatic but not wise permalink"></a>The Connecticut Compromise was Pragmatic, but Not Wise</h2>
<p>Some people defend the Connecticut Compromise as an enduring legacy of founder wisdom. But the Connecticut Compromise wasn’t meant to be wise, it was meant to be pragmatic. </p>
<p>Seven weeks into the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the founders were at an impasse.</p>
<p>Many large states felt that representation should be proportional to population in Congress. As larger states would be contributing more to the treasury and defense, they felt that should have more say.</p>
<p>Smaller states like Delaware and Rhode Island—and representatives from certain larger but slower-growing states like New York (except for Alexander Hamilton, of course)—weren’t having it, and had leverage. These states enjoyed authority and autonomy under the Articles of Confederation. Proportionate representation—plus anticipation of a rapidly growing South and West—would erode their political power.</p>
<p>Connecticut delegates Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, with the support of Benjamin Franklin, struck a compromise: a bicameral (two-chambered) legislature, with one chamber, the House of Representatives, allocating seats in proportion to population, and the other chamber, the Senate, allocated evenly by state. Benjamin Franklin proposed that the House originate all revenue matters.</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton hated it. Writing in Federalist 22:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its operation contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government, which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail. Sophistry may reply, that sovereigns are equal, and that a majority of the votes of the States will be a majority of confederated America. But this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain suggestions of justice and common-sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madison, in Federalist 62, didn’t want to defend it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision to allocate Senate seats was a compromise needed to ratify the Constitution and satisfice an existing power structure—nothing more.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-the-hardest-thing-to-change-about-the-constitution"><a href="#this-is-the-hardest-thing-to-change-about-the-constitution" aria-label="this is the hardest thing to change about the constitution permalink"></a>This is the Hardest Thing to Change about the Constitution</h2>
<p>One possible mechanism of reform is amending the Constitution. Suppose you wanted to change the Senate to allocate seats in proportion to population. Not so fast—Article V of the Constitution writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution,</strong> or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; <strong>and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article V articulates a state right—equal suffrage in the Senate—that cannot be deprived through the Constitutional change process. Put differently: you can change anything in the Constitution (after 1808) through amendments or a convention, but you cannot change this aspect of the Connecticut Compromise.</p>
<p>In practice, even Justice Scalia <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/the-weirdest-sentence-in-the-u-s-constitution" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">once remarked</a> that he didn’t see how the Supreme Court could declare a properly proposed and ratified Constitutional amendment unconstitutional. It is unclear how a future Supreme Court might view a dispute around this kind of Constitutional amendment, although any well-written amendment would begin by changing Article V.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this speed bump, passing constitutional amendments requires the consent of 3/4 of the states, meaning that the 12 least populous states could block any Senate reform amendment.</p>

<p>An improvement to the representation problem has the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is legal. In this sense, legal means that it would survive a challenge in the Supreme Court in which the justices were approved by a partisan Senate.</li>
<li>It preserves the “deliberative” aspects of the Senate.</li>
<li>It reduces population inequality in the Senate.</li>
<li>It is politically tractable.</li>
</ul>
<p>A better solution to this problem has these additional properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>New statehood, or reorganized statehood, is incentive-compatible. That means that citizens of prospective new states (Puerto Rico, for instance) should have the opportunity to form a state and be admitted to the Senate without disproportionately diluting power.</li>
<li>Senate proportionality is robust to population shifts. If Wyoming became a booming population center, then Wyoming should have more Senate representation.</li>
<li>It decreases wasted votes and reduces the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">efficiency gap</a>.

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Especially after COVID-19 began plaguing the planet, QR codes have been a big part of our daily lives. In this day and age, it’s quite impossible for one to have never seen a QR code, or used one. Even before the pandemic, QR codes had been around us for a while, but many of us — having grown up in the Digital Age — simply accept new technology into our lives without wondering too much about how they work. For most of us, QR codes just look like... square pixelated versions of the alien heptapod symbols in Arrival (2016), that somehow, magically (and really quickly) bring us to a different screen when we scan them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So what are these cryptic codes? Are they magic? Clearly they’re not, but how do they work? Before we take you in for the ride, let’s get the basics down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QR stands for <em>Quick Response</em>, and a QR code is pretty much a barcode (which has been around since the 1950s) except two-dimensional. Because it’s 2D, it can contain more data than a barcode. It can encode over 7000 characters, which is a vast improvement from the standard barcode with a limited capacity of about 20 alphanumeric characters.</p>
<h2>How did they come about?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In Japan circa 1990s, Denso Wave Incorporated was contacted by manufacturing sites and asked if it was possible to come up with a faster barcode scanning system. This presented a problem as barcodes had a limited capacity, which made the scanning process time consuming for workers no matter how efficient the scanner was. To tackle this, Denso Wave began developing a compact code that can contain more data, including Kanji and Kana characters. The launch of the QR code was later announced in 1994.</p>
<h2>What are they used for?</h2>
<p>The QR code was first used by the auto industry to track parts and products shipped around the globe. Then, gradually, other industries all over the world began joining in. Today, QR codes are used by nearly every physical and digital establishment for quick check-ins, displaying geolocation or contact info, redirecting customers to their websites, etc.</p>
<h2>How do they work?</h2>
<p>Grasping how a QR code works would require understanding the functions of its different parts. With the help of the labelled diagram, we hope to make this palatable for the layman. Let’s break it down.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=715&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png" alt="QR Structure, modules, separators, alignment, timing, format info, version, labels, black and white" width="715" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=358&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 358w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=715&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 715w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1073&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1073w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1430&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1430w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1788&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1788w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=2145&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 2145w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px"></p>

<p>The tiny squares in a QR code are called <em><strong>modules</strong></em> - black squares would be considered foreground modules, and white ones would be background modules. They don’t always have to be black and white, though, they could be in color too. Most QR codes are in black and white only so decoder softwares easily distinguish the contrast between the background and foreground. If you want your QR code to be colorful, you just have to make sure that the contrast is retained when it is in grayscale / black and white.</p>
<p>The bigger the code, the more rows and columns of modules it will contain. Yup, just like humankind, QR codes come in different shapes, sizes and colors (although there are standards to follow).</p>
<p>There are 40 preset sizes (or, <em><strong>versions</strong></em>) to choose from. Version 1 being the smallest type with 21 rows and 21 columns, and Version 40 being the largest with 177 rows and 177 columns. When a generator produces a code for you, it will determine the suitable QR code version number for you depending on the amount of data you are encoding.</p>
<p>The 3 big squares on 3 corners of the QR code are <em><strong>finder patterns</strong></em>, which help your device camera determine the boundaries of the code and its correct orientation. This is so if the code is rotated, or upside-down, decoders would still be able to read it. These finder patterns are surrounded by a single-module spacing called <em><strong>separators</strong></em> which help decoders separate the finder patterns from the code data.</p>
<p>Connecting each finder pattern are <em><strong>timing patterns</strong></em> that alternate between black and white. These lines tell your decoder software how big the data cells are within the code.</p>
<p>The smaller square (that is distinctively not a finder pattern) on the fourth corner is an <em><strong>alignment pattern</strong></em> that helps the decoder prevent image distortions. Level 1 QR codes (the smallest size of QR codes) do not contain alignment patterns. The bigger the code, however, the more alignment patterns are added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 15 bits beside the separators are <em><strong>format and version strings</strong></em> which contain information on the code’s error correction level and the chosen mask pattern for the particular code. Hold on… information on the what and what?</p>
<p><em><strong>Error correction</strong></em> code makes sure that the code is still readable if up to 30% of the code is corrupt. Designers or generators of a code can decide how many levels of error correction they want to include in the code. The higher the level of error correction, the higher percentage of corruption a decoder can read past. However, the higher the level of error correction, the more space it takes up on the QR code, leaving less space for data. In other words, the more space the error correction code takes up, the lower the max numerical characters a QR code can fit. How much error correction a QR code needs probably will depend on where it will be displayed. E.g. A QR code on a paper flyer would need higher error correction than one on a laminated poster placed indoors, and a digital QR code could do with none because it is unlikely to be damaged.</p>
<p>The code is also overlaid by a <em><strong>mask pattern</strong></em>, inverting and retaining certain data areas to “mix it up” / conceal it. Decoder softwares detect the mask type from the format information and demask the QR code before reading the rest of the data. Of course this happens in a matter of milliseconds.</p>
<p><em><strong>Encoded characters </strong></em>- The black and white modules read in a fixed zigzaggy direction (as shown in the image), starting from the bottom right corner, gives the decoder a sequence of data bits that goes something like 001010111…&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Different binary sequences represent different codewords, which include symbols, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, etc. For example, the binary sequence 01110111 represents the letter ‘w’, 00100001 represents the exclamation point ‘!’, and 00100000 represents a space.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you make a QR code?</strong></h2>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Mi8ate-UiC0ZpKEoRFn8EUpe5bZDS5O6ggTSK96wPR1OTHx_zoKu_dbS5NvJDpPRsDAt9qdHXkQdfo1sm8Jun4Id0dpS3JjSnmOO51mXv6NT1ql7rb5P0DJc01k-kuw9RYw5vMF2" alt="QR code, generated QR code, snappymob website" width="297"></span></p>
<p>Here’s a QR code generated with <a href="http://www.qr-code-generator.com/"><span>www.qr-code-generator.com</span></a>. Do the patterns make a lot more sense to you now? If you can’t answer in confidence, that’s okay. You’re not going to have to make one by hand, ever. (Unless you want to.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are plenty of offline and online QR code generators free for use. All you have to do is key in what you want to encode in the QR code, be it a link to a coupon redemption page, a YouTube video, your social media sites, your contact details, or simply a website homepage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most free QR code generators, though, require you to sign up or subscribe to a plan to gain access to more design options and features, such as error correction levels and insights tracking.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How can QR codes help you?</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you own a business or simply have a web page to share, a QR code could help people reach you easily and quickly. In case you were looking for ideas, here are some of the ways in which using a QR code could greatly benefit you:</p>
<h4><strong>Webpages and Location</strong></h4>
<p>Your customers can get to your website, social media platforms, or map location in a matter of seconds. They don’t have to manually type your website URL, usernames, or addresses into their browsers or maps. They simply need to whip out their phones and scan the QR code to be redirected to you.</p>
<h4><strong>Payment</strong></h4>
<p>Payment is also made easy with QR codes. Most stores enable QR codes for quick payment via e-wallets so customers don’t have to fumble through their wallets for cash and keep others waiting. Some good examples would be GrabPay or ShopeePay, which are enabled at many on and offline merchants in Malaysia.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=648&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg" alt="grabpay, shopeepay, qr code, merchant, scan to pay, app" width="648" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=324&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 324w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=648&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 648w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=972&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 972w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1296&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1296w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1620&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1620w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1944&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"><br>(Image Source: help.shopee.com.my, grab.com)</p>
<h4><strong>Email and Direct Messaging</strong></h4>
<p>You can embed URL links that lead straight to a ‘compose email’ or ‘compose direct message’ page (for instance, <a href="mailto:hello@snappymob.com">mailto:hello@snappymob.com</a>) into your QR code. For email, this saves your customers up to 10 seconds because it helps them skip the process of opening their email app, tapping on compose email, and typing your email address manually into the recipient bar. For social media, this saves them the effort of opening the app, typing your username into the search bar, and tapping on the message button. This might literally be “a matter of seconds” which seems small, but it keeps people who are interested in your services or products, well, interested. Making things quicker and easier for your patrons is always a good move.</p></span></p><p><label>app insights</label></p>

<p>Often times, when you want to compare two videos side-by-side or you want to create an effect during post-processing, you might want to stack videos together. It can get expensive if you end up buying a tool to do this, but, guess what? </p>



<p><strong>FFmpeg offers a variety of tools to help stack videos together – horizontally, vertically, or in a grid fashion. In this tutorial, let’s learn about FFmpeg’s <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters for stacking videos. </strong></p>



<hr data-amp-original-style="height:50px">




<h2><span id="How_to_Stack_Videos_Horizontally_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>How to Stack Videos Horizontally using FFmpeg?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Horizontally stacking videos” refers to placing videos side-by-side (one on the left and the other on the right). </p>



<p>Before you do this, there are a couple of points that you need to consider. </p>



<ol><li>The videos that you want to stack need to have the same height. </li><li> The videos need to have the same pixel format. </li></ol>



<p>The command line is shown below where we try and stack two <code>mp4</code> videos. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex hstack=inputs=2 horizontal-stacked-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The <code>hstack</code> filter has a simple format. You need to specify the number of inputs and it parses that from the beginning portion of the commandline. The order of stacking follows the order of inputs. </p>



<p>Here is a screenshot of what it looks like. </p>



<figure><amp-img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4FwbqByqDpDpOGTNvpSWSOh6RVE9yzesrQyAyGvaOF1ZjVsycKOlQUjrTmdJRFJWblHjC9gF6zMds0s5w2Yy2w6CVXXme-H-zF8nYoJ496khN0aHXHaWbnwEe41BYmu6c2mdoQb8" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" width="1600" height="423" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4FwbqByqDpDpOGTNvpSWSOh6RVE9yzesrQyAyGvaOF1ZjVsycKOlQUjrTmdJRFJWblHjC9gF6zMds0s5w2Yy2w6CVXXme-H-zF8nYoJ496khN0aHXHaWbnwEe41BYmu6c2mdoQb8" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" width="1600" height="423" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzQyMycgd2lkdGg9JzE2MDAnIHhtbG5zPSdodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZycgdmVyc2lvbj0nMS4xJy8+"></amp-img></figure>



<p>And, here is a video! </p>











<p>Here is another use case. Companies or teams working on video compression often like to compare videos side-by-side in the lab or showcase their work in conferences. FFmpeg’s horizontal stacking is an easy way to do this and achieve a very good result. </p>



<p>Below are two videos encoded at different video quality settings and stacked horizontally. Comparison made simple, right? <em>(note: Vimeo’s choise of bitrate might mess with the comparison, but, when done offline (downloaded), the <code>hstack</code> filter makes comparisons easy!)</em></p>







<hr data-amp-original-style="height:50px">



<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_Vertically_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>Stacking Videos Vertically using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Vertically stacked videos” results in placing videos one below the other. Unlike in horizontal stacking, inputs need to be having the same width. The command is as shown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For vertical stacking, we need to use the <code>vstack</code> filter whose syntax is similar to the <code>hstack</code> filter we used in the previous horizontal stacking example.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex vstack=inputs=2 vertical-stack-output.mp4</code></pre>



<figure><amp-img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qtyxioWFR54pqwZhX7jgX6HkSG7gCw840GdK78HGHHP7X3sv3fr3Pou9hOMFu2O-e6O7nmCith3U6CM1SpDanhwmIFIBzZUQyaG4T0BJaF9QCdMIPrmMmH0qc9WTK5f-5Nf4-92y" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" width="1248" height="1400" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qtyxioWFR54pqwZhX7jgX6HkSG7gCw840GdK78HGHHP7X3sv3fr3Pou9hOMFu2O-e6O7nmCith3U6CM1SpDanhwmIFIBzZUQyaG4T0BJaF9QCdMIPrmMmH0qc9WTK5f-5Nf4-92y" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" width="1248" height="1400" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzE0MDAnIHdpZHRoPScxMjQ4JyB4bWxucz0naHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmcnIHZlcnNpb249JzEuMScvPg=="></amp-img></figure>



<p>Both functions pretty much use the same commands with a simple distinction, the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#hstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>hstack</code></a> and the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#vstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>vstack</code></a> under the <code>-filter_complex</code> argument.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a video of stacking two videos vertically using FFmpeg. </p>







<hr data-amp-original-style="height:50px">



<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths"></span><strong>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Well, there’s a really nifty ability for both of these to prioritize the length of the shortest video. And as luck would have it the parameter is named <code>shortest</code>, and it’s applicable to both the horizontal and vertical stacking filters. Using <code>shortest=1</code> ensures the shortest length is used. </p>



<p>For example – </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -filter_complex hstack=inputs=2:shortest=1 shortest-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>As a <b>side note</b>, if you run into an error that claims frames are being duplicated, the easiest workaround is to slip the <code>vsync 2</code> parameter into your command, and it worked like a charm.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_Without_the_shortest_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths Without the <code>shortest</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>To test what happens in this situation, let’s stack two videos vertically – a 10 second clip and an 18 second clip. You’ll see that the shorter clip just stops after it completes, but the output video continues till the longest of the input clips complete.  </p>















<p>If you want to truncate the clips to the length of the shortest clip, then you need to use the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter. Let’s look at that in the next section.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_With_the_shortest=1_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths With the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>In this example, we use the <code>shortest=1</code> command-line parameter and as you can see, the length of the final video is truncated to the length of the shortest of the inputs. </p>







<hr data-amp-original-style="height:50px">



<h2><span id="2%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong><strong>2×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong></strong><span></span></h2>



<p>We can achieve a 2×2 grid of videos using a combination of the <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. Let’s start by looking at the command-line and then break it down. It’s actually pretty simple! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]; \
[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]; \
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p>What’s happening here?</p>



<ul><li>firstly, you need to provide 4 input videos with the same height and width</li><li>next, you stack the first two videos horizontally and call it “top” i.e. <code>[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]</code></li><li>then, you you stack the next two videos horizontally and call it “bottom” i.e. <code>[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]</code></li><li>then, you stack <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> vertically to create a 2×2 grid. — <code>[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]</code></li><li>then using the <code>map</code> command, we can extract and push the video track to the output container. </li></ul>



<p>Here is what the video looks like. </p>







<hr data-amp-original-style="height:50px">



<h2><span id="3%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>3×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Along the same lines, here is a 3×2 grid of videos using <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 \
-i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-i input4.mp4 -i input5.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v][2:v]hstack=inputs=3[top];\
[3:v][4:v][5:v]hstack=inputs=3[bottom];\
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>







<hr data-amp-original-style="height:50px">



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>That’s it folks. Now you know how to stack videos together horizontally, vertically, and in a grid. This is very useful in comparing videos and also creating fun effects along the way! </p>

<p>“Amazing”, “Beautiful”, “Incredible”, “Unreal”, “Brought tears to my eyes”.</p>



<p>These are all comments that repeatedly appeared in response to a viral Facebook video of a drone light show that <a href="https://verge.aero/">Verge Aero</a> flew to show gratitude for healthcare and essential workers in Philadelphia. The response was overwhelming, and these words demonstrate that when properly executed, drone light shows are a mesmerizing and powerful experience. Since then, we’ve received many questions about our technology, and we’d like to share our responses with a wider audience.</p>



<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/415494003" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<h2><strong>What is a drone light show, exactly?</strong></h2>



<p>Drone light shows are performed by illuminated, synchronized, and choreographed groups of drones that arrange themselves into various aerial formations. Almost any image can be recreated in the sky by a computer program that turns graphics into flight commands and communicates them to the drones.</p>



<p>In recent years, drone shows have migrated from the university laboratory to being deployed at scale on prominent events around the world. We were originally inspired by this 2012 <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/vijay_kumar_robots_that_fly_and_cooperate">TED video</a> featuring the University of Pennsylvania’s Dean of Engineering, Vijay Kumar, demonstrating drone fleets doing all kinds of stunning maneuvers. Later, pioneering work was done in Europe by the <a href="https://www.spaxels.at/">Spaxels Research Initiative</a>, <a href="https://collmot.com/">Collmot</a>, and <a href="http://www.veritystudios.com/">Verity</a>.<a href="https://www.intel.com/"> Intel</a> has done the most to popularize the concept, flying drone shows on big events such as the Super Bowl halftime show and the Winter Olympics.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="562" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_xIWK_MTjYpP_xFAK9zP8gg.jpeg" alt="Philadelphia Drone Light Show LOVE" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_xIWK_MTjYpP_xFAK9zP8gg.jpeg 1000w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_xIWK_MTjYpP_xFAK9zP8gg-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_xIWK_MTjYpP_xFAK9zP8gg-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption>First Responders filming LOVE during Philadelphia Drone Light Show</figcaption></figure>



<h2><strong>How do drone shows work?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s clear up one thing first: drone light shows are <strong>not </strong>powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28Terminator%29">Skynet</a>, the artificial intelligence network depicted in <em>The Terminator</em>! Drones used in shows are not self-aware, can’t think for themselves, and make no real-time decisions. Instead, like obedient servants, they follow specific commands sent to them and can’t deviate!</p>



<p>The process for creating a show is quite straightforward. First, the design team creates a storyboard timeline showing the desired images and effects. These looks are then animated in a specialized piece of software that translates them into synchronized flight paths for each drone, and usually a soundtrack is created to accompany the show. Complete shows are sent to the drones via radio signal from a ground control station operated by a pilot. When the pilot is satisfied that everything is safe and ready to go, the show starts, and the drones take off to draw the storyboard in the sky.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="638" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2.jpg" alt="verge aero flying a drone light show in Mazatlan for Carnaval de Mazatlan" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2.jpg 960w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"><figcaption>Verge Aero flies a show in Mazatlan for Carnaval 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Creating a system that can be flown safely and repeatedly requires a lot of clever engineering work. Verge Aero’s drones and software were designed by our engineers specifically for performing shows. Our custom drones are missing some things normally found on drones, like cameras, and include unique features, such as a blindingly bright LED light source.</p>



<p>Verge Aero’s design software lets users select graphics and special effects and place them in a timeline, similar to those found in video editing software. This software calculates the flight paths of each drone to guarantee they don’t collide in the air, and generates a full 3D rendering of the show to ensure it looks exactly as intended. Every drone is sent a unique program and the ground control station monitors each drone over a local, encrypted network for maximum safety.</p>



<p>The flight crew uses a detailed dashboard display on the ground station to prepare drones for flight and continuously monitor status. The drones themselves carry multiple radios operating simultaneously, away from busy WiFi frequencies, to ensure communications are maintained even in busy and noisy radio environments.</p>



<p>Shows are flown by certified pilots, experts in relevant aviation subject matter, including regulations and weather. Prior to every show, checklists are used to make sure everything is in order: drones are fully operational, batteries are charged, and the flight area is clear. Once these checks are complete, the pilot presses <strong>GO</strong> and the drones take off on their mission!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2700" height="1800" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-2700x1800.jpg" alt="guitar drone light show at Festival Internacional del Globo" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-2700x1800.jpg 2700w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-300x200.jpg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-768x512.jpg 768w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2700px) 100vw, 2700px"><figcaption>Guitar in drone light show at Festival Internacional del Globo</figcaption></figure>



<h2><strong>Will drones replace fireworks?</strong></h2>



<p>Fireworks shows are increasingly criticized for their negative environmental impact—they are noisy, polluting, and wasteful. Concerns are regularly raised around their impact on sensitive wildlife populations, as well as military veterans experiencing PTSD. What’s more, in many locations, fireworks displays have been banned altogether, due to the increased risk of wildfires.</p>



<p>These and other factors have led many people to consider replacing fireworks displays with alternatives—and drone light shows are perfectly positioned to fill the gap.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ.jpeg" alt="Philadelphia Drone Light Show Stethoscope" width="286" height="391" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ.jpeg 1000w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ-220x300.jpeg 220w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ-768x1049.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px"><figcaption>Verge Aero flies a stethoscope for frontline workers at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In many cases, drone shows have been used successfully as a great complement to fireworks displays. However, as a new and exciting form of entertainment, drones have much more to offer. They are capable of a far greater range of effects than fireworks, and their capacity for sophisticated choreography gives them vastly more potential for storytelling in the sky. Drones can also be deployed in more constrained environments where fireworks would never be allowed.</p>



<p>When you think about it, fireworks actually have quite a limited repertoire. Usually, a handful of effects are repeated over and over again, just in varying combinations, sizes, colors and intensities. Why settle for this when you can have dynamic, repositionable 3D pixels capable of generating virtually unlimited imagery? Drones offer far more creative options than fireworks. In fact, it’s easy to envision that as drone shows become more commonplace, people will one day look back on fireworks displays as being quite mundane in comparison.</p>



<p>Regardless, the transition from fireworks to drones will happen gradually. Fireworks shows will be with us for some time to come, if for no other reason than that they are fairly inexpensive to stage. But as drone shows become more affordable, we can expect to see events using them more frequently.</p>



<h2><strong>Why haven’t I seen more shows?</strong></h2>



<p>Even Wal-Mart now sells drones, so why aren’t we seeing more light shows? The problem is that successful show execution requires different technologies that are only now maturing. Innovations usually take time to disseminate, and drone shows are no different. A number of factors have limited the uptake of drone shows before now:</p>



<ul><li>High cost</li><li>Need for regulatory approval</li><li>Expensive and limited insurance options</li><li>Labor intensive operations</li><li>Lack of efficient show design tools</li><li>Safety requirements</li></ul>



<p>The use of specialized drones with high-precision avionics drives high cost. Labor intensive operations also contribute, whether it’s wrangling rudimentary control software or preparing finicky drones for flight.</p>



<p>High operating expenses are possibly acceptable for the Super Bowl or the Olympics, but are not viable for most events. Nonetheless, things are changing, and Verge Aero’s innovations are helping to make drone light shows more accessible to a far wider range of budgets.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1400" height="399" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA.jpeg" alt="Verge Aero X1 drones ready for flight" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA.jpeg 1400w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA-300x86.jpeg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA-768x219.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"><figcaption>Verge Aero X1 drones ready for flight</figcaption></figure>



<h2><strong>How much do drone light shows cost?</strong></h2>



<p>Like many new technologies, drone light shows were extremely expensive at first, and they’re still more expensive than desired. But as with computers and flat panel TVs, prices are decreasing over time. Drone light shows will go mainstream as the technology matures. The tools developed by Verge Aero already make it possible to do more for less!</p>



<p>The main driver of cost is the number of drones being flown. It clearly costs a lot more to put on a 500-drone show than a 50-drone show. In addition to the drones themselves, labor, freight, and logistics all add expense.</p>



<p>A small show that’s easy to deploy costs as little as $20,000. But larger and more complicated shows can easily cost many times this number. Here’s a list of factors that impact price:</p>



<ul><li>Drone quantity</li><li>Show design complexity</li><li>Show coordination and rehearsal time</li><li>Airspace authorization and regulatory compliance</li><li>Shipping and logistics</li><li>Crew travel and accommodation</li></ul>



<h2><strong>What is Verge Aero doing differently?</strong></h2>



<p>To make drone shows more affordable, we introduced a few innovations to streamline the process and reduce the amount of work required.</p>

<h3>Simplified Show Design</h3>



<p>Historically, drone light shows were manually created using a series of applications including animation software like<a href="https://www.blender.org/"> Blender</a>—which was an extremely tedious and limiting process. Even worse, the programmer had to check that vertices in Blender <strong>never </strong>overlapped during animation, because that would mean drones colliding in the air. The output then needed to be transferred to at least one more program to prepare for flight. All this is an extremely unsafe process because it’s prone to human error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A far better way is to use a unified software application with an easy-to-use interface, like the Verge Aero Design Studio, which automatically handles the anti-collision calculations. Cues are created in the built-in animation software and easily manipulated. Once the design process is complete, the software removes the possibility of human error by deconflicting flight paths, identifying potential issues or mistakes in the show design, and simulating the performance via a rendering pipeline—all without any human intervention.</p>



<p>This software allows designers to generate content with a few key presses, instead of through the laborious processes of using animation tools or writing code. Effects such as complex flocking, as seen in this<a href="https://youtu.be/7DQ4covPEyE"> All of Us music video by PNAU</a>, are automatically created by an effects generator in the Verge Aero Design Studio. Effects created by one designer can easily be …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The debate on the impact telework has on employee productivity &amp; morale is one that has slowly aged with the improvement of technology, but never so important to discuss than in the current global pandemic state the world is faced with.</p><p>For decades the working class has enjoyed, and even thrived in the conventional 9-to-5 office workday with very little contention. In fact, most of the well-known productivity techniques are centered around the premise that employees can only maximize team cohesion &amp; communication when working in a controlled work environment like the office.</p><p>But with the rise of the digital age and need to travel, the world has started to realize the value and need for remote work and set in place internal measures to promote alternative work methods that benefit the workforce.<br>
&nbsp;</p><h2>Reimagining the 9-to-5 workday could improve productivity</h2><p>The contemporary 9-to-5, eight-hour workday was imagined by American labor unions in the 1800s and normalized by Henry Ford in the 1920s. Most employees today simply accept this narrative because it’s what they have gotten so acquainted with. But despite the growing popularity in the demand for remote and flexible work, the need for a change in work culture has been met with much skepticism from managers. A recent study conducted by Remote Workplace Study explores the prime obstacles to implementing a flexible workplace policy:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Company’s long-standing resistance to change &nbsp;</li><li>Privacy</li><li>Lack of understanding about the benefits of remote work</li><li>Fear of how it will impact the overall company culture</li><li>Technology requirements</li><li>Data security</li></ul><p>Understandably, managers have reservations about changing traditional work culture. Most concerns center around losing control of assessing team cohesiveness and potential reduction in employee productivity &amp; focus. But despite this, change is inevitable. In fact, most studies confirm an increase in productivity, working “smarter” and willingness to work over-time when employees are given the flexibility to choose when and how to work.&nbsp;</p><h2>Millennials are driving the demand for flexible and remote work&nbsp;</h2><p>As of today, millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) account for almost 50% of the global workforce and are expected to grow to 75% by 2025. This means that the need for companies to adopt flexible and remote work policies is more compelling today than ever before in order to attract and retain a younger, skilled workforce.&nbsp;</p><h2>There are equal benefits to jumping on the remote-work bandwagon for both companies and employees:</h2><p>There are equal benefits to jumping on the remote-work bandwagon for both companies and employees:</p><h3>For Companies</h3><ul><li>Cost savings (office &amp; overhead costs)</li><li>Increase in productivity</li><li>Employee retention &amp; reduced turnover</li><li>Profitability (companies save avg. $11, 000 &nbsp;per part-time telecommuter)</li><li>Environmental benefits (less commuting to work reduces carbon footprint)</li><li>Improved inclusivity and diversity (easier reach and accessibility to skilled talent from different demographics, races, and people with disabilities from all over the world)</li></ul><h3>For Employees</h3><ul><li>Improved work-life balance</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>No commute (time and cost savings)</li><li>Location independence (work from home/travel while working)</li><li>More time to spend with family</li><li>Expense savings (transportation, gas, &amp; freedom &nbsp;to live in low-cost cities) &nbsp;</li></ul><h2>The world’s largest firms have endorsed remote working policies in the wake of Covid19</h2><p>It’s no secret that the novel Coronavirus pandemic has played an integral role in the sudden surge of remote work policies implemented across companies worldwide. Big corporations such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, Amazon, &amp; Microsoft have adopted such changes with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey announcing that his employees can work remotely indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“... the work-from-home revolution is shaping the future of the workplace.”</p></blockquote><p>Improved inclusivity and diversity (easier reach and accessibility to skilled talent from different demographics, races, and people with disabilities from all over the world)</p><p>In closing, albeit reservations from conservative and outdated work practices, the future of the work environment is remote and flexible work. In the age of the internet, connecting with skilled professionals has become easier and accessible. Thanks to online professional platforms like remoteworkers.net, companies have access to a wider pool of highly experienced talent and job-seekers can find their ideal remote jobs. Companies would be wise to evolve with the growth in remote work trends in order to become more competitive &amp; improve productivity.</p><h2>Looking for a remote job?</h2><p>Thanks to the internet, connecting skilled professionals with remote-friendly companies has never been easier.

<p>In his 2014 <em>Safety I and Safety II: The past and future of safety management</em>, Erik Hollnagel makes the argument that we should not (just) try to stop things from going wrong. Instead, we need to understand why most things go right, and then ensure that as much as possible indeed goes right. It seems so obvious. Yet it is light years away from how most organizations ‘do’ safety today, with their focus on low numbers of lagging indicators, incidents and injuries.</p>
<p>That said, many organizations have now begun to recognize the severe organizational deficiencies, cultural problems and ethical headaches that lag indicators create for them. Most will be familiar with the following sorts of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers games and the hiding or renaming of injuries and incidents;</li>
<li>Counterproductive and credibility-straining sloganeering (‘Zero Harm!’);</li>
<li>Short-termism (driven by quarterly figures);</li>
<li>Creative case management and a lack of compassion for those who do get hurt in the course of work (think of the cynical use of ‘suitable duties’ to keep someone off the injury stats or lost time books);</li>
<li>The misdirection of accountability through sanctioning, dismissal or exclusion of those who have been hurt in the past (just cancel the contractor’s access card, for instance);</li>
<li>The statistical insignificance of any change in typical lagging indicators (‘We went from 3 lost time injuries last year to 1 this year! And we worked a total of 5 million person-hours!’ …<em>Uhmm, right</em>);</li>
<li>Organizational learning disabilities and cultures of risk secrecy;</li>
<li>Worker cynicism, mistrust and disenchantment;</li>
<li>Cases of outright management fraud that have got managers dismissed or even in jail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Erik’s insight is the hinge on which the transition to Safety Differently turns. Let’s not stare ourselves silly at the lowest possible injury and incident numbers, with the ridiculous and counterproductive Siren Song of ‘Zero Harm’ (See Sheratt &amp; Dainty, 2017, for how ‘Zero’ is linked to more fatalities and serious injuries)as the ultimate paradise we want to reach. Deming said it long before anybody in the Resilience community said it: get rid of targets, slogans and exhortations. They get in the way of allowing your people to produce quality work (Deming, 1982). So instead, let’s learn why things go right and find out what we can do to make it even more so. Safety is not about the <em>absence&nbsp;</em>of negatives; it is about the <em>presence&nbsp;</em>of capacities. The field of Resilience Engineering, formally founded at a meeting in Söderköping in Sweden over a decade ago (Dekker, 2006)was of course driven by this logic. I witnessed Erik and others forcefully making this very point, from many different angles, for a week in a room full of peers and stakeholders.</p>
<p>One way to illustrate this point, as Erik indeed does (and others now do as well) is by way of a Gaussian, or normal curve. The curve shows that the number of the things that go wrong (the left side of the curve) is tiny. On the right side of the curve are the heroic, unexpected surprises (a Hudson River landing, for instance) that fall far outside what people would normally experience or have to deal with. In between, the huge bulbous middle of the figure, sits the quotidian or daily creation of success. This is where good outcomes are made, despite the organizational, operational and financial obstacles, despite the rules, the bureaucracy, the common frustrations and obstacles. This is where work can be hard, but is still successful. The way to make even further progress on safety, suggests this figure, is not by trying to make the red part of things that go wrong even smaller, but by understanding what accounts for the big middle part where things go right. And then enhancing the capacities that make it so. That way, we don’t make the red part smaller by making the red part smaller. We make the red part smaller by making the white part bigger. Research by René Amalberti tells us that it is indeed likely that this is <em>the&nbsp;</em>way to make progress on safety in already safe systems (Amalberti, 2001, 2006, 2013). In those systems, we have milked the recipes for how to prevent things from going wrong to the maximum already. We have many layers of protection in place. We have rules to the point of overregulation. We monitor, record, investigate and standardize the designs people work with. Ever more things targeted at the red part are not going to make it any smaller. The complexity of the system won’t let us. And in fact, the more we do to make that part smaller with what we already know (more rules, more limits on people, more technology and barriers) may in fact contribute to novel pathways to breakdown, accidents and failures (Dekker, 2011).</p>

We make the red part smaller by making the white part bigger: focusing on why things go right and enhancing the capacities that make it so. Figure by Kelvin Genn.</p></div>
<p><em>Shifting the paradigm</em></p>
<p>The question that most organizations yearn to have answered, though, is this: what is going to take the place of their long-held and easily communicated total recordable injury frequency rate? As Thomas Kuhn (1970)pointed out, people are unwilling to relinquish a paradigm—despite all its faults—if there is no plausible, viable alternative to take its place.</p>
<p>A few years back, I was working, together with some students, with a large health authority which employed some 25,000 people. The patient safety statistics were dire, if typical: one in thirteen of the patients who walked (or were carried) through the doors to receive care were hurt in the process of receiving that care. 1 in 13, or 7%. These numbers weren’t unique, of course. They were also problematic. Because what exactly is ‘nosocomial harm,’ harm that originates in a hospital? What is ‘medical error’ and when is it putatively responsible for the adverse event that happened to the patient? Indeed, when exactly does the patient become that ‘one’ out of thirteen? These are important (and huge) epistemological and ontological questions. I have vociferously commented on them before (and I didn’t exactly make friends in the field, for example by claiming how safe gun owners are in comparison to doctors) (Dekker, 2007).</p>
<p>But it’s not the point here. When we asked the health authority what they typically found in the one case that went wrong—the one that turned into an ‘adverse event,’ the one that inflicted harm on the patient—here is what they came up with. After all, they had plenty of data to go on: one out of thirteen in a large healthcare system can add up to a sizable number of patients per day. So in the patterns that all this data yielded, they consistently found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workarounds</li>
<li>Shortcuts</li>
<li>Violations</li>
<li>Guidelines not followed</li>
<li>Errors and miscalculations</li>
<li>Unfindable people or medical instruments</li>
<li>Unreliable measurements</li>
<li>User-unfriendly technologies</li>
<li>Organizational frustrations</li>
<li>Supervisory shortcomings</li>
</ul>
<p>It seemed a pretty intuitive and straightforward list. It was also a list that firmly belonged to a particular era in our evolving understanding of safety: that of the person as the weakest link, of the ‘human factor’ as a set of mental and moral deficiencies that only great systems and stringent supervision can meaningfully guard against. In that sort of logic, we’ve got great systems and solid procedures—it’s just those people who are unreliable or non-compliant:</p>
<ul>
<li>People are the problem to control</li>
<li>We need to find out what people did wrong</li>
<li>We write or enforce more rules</li>
<li>We tell everyone to try harder</li>
<li>We get rid of bad apples</li>
</ul>
<p>Many organizational strategies, to the extent that you can call them that, were indeed organized around these very premises. Poster campaigns that reminded people of particular risks they needed to be aware of, for instance. Or strict surveillance and compliance monitoring with respect to certain ‘zero-tolerance’ or ‘red-rule’ activities (e.g. hand hygiene, drug administration protocols). Or a ‘just culture’ process that got those lower on the medical competence hierarchy more frequently ‘just-cultured’ (code for suspended, demoted, dismissed, fired) than those with more power in the system. Or some miserably measly attention to supervisor leadership training.</p>
<p>We were of course interested to know the extent to which these investments in reducing the ‘one in thirteen’ had paid off. They hadn’t. The health authority was still stuck at one in thirteen.</p>
<p><em>What would Erik do?</em></p>
<p>This is when we asked the Erik Hollnagel question. We asked: “What about the other twelve? Do you even know why they go right? Have you ever asked yourself that question?” The answer we got was “no.” All the resources that the health authority had were directed toward investigating and understanding the ones that went wrong. There was organizational, reputational and political pressure to do so, for sure. And the resources to investigate the instances of harm were too meager to begin with. So this is all they could do. We then offered to do it for them. And so, in an acutely unscientific but highly opportunistic way, we spent time in the hospitals of the authority to find out what happened when things went well, when there was no evidence of adverse events or patient harm.</p>
<p>When we got back together after a period of weeks, we compared notes. At first we couldn’t believe it, thinking that what we had found was just a fluke, an irregular and rare irritant in data that should otherwise have been telling us something quite different. But it turned out that everybody had found that in the twelve cases that go right, that don’t result in an adverse event or patient harm, there were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workarounds</li>
<li>Shortcuts</li>
<li>Violations</li>
<li>Guidelines not followed</li>
<li>Errors and miscalculations</li>
<li>Unfindable people or medical instruments</li>
<li>Unreliable measurements</li>
<li>User-unfriendly technologies</li>
<li>Organizational frustrations</li>
<li>Supervisory …</li></ul></div></div>
