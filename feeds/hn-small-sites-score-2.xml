<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a
language unlike most others. It’s not functional <em>or</em> object oriented, it doesn’t
have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>



<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>

<pre><code>123 456 +
</code></pre>



<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>

<pre><code>5 2 + 10 *
</code></pre>



<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 dup
</code></pre>



<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 drop
</code></pre>

<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 swap
</code></pre>

<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 over
</code></pre>

<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 rot
</code></pre>

<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>

<pre><code>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . .
</code></pre>



<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="section"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 = .
5 5 = .
</code></pre>

<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; .
3 4 &gt; .
</code></pre>

<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using …</p></section></div>

<p><em>Guest post originally published on <a href="https://elastisys.com/top-5-cloud-to-cloud-migration-woes-and-how-to-solve-them/">Elastisys’s blog</a> by Lars Larsson, Senior Cloud Architect and Branch Manager</em> at <em>Elastisys</em></p>



<p>All companies that use cloud services do so for a reason. But those reasons may change. Whether motivated by the need for a multi-cloud strategy, expenditure minimization, legislative or regulatory demands, or simply to get closer to end users, many organizations find themselves migrating from one cloud to another. Cloud-to-cloud migration for a non-trivial application contains a lot of unknown unknowns. This causes stress and uncertainty for a CTO. To help shed some light based on years of experience in the field, we have asked senior cloud architect Lars Larsson at Elastisys, to list some of these issues.</p>



<h2>Executive summary</h2>



<ul><li>Cloud providers offer a wide range of services, each with their own associated costs. Make sure to fully understand the situation as you make your calculations.</li><li>Providers tend to lock in customers via well-integrated services. These may make migration more difficult.</li><li>Make clear inventory of features and functionality your application requires of a managed service. These may or may not match what other cloud providers offer.</li><li>Also make an inventory of the tools and services supporting your organizational processes.</li><li>Take all these inventories into account to calculate your total cost of ownership for any cloud-to-cloud migration.</li><li>Use cloud native technologies to decouple your application and organization from the services offered by a particular cloud provider. This makes migration easier in the future.</li></ul>



<h2>1. Pricing models vary wildly</h2>



<p>Most companies have been hit by that one cloud bill that surprised them. Some services or features wound up costing far more than originally anticipated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you considering a cloud-to-cloud migration to reduce operational costs? If so, please take a long and hard look at the various costs in each of the clouds. Because each service has a different cost model, making it very difficult to compare accurately. You really need to get to the bottom of it.</p>



<p>Compute and storage costs are often easy enough to compare, because those are the most obvious two. But what about other services? How much are you spending on, e.g., log handling or monitoring? Good services such as AWS CloudWatch come at a cost, especially if you use it for log handling too (AWS CloudWatch Logs). Are you heavily using a managed database service? A queueing or pub/sub service?</p>



<p>Avoid feeling like that one time the surprise cloud bill hit you in the face by doing your homework this time. You are wiser from the experience, after all.</p>



<p>Network transfers in and out of the cloud can also vary by quite a large amount. The three major providers will give you incoming network traffic for free, but charge you for the outgoing traffic. Smaller, regional, cloud providers will often have higher compute and storage costs, but not charge you for network traffic. Or include a much larger amount of it in a free tier offering.</p>



<p>Overwhelming? I get it. It sure looks that way at first glance! But it doesn’t have to be. My trick is to look at your past few detailed billing statements, and map those costs to your new cloud provider options.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Deeply take all aspects of your current cloud billing into account. Find the differences between offerings, and make a more informed decision.</em></li></ul>



<h2>2. Cloud vendor-specific integrations</h2>



<p>Tell me, did you adopt Kubernetes to make yourself less dependent on cloud providers? Reduce vendor lock-in? Are you now surprised at finding out that you are still locked in, but on a different level?</p>



<p>What I’ve seen is that most organizations will make sure they have highly portable application definitions. By relying on Kubernetes, the application definitions work across cloud providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I’ve also seen is that if you are using a managed Kubernetes service, your users and permissions handling is perhaps tied not to Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) features, but rather, to cloud-specific offerings. Like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Great service, but ties you to the AWS platform.</p>



<p>Fully-managed Kubernetes services, if offered by cloud vendors themselves, serve to offer a highly integrated experience. The cost of that integration is that migration to another cloud provider becomes just that certain amount more difficult.</p>



<p>As a community, we’ve tried to fix this. But as a community of engineers, those fixes are technical. Kubernetes dictates standards for certain components or aspects. Networking has to work according to the Container Network Interface (CNI) standard. Storage according to Container Storage Interface (CSI). And so on. Great. But the business people have put in much more clever ways of locking you to the platform. This means that other less obvious aspects are more difficult to freely migrate from one cloud to another.</p>



<p>So what is the option? Do you have to manage Kubernetes yourself? No. Of course not. But it may make sense to investigate managed Kubernetes offerings that are not tied to a particular cloud provider to reduce the risk of vendor lock-in. Without having to take on the task of day-to-day operations on your own, of course.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Investigate the ways in which cloud providers make migration more difficult due to incompatible integrations. Choose third-party vendors that are not tied to any particular cloud provider, and can offer their services on top of other cloud providers if need be.</em></li></ul>



<h2>3. The devil is in the (technical) details</h2>



<p>Almost all organizations I’ve talked to say the same thing. They went to the cloud because they wanted to get infrastructure or platform functionality on an as-a-Service basis. That is the whole point of the cloud, is it not?</p>



<p>So, of course, all cloud providers will offer certain services. It used to be just infrastructure as a service (virtual machines, network, and storage) but we are starting to also take, e.g., object storage and queuing services for granted. Many such services will claim to offer an “S3 compatible API” or similar. And that is a great starting point! But beware, because what does such a compatibility claim really mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS S3, for example, was, until December 2020, merely eventually consistent. Since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/12/aws-s3-strong-consistency/">their announcement</a>, it is read-after-write consistent (strong consistency). Which level of consistency would a service that is “S3 compatible” have? The old one? Or the new one? And do you have aspects of your applications that depend on that answer being one or the other? Would you know off-hand?</p>



<p>If you don’t, by the way, you’re in excellent company. Most people’s eyes gloss over when consistency guarantees are discussed. But then again, you don’t want to get bitten by a bug caused by wrongful assumptions, so somebody has to stay awake to figure this stuff out. Hopefully not past midnight!</p>



<p>Ready for another unexciting example? Queuing services, such as AWS SQS, offer certain delivery guarantees. SQS standard queues offer “at least once” guarantees. That means that a message can be delivered to your application more than once, and must have logic in place for dealing with duplicates. An application that is not prepared for this will start showing strange behavior. Especially under heavy load, because that is when the risk for multiple deliveries is higher. This is because high load means there is less time to do housekeeping for the queuing service. (Note that while SQS offers FIFO queues that have “exactly once”&nbsp;<strong>processing</strong>&nbsp;guarantees, however, that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/sqs-fifo-queues-message-ordering-and-exactly-once-processing-guaranteed">does not imply exactly once delivery</a>.) So confusing for an application that was coded with assumptions of RabbitMQ’s “at most once” delivery guarantees!</p>

<p>The point I am making here is that you must make an inventory of all the cloud services you use, and what features in these are key to your applications working the way they are intended. Because&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;use case is the one that matters.</p>



<p>Cloud providers offer services that make certain trade-offs to ensure the scalability and availability&nbsp;<em>of their service</em>. From the perspective of individual customers and applications, the ideal trade-off choice might have been different. If you use a software such as RabbitMQ, you can configure it perfectly for your use case and requirements. Not the ones of the cloud providers. There are companies that offer managed services in a cloud-agnostic way. Especially on top of Kubernetes, which deserve your consideration.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Make a clear inventory of all cloud services you use, along with the required features of each for your use case. To make a cloud-to-cloud migration easier, start depending on software not tied to any particular provider.</em></li></ul>



<h2>4. Tools supporting your processes (may) change</h2>



<p>Industry wisdom and rule of thumb says that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.econnectivity.se/app-maintenance-cost-can-be-three-times-higher-than-development-cost/">about 70% of software costs</a>&nbsp;are in maintenance. Not development. Just keeping the thing running as intended. How do you address that? My take on it is to rely on smart tools and automation as much as possible. The less your staff has to work on rote menial tasks, the better. Everything they do is a process. So let’s talk about those processes.</p>



<p>Operating your mission-critical cloud application? A bunch of processes. And most, if not all, of these are supported by tools. Continuous integration and deployment, monitoring, notifications and alerting. These are the tools your operations staff is using to analyze and optimize your application deployment.</p>



<p>Great tools like AWS CloudWatch offer insight into monitoring, logging (CloudWatch Logs), and containerized workloads (CloudWatch Container Insights). Your team probably depends on them. But they are specific to a particular cloud vendor.</p>

</p>


<h2><span id="Kill_the_alarm_clock.21">Kill the alarm clock!</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_epidemic">Alarm clock epidemic</span></h3>
<p>Few upwardly mobile people in the modern rat-race society can live without an alarm clock. With a shot of strong coffee and round-the-clock stress, most people learn to live and survive with an alarm clock. Half of the population wakes up with an alarm, 9% are woken by a partner, 4% by pets, 3% by children, etc. That leaves a minority that wake up naturally. Increasingly, time becomes the most precious commodity in society where achievement is often associated with speed and perfect time-management. However, alarm clocks introduce harmful side effects: stress, sleep debt, and worst of all, disruption of the natural physiological sleep function. At worst, those factors will result in physical damage to the brain (e.g. such sensitive structures as the hippocampus, your memory switchboard, may literally <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!" title="If you do not sleep, you die!">lose neurons as a result of disrupted sleep</a>).
</p><p>The art of time-management makes it possible to live at a high speed with an alarm clock at your side, and still be free from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Stress" title="Factors that affect sleep">stress</a>. However, the societal damage inflicted by alarm clocks and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> is unforgivable. An alarm clock that interrupts your sleep damages your memories, your ability to learn, your creativity, your mood and temper, your relationships with other people, your ability to focus, and your overall intellectual performance!
</p><p>Dr Robert Stickgold has shown that people who learn a skill during the day do not show significant improvement until they get 7-8 hours of good sleep<sup id="cite_ref-stickgold-2005_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-stickgold-2005-1">[1]</a></sup>. There was a noticeable correlation between the degree of improvement and the quality of sleep received. My own work with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_habits#SleepChart_in_SuperMemo" title="Sleep habits">SleepChart</a> also shows that the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Alarm_clock_vs._learning" title="Sleep and learning">use of alarm clocks can dramatically reduce memory recall and consolidation</a>. Forgetting is so painless that we rarely notice its effects. In a natural way, forgetting will proceed even if you get as much sleep as you need, and it is difficult to point to specific memories lost as a result of not sleeping enough. Moreover, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">sleep deprivation may leave your memories intact while their storage will be sub-optimum</a>. The difference may be impossible to spot without measurement. We are more likely to notice sleepiness, reduced mental agility, or bad mood.
</p><p>Disrespect for sleep has reached biblical proportions. This is most noticeable in the US and other highly industrialized nations. <i>Men's Health's</i> Dan Vergano writing for <i>ABC News</i> in <i>"No More Rude Awakenings"</i> suggests a seven-day system for fighting sleepiness: <i>"The secret is to fuel that arousal system so it can <b>beat the pants off the sleep system</b>. By creating the kind of feel-good expectations that trigger hormones to wake the brain, you’ll override the need to sleep and be able to jump out of bed like a man on fire"</i>. The article suggests a "fresh" mind method that capitalizes on the fact that stress hormones help keep you alert. However, the only rational remedy for <i>"rude awakenings"</i> is simple: get enough sleep! Jumping <i>like a man on fire</i> is not likely to have a positive effect on your creative potential!
</p><p>You may often notice that waking up with an alarm clock gives you a jumpstart for the day. You may then come to believe that using the alarm clock might help you stay alert later in the day. This is not the case. The alarm signal simply scares your brain into wakefulness, disrupting the carefully planned process of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">neural optimization</a> that occurs in sleep. As a result, you get an immediate injection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline">adrenaline</a> and your levels of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTH">ACTH</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol">cortisol</a> also increase. This is cortisol that peaks at awakening in natural sleeping rhythm that provides you with the fresh-mind impression. With passing time, this cheaply gained alertness will wear thin unless you continue abusing your physiology with more "remedies". You may use more scare tactics for keeping yourself alert, abuse caffeine, or even get a more profound effect with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil">modafinil</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine">cocaine</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamines">amphetamines</a>. Alertness should be achieved with the help of sufficient sleep, not despite the lack of sleep! Apart from your reduced ability to learn new things, all unnatural anti-drowsiness methods will produce a great deal of side effects that can be pretty damaging to your health in the long run.
</p><p>All efforts to overcome sleepiness by means other than sleep itself can be likened to a chase of the first high in the use of psychoactive substances. If you drink buckets of coffee, do pushups, pour cold water over your head, or slap your face, you only dip into the last reserves of your alertness hormones that only worsen the effects of deprivation after the effects of the stimulation wear off, which is usually a matter of minutes. Rarely can you get a boost lasting more than an hour, and the more you perk up, the lower you fall in the aftermath.
</p>
<h3><span id="Insomnia_trap">Insomnia trap</span></h3>
<p>If your life without an alarm clock may seem like an impossibility, you will probably need to use all methods in the book to be sure you get enough sleep and minimize the damage. If you need to wake up early at the cost of your brain, avoid the <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia trap</a></b>! Insomnia trap is a vicious circle of:
</p>
<ol><li> going to sleep too early to get more sleep,</li>
<li> failing to fall asleep in time (or worse, waking up prematurely),</li>
<li> feeling even more tired on the next day, and</li>
<li> going to sleep even earlier on the next day to catch up with the lost sleep.</li></ol>
<p>It is better to go to sleep at a natural hour (i.e. a bit later), wake up early, suffer a degree of sleep deprivation, and hope for a phase reset that will make it possible to continue on the <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/">designer schedule</a>. For a solution to the insomnia trap see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia" title="Curing DSPS and insomnia">Curing DSPS and insomnia</a>.
</p><p>If you cannot reset your phase and still feel tired when getting up early on a regular basis, consider choosing a job that is acceptable for your body, not the other way around. Your long-term health and well-being is at stake. If you absolutely cannot live without an alarm clock, you can at least start from changing your mindset about the importance of sleep and ensure you do not impose wrong habits on your children. Perhaps the young ones will be lucky enough to work in a flex-time system that will make it possible to get sufficient amount of undisturbed sleep. At least, do not set a bad example!
</p>
<h3><span id="Wake_up_the_President">Wake up the President</span></h3>
<p>President Bill Clinton was woken up twice by telephone during the night of April 22, 2000 before the infamous I.N.S. raid on the home of Miami relatives of the young Cuban exile Elian Gonzales. He was probably the most often disrupted and sleep deprived president in history. Only after a heart surgery did Clinton take diet, sleep and (real) exercise seriously. Those interrupted nights would definitely influence his performance and the quality of his decisions! Has anybody thought of a rule: <i>Do not wake up the president?</i> A rule that could only be revoked in a true national emergency? President G. W. Bush (b. 1946) was woken up when an American spy plane landed in China in 2001. He was also woken up after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem in 2002. George H. W. Bush (b. 1924) and Hilary Clinton made "waking up in the middle of the night" part of their presidential campaign and prowess. It seems that only Ronald Reagan had pretty strong rules for protecting his own sleep. He also famously napped during some cabinet meetings. He slept through a couple of international events without an apparent negative impact on his somewhat delayed decision-making. Critics would say he slept through the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">Iran-Contra affair</a>. Was Reagan so protective of sleep because he understood the role of sleep better, or perhaps he was just a bit lazier than other presidents? I don't know. However, he sure set a good example.
</p>
<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_monsters">Alarm clock monsters</span></h3>
<p>Andrea K. wrote to me with skepticism: 
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Take the alarm clock away from a typical person and they won't just wake up on their own at their desired time and they will miss work, school, or whatever. An alarm clock can't be that bad for you because of the simple fact that most people use it and I never noticed any problem with them&nbsp;:) Everyone in my family has been using one since they were children, and no one suddenly went crazy or began to mutate into a monster (yet)!"</i></p></blockquote> 
<p>When you use an alarm early in the morning in order to get to work or to school, you cut off the later stages of sleep. If the intrusion into natural sleep is not large (e.g. from minutes to an hour), the damage may be limited and hard to notice. Alarm clock will do far more damage if it cuts deep into the middle of the night sleep. You can compare the use of alarm clocks to smoking or eating hot dogs. The harm is not great enough to be instantly noticeable. It took the public many years to largely accept that "smoking is bad" or "fast food is bad". It is hard to quantify the degree of damage. However, as we move to knowledge society where our intellectual performance becomes increasingly important, the effects of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> will come under closer scrutiny and alarm clocks are bound to gradually fall out of favor. Unlike hot dogs, they are already universally hated by their users. Most people are able to somewhat adapt their sleep to their schedules if their routines are regular enough. When those people need to resort to the use of the alarm clock, they cut less of their sleep and the damage is proportionally smaller. Nevertheless, we should always strive at eliminating alarm clocks altogether. Most of all, we should protect our kids from suffering interrupted sleep!

We want it to be the height of the viewport and the margin centers our content. We have set the overflow to hidden as we will be doing some positioning later on and this will hide some of the overflowing elements.</p><p>main-grid</p><p>Looking at the poster we could go for a flexbox layout and use a direction of column, stacking all the elements vertically. That would be a viable solution, but to have a little more control over the size of each column and its placement we can instead use the grid. We are setting an explicit height on the top section and the title section then saying the rest (which is made up of the circles) should take up the rest of the available space, or 1 fractional unit.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.main-grid</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>50</span><span>px</span><span> </span><span>200</span><span>px</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>fr</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>info-section</p><p>The top section of the poster, with the two paragraphs of text will also utilize the grid. Flexbox would indeed be a good solution here, we could have used <code>justify-content: space-between</code> and then a padding on the horizontal of each text section to push them to the edges of the pages but with some padding from the actual edge. In keeping with using grid however, we can use a nifty feature of the <code>auto</code>cloumn size to set a defined width on the elements on the edges but an auto size in between, pushing the outer elements apart. The left and right section of text use flexbox with a direction of column.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.info-section</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-row</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span> auto </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>  p</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.8</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.section-left</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.section-right</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>title-section</p><p>We are on a roll with grid! Let's use another one. Here we will be defining the width of each text section whilst also setting the rows height to that of the given second section in the <code>main-grid</code> class. The subtitle, that is, the text on the right which is split into three rows, was a little more fiddly to get right. Our final result is ok but it's not 100% accurate.</p><p>Due to the size of the title text on the left we use a cheeky <code>margin-top</code> to push the three rows down a tad, this gives our eyes the impression that these three rows are centered to the big text on the left. That's not actually true due to the dots on the <code>i</code> raising the height of the title text.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.title-section</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-row</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>400</span><span>px</span><span> auto </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>200</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>align-items</span><span>:</span><span> center</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>%</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.title</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-weight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>500</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>letter-spacing</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.subtitle</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>color</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--white-color</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.3</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-weight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>justify-content</span><span>:</span><span> space-evenly</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>150</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>margin-top</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>circles-grid</p><p>Our final class is the most "complicated". If we take a look at the original poster we can count how many circles we see, it's an 11x11 grid. The <code>repeat()</code> function allows us to set a repeating pattern of sizes in one short statement. For the columns we are saying that there should be 11 columns, each taking up the available space until they reach each end of the parent container. We do the same for the rows except that we explicitly state the height of the rows so that the child elements sizing more closely resemble that of the original poster.</p><p>Remember we set the <code>overflow: hidden</code> on the <code>outer-cointainer</code>? Here we can see why. When looking at the original poster we can see the circles on the horizontal edges are cut off, they are semi-circles. Now, rather than creating some special semi-circle shapes we set the width of this section (this grid) to be slightly larger than the parent container, and by hiding the overflow we give the illusion that the circles are semi-circles contained within our bounderies.</p><p>We use another little trick with the before pseudo element to give the illusion that the top of the grid is cut off and thus the circles look like semi-circles. The pseudo element here is creating a 20px high block which has the same colour as the poster. It's got an absolute position and lays on top of the <code>circles-grid</code>.</p><p>The nested <code>circle</code> class is the base circle that will be used to generate a circle dynamically using JavaScript. The <code>white-circle</code> will be used as an override to colour the white circles on the poster.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.circles-grid</span><span>

              <p>The Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) hit a new milestone yesterday, hitting $100 billion in cumulative volume since its launch in 2020.</p>


<p>Uniswap has become the first DEX to cross this $100 billion volume milestone, a feat that founder Haydn Adams <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1361356927226310668" target="_blank">celebrated on Twitter</a> on Feb 15. </p>



<p>The value counts all processed transactions since Uniswap’s launch in August 2020.</p>







<p>The statistic is just another reminder of Uniswap’s dominance over the DEX market. It’s the market’s most popular DEX by far, beating out SushiSwap and Curve Finance by a handsome margin. The latter two processed roughly $2.9 billion and $1 billion respectively in the last seven days, while Uniswap processed a staggering $7.3 billion.</p>



<h2 id="h-uniswap-on-a-tear">Uniswap on a Tear</h2>



<p>Uniswap continued its record-setting behavior from January 2020, which <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://beincrypto.com/uniswap-hits-new-milestones-amid-growing-prices-and-social-media-attention/" target="_blank">saw growth</a> in numerous areas. This includes an approximate 25% increase in liquidity to $3.6 billion.</p>



<p>The popularity gives Uniswap a 54% share of the DEX market. However, despite its dominance, there is still heavy <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://beincrypto.com/sushiswap-positioned-itself-formidable-uniswap-rival/" target="_blank">competition from Sushiswap</a> and the like. </p>

<p>Uniswap is expected to release a new version of its platform, Uniswap v3, in the months to come. This should attract even more users — though it’s impossible to when <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-decentralized-finance-revolution/" target="_blank">DeFi</a> markets will peak. By all accounts, it doesn’t look like the momentum is stopping any time soon.</p>

<p>The UNI token has also fostered much discussion. Uniswap users were airdropped 400 UNI tokens in September 2020. The token now stands at a price of approximately $20 — a 10x increase since its all-time low.</p>



<h2 id="h-dex-growth-going-up-gas-fees-follow">DEX Growth Going Up — Gas Fees Follow</h2>



<p>Alongside the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-decentralized-finance-revolution/" target="_blank">DeFi</a> industry, DEXs have taken much of the spotlight since mid-2020. They are the hubs for yield farming and liquidity provision, but the growth of Ethereum-based services has come at a literal cost. Gas fees have<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://beincrypto.com/uniswap-liquidity-surges-3-billion-gas-price-crisis/" target="_blank"> been painfully high</a> in recent weeks, with simple transactions occasionally costing over $100.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://beincrypto.com/layer-2-uniswap-port-launched-to-quell-rising-gas-costs/" target="_blank">Layer-2 (L2)-based solutions</a> like <a href="https://beincrypto.com/price/loopring/" target="_blank">Loopring</a> provide an alternative to the problem, though investors are still flocking to the likes of Uniswap and SushiSwap. These L2 exchanges conduct transactions at a significantly cheaper rate.</p>



<p>However, the much-hyped Ethereum 2.0, which would bring about sharding and other features to the protocol, also aims to fix these problems. ETH 2.0 will be released in phases, and traders are hoping that gas prices will go down as scaling solutions are deployed.</p><div><h3>Disclaimer</h3><p>

<p>I get the temptation to make standup asynchronous. “Stop forcing a daily meeting on everyone! Take back those <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/14/parkinsons-law-and-friends/">15 minutes</a>!” It sounds great, and I’m usually a fan of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">writing as a way to collaborate</a>. </p>



<p>But <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/02/09/say-things-that-can-be-wrong/">asynchronous standups are not standups</a>. They’re a way for teams to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/24/declare-bankruptcy-and-dont-be-ashamed-of-it/">kill standups</a> without feeling guilty about it. </p>



<p>Why? Two reasons:</p>



<p><strong>Reason 1: Standups are not status updates. </strong>I like Scrum’s definition of a standup, even for teams not doing Scrum:</p>



<blockquote><p>The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.</p><cite><a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum">Scrum Guide</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>See that? In a good standup, you’re <strong>re-<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">planning the sprint</a> every day</strong>. That can’t happen if you rattle off a quick “last 24 I did X, next 24 I’ll do Y, no blockers” and move on with your day.</p>



<p><strong>Reason 2: <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">Nobody’s reading</a> all those updates.</strong> At best, the manager reads them and one or two other people skim them. That’s not collaboration. That’s reporting up the chain, which is not what standups are for.</p>



<p>If your <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">standups are so useless</a> that you don’t miss anything by taking it to Slack, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/17/zombie-standups-try-walking-the-board/">try fixing them</a> instead of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">giving up</a>. </p>

				<p>Imagine you are handed this device and asked to get root on it as quickly as possible. No further information is given. Where would you begin? &nbsp;<em>(If you just want to see the router get rooted, jump down to "Mounting an Attack: Rooting a Home Router" ;-)</em></p>    <p><em>Our target: A <strong>VERY</strong> common/popular consumer Access Point.</em></p>  <p>Since you have the device in your hands, you might try directly attacking the hardware. However, if you've never done any kind of hardware hacking, getting started can be intimidating. In this post, we are going to talk about the fundamental information you need to know to use JTAG for hacking hardware. We'll also go over a quick example to illustrate the power of direct hardware access. ​</p>  <h2><u><span size="5" color="#3f3f3f"><strong>Why Do Manufacturers Use JTAG?</strong></span></u></h2>  <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/boundary-scan-history_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/boundary-scan-history.png?241" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><p>​JTAG is a common hardware interface that provides your computer with a way to communicate directly with the chips on a board. It was originally developed by a consortium, the Joint (European) Test Access Group, in the mid-80s to address the increasing difficulty of testing printed circuit boards (PCBs). JTAG&nbsp;has been in widespread use ever since it was included in the Intel 80486 processor in 1990 and codified as IEEE 1491 that same year.&nbsp;Today JTAG is used for debugging, programming and testing on virtually ALL embedded devices.&nbsp;<br></p> <hr>    <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/dfx-dft-ictdi-img01_orig.gif" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/dfx-dft-ictdi-img01.gif?264" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><p><strong>Boundary Scanning</strong><br>With the invention of integrated circuits came the need to test physical interconnects. That is: test whether "Point A" on a circuit board correctly connects to "Point C". As industry drove toward higher density interconnects and finer pitch (i.e. smaller) components, a standardized way of testing integrated circuits (or "chips") was needed. By embedding the test logic within the IC itself and limiting the physical interface to just a few signals, JTAG/boundary-scan presented an elegant solution to testing, debugging, and diagnosing modern electronic systems.&nbsp;Simply stated, boundary Scanning allows you to read and write individual bits, on individual pins, of the individual chips on a board. This ability to read and write 1's and 0's directly onto the pins is extremely powerful, but widely misunderstood.&nbsp;</p> <hr>  <div><div><div> 	<table> 		<tbody> 			<tr> 				<td> 					 						  <p>​The JTAG interface gives manufacturers a way to test the physical connections between pins on a chip. When electrical engineers talk about using JTAG to "debug" a chip, they are talking about something very different than traditional software debugging. They are talking about making sure pin A on chip A is physically connected to pin B on chip B, and that all those pins are functioning correctly. Since JTAG gives you direct hardware access to a device, it's also a fantastic tool for security research.</p>   					 				</td>				<td> 					 						  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/connectiontest_orig.gif" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/connectiontest.gif?158" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </div></div></div>  <h2><u><span size="5" color="#3f3f3f"><span><strong>JTAG Fundamentals</strong></span></span></u></h2>  <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/654px-jtag-chain-svg_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/654px-jtag-chain-svg.png" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><div><p>Before we go into using JTAG to actually hack something, let's review the JTAG fundamentals.</p><p><strong>4 Pins, Plus 1</strong><br>The official JTAG standard requires 4 standard pins (or signals), and defines an optional 5th. These signals, and the small bit of silicon logic that connects and controls them, are collectively referred to as the Test Access Port, or TAP controller.</p></div> <hr>  <p><strong>The JTAG "Tower of Babel"</strong></p>  <div><p>One of the most confusing thing about learning to get hands-on with JTAG is how much partial and disinformation there is about it. Manufacturers' websites tell you the "theory" of how it works, but leave you longing for more information about "how to get started". To further confuse things there are other factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Buzzword</strong>:&nbsp;It is a infosec buzzword, everyone talks about it but few really share actionable info</li><li><strong>Loaded Word: </strong>JTAG has come to mean many things to many people. For example,&nbsp;in the gamer community "JTAG" means a hardware modification&nbsp;for a console that allows playing pirated games or loading homebrew content (i.e. "a <a href="http://hackaday.com/2009/10/20/freeboot-gives-the-xbox-360-jtag-hack-new-life/" target="_blank">jtagged&nbsp;XBox</a>"). This makes it difficult to search for useful information.</li><li><strong>Vernacular Overlap:</strong> As mentioned above, when an Electrical Engineer says "debug" he means: <em>"Are the pins in the right place?&nbsp;Is there enough power?&nbsp;Is the logic of the circuit correct?"</em> When a Software Engineer says "debug" he thinks of GDB or WinDBG. JTAG is designed for the former, not the latter.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Misunderstanding: </strong>As software developers the closest similarity&nbsp;to JTAG is maybe Kernel debugging via a debug cable (USB, Parallel, or Serial). But this is a dangerous comparison, because even on the "debugee" (in that scenario) there is software code executing on the remote system&nbsp;handling the translation of commands arriving on the debug cable. The JTAG state machine implemented&nbsp;entirely in hardware on the target.</li></ul></div>  <p><strong>What JTAG <u>ISN'T!</u></strong></p>  <div><p>In an effort to dispel disinformation (which is so rampant) here is what JTAG isn't.</p><ul><li><strong>The name of a specific device</strong> for debugging firmware or hardware</li><li><strong>The name of a piece of software</strong> used for debugging software code running on an embedded device.</li><li><strong>The name of a protocol:&nbsp;</strong>The JTAG specification doesnt even define the protocol for how data is passed between debugger and debugee (i.e. there is no .h file you can reference defining a "JTAG packet" to be passed over a serial, parallel, or USB cable to a target)</li><li><strong>The name of a kind of connector: </strong>Unlike a specification like USB or Ethernet, the&nbsp;JTAG specification doesn't even define what connectors should look like. This&nbsp;leads to a VERY confusing diversity of "JTAG" connectors. This is often a huge source of confusion&nbsp;to a software person. Imagine if every USB cable was different!</li></ul></div>  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-21-am_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-21-am_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>All of the connectors above can be referred to as "JTAG" connectors. </p> </div></div>  <div><div><div> 	<table> 		<tbody> 			<tr> 				<td> 					 						  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-1-33-15-am_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-1-33-15-am.png?329" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>JTAG connector for a DD WRT router</p> </div></div>   					 				</td>				<td> 					 						  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-1-33-08-am_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>JTAG connector for a Point-Of-Sale device</p> </div></div>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </div></div></div>  <p>All of the connectors above are "JTAG" connectors.

Voltage on this pin simply pulses up and down in a rhythmic, steady beat. On every “beat” of the clock, the TAP controller takes a single action.

The State controller diagram is in the upper left of the video below. By manipulating the voltage on the TMS pin of the TAP controller and the TCK pin, you control the way the State Machine changes state. On each beat of the clock, the JTAG TAP controller in your targeted device checks if there is voltage on the TMS pin, and interprets that as either a 1 (voltage) or a 0 (no voltage). This series of 1’s and 0’s moves JTAG through a relatively simple State Machine. This state machine is so simple that you can <a href="http://hackaday.com/2013/08/31/learn-jtag-by-writing-a-bit-banging-programmer/" target="_blank">even write Arduino code to manipulate it</a>.

<p>
Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer’s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers’ heads. It’s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack “code browsers” that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we’ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
In simple cases, some constructs manifest as naming conventions: prefixes in a name may be a rudimentary way to namespace classes<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, while suffixes may be a rudimentary way to group classes or identify their type<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>. But these are easy examples; many patterns are much more subtle.</p>
<h2>
“Where is this used?”</h2>
<p>
Imagine figuring out “where is this used?”, for various types of “this”:</p>
<p>
Most code editors (perhaps paired with a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a>) can show you where local variables are used. This usually also works for finding where methods are invoked — although perhaps less reliably in dynamic-dispatch languages, or languages without types.</p>
<p>
What if you want to find where instances of a particular model get created? There may be multiple ways to create a model, so this isn’t super simple. In Rails, for example, there’s two built-in ways to create a model: you can either call <code>.new</code> to create a new instance in memory followed by <code>.save</code> to persist it to the database, or call <code>.create</code> to automatically do both. Your particular codebase might have additional wrappers for doing this that you’re supposed to use. Even worse, imagine that sometimes you create a <code>.new</code> instance, then set some properties on it over the next few lines, then finally call <code>.save</code>. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>user = User.new
user.email = '<a href="https://feifan.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="8de5e8e1e1e2cde8f5ece0fde1e8a3eee2e0">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>' unless self.anonymous?
user.save</code></pre>
<p>
Conceptually, that’s still code that creates an instance of a particular model. But with the intervening syntax, this would be a difficult case to find with <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h2>
Static config</h2>
<p>
At <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I work, we have a lot of code for jobs that need to run at certain times each day. For example, we might need to move funds from one financial partner to another at noon UTC each day. Each of these jobs has configuration code describing when and how it should be run, implemented as a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/">DSL</a>. This config might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>run_config RunConfig.new(
  job_name: 'partner-daily-funding',
  env_vars: self.config_env,
  cron: RunConfig::Cron.new(
    schedule: { hour: 12, minute: 0 }
  ),
  owning_team: Company::Team::Liquidity
)</code></pre>
<p>
In our codebase, we have hundreds of these jobs, each with their own <code>run_config</code>. If you look at this codebase as a database, you can imagine these jobs being rows in a <code>jobs</code> table, where the fields on each row correspond to the parameters provided to the <code>RunConfig</code> class. </p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse all these jobs in a table? Maybe you could perform some basic operations on this data: searching for specific jobs by name or owning team; sorting by the time-of-day they’re scheduled to run; filtering for jobs owned by your team that have errored in the past week. Maybe you could edit the <code>run_config</code> from that interface (like you might edit a spreadsheet) and have it automatically make the corresponding change in the source code (or open a PR). Maybe you could even compute some aggregations on this data — for example, if you’re introducing a new job that requires some expensive computation, maybe you’d like to know which hours have the fewest other jobs scheduled. And of course, this job browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each entry that shows the code for the job inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<h2>
Diffused concepts</h2>
<p>
Codebases typically contain logical concepts that are implemented across multiple pieces of code. This is often the case when you need to create multiple files to implement a particular feature.</p>
<p>
For example, in Rails, a “resource” is collectively implemented across a line in the router, a model file, a controller file, and a bunch of view files. Rails even ships with a code generator to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5f3ff60084ab5d5921ca3499814e4697f8350ee7/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/resource/USAGE">create some of these files</a> for you. But despite resources being a core concept when working with Rails, there’s no good way to browse the resources in your codebase<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a>. There’s no good way to filter or query your codebase either — you can’t, for example, see which resources support JSON vs XML params. </p>
<p>
For another example, consider pubsub (aka emitter-consumer) pipelines. In web services, when you have processing that can happen “in the background”, one service will publish an event; another service subscribes to that event and will do the background processing on its own when it receives the event. Often, these will form event “pipelines” or trees where an event consumer will emit additional events that are consumed by yet other services. These pipelines are concepts that developers talk about (as in, the “account creation pipeline” or “funding reconciliation pipeline”), but in most codebases the pipeline itself isn’t declared or reified anywhere in the code.</p>
<p>
If you’re looking at code that emits an event, how do you find the consumers? If you’re lucky, the event has a unique, literal name and the consumer uses that name literally as well. But maybe some subscribers are using wildcard event names, or names generated by string concatenation, and that becomes a lot harder to grep for. Likewise, if you’re looking at a consumer of an event, how do you find the locations in the codebase that could emit that event<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>?</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse those pipelines in a table or perhaps a directed graph<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a>? Maybe that graph would support some basic operations on this data: searching for specific publishers or subscribers by class name or event name; filtering for pipelines that have run into errors; maybe even showing the flow of a particular event given an event ID<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. And of course, this pipeline browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each graph node that shows the code for the publisher or subscriber inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<p>
For a final example, consider code that has functionality inherited from elsewhere. Some environments let you see a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-structure-of-a-source-file.html">list of inherited properties</a> or methods, but this isn’t possible for more specialized cases. At Stripe, we have code that implements shell scripts that can take command-line arguments and flags. These arguments are defined via a DSL in the implementing code, but these commands can be subclassed, and there’s no way to see what the available arguments are while working in the subclass.</p>
<h2>
Philosophy</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to consider these problems not as disparate cases in need of bespoke tooling, but as a <em>class</em> of problems characterized by a lack of access to the data structures embedded within codebases. Just like SQL databases and spreadsheets provide a singular querying abstraction and a set of visualization primitives that can be applied to any kind of data, programming environments need a singular querying abstraction and set of visualization primitives that can be applied to the concepts lurking in codebases. Getting there does <em>not</em> mean using proprietary drag-and-drop visual programming interfaces where the introspection capabilities are limited to whatever the programming environment happens to have implemented. Just the opposite — you should still be able to do whatever you want with your code (including treating it as plain-text files), <em>and also</em> have access to more advanced introspection tools that can query and slice your code — tools that let you easily understand and navigate complex codebases to reduce the <em>incidental complexity</em> of building software.</p>
<h2>
Solutions</h2>
<p>
I don’t have a solution to sell you here (at least, not yet!). But <a href="https://twitter.com/hirday_g/status/1356657607381946369">by popular demand</a> I think it’s worthwhile to at least discuss principles that solutions should embody and directionally-related prior art. </p>
<p>
To start with a simple example, see <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a>, a full-stack web framework similar to Rails. It comes with a web interface for manipulating your project’s codebase and database schema. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbDtS_mUMpI?t=102">One point in the introduction video</a> showed changes being made in the visual schema editor being automatically reflected in the SQL code that describes the database schema — and changes being made to the SQL code being bidirectionally reflected in the visual schema editor. </p>
<p>
For a more in-depth example, consider <a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>, a Smalltalk environment. “Environment” in this case means that it feels like you’re using a custom OS (including global menus, idioms, and keyboard and mouse conventions) designed specifically for browsing, writing, and debugging programs in the Smalltalk programming language<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a>. The holistic integration of these tools is important. Unlike the programming environments we cobble for ourselves today — where the editor is agnostic of the language and runtime and other tools like debuggers, inspectors, and code browsers are tacked on (if they exist at all) — it’s worth thinking about what an entire computing experience <em>for</em> writing and building custom tools might look like<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>
Pharo is also interesting because of its Class Browser, which looks like this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://files.tanagram.app/file/tanagram-data/prod-feifans-blog/database-codebase-pharo-browser.png" alt="Pharo class browser">
</p>
<p>
This browser breaks free from the source code <em>file</em> as the atomic unit of browsing; instead, it allows the user to browse one method at a time. Making the “unit of browsing” …</p></article></div></div></div>

<p>In late 2020, a coalition of predatory, money-losing, private-equity backed companies ran a $200m disinformation campaign that resulted in the passage of California's Prop 22, legalizing worker misclassification and mass-scale labor law violations.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#prop-22">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#prop-22</a></p>
<p>Almost immediately, the passage of Prop 22 led to the loss of unionized jobs paying a living wage and offering basic worker protections, especially for people of color – only to have them replaced by "gig work" that lacked any of the above.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22</a></p>
<p>One of the primary funders – and beneficiaries – of Prop 22 was Uber, which pioneered worker misclassification. Uber is now pushing the EU to "harmonize" its regulations in a game of transatlantic pingpong where each volley makes things worse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/uber-proposes-california-style-gig-work-reforms-in-europe.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/uber-proposes-california-style-gig-work-reforms-in-europe.html</a></p>
<p>The irony? Uber is a "bezzle" – JK Galbraith's name for "the magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it." Uber is a scam and it will never be profitable.</p>
<p>Uber is a product of Softbank, the Saudi-backed Japanese investment fund that has $100b to spend on helping the Saudi royals find a revenue stream to replace oil. Softbank is a pioneer of accounting frauds that make stupid businesses look profitable.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/19/larval-pegasi/#long-con">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/19/larval-pegasi/#long-con</a></p>
<p>From Wework to Uber to Doordash and beyond, Softbank makes two kinds of bets: first, that they can achieve a monopoly by doing illegal or quasi-illegal things so quickly that they become faits accompli before they get shut down.</p>
<p>And second, that the companies that fail to achieve a monopoly can be unloaded on suckers ("investors") who assume that a money-losing company that has been around for a decade or more must have a path to profitability ("a pile of shit this big <em>must</em> have a pony under it!").</p>
<p>Uber will never, ever be profitable. The company admitted as much on its S1 IPO filing, where it said that profitability depended on every public transit system in the world being replaced with Uber. The company lost <em>$4b</em> in the first half of 2020,</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/10/folksy-monopolists/#bezzled">https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/10/folksy-monopolists/#bezzled</a></p>
<p>If you think the first half of 2020 was bad, you should see the second half of 2020: <em>Uber lost $6.8b more!</em> As usual, transportation analyst Hubert Horan has the absolute best context on the company's haemorrhagic losses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-four-uber-loses-another-6-8-billion.html">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-four-uber-loses-another-6-8-billion.html</a></p>
<p>He points out that things are even worse than they seem for Uber. For many years, the pony-under-all-this-shit show required that Uber spend billions on the doomed pretense that they would someday replace drivers with autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>$2.5B later, Uber's "self-driving" cars could go a whopping <em>0.25 miles</em> before crashing. They had to <em>pay</em> someone $400m to take the division off their hands. Even so, ditching the business-unit produced a gain for Uber's H2-2020 balance-sheet.</p>

<p>Now, Uber <em>did</em> experience massive growth in H2-2020, in their food delivery division. However, that growth led to massive losses for them, because every delivery loses the company money, by design (more expensive pony-under-the-pile theatrics):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza</a></p>
<p>But Uber's food delivery long con doesn't just victimize its investors: the primary harms accrue to the restaurants the company nonconsensually opts into its delivery services (with help from Google), draining them until they collapse.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle</a></p>
<p>Uber claims that it is just consuming every beloved restaurant in the world in order to attain liftoff for "ghost kitchens" – literally shipping containers stuffed with precarious chefs <em>paying</em> to cook in unsafe working conditions.</p>
<p>This is what we mean when we talk about "financialization." Uber is a finance shell-game, one that can only be sustained by the destruction of all public transit, all restaurants, basic worker protections and the minimum wage.</p>
<p>And once it has taken that brutal toll on workers and the real economy, once it has fleeced the last investor lured into paying to excavate a little more of the pile of shit, it will collapse.</p>
<p>You can't lost $10b/year forever. $10b here, $10b there, pretty soon you're talking real money.</p>

<p>Ring – Amazon's surveillance doorbell division – has 4,000 "partnerships" with US police ("public safety") orgs. The company has lied about how these work for years, but the basic deal is that they give cops free stuff to buzz-market their products.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5wyjy/amazon-told-police-it-has-partnered-with-200-law-enforcement-agencies">https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5wyjy/amazon-told-police-it-has-partnered-with-200-law-enforcement-agencies</a></p>
<p>Ring tells its customers that they get to choose whether to share the footage from their street-facing cameras with cops, but that's a lie, too. If you say no, the cops still get to look through your camera.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kga3/amazon-is-coaching-cops-on-how-to-obtain-surveillance-footage-without-a-warrant">https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kga3/amazon-is-coaching-cops-on-how-to-obtain-surveillance-footage-without-a-warrant</a></p>
<p>That's why cops debase themselves to serve as buzz-marketers for Ring – in exchange, they get an off-the-books, free-to-use, warrantless, city-scale, video surveillance grid.</p>
<p>It's an investment that pays off. Back in July, EFF documented how the San Francisco Police Department was able to commandeer 200 Avigilon cameras to produce surveillance data on BLM protesters:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/san-francisco-police-accessed-business-district-camera-network-spy-protestors">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/san-francisco-police-accessed-business-district-camera-network-spy-protestors</a></p>
<p>And in a new blockbuster report, EFF's Dave Maass and Matthew Guariglia document how the LAPD did the same thing, fraudulently using "unusual occurance" protocols to gain access to last summer's BLM protests.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests</a></p>
<p>Ring has a terrible track record, kicking off its marketing by sending out deceptive news-bulletins to convince people that they lived in high-crime areas and needed its products:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/amazon-owned-ring-wants-report-crime-news/588394/">https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/amazon-owned-ring-wants-report-crime-news/588394/</a></p>
<p>They lied about their facial recognition program:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-ring-facial-recognition-ukraine">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-ring-facial-recognition-ukraine</a></p>
<p>A program that included a plan to make "watch lists" of people who'd be tracked from camera to camera:</p>
<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/11/26/amazon-ring-home-security-facial-recognition/">https://theintercept.com/2019/11/26/amazon-ring-home-security-facial-recognition/</a></p>
<p>Far from keeping its customers safe, Ring exposed them to real harm, leaking their home addresses:</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/ring-s-hidden-data-let-us-map-amazons-sprawling-home-su-1840312279">https://gizmodo.com/ring-s-hidden-data-let-us-map-amazons-sprawling-home-su-1840312279</a></p>
<p>Allowing third parties to hack their cameras, spy on them, and scream abuse at them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3bbq4/podcast-livestreams-hacked-ring-cameras-nulledcast">https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3bbq4/podcast-livestreams-hacked-ring-cameras-nulledcast</a></p>
<p>Not just hackers, either! Multiple Ring employees got caught spying on Ring owners and their families, including their children:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3mdvk/ring-fired-employees-abusing-video-data">https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3mdvk/ring-fired-employees-abusing-video-data</a></p>
<p>As Maass and Guariglia point out, Ring made some improvements to user privacy over the past year, adding end-to-end encryption. But at the same time, Ring has cemented its relationship with American police forces, leading to far more police requests for Ring owners' footage.</p>
<p>These "requests" start to feel a lot more like coercion, and, as with other coercive law-enforcement requests, "like police 'asking' to search your phone during a traffic stop," they should be bound by strict limits.</p>
<p>EFF proposes four rules for coercive electronic searches:</p>
<p>I. Requests must be specific, targeting a particular time and place where there is reasonable suspicion that crime has happened (rather than general requests)</p>
<p>II. Police must collect and publish statistics about their consent searches of electronic devices, to deter and detect racial profiling</p>
<p>III. Police and reviewing courts must narrowly construe the scope of a person’s consent to search their device.</p>
<p>IV. Before an officer attempts to acquire footage from a person’s Ring camera, the officer must notify the person of their legal right to refuse.</p>
<p>The public-private surveillance partnership between Ring and the cops epitomizes the paradox of the American privacy debate.</p>
<p>When I talk to military, intelligence and government audiences about surveillance, they say, "Look, Uncle Sam already knows everything about me, but those scumbags in Silicon Valley would sell their mothers for a nickel."</p>
<p>And when I talk to tech audiences, they say, "Google just wants to show me better ads, big deal. But cops and spooks? They're the thickwitted sociopaths who were too stupid to get a job at a tech company. No <em>way</em> I want them spying on me."</p>
<p>But the reason companies like Ring are allowed to conduct such indiscriminate surveillance (a one mile walk in DC puts you under the gaze of 13 Ring cameras!) is that governments are wholly dependent on requisitioning their footage.</p>
<p>Rather than warning people about the dangers of Ring cameras – or agitating for ordinances banning them – cops served as street-teams marketing Ring's products. Private surveillance depends on government complicity, and spying governments depend on private surveillance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>My personal computer was a 4 year old MacBook Pro with a permanent battery service warning, a butterfly keyboard (AKA Apple’s greatest hardware design mistake), and a high chassis temperature issue when I use the <a href="https://twitter.com/_zouhir/status/1292878918677139464">left USB-C to charge it</a>, which throttled its Intel i7 CPU and spun the fan so much that it was quite noticeable — I guess what I am trying to say here is, my personal computer was due for a replacement.</p>
<p>After weeks of research, I ended up purchasing a Mac Mini with Apple’s M1 chip and 16 GB of memory. It arrived on Dec 9th and I have been using it for about 2 months now as my daily driver and primary web development machine. In this post I will be sharing my experience migrating away from my Intel-based Mac and how I set up a clean and productive web development environment on the new Apple silicon based Macs.</p>
<p>I will start out by highlighting some of the research I did around the M1 SoC and explain a little on how Apple has managed to achieve great results emulating stronger memory models on their ARM processor, before I walk you through my web development environment setup with Homebrew, Go, Node.js, and Docker.</p>
<h2 id="researching-apple-silicon"><a href="#researching-apple-silicon">Researching Apple Silicon </a></h2><p>Apple’s “One more thing…'' event in November brought us their M1 SoC and a handful of numbers: up to 3.5x faster CPU performance, up to 6x faster graphics, up to 2x battery life, and faster than 98 percent of PC laptops.</p>
<p>Although some people were <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3596814/new-macbook-air-is-not-faster-than-98-percent-of-pc-laptops.html">skeptical about Apple’s claims</a>, there was enough third-party data soon after the announcement that confirmed Apple’s M1 chip does provide a substantial <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks#single-core">performance increase</a>.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the performance and energy efficiency of the M1 chip should have not really been that surprising. Over two years ago, the reputable tech reviews magazine Anandtech ran the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13392/the-iphone-xs-xs-max-review-unveiling-the-silicon-secrets/4">SPEC2006 industry standard benchmark on Apple’s A12 chip</a>, and we learned that the A12 chips Apple used in their iPhone XS are capable of handling desktop workloads. They were capable of outperforming a moderately-clocked Skylake CPU in single-threaded tasks while having better energy efficiency than all Android SoCs.</p>
<p>As it became quickly evident that those who bought an M1 Mac would enjoy great responsiveness and blazing fast startup times, I shifted my attention to the main concern: <strong>the ARM architecture</strong>. I wanted to understand which Intel-based executables Rosetta 2 would <em>not</em> be able to translate? And how stable and performant were Rosetta 2 translated binaries?.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-rosetta-2-behavior-and-performance"><a href="#understanding-rosetta-2-behavior-and-performance">Understanding Rosetta 2 Behavior and Performance </a></h3><p>On the surface, nothing about Rosetta 2’s behaviour is out of the ordinary. It takes <code>x86_64</code> instructions and translates them to <code>arm64</code> instructions ahead-of-time. Once the translation process is finished, the translated <code>arm64</code> code blocks are cached so the subsequent executable launches do not need to repeat this process.</p>
<p>To get some insight on how Rosetta 2 translated executables perform compared to native <code>arm64</code> ones, Anandtech ran <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/6">various SPEC benchmarks on the M1 chip in both formats</a>. The results showed that memory-intensive <code>x86_64</code> workloads translated by Rosetta 2 consistently achieved more than 90% of the native <code>arm64</code> speed and CPU-intensive workloads performed at 70-80% of its native counterparts. Overall, these results are simply outstanding. Combined with the raw power of the M1 chip, people should, in theory, barely notice any difference using translated macOS <code>x86_64</code> applications.</p>
<p>So, we now know that Rosetta 2 translated executables performance is great in general, and specifically for memory-intensive workloads, the question becomes: <em>how is this possible</em>?</p>
<h3 id="m1s-approach-to-emulating-strongly-ordered-memory-models-on-arm"><a href="#m1s-approach-to-emulating-strongly-ordered-memory-models-on-arm">M1’s Approach To Emulating Strongly Ordered Memory Models on ARM </a></h3><p>At a fundamental level, a multi-core processor requires reads and writes to memory to be communicated between its cores in a consistent manner. Each processor architecture defines the semantics of this communication as a part of its memory consistency model (often referred to as just memory model). The ARM architecture used by the M1 SoC provides <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100941/0100/">weaker memory ordering semantics</a> than the <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-sdm-volume-3a-system-programming-guide-part-1.html">x86 architecture</a> used by Intel processors. To understand the difference between the two, let’s look at the four basic types of memory reads &amp; writes orderings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write → Read: write must complete before subsequent read</li>
<li>Read → Read: read must complete before subsequent read</li>
<li>Read → Write: read must complete before subsequent write</li>
<li>Write → Write: write must complete before subsequent write</li>
</ul>
<p>Strongest memory model (known as Sequential consistency) maintains all orderings above, and ensures any change is communicated before the next instruction is run. This intuitive, sequential execution of instruction is bad for performance, and defeats the purpose of having multiple cores that can run things on parallel. Weaker consistency models allow some orderings to be violated, enabling the processors to overlap memory access with other operations. The table below captures which reoderings ARM’s “weaker” memory model and the “stronger” X86 one allow.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, ARM chose to adopt a memory model that allows any of the four basic memory operations to be reordered as a way to beat sequential consistency and make a wide range of hardware optimizations possible. x86 on the other hand chose to preserve orderings for the most parts, and adopt an on-core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_buffer"><em>write buffers</em></a> as a way to beat sequential consistency and hide memory writes latency. x86’s behavior is often referred to as <em>Total Store Ordering</em> (or TSO) where write operations are placed on the local write buffer, and subsequent read instructions can be executed before that write changes are communicated.</p>
<p>When compiling binaries for ARM or x86 architectures, we are basically informing our software what are all the reorderings allowed by the target architecture that it needs to account for to ensure correctness.</p>
<p>Typically, this makes it extremely difficult to emulate x86 correctly on ARM without introducing a significant performance disadvantage caused by the ARM processor trying to explicitly guarantee the orderings x86 executables expect. While there aren’t any official details available publicly on how Apple has managed to overcome this hurdle, a plausible explanation is that it’s been solved at the hardware level, and the M1 chip is capable of switching between ARM’s memory model and the x86 TSO.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-rosettas-limitations"><a href="#what-are-rosettas-limitations">What are Rosetta’s limitations? </a></h3><p>In an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">official documentation page</a>, Apple stated that Rosetta 2 can translate most Intel-based apps, including the ones that contain just-in-time (JIT) compilers. The two exception are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kernel extensions</li>
<li>Virtual Machine apps that virtualize x86_64 computer platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Catalina is the last version of macOS that supports third-party kernel extensions. Without these, developers are now limited to the collection of APIs and frameworks that macOS officially provides and supports. In turn, this means that Mac developers’ freedom and creativity are limited with BigSur – but that’s a topic for another day.</p>
<p>The lack of support for virtual machines was a big concern. It meant I wouldn’t be able to run <code>x86_64</code> Docker because it runs virtual machines under the hood. Luckily there was a path forward, as Docker was able to shift to Apple’s new hypervisor framework and provide <code>arm64</code> binaries. Today, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/">Docker supports M1 chips natively</a>.</p>
<h3 id="decision-day"><a href="#decision-day">Decision Day </a></h3><p>Fascinated and feeling good about the M1’s performance and Rosetta 2 efficiency, I decided it was safe to buy a M1 Mac Mini and give it my own series of real-world tests. And I figured that if it did not meet my expectations or needs, I could take advantage of Apple’s return policy, or hang onto it as a secondary computer or as a media server. (Spoiler: It’s neither!)</p>
<h2 id="installing-rosetta-2"><a href="#installing-rosetta-2">Installing Rosetta 2 </a></h2><p>To make the process of setting up a new Mac less cumbersome and repetitive, I -like many others- have a shell script to configure new installations of macOS, copy my dotfiles and install some of the necessary tools via Homebrew.</p>
<p>If this “setup my new macOS” shell script is being executed on an Apple silicon based Mac, one of the first things we need to do is to check for an existing installation of Rosetta 2, and if one was not found, we should go ahead and install it.</p>
<h3 id="detecting-the-processors-architecture"><a href="#detecting-the-processors-architecture">Detecting the processor’s architecture </a></h3><p>We can use the <code>uname</code> utility to get details about the processor’s architecture (e.g. arm, i386, i686, arm, etc), the machine’s hardware class (e.g. arm64, x86_64, etc) as well as various other characteristics of our system.</p>

Lately I have been getting several emails and there have been postings around the web about the quality / coolness of this site. Mostly comments like, "His POS software is really good, just try to ignore the way his site looks.", "Once you get past the '90's look of his site...", "Just disregard the way the site looks, this is really functional software.", "If your site looks that bad your software must really suck."  And there have been several offers to take the maintenance of this site out of my pathetic hands by folks who like the software but think I have the site design skills of a mushroom.<p>
Piles of thanks for the feedback.</p><p>
So why does this site look like this?</p><hr>
<b>Answer #1</b><p>
Well, I like it.</p><hr>
<b>Answer #2</b><p>
It makes everyone else's site look so much better in comparison. Think of this site as a public service.</p><hr>
<b>Answer #3</b><p>
It isn't that bad, most of the words are spelled correctly. (How many sites can say that?)</p><hr>
<b>Answer #4</b><p>
This is an eye test to see if I can make you go blind.
</p><hr>
<b>Answer #5</b><p>
The real reason. Folks, I am doing the best I can.</p><p>
First realize that I am old. When I was in grade school / high school there were NO COMPUTERS IN THE SCHOOL because outside of main frame computers that cost millions of dollars, computers did not exist. Even pocket calculators did not exist. This made computer classes sort of problematical. (However I used to be a wizard with a slide rule.) So while you have had the advantages of computer classes in school and a bunch of friends to trade computer tips with, I have not. Half of my friends cannot even use a computer which makes them sort of useless when it comes to having a nice chat about HTML or Java. Needless to say I have no teachers, instructors, or professors to help guide my hand to learn this stuff.</p><p>
When I need a new talent (such as HTML) I have to research it on the net, get some books, and then shove myself into a cave until I get the concept, barely. Although if the idea of "learning through your mistakes" is correct then I should know everything because not only do I have the capability of screwing up every possible feature but I can also screw up each feature in every possible way.</p><hr>
So why do I not just stick with it until I actually learn it completely?<br>
 Well unlike some out there who get Christmas, spring, and summer vacations and weekends off, and can study this stuff during class, I have a 6 day a week job, 50 weeks a year. I have a family that I occasionally like to see. I am also writing the software, updating the manual, doing my incompetent best to update the site, and I sometimes sleep. At last count there was still only one of me. So since my computer time is limited I have two choices, either learn more about website design or add more features to the software. My guess is that adding more to the software would be a better use of my time for everyone.<hr>
So why not hire a professional service to maintain the website?<br>
Let me once again explain the concept of "FREE." Free means that you do not pay anything for my software. This means that there is no money coming in to pay for a professional service to maintain the website. I imagine that I could pay for a service out of my pocket for this but that is insane. Free is bad enough but I am not going to pay to provide folks with my software for nothing.<hr>
But if I have a slick site wouldn't that lead to more downloads of my software?<br>
Well, yes, but so what? Remember that FREE thing? An additional billion downloads would not put a dime in my pocket. As of 1-19-17 I have had 800,000 downloads of the POS program from just my site. How many more do I need? Just more people to complain about the website.<hr>
So how about having one of those volunteers do the site.<br>
Well there are two reasons. First I would lose control of the site. Sure, it would look great but I would not understand the code needed to create the site. If I needed to make a change in the site (which happens about weekly) I would have to dig up the volunteer to make the changes. For the volunteer this could quickly become a pain in the neck. Sure it would be fun to redesign this site and show off what you can do but then to have to update it every damn week would rapidly become a chore.<p>
So the volunteer quits, now what? I need to update the website for a new version of the program and I can't even change a period to a comma in this mess. Time to revert to my code that I at least can understand. I may as well just leave it as it is.</p><p>
Sorry.</p><p>

But if you have a better idea or just want to be the next person to bitch about this site <a href="mailto:daleharris@prodigy.net">daleharris@prodigy.net</a>

Here is another comment from <a href="http://smallbusinessonlinecommunity.bankofamerica.com/message/71459"> http://smallbusinessonlinecommunity.bankofamerica.com/message/71459 </a><p>
If you want a totally free POS system that is very easy to use, accepts bar code scanners, various printers and does nearly everything and very easy to set up and use, then try Cash Register By Dale Harris. <span color="red">I looked at the website and thought it looked a piece of junk being a small program and the tacky look of the website, but the free software works excellently and so easy to use.</span> Its not Excel is the only problem I see for you. It actually runs in Msdos , but will run from your windows main screen. Take a look it, it costs nothing though he does offer a donation if the person likes it, but you don’t have to pay anything. I tried many free POS programs which had too many features for a small retail business, but this is so easy even the sales girl.
only took 30 minutes to understand it.

<span color="red">"Also, Did you know your website Sucks?"</span></p><p>

Ah yes, another appreciative fan.

I've been using the first one in that list for the last few years. DHPOS doesn't do customer tracking, but its a reasonable system. There's good support for it via forums and online chat, and it is regularly updated with bug fixes and new features. <span color="red">Don't get turned off by the ugly website or the DOS interface, it works well.</span>

<span color="red">dhpos dot com . It's free and actually rather good despite the terrible website.</span>

</p><hr>
Now they are even picking on the program itself. I have a "form" on my page that asks folks how they found my software and here is one I just received, "Google search pos system free download in Malaysia..do u have any

February 16, 2021 | https://www.linux.it/~ema/posts/porsche-book/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.linux.it/~ema/posts/porsche-book/">archive.org</a>

<p>One of the Amazon reviewers of "Sun Performance and Tuning: Java and the
Internet" gave it 3/5 stars. While still a nice introduction, the book by
Adrian Cockcroft has become dated — claimed Roland in 2003, which believe it
or not was 18 years ago. The book Roland reviewed was published in 1998, and it
is a second edition. The first edition (1994) has a significantly different
title: "<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">Sparc &amp; Solaris</a>",
is the focus instead of "Java and the Internet". Other than reflecting a major
shift in Sun’s focus happened between '94, and '98, the two editions also have
a different price tag. "Java and the Internet" costs 15.97 EUR, while one can
get "Sparc &amp; Solaris" used in allegedly <strong>Very Good</strong> conditions for 1.94.  If
I’m buying an outdated book I’m gonna get the most outdated version possible, I
figured, plus imagine the embarrassment if someone would find a book about Java
in my bookshelf. Shipping is 3 bucks, for a grand total of 4.94 EUR the book is
in my hands 15 days after placing the order.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PSF9CDRYL.jpg" alt="51PSF9CDRYL">
</p>
</div>
<p>"The Porsche Book" is quick to explain the analogy between UNIX and the Porsche
911 featured on the cover: both were created in the '60s, in a form similar to
the current one. Both represent the latest and greatest of products still around
in 1994, and indeed 2021, despite their quirks.</p>
<p>A valid question at this point clearly is: why do you care about a book
published 30 years ago when there’s so much recent and surely more useful
material? One reason is that I find the history of Sun Microsystems
particularly interesting.  I’ve read and very much enjoyed
<a href="https://archive.org/details/highnoon00kare">High Noon</a> as well as
<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunburstascentof00hall">Sunburst</a> — dealing with
recent history there’s the privilege of having plenty of primary sources
readily available, which is great. When it comes to the Porsche book, I find it
fascinating to read about the most common usage scenarios of Sun servers in the
'90s, and I can’t help but feel sorry for the admin who didn’t know that for
SunOS 4, only filenames up to 14 characters long are cached in the Directory
Name Lookup Cache (DNLC). In this article, however, I want to focus on the
information contained in the book which is still valid today.  In a world that
moves as quickly as the world of computing, you could argue that all books are
outdated to begin with. If some of the information in "Sun Performance and
Tuning" was valid in 1994 and is still valid in 2021, there’s a good chance
that it will still be valid 30 years from now.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we can categorize tech knowledge as follows: theoretical
knowledge, generic practical information, and implementation details. Of the
three, theoretical knowledge is the most likely to stay relevant with time,
followed by generic practical information which might still apply some years
later, and finally implementation details which are very likely to become
irrelevant as time goes by. Those details are far from being useless however:
in fact they provide the distinction between novice and experienced
practitioner. To give an example: the chapter about Networks opens with a
description of the built-in <strong>le</strong> network interface, pointing out that it shared
its DMA connection with the SCSI interface. Crucially, the network interface had
higher priority: heavy network activity was likely to reduce disk throughput. In
1994 you would have needed to see multiple workstations with bad disk
performance before concluding that network traffic had anything to do with it — or read the book.</p>
<p>But what is the content that stood the test of time?</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_configuration_factors_and_levels">Configuration Factors and Levels</h2>
<div>
<p>When performing a set of tests, there are multiple settings and knobs one can
work with, each having various options to choose from. Which filesystem are we
using?  What’s the version of the application we’re testing? Kernel buffer
size?</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><b>Factor</b></td><td><b>Level</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Filesystem type</td><td>ext4, xfs, btrfs,...</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS version</td><td>5.10.16, 5.11, ...</td></tr>
<tr><td>vm.dirty_ratio kernel setting</td><td>20, 40, 60, ...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To measure every combination of 6 different factors with 4 levels each would
take 4^6 = 4096 measurements, which clearly is madness. By reducing the levels
we consider to 2, still evaluating all 6 different factors in all possible
combination, we get down to 2^6 = 64 measurements instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_throughput_response_time_utilization">Throughput, Response Time, Utilization</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Throughput</strong> — the amount of work performed in a given amount of time — was a
thing in the '60s, it’s the same thing today, and it will still be <strong>work/time</strong>
in 2050. Your web server might have a maximum throughput of 10000 requests per
second (rps), that’s something you can use to compare it with another one.
<strong>Response time</strong> (latency) is defined as the amount of time the user has to
wait.  For example, how long did a given database transaction take.
<strong>Utilization</strong> is how much of the computer’s resources were used to do the work.
The values reported by <code>sar</code> and <code>iostat</code>, two tools very much still in use
today, are an example of Utilization measures.</p>
<p>The author suggests taking multiple <code>sar</code> Utilization measurements at various
load levels and combine them with <code>awk</code> to get an overview of how the system
behaves. We do have <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>,
<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>, and friends nowadays, but the <code>sar | awk</code> idea
is a useful reminder that quick, simple measurements can go a long way too!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_vmstat_sar_and_iostat_rules">vmstat, sar and iostat Rules</h2>
<div>
<p><code>vmstat</code> and <code>sar</code> are described in detail, with a focus on runnable queue,
blocked queue, swap usage, and so forth. The Linux versions of <code>vmstat</code> and
<code>sar</code> from <a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps">procps</a> and
<a href="http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/">sysstat</a> are a bit different than
the Solaris ones, but the main ideas still apply.</p>
<p>The three commands are also used in the <strong>Rules and Tunables Quick Reference
Tables</strong> section. For each subsystem (Disk, Network, Memory, CPU), the author
specified a list of Rules involving the commands and the action to take if the
rule applies. Rules consist in the name of the command with any options, then a
"." followed by the name of the variable to take into account. For example, the
following indicates a disk bottleneck: <code>35%  &lt; iostat-D30.util &lt; 65%</code>. The
action to take is to try balance the I/O load on other disks too, or get more
disks.</p>
<p>A contemporary version of those rules for Linux would be great to have.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_interrupt_distribution_tuning">Interrupt Distribution Tuning</h2>
<div>
<p>Interrupts in Solaris 2.2 were load-balanced among all available CPUs. The
drawback was that, in case of heavy interrupt load from a given device, cache
hit rate would suffer: the OS allowed to statically assign IRQs to CPUs as an
improvement instead.</p>
<p>Nowadays a very similar problem occurs with the <code>irqbalance</code> daemon on Linux,
which on systems doing lots of network activity should not be used. SMP
affinity should instead be configured to ensure the interrupts of multiqueue
network cards are statically mapped among CPUs.</p>
<p>There’s more information in "Sun Performance and Tuning" that can still provide
valuable lessons today, as well as some true historical gems for those into
such things. Go <a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">check it
out</a> on the Internet Archive if you’re interested!</p>

<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>One of the favorite activities of tech analysts, VCs and similar Twitter armchair experts is to predict what the next big technology platform might be.</p>



<p>The usual suspects that come up in these conversations are VR/AR, crypto, smart speakers and similar IoT devices. A new contestant that I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNorgard/status/1108755070642880512">seen</a> <a href="https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2019/11/19/airpods-are-becoming-a-platform">come up</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1177619897884368904">more</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings/status/1215425809944543240">frequently</a> in these debates recently are Apple’s AirPods.</p>



<p>Calling AirPods “the next big platform” is interesting because at the moment, they are not even a small platform. They are no platform at all. They are just a piece of hardware. </p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean they can’t become platform.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/platform.png"></p><p><span>02</span> What is a platform?</p>



<p>Let’s first take a look at what a platform actually is.</p>



<p>At its core, a platform is something that others can build on top of. A classic example would be an operating system like iOS: By providing a set of APIs, Apple created a playground for developers to build and run applications on. In fact, new input capabilities such as the touch interface, gyroscope sensor and camera allowed developers to create unique applications that weren’t possible before. </p>



<p>Platforms are subject to network effects: More applications attract more users to the platform, while more users in turn attract more developers who build more apps. </p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flywheel.png"></p><p>It’s a classic flywheel effect that creates powerful winner-takes-all dynamics. This explains why there are only two (meaningful) mobile operating systems – iOS and Android. </p>



<p>It also explains why everyone is so interested in upcoming platforms – and why Apple might be interested in making AirPods a platform.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Why AirPods aren’t a platform</p>



<p>In their current form, AirPods are not a platform. They don’t provide any unique input or output functionalities that developers could leverage. Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode are neat but not new or Airpods-exclusive features – other headphones offer exactly the same. In either case, developers don’t have any control over them and thus can’t build applications that use these functionalities.</p>



<p>Some say that AirPods will give rise to more audio apps because they are “always in” which in turn will lead to more (and perhaps new forms of) audio content. That might be true – content providers are always looking for <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/26/newsletters-and-alternative-trade-routes/">alternative routes</a> to get consumers’ attention – but, again, it does not make AirPods a platform. You can use any other pair of headphones to use these audio apps as well.</p>



<p>If Apple wants to make AirPods a platform, it needs to open up some part of the AirPods experience to developers so that they can build new things on top of it.</p>



<p><span>04</span> On Siri &amp; Voice Platforms</p>



<p>The most obvious choice here is Siri, which is already integrated into every pair of AirPods.</p>



<p>In contrast to other voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, Apple has never really opened up Siri for 3rd-party developers. If they did, it would create a new platform that could have its own ecosystem of apps and developers.</p>



<p>But I’m not convinced that this is Apple’s best option.<br>Let me explain why.</p>



<p>Opening up Siri wouldn’t make AirPods a platform, it would make Siri a platform. This might sound like a technicality, but I think it’s an important difference. As <a href="https://twitter.com/einkoenig">Jan König</a> <a href="https://context-first.com/alexa-please-send-this-to-my-screen-6f4839eb415a">brilliantly summarized in this article</a>, voice isn’t an interface for <em>one</em> device – it’s an interface <em>across</em> devices. It’s more of a meta-layer that should tie different products together to enable multi-device experiences.</p>



<p>This means Apple has little interest in making Siri an AirPods-exclusive. Voice-based computing works best when it’s everywhere. It’s about reach, not exclusivity. This is part of the reason why Google and Amazon excel at it.</p>



<p>At the moment, Siri’s capabilities are considerably behind those of Google Assistant and Alexa. Again, this isn’t overly surprising: Google’s and Amazon’s main job is finding the right answers to users’ questions. The required ML capabilities for a smart assistant are among the core competencies of these two companies.</p>



<p>But even Amazon and Google haven’t really figured out the platform part yet, as indicated by the lack of breakout 3rd-party voice applications. It seems like the two platforms are still looking for their product-market-fit beyond being just cheap speakers that you can also control with your voice.</p>



<p>This is partly because the above-mentioned use case of voice as a cross-device layer isn’t something developers can build with the current set of APIs. </p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/voiceonlyinterfaces-3.png"></p><p>The other big reason I see is that people are mistaking voice as a replacement for other interfaces. Movies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6p6MfLBxc">Her</a> paint a future where human-computer-interaction primarily occurs via voice-powered smart assistants, but in reality, voice isn’t great as a primary or stand-alone interface. It works best as an *additional* input/output channel that augments whatever else you are doing.</p>



<p>Let me give you an example: Saying “Hey Google, turn up the volume” takes 10x longer than simply pressing the volume-up button on your phone. It only makes sense when your hands are busy doing other things (kitchen work, for example).</p>



<p>The most convincing voice app I have seen to date was at a hackathon where a team <a href="https://upsidelab.io/blog/design-voice-user-interface-starcraft/">used the StarCraft API to build voice-enabled game commands</a>. Not to replace your mouse and keyboard but to give you an additional input mechanism. Actual multitasking.</p>



<p><span>05</span> What Apple Should Build</p>



<p>I’m not against Apple opening Siri for developers. On the contrary, given that AirPods are meant to be worn all the time, a voice interface for situations that require multitasking is actually a very good idea. But voice input should remain the exceptional case. And it shouldn’t be what makes AirPods a platform.</p>



<p>Instead of voice, I’d love to see other input mechanisms that allow developers to build new ways for users to interact with the audio content they consume.</p>



<p>Most headsets currently on the market offer the following actions with one (or multiple) clicks of a physical button:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/earpodsremote-1.png"></p><p>These inputs were invented a long time ago and there has been almost zero innovation since. <strong>Why has no one thought about additional buttons or click mechanisms that allow users to interact with the actual content?</strong></p>



<p>For example, when listening to podcasts I often find myself wanting to bookmark things that are being talked about. It would be amazing if I could simply tap a button on my headphones which would add a timestamp to a bookmarks section of my podcast app. <span>(Or better even, a transcript of the ~15 seconds of content before I pressed the button, which are then also automatically added to my notes app via an Apple Shortcut.)</span></p>



<p>Yes, you could build the same with voice as the input mechanism, but as we discussed earlier, saying <em>“Hey Siri, please bookmark this!”</em> just doesn’t seem very convenient.</p>



<p>While podcast apps might use the additional button as a bookmarking feature, Spotify could make it a Like button to quickly add songs to your Favorites playlist. Other developers could build completely new applications: Think about interactive audiobooks or similar two-way audio experiences, for example. </p>



<p>This is the beauty of platforms: You just provide developers with a set of tools and they will come up with use cases you hadn’t even thought about. Crowdsourced value creation.</p>



<p><span>06</span> Closing Thoughts</p>



<p>(1) The input mechanism I describe doesn’t have to be a physical button. In fact, gesture-based inputs might be even more convenient. If AirPods had built-in accelerometers, users could interact with audio content by nodding or shaking their heads. Radar-based sensors like Google’s Motion Sense could also create an interesting new interaction language for audio content.</p>



<p>(2) You could also think about the Apple Watch as the main input device. In contrast to the AirPods, Apple opened the Watch for developers from the start, but it hasn’t really seen much success as a platform. Perhaps a combination of Watch and AirPods has a better chance of creating an ecosystem with its own unique applications?</p>



<p>(3) One thing to keep in mind is that Apple doesn’t really have an interest in making AirPods a standalone platform. The iPhone (or rather iOS) will always be the core platform that Apple cares about. Instead of separate iPhone, Watch and AirPods ecosystems, think about Apple’s strategy as more of a multi-platform bundle. Even as a platform, AirPods will remain more of an accessory that adds stickiness to the existing iPhone ecosystem.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard that phrase in TV and movies, in fact, it’s become quite cliché in my opinion. I recently watched an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc9TDjhaYg8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc9TDjhaYg8" target="_blank">interview with Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen</a> from 2018 where Paul discusses how he got the role of Vision in Avengers: Age of Ultron. In the interview, he says he had a meeting with a producer that told him he was done in Hollywood, and immediately following that meeting he [Bettany] received a phone call from Joss Whedon offering him the part of Vision. This story reminded me of the time that I was told I would “never work in this town again”.</p>



<p>Years ago, while living and working in Greenville, South Carolina, I was unhappy with my job and I was trying to break out of it. I was looking for another position in local marketing agencies as a web developer. At the time, I had zero connections to the <a href="https://stevenwadejr.com/2016/03/03/starting-a-user-group/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://stevenwadejr.com/2016/03/03/starting-a-user-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local community</a> and did all of my job searching with Google: “php developer greenville sc”. Despite the no networking abilities, no connections, and poor job search skills, I found a local shop that was more web development than marketing, and they were hiring. Their website’s job description included a link to an online application with the usual resume upload and personal info, but it also included a questionnaire wanting more specifics on experience, programming style, and various bits and bobs. So, I started filling out the application. That’s when I received a phone call.</p>



<p>A local recruiter, who shall not be named, from a local recruiting agency, that too will remain nameless, phoned me up. They had seen my profile on LinkedIn and had an opportunity for me. They told me all about the company and the position and it all sounded great. I was excited about the possibility of interviewing there, so the recruiter agreed to send them my information. At the end of the call, he revealed the name of the company he was hiring for. It was the same company I had tracked down myself and was in the middle of applying for.</p>



<p>After the phone call, I went back to my browser and looked at my half completed application. The direct application was asking many more questions than the recruiter asked me, so in my inexperienced and young mind, I thought “hey, I’ll just finish filling this out and when they get my resume from the recruiter, they’ll have a little extra info on me for the interview”. I didn’t see anything wrong with my thinking. I thought it would help my chances. I was wrong.</p>



<p>The next day I got a call from the recruiter. Excited and thinking it was to schedule an interview, I answered the phone. I was immediately berated with accusations of “double submittal” and trying to “screw” the recruiter. I was in shock. I casually explained that I had already been in the middle of an application and decided to finish it as the company was asking more specific questions than the recruiter did. I also explained that since the recruiter was sending my info over, I didn’t see how it was a “double submittal”. The recruiter wasn’t having any of it, and then he hit me with “I’ll make sure you never work in this town again”.</p>



<p>I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. I was nervous and scared. Could this person really prevent me from getting another job in my city? Logically I knew he couldn’t, but emotions are quicker to the brain than logic. Years later I would become friends with the owners of the company that I had attempted to interview with and they remembered the incident. They told me the same recruiter threatened to blackball their company if they hired me.</p>



<p>Needless to say, I did not get the interview. A few months after the incident, I received a cold call from a local business owner about a different opportunity in town that was a bigger step up than the one I had attempted to get earlier. I took the job which eventually led to other possibilities and eventually to where I am now, a full-time remote Software Engineer working for an international company. So I guess that recruiter was right, I never did work in that town again.</p>

<br/>
February 16, 2021 | https://materialize.com/temporal-filters/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.com/temporal-filters/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a> provides a SQL interface to work with continually changing data. You write SQL queries as if against static data, and then as your data change we keep the results of your queries automatically up to date, in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Materialize leans hard into the ideal that SQL is what you know best, and what you want to use to look at streaming data. At the same time, there are several tantalizing concepts that native stream processors provide that aren’t obviously possible with standard SQL.</p>
<p>Today we’ll look at how to perform time-windowed computation over temporal data.</p>
<h2>Temporal Data</h2>
<p>Temporal databases are a pretty neat thing, and we aren’t going to go deep on that today. Instead, let’s just start with a relation that has a pretty simple schema, and which includes some times.</p>
<pre><code>-- Making a new data source.
CREATE TABLE events (
    content text,
    insert_ts numeric,
    delete_ts numeric
);
</code></pre>
<p>We have some content, clearly you could fluff that up to something more interesting, and two additional columns. The <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code> columns will play the role of timestamps, indicating when an event should first appear and when it should be removed.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all just data right now. These are fields, and you could put whatever you want in them. They don’t have any specific meaning yet. You could make <code>delete_ts</code> be smaller than <code>insert_ts</code>, if you are that sort of person.</p>
<h2>Time-Windowed Queries</h2>
<p>The question is now what do you do with these data?</p>
<p>In Materialize, you can ask questions that grab the “logical time” for your query (roughly: the wall clock when you run the query) and then use that in your query’s logic. For example, this query counts up <code>content</code> based on events that start by and end after the current logical timestamp.</p>
<pre><code>-- Reduce down to counts within a time interval.
SELECT content, count(*)
FROM events
WHERE mz_logical_timestamp() &gt;= insert_ts
  AND mz_logical_timestamp()  &lt; delete_ts
GROUP BY content;
</code></pre>
<p>This query will change its results over time. Not just because you might add to and remove from <code>events</code>, but because <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> advances as you stare at your screen. Each time you issue the query you may get a different result.</p>
<p>This looks like a great query! What’s not to like?</p>
<p>The main issue really is that it is <em>just a query</em>. You can ask this question over and over, but you can also ask the same thing with an arbitrary timestamp in place of <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code>. To support that, Materialize has to keep the entire collection of data around. Your <code>events</code> table will grow and grow and grow, and the time to answer the query will grow as well.</p>
<h2>Time-Windowed Computation</h2>
<p>Materialize specializes at <em>maintaining</em> computations like the above, both because that can make it faster to get your answers out, but also because by specifying what you actually need Materialize can run much more lean. We’ll see that now with the query above!</p>
<p>Until recently, if you tried to create a materialized view of the query above, Materialize would tell you to take a hike. The subject of this post is that you can now do it. Moreover, comparing parts of your data to <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> in views (rather than just in queries) introduces powerful new idioms, ones that we’ll explore in this post.</p>
<pre><code>-- Maintained collection of only valid results.
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW valid_events AS
SELECT content, count(*)
FROM events
WHERE mz_logical_timestamp() &gt;= insert_ts
  AND mz_logical_timestamp()  &lt; delete_ts
GROUP BY content;
</code></pre>
<p>What’s all this then?</p>
<p>Presumably <code>valid_events</code> has the property that if you <code>SELECT</code> from it you should see the same results as for the time-windowed <code>SELECT</code> in the previous section. That is 100% true.</p>
<p>What is also true is that <code>valid_events</code> has enough information from you, in the form of the query itself, to maintain only enough historical detail to answer these <code>SELECT</code> queries from now onward. Once Materialize’s <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> passes a record’s <code>delete_ts</code> it cannot be seen (at least not through this view), and Materialize can dispose of the event. The in-memory footprint of <code>valid_events</code> stays bounded by the number of records in the system that could still satisfy this constraint (those records that are currently valid, or who may yet become valid in the future).</p>
<p>While you add to <code>events</code>, Materialize collects up the events that are no longer visible, automatically. Of course, you can also <em>change</em> the records in <code>events</code>, in case you want to remove some events early, or draw out the <code>delete_ts</code> of any record, or replace one event with its next stage (and new <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code>). If you happen to adjust any fields that interact with <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> Materialize will update the views appropriately.</p>
<h2>A Brief Example</h2>
<p>Let’s do some testing with our table and maintained view. Tables have the nice property that we can interactively update them from within Materialize, rather than spinning up a Kafka cluster.</p>
<p>Let’s start with something simple: we’ll just look at the records currently present in our <code>valid_events</code> view. Let’s define a different view to do that, though, without the aggregation so you can see the raw data:</p>
<pre><code>-- Maintained collection of only valid results.
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW valid AS
SELECT content, insert_ts, delete_ts
FROM events
WHERE mz_logical_timestamp() &gt;= insert_ts
  AND mz_logical_timestamp()  &lt; delete_ts
</code></pre>
<p>We’ll print out the things in our view, along with the current logical timestamp. It is initially empty, because we haven’t put any data in. But, these are the columns we’ll be looking at.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content | insert_ts | delete_ts | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+-----------+-----------+----------------------
(0 rows)

materialize=&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s put some data in there. I’m going to just take advantage of the fact that <code>INSERT</code> statements can also use <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> to populate the data with some records that we will make last five seconds.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; insert into events VALUES (
    'hello',
    mz_logical_timestamp(),
    mz_logical_timestamp() + 5000
);
materialize=&gt; insert into events VALUES (
    'hello',
    mz_logical_timestamp(),
    mz_logical_timestamp() + 5000
);
materialize=&gt; insert into events VALUES (
    'hello',
    mz_logical_timestamp(),
    mz_logical_timestamp() + 5000
);
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these were executed by me, a human, and so almost certainly got different <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code> timestamps. We’ll see them in just a moment!</p>
<p>Next, I typed <em>incredibly fast</em> to see the output for the query; what was previously empty just up above:</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084609890 | 1613084614890 |        1613084613168
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084613168
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084613168
(3 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code> values are indeed <code>5000</code> apart, and for each of the outputs the <code>mz_logical_timestamp</code> lies between the two. What happens if we type the query again, very quickly?</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084609890 | 1613084614890 |        1613084613988
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084613988
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084613988
(3 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>mz_logical_timestamp</code> values have increased. We still see all of the record, as the timestamp hasn’t increased enough to fall outside the five second bound yet. We type again ..</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084609890 | 1613084614890 |        1613084614843
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084614843
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084614843
(3 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>.. and the timestamp increases again ..</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;

<p>.. and we lost one! Now that <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> has reached <code>1613084614890</code> that record no longer satisfies the predicate, and is no longer present in the view.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;

---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084616392

<p>One more has dropped out.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content | insert_ts | delete_ts | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+-----------+-----------+----------------------
(0 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>Ah, they are all gone. My fingers can rest now.</p>
<p>Although this looks rather similar to re-typing the <code>SELECT</code> query that explicitly filters against <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code>, the difference here is that everything is dataflow with updates flowing through it. If we were to <code>TAIL</code> the view, we would see exactly the moments at which the collection changes, without polling the system repeatedly.</p>
<p>And of course, we can handle a substantially higher volume of updates than if we were continually re-scanning the entire collection.</p>
<h2>Windows: Sliding and Tumbling</h2>
<p>The pattern we saw above was actually very powerful: records could state both their insertion and deletion times. If a record wants to be around for 10s it can do that, if it wants to stay for a year or forever, it could do that too (note: please read further before choosing to do that).</p>
<p>But, let’s check out some other idioms.</p>

Now that we have data to compare pre and post pandemic usage, let’s revisit the same group of online learning providers:</p>

<p>At least in the West, the impact of the pandemic as far as restrictions and shelter-at-home orders didn’t kick in until March/2020 (late February in a few places). So the chart above is the first comparison of usage <strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong> the effects of the pandemic. Data indicates that major online learning platforms enjoyed a banner year. Many of them grew by double digits year-over-year: Udemy, Coursera, edX, Skillshare, and Pluralsight all grew by more 10%. Traffic to Coursera jumped 75%!</p>
<p>A major reason behind this growth is the increasing popularity of <em>micro-credentials</em> ⎼ series of courses that let students demonstrate competence in specific areas. With micro-credentials, students typically get badges or certificates upon completion, and depending on the program, they are able to <em>combine and stack</em> different micro-credentials towards a more comprehensive qualification. I have spoken to several people who have started micro-credential programs over the last year and I get the sense that they are representative of what’s happening in online learning. With many people sheltering in place, micro-credential programs are booming.</p>
<p>All of the major online learning platforms offer micro-credentials in many different disciplines and subjects, here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>edX offers more than sixty <a href="https://www.edx.org/micromasters">MicroMasters®</a> degrees.</li>
<li>Coursera offers <a href="https://www.coursera.org/browse">Specializations, Certificates, and Degree Programs</a>.</li>
<li>Linkedin Learning offers 150 different <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/business?entityType=LEARNING_PATH">Learning Paths</a>.</li>
<li>Traditional Universities are beginning to acknowledge demand for micro-credentials and some well-known public institutions in the U.S. are rolling out offerings: <a href="https://gradpathways.ucdavis.edu/micro-credentials">UC Davis</a>, <a href="https://system.suny.edu/academic-affairs/microcredentials/">SUNY</a>, <a href="https://www.unh.edu/continuingeducation/micro-credentials/about">UNH</a> – just to name a few.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few trends make me think that&nbsp;online learning platforms will be able to maintain at least some of the growth we’re seeing once the world returns to normal. First of all digital transformation is fueling demand for skilled workers across all industries and traditional educational institutions alone cannot meet demand. Secondly employees realize that they increasingly need to keep their skills up to date, and online learning platforms are just so much more cost-effective and convenient.</p>
<p>Finally, the pandemic has caused many to question the cost of higher education. This is particularly true in the U.S. where there’s already a looming <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/how-student-debt-became-a-1point6-trillion-crisis.html">crisis in student loans</a>. While I think the <strong><em>top</em></strong> private and public Colleges and Universities have enough brand power to hold off more affordable alternatives, many academic institutions will have difficulty countering lower cost and more convenient alternatives. It’s hard to fault people who want to continue to study from the comfort of their home, while focusing only on the topics they are most passionate about!</p>

                    <div data-clipboard="Copy link to clipboard."><p>One of the best ways to make software more accessible is to reduce the hardware resources needed to run it. Blockchain software is no exception. The XRP Ledger is already <a href="https://xrpl.org/carbon-calculator.html">one of the greenest blockchains</a> due to its pioneering consensus protocol, but its ecosystem can still benefit from more efficient resource usage. Reduced inefficiencies benefit businesses, developers, and enthusiasts alike.</p><p>So how much can we really improve?</p><p>The C++ team at Ripple spent a significant amount of time in 2020 focusing on how to make better use of available system resources. We're proud to report that, compared to previous versions, the improvements we've contributed to version 1.7.0 of <code>rippled</code>, our reference implementation of the XRP Ledger server, cut its memory usage to <em>less than half</em>.</p><p>That's not a typo and these aren't theoretical numbers. These are <em>real-world</em> improvements of more than 50% in servers running <code>rippled</code> on the XRP Ledger mainnet. The operator of <a href="https://alloy.ee/">alloy.ee</a> calls it "sheer voodoo":</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1.7b9 is sheer voodoo - The higher one is 1.6.0 <a href="https://t.co/NOlqAmpvBU">pic.twitter.com/NOlqAmpvBU</a></p>— Alloy Networks (@alloynetworks) <a href="https://twitter.com/alloynetworks/status/1341495806893973506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>"Sheer voodoo"</figcaption></figure><p>Keep reading to learn the technical details that made this engineering work possible.</p><p>Alongside our other experiments, we set out to measure and understand how <code>rippled</code> uses resources and how to improve it.</p><p>As a result of these measurements, we contributed support for link compression in <a href="https://xrpl.org/blog/2020/rippled-1.6.0.html">version 1.6.0</a>, which reduces the amount of bandwidth used by servers, benefiting operators of single servers and large clusters alike.</p><p>We're also working on optimizing how messages are propagated or routed throughout the XRP Ledger network so that every server receives everything it needs to know without getting redundant copies of info.</p><p>However, the primary pain-point for many operators of the software is RAM usage. Memory is a critical and scarce resource. Reducing the amount required by the server could have an outsized impact on the performance of individual servers, and potentially, the network as a whole.</p><p>To get the best return on our effort, we focused on identifying what parts of the server used the most RAM and experimented with what we could do about them.</p><h2 id="understanding-shamap"><strong>Understanding SHAMap</strong></h2><p>In <code>rippled</code>, one of the largest targets was the SHAMap and its constituent parts—specifically, the nodes within the SHAMap's tree-like structure.</p><p>This data structure holds the state of <a href="https://xrpl.org/ledgers.html">the ledger itself</a>—all the accounts, balances, settings, exchange orders, and everything else the XRP Ledger tracks. On the mainnet, the SHAMap consists of millions of nodes, which means that even small savings in the size of individual nodes can result in large savings overall.</p><p>More precisely, the SHAMap is a combination of a <a href="https://medium.com/@theblockchaincafe/what-is-merkle-tree-complete-guide-for-beginners-9bcf4631bb19">Merkle tree</a> and a <a href="https://medium.com/basecs/compressing-radix-trees-without-too-many-tears-a2e658adb9a0">Radix tree</a> with a branching factor of 16. This branching factor is especially relevant in this instance. It means that the <em>inner nodes</em> in the tree (the nodes other than the "leaves") can have <em>up to</em> 16 children. For example, consider this simple tree:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/2021/02/Tree-01.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Tree-01.png 600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Tree-01.png 1000w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Tree-01.png 1600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Tree-01.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Each node has 16 children, whether they point to something or not. And that was the key insight: just because nodes can have <em>up to</em> 16 children doesn't mean that they actually do in practice.</p><p>The question then became, how many children does a "typical" inner node have? We gathered data from Ripple-operated servers, which resulted in the following distribution:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/2021/02/Histogram.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Histogram.png 600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Histogram.png 1000w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Histogram.png 1600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Histogram.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>The data we collected shows that most inner nodes only have a handful of children. With that in mind, we examined if the nodes of the tree could be adjusted, at runtime, to accommodate only as many children as they needed.</p><p>In other words, what if we changed the tree to look more like this?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/2021/02/Tree-02.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Tree-02.png 600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Tree-02.png 1000w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Tree-02.png 1600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Tree-02.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="the-naive-shamap-design"><strong>The Naive SHAMap Design</strong></h3><p>The SHAMap is a tree-like data structure where keys are 256-bit hashes, and a node in the tree (other than the leaves), can have up to 16 children. Children are always stored as a 256-bit hash value that can be used to retrieve the child node from a database. Children are also sometimes cached directly in a node for quick traversal.</p><p>The original implementation of the non-leaf nodes had a C++ class that looked a bit like this:</p><pre><code>struct SHAMapInnerNode {
    std::bitset&lt;16&gt; isBranch_;
    SHAMapHash hashes_[16];
    std::shared_ptr&lt;SHAMapTreeNode&gt; cachedChildren_[16];
}</code></pre><p>To traverse the tree, the code looks at the 256-bit key four bits at a time. These 4-bit numbers represent which of the sixteen children to transition to next. This means the children are ordered, and it's possible that some branches (such as 2, 5, and 7) are occupied while the rest are empty.</p><p>The <code>isBranch_</code><em> </em>variable tracks which branches have children and which are empty, but the <code>hashes_[16]</code> array always leaves space for sixteen 256-bit identifiers anyway.</p><h3 id="sparse-shamap"><strong>Sparse SHAMap</strong></h3><p>Instead of always storing sixteen children, we want to use a space-saving sparse representation when there are only a few children and only switch to the dense representation when there are more children.</p><p>Such a representation could look like this:</p><pre><code>struct SHAMapInnerNode {
    std::bitset&lt;16&gt; isBranch_;
    SHAMapHash* hashes_;
    std::shared_ptr&lt;SHAMapTreeNode&gt;* cachedChildren_;
    std::uint8_t arraySize_;
}
</code></pre><p>A sparse representation would store <code>hashes_</code> and <code>cachedChildren_</code> without gaps. For example, if branches 2, 5, and 7 are occupied while the rest are empty, then <code>hashes_</code> would store these values at indexes 0, 1, and 2. To look up a child in a sparse array, count how many non-empty branches come before it.</p><p>For example, if branches 2, 5, and 7 are occupied, and you want to find the child in branch 5, there's 1 branch with an index less than 5, so you'd look at array index 1 of the <code>hashes_</code> array.</p><p>How much memory does this save? Each hash is 256 bits—that's 32 bytes—and each shared pointer is 16 bytes. That means that every time the sparse representation doesn't leave empty space for a nonexistent child that the naive, dense implementation would have, you save 48 bytes.</p><p>With the data we had collected on how many children the nodes in the SHAMap really had when used in production, we could calculate how much memory could be saved by using a sparse representation.</p><p>The following Python code demonstrates how to perform such a calculation:</p><pre><code>def savings(child_hist, arg_indexes):
"""
Given a histogram of the number of children, and the array size boundaries,
calculate the ratio of memory used for a sparse representation/memory used
for a dense representation
"""
if not arg_indexes:
	return 1.0
# add one (and copy so we don't modify original list)
indexes = [a+1 for a in arg_indexes]
	if indexes[0] != 0:
indexes.insert(0, 0)
	if indexes[-1] != 17:
indexes.append(17)
per_child_bytes = 48.0 # 32 for the hash 16 for the shared_ptr
dense_bytes = 16.0 * per_child_bytes * sum(child_hist)
sparse_bytes = 0.0
	for i in range(1, len(indexes)):
		sparse_bytes += ((indexes[i]-1) *
				per_child_bytes *
				sum(child_hist[indexes[i-1]:indexes[i]])
				)
return (sparse_bytes/dense_bytes)</code></pre><h2 id="how-sparse-to-go"><strong>How Sparse to Go?</strong></h2><p>It was clear that a sparse representation could save a substantial amount of memory, but the next challenge was to determine how sparse to go.</p><p>If we used 16 different sparse array sizes, one for every possible number of children, then no space would be wasted at all. But doing that brings in other costs. For example, when you have a size-10 array and you need to add an 11th child, you need to allocate space for a size-11 array and copy all 10 existing entries into the new array.</p><p>Another approach is to have just two sizes of arrays. For example, you might use a sparse array with room for up to 5 children, and a dense array when you need to hold 6 to 16.</p><p>This approach still wastes some space (i.e. when the sparse array has just 1 of its 5 spots occupied, or when the dense array uses only 6 or 7 of its 16 spots, it's simpler and faster than constantly changing the size of the array). Alternatively, we could have different 3 sizes or more (i.e. 3, 6, 16).</p><p>To decide between all the possibilities, we had to consider the trade-offs of different numbers of sparse array sizes. This kind of analysis is common in engineering and even in other disciplines; it's kind of like deciding how many different sizes of jeans you want to manufacture to make the most profit.</p><p>In our case, we considered all of the following in deciding how to approach the problem:</p><ol><li>Costs of moving data when the sparse array changes representations. If you need to add a child and the current sparse array is full, you need to allocate a new array and move the data into it.</li><li>Costs of inserting and removing data in the sparse array. Since the sparse arrays are sorted, you have to move elements around whenever you add or remove children from them. Keeping the sparse arrays small reduces the amount of data movement necessary.</li><li>Space savings. The more sparse array sizes, the greater the savings. However, we expected diminishing returns from each additional size option.</li><li>Implementation considerations. A tagged pointer (described below) can be used to store a small number of bits without using additional space. Keeping the number of array sizes below this number results in additional savings.</li></ol><p>Fortunately, we didn't have to make these decisions based on pure intuition and generalizations. Using our histogram data, we could calculate the actual space savings of various numbers and sizes of sparse arrays, which helped us figure out where the diminishing returns actually kicked in.</p><p>The following code helps compute this.</p><pre><code>def savings_dim(dim=1):
	if dim == 0:
		s = savings(collected_child_histogram, [])
		return ([s], [()], 0)
	args = [arg for arg in itertools.combinations(range(17),dim)]
	r = [savings(collected_child_histogram, arg) for arg in args]
	return (r, args, numpy.argmin(r))

def doit():
	result = []
	for dim in range(17):
		r, args, arg_min = savings_dim(dim)
		result.append([r[arg_min], args[arg_min]])
	return result

</code></pre><p>This gives the following result:</p><pre><code>[[1.000, ()],
[0.384, (5,)],
[0.293, (3, 6)],
[0.259, (2, 4, 6)],
[0.246, (2, 3, 5, …</code></pre></div></div></section></article></div>

<p>If you ever had a look at <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_globex.html">CME’s Bitcoin futures</a>, you might have noticed that there are multiple contracts – one for each month, and that they have different prices. Systematically, the futures contracts for months that are further away, are more expensive than those with closer expiration, and also cheaper than spot. When this happens for a commodity like oil, we’re talking about contango.</p>



<p>This is usually due to the fact that there’s a risk premium on the uncertainty of the future, and it costs a little bit to be sure of the price that you’ll pay for something three months from now. But for futures on financial products, it’s very rare. Currently, the premium for Bitcoin is a whopping 2% per month, and it’s a red warning sign.</p>



<h3>Term structure of Bitcoin futures</h3>



<p>The reason contango for commodities like oil is normal, is that you can’t arbitrage it. The way to arbitrage contango is to buy spot, short the future, wait till expiry, and collect the premium. But you can’t simply “wait” when you buy thousands of barrels of oil – you have to store those barrels somewhere, and it will cost you an arm and a leg. The storage costs will eat up your contango premium, plus some.</p>



<p>There were occurrences in the past where traders were able to arbitrage this premium, but the contango needed to be absolutely off-the-charts (“super-contango”). For instance, after the 2008 financial panic, the spread between spot and futures in the oil market was so big, <a href="https://doc.rero.ch/record/323428/files/TDIBM_Loris_Beltramello.pdf">traders would literally rent tankers and use them as storage facilities</a> for oil, waiting for their futures leg to mature.</p>



<p>The reason contango for financial products isn’t normal, is that you can arbitrage it very easily, as you don’t have storage costs. You buy Bitcoin spot, sell an April future for 4% more than spot, and simply wait two months.</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35.png 952w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35-300x79.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35-768x203.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></figure>



<p>At expiry, you’ll sell your Bitcoin at a certain price, while the future will settle at the exact same price, and you’ll collect the premium. Your only cost is the carry, i.e. the interest you have forfeited on the cash you used to buy Bitcoin, but this is virtually zero today.</p>



<p>Why the premium, then? Why don’t hedge funds with hundreds of billions of dollars to spare don’t arbitrage the Bitcoin contango down to zero?</p>



<h3>Credit risk?</h3>



<p>One quick answer would be that you aren’t guaranteed to close your trade because of counterparty risk. This is what happened when Lehman went bust – all the hedge funds that had OTC derivatives positions with Lehman as one leg of a trade, suddenly saw the “Lehman leg” disappear, while the other leg was still there. Lehman going bust single handedly destroyed the convertible bonds market, as hedge funds who had bought convertible bonds and hedged their risks (credit, volatility, equity risks – you name it) with Lehman, suddenly were out of hedges, and had to sell their cash position (their convertible bonds) at literally any price.</p>



<p>But there is no counterparty risk here. You can’t lose your Bitcoins – you just keep them on chain, and no exchange going bust will affect your position. CME can’t go bust – it has margin calls, initial margin deposits, has a guarantee fund, and is almost explicitly guaranteed by the Fed because of its critical importance to financial markets.</p>



<p>So, again, why is nobody picking those hundred dollar bills lying on the street?</p>



<h3>Systemic risk</h3>



<p>There is one risk that you can’t edge – that of the world collapsing overnight, when there’s nobody left to pay you even if you win your bet. Imagine shorting USDT on Binance. What happens if you’re right and USDT goes to zero? Do you really think Binance will still be around to pay you?</p>



<p>You can always say, “bah, I’ll see it coming, the moment shit starts to hit the fan, I’ll close my positions”. But what if you don’t have the time to do so? What if a black swan event happens overnight?</p>



<p>This is the risk with Bitcoin. A whim from regulators, like passing the STABLE act, and all USDT exchanges go bust. What will happen to Bitcoin futures then? CME uses the “<a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/cryptocurrency-indices.html">Bitcoin Reference Rate</a>” (BRR) to calculate the spot for its Bitcoin futures, which is a weighted average of the spots taken from multiple crypto exchanges, the list of which changes over time. What happens if the Bitcoin ecosystem collapses, the prices of Bitcoin on half of those exchanges go to 100,000 on paper because those exchanges become insolvent and people rush for the exits by buying Bitcoin to try and send it to their own wallets (as happened with MtGox)? Futures skyrocket because of a technicality, CME is slow to react, and you get wiped out on your “short futures” leg – while you can’t really sell the “long Bitcoin” leg either, because every exchange is on fire and nobody processes redemption requests.</p>



<h3>Implied probability of default</h3>



<p>This risk is rewarded handsomely – a big fat 2% per month. With interest rates at zero, we can borrow a formula from the Credit Default Swaps market to calculate the <a href="https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/15986/how-to-compute-the-implied-probability-of-default-from-a-cds-spread#:~:text=Risk%2Dneutral%20default%20probability%20implied,R%20is%20the%20recovery%20rate.&amp;text=Hulls%20equation%20is%20a%20gross,works%20for%20all%20tenor%20points.">implied probability of default</a>, which we’ll <a href="http://nzz-files-prod.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files/4/1/2/cds+deutsche+bank+161214_1.18446412.pdf">simplify to the extreme</a>:</p>



<p><strong>p = S/(1-R)</strong></p>



<p>Where p is the probability of default, S the annual “swap rate” that compensates for that probability, and R the recovery rate, i.e. how much you can expect to recoup from your investment if a default occurs.</p>



<p>In our case, S = 24% (12 months in a year, at 2% for each month), and R ≈ 50% based on what happened after MtGox collapsed. This means that we assume you’ll be able to cash out in the event of an apocalypse with an average 50% loss. Remember, this is assuming that you are hedged!</p>



<p>This gives us an implied probability of default p ≈ 50% over the next year. Again, that’s the probability of the whole Bitcoin ecosystem collapsing overnight, not giving you the time to close your positions, cutting you off from exchanges, and where CME futures no longer trade.</p>



<p>This is the risk as it’s being priced by the market, on relatively liquid financial instruments. So the next time someone tries to explain to you that “Bitcoin is a store of value”, when the chances of it getting utterly destroyed overnight before the year is over are around 50/50, try not to shoot coffee through your nose laughing.</p>

      </p>
<p>
Throughout <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop/dp/1732265119"><em>The Dream Machine</em></a>, a history of the early days of computing, tinkering and having fun was a recurring theme throughout the decades. I wasn’t around to experience the early days of computers myself, but they seemed to be genuinely exciting and rewarding. In the words of MIT sociologist Sherry Turkle: computers empowered their users, making them feel smart[er], “in control”, and “more fully participant in the future”. </p>
<p>
Those feel like odd descriptions for the modern computing experience. Using computers today doesn’t feel like￼ an empowering experience￼. Sometimes it’s mindless and distracting. Sometimes, when a redesign rolls out, or laptop doesn’t wake from sleep mode,￼ it’s downright hostile. The experience of using a computer in 2020 is a concoction of data silos, dinging notifications and reinvented wheels, presented in gratuitously bubble-wrapped UIs hyper-optimized by persnickety product managers and soulless A/B tests. </p>
<p>
For most people, the computing experience is <a href="https://feifan.blog/2020/06/22/no-one-cares-about-software-quality/">clicking around a lot</a>, typing into disparate apps in which your data is trapped except through narrowly-defined, bespoke integrations, and struggling to find <em>that thing you were just reading a few days ago</em> among all the silos. This doesn’t make anyone feel smarter or more in control. It’s simply frustrating.</p>
<p>
Software <em>development</em> is stuck in the doldrums too. A massive amount of cumulative engineering effort is spent rebuilding the same primitives<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a> because the software engineering industry hasn’t convincingly developed platforms at higher levels of abstraction<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>. A significant portion of development effort goes to placating not-invented-here-ness, where companies feel the need to build their own version of every feature, each slightly different (user familiarity be damned). A lot of software is little more than looking up API documentation and plugging one into another. There’s a dearth of creativity, of joy and discovery, of inventing something interesting and new. </p>
<p>
To be fair, computers — both the desktop kind and various mobile kinds — enable<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a> seemingly-impossible<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a> things<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>. But it feels frustrating to see the pioneering spirit that originally led to the development of modern computers giving way to uninspired flat interfaces<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> SaaS apps. The things you can do are limited to bespokely-implemented features, dribbled out only as fast as a small team of designers and developers can think of and build them. Of course you have an extensive list of things you <em>wish</em> your phone/computer/most-used apps could do; everyone does. You know the majority of it will remain a wishlist; there’s almost no hope of the feature you really want being implemented<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. This isn’t empowering. What’s more, new features tend to be one-off improvements and ungainly new ways for you to do more work<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a> rather than adding or improving functionality in a generalized way so you can remix functionality and do things faster.</p>
<p>
For the people who’ve figured out the right incantations to type and buttons-buried-in-submenus to click, computers can automate administrivia, surface information, and make them feel “more fully participant in the future”. But getting there is an arduous journey, and many people get in a place where computers just make things harder. The experience of using computers is, in various ways, awkward and frustrating (and maybe even dangerous<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>) for everyone. Computers were supposed to be bicycles for the mind. So far we only have penny-farthings.</p>

Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer’s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers’ heads. It’s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack “code browsers” that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we’ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
In simple cases, some constructs manifest as naming conventions: prefixes in a name may be a rudimentary way to namespace classes<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, while suffixes may be a rudimentary way to group classes or identify their type<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>. But these are easy examples; many patterns are much more subtle.</p>
<h2>
“Where is this used?”</h2>
<p>
Imagine figuring out “where is this used?”, for various types of “this”:</p>
<p>
Most code editors (perhaps paired with a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a>) can show you where local variables are used. This usually also works for finding where methods are invoked — although perhaps less reliably in dynamic-dispatch languages, or languages without types.</p>
<p>
What if you want to find where instances of a particular model get created? There may be multiple ways to create a model, so this isn’t super simple. In Rails, for example, there’s two built-in ways to create a model: you can either call <code>.new</code> to create a new instance in memory followed by <code>.save</code> to persist it to the database, or call <code>.create</code> to automatically do both. Your particular codebase might have additional wrappers for doing this that you’re supposed to use. Even worse, imagine that sometimes you create a <code>.new</code> instance, then set some properties on it over the next few lines, then finally call <code>.save</code>. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>user = User.new
user.email = '<a href="https://feifan.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="8de5e8e1e1e2cde8f5ece0fde1e8a3eee2e0">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>' unless self.anonymous?
user.save</code></pre>
<p>
Conceptually, that’s still code that creates an instance of a particular model. But with the intervening syntax, this would be a difficult case to find with <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h2>
Static config</h2>
<p>
At <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I work, we have a lot of code for jobs that need to run at certain times each day. For example, we might need to move funds from one financial partner to another at noon UTC each day. Each of these jobs has configuration code describing when and how it should be run, implemented as a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/">DSL</a>. This config might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>run_config RunConfig.new(
  job_name: 'partner-daily-funding',
  env_vars: self.config_env,
  cron: RunConfig::Cron.new(
    schedule: { hour: 12, minute: 0 }
  ),
  owning_team: Company::Team::Liquidity
)</code></pre>
<p>
In our codebase, we have hundreds of these jobs, each with their own <code>run_config</code>. If you look at this codebase as a database, you can imagine these jobs being rows in a <code>jobs</code> table, where the fields on each row correspond to the parameters provided to the <code>RunConfig</code> class. </p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse all these jobs in a table? Maybe you could perform some basic operations on this data: searching for specific jobs by name or owning team; sorting by the time-of-day they’re scheduled to run; filtering for jobs owned by your team that have errored in the past week. Maybe you could edit the <code>run_config</code> from that interface (like you might edit a spreadsheet) and have it automatically make the corresponding change in the source code (or open a PR). Maybe you could even compute some aggregations on this data — for example, if you’re introducing a new job that requires some expensive computation, maybe you’d like to know which hours have the fewest other jobs scheduled. And of course, this job browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each entry that shows the code for the job inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<h2>
Diffused concepts</h2>
<p>
Codebases typically contain logical concepts that are implemented across multiple pieces of code. This is often the case when you need to create multiple files to implement a particular feature.</p>
<p>
For example, in Rails, a “resource” is collectively implemented across a line in the router, a model file, a controller file, and a bunch of view files. Rails even ships with a code generator to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5f3ff60084ab5d5921ca3499814e4697f8350ee7/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/resource/USAGE">create some of these files</a> for you. But despite resources being a core concept when working with Rails, there’s no good way to browse the resources in your codebase<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a>. There’s no good way to filter or query your codebase either — you can’t, for example, see which resources support JSON vs XML params. </p>
<p>
For another example, consider pubsub (aka emitter-consumer) pipelines. In web services, when you have processing that can happen “in the background”, one service will publish an event; another service subscribes to that event and will do the background processing on its own when it receives the event. Often, these will form event “pipelines” or trees where an event consumer will emit additional events that are consumed by yet other services. These pipelines are concepts that developers talk about (as in, the “account creation pipeline” or “funding reconciliation pipeline”), but in most codebases the pipeline itself isn’t declared or reified anywhere in the code.</p>
<p>
If you’re looking at code that emits an event, how do you find the consumers? If you’re lucky, the event has a unique, literal name and the consumer uses that name literally as well. But maybe some subscribers are using wildcard event names, or names generated by string concatenation, and that becomes a lot harder to grep for. Likewise, if you’re looking at a consumer of an event, how do you find the locations in the codebase that could emit that event<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>?</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse those pipelines in a table or perhaps a directed graph<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a>? Maybe that graph would support some basic operations on this data: searching for specific publishers or subscribers by class name or event name; filtering for pipelines that have run into errors; maybe even showing the flow of a particular event given an event ID<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. And of course, this pipeline browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each graph node that shows the code for the publisher or subscriber inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<p>
For a final example, consider code that has functionality inherited from elsewhere. Some environments let you see a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-structure-of-a-source-file.html">list of inherited properties</a> or methods, but this isn’t possible for more specialized cases. At Stripe, we have code that implements shell scripts that can take command-line arguments and flags. These arguments are defined via a DSL in the implementing code, but these commands can be subclassed, and there’s no way to see what the available arguments are while working in the subclass.</p>
<h2>
Philosophy</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to consider these problems not as disparate cases in need of bespoke tooling, but as a <em>class</em> of problems characterized by a lack of access to the data structures embedded within codebases. Just like SQL databases and spreadsheets provide a singular querying abstraction and a set of visualization primitives that can be applied to any kind of data, programming environments need a singular querying abstraction and set of visualization primitives that can be applied to the concepts lurking in codebases. Getting there does <em>not</em> mean using proprietary drag-and-drop visual programming interfaces where the introspection capabilities are limited to whatever the programming environment happens to have implemented. Just the opposite — you should still be able to do whatever you want with your code (including treating it as plain-text files), <em>and also</em> have access to more advanced introspection tools that can query and slice your code — tools that let you easily understand and navigate complex codebases to reduce the <em>incidental complexity</em> of building software.</p>
<h2>
Solutions</h2>
<p>
I don’t have a solution to sell you here (at least, not yet!). But <a href="https://twitter.com/hirday_g/status/1356657607381946369">by popular demand</a> I think it’s worthwhile to at least discuss principles that solutions should embody and directionally-related prior art. </p>
<p>
To start with a simple example, see <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a>, a full-stack web framework similar to Rails. It comes with a web interface for manipulating your project’s codebase and database schema. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbDtS_mUMpI?t=102">One point in the introduction video</a> showed changes being made in the visual schema editor being automatically reflected in the SQL code that describes the database schema — and changes being made to the SQL code being bidirectionally reflected in the visual schema editor. </p>
<p>
For a more in-depth example, consider <a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>, a Smalltalk environment. “Environment” in this case means that it feels like you’re using a custom OS (including global menus, idioms, and keyboard and mouse conventions) designed specifically for browsing, writing, and debugging programs in the Smalltalk programming language<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a>. The holistic integration of these tools is important. Unlike the programming environments we cobble for ourselves today — where the editor is agnostic of the language and runtime and other tools like debuggers, inspectors, and code browsers are tacked on (if they exist at all) — it’s worth thinking about what an entire computing experience <em>for</em> writing and building custom tools might look like<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>
Pharo is also interesting because of its Class Browser, which looks like this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://files.tanagram.app/file/tanagram-data/prod-feifans-blog/database-codebase-pharo-browser.png" alt="Pharo class browser">
</p>
<p>
This browser breaks free from the source code <em>file</em> as the atomic unit of browsing; instead, it allows the user to browse one method at a time. Making the “unit of browsing” …</p></article></div></div></div>

        Why is esbuild fast?
      </h2>
      <p>Several reasons:</p>
      <ul><li><p> It's written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and compiles to native code. </p> <p> Most other bundlers are written in JavaScript, but a command-line application is a worst-case performance situation for a JIT-compiled language. Every time you run your bundler, the JavaScript VM is seeing your bundler's code for the first time without any optimization hints. While esbuild is busy parsing your JavaScript, node is busy parsing your bundler's JavaScript. By the time node has finished parsing your bundler's code, esbuild might have already exited and your bundler hasn't even started bundling yet. </p> <p> In addition, Go is designed from the core for parallelism while JavaScript is not. Go has shared memory between threads while JavaScript has to serialize data between threads. Both Go and JavaScript have parallel garbage collectors, but Go's heap is shared between all threads while JavaScript has a separate heap per JavaScript thread. This seems to cut the amount of parallelism that's possible with JavaScript worker threads in half <a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/111#issuecomment-719910381">according to my testing</a>, presumably since half of your CPU cores are busy collecting garbage for the other half. </p></li><li><p> Parallelism is used heavily. </p> <p> The algorithms inside esbuild are carefully designed to fully saturate all available CPU cores when possible. There are roughly three phases: parsing, linking, and code generation. Parsing and code generation are most of the work and are fully parallelizable (linking is an inherently serial task for the most part). Since all threads share memory, work can easily be shared when bundling different entry points that import the same JavaScript libraries. Most modern computers have many cores so parallelism is a big win. </p></li><li><p> Everything in esbuild is written from scratch. </p> <p> There are a lot of performance benefits with writing everything yourself instead of using 3rd-party libraries. You can have performance in mind from the beginning, you can make sure everything uses consistent data structures to avoid expensive conversions, and you can make wide architectural changes whenever necessary. The drawback is of course that it's a lot of work. </p> <p> For example, many bundlers use the official TypeScript compiler as a parser. But it was built to serve the goals of the TypeScript compiler team and they do not have performance as a top priority. Their code makes pretty heavy use of <a href="https://mrale.ph/blog/2015/01/11/whats-up-with-monomorphism.html">megamorphic object shapes</a> and unnecessary <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/39247">dynamic property accesses</a> (both well-known JavaScript speed bumps). And the TypeScript parser appears to still run the type checker even when type checking is disabled. None of these are an issue with esbuild's custom TypeScript parser. </p></li><li><p> Memory is used efficiently. </p> <p> Compilers are ideally mostly O(n) complexity in the length of the input. So if you are processing a lot of data, memory access speed is likely going to heavily affect performance. The fewer passes you have to make over your data (and also the fewer different representations you need to transform your data into), the faster your compiler will go. </p> <p> For example, esbuild only touches the whole JavaScript AST three times: </p> <ol> <li>A pass for lexing, parsing, scope setup, and declaring symbols</li> <li>A pass for binding symbols, minifying syntax, JSX/TS to JS, and ESNext-to-ES2015</li> <li>A pass for minifying identifiers, minifying whitespace, generating code, and generating source maps</li> </ol> <p> This maximizes reuse of AST data while it's still hot in the CPU cache. Other bundlers do these steps in separate passes instead of interleaving them. They may also convert between data representations to glue multiple libraries together (e.g. string→TS→JS→string, then string→JS→older JS→string, then string→JS→minified JS→string) which uses more memory and slows things down. </p> <p> Another benefit of Go is that it can store things as compactly in memory, which enables it to use less memory and fit more in the CPU cache. All object fields have types and fields are packed tightly together so e.g. several boolean flags only take one byte each. Go also has value semantics and can embed one object directly in another so it comes "for free" without another allocation. JavaScript doesn't have these features and also has other drawbacks such as JIT overhead (e.g. hidden class slots) and inefficient representations (e.g. non-integer numbers are heap-allocated with pointers). </p></li></ul>
      <p>Each one of these factors is only a somewhat significant speedup, but together they can result in a bundler that is multiple orders of magnitude faster than other bundlers commonly in use today.</p>

Webpack uses <code>ts-loader</code> with <code>transpileOnly: <wbr>true</code> and <code>--mode=<wbr>production <wbr>--devtool=<wbr>sourcemap</code>. Parcel 1 uses <code>--target <wbr>node --bundle-<wbr>node-<wbr>modules</code>. Parcel 2 uses <code>"engines": <wbr>"node"</code> in <code>package.json</code> and needs the <code>@parcel/<wbr>transformer-<wbr>typescript-<wbr>tsc</code> transformer to be able to handle the TypeScript code used in the benchmark. Absolute speed is based on the total line count including comments and blank lines, which is currently 131,836. The tests were done on a 6-core 2019 MacBook Pro with 16gb of RAM.</p>
      <p>The results don't include Rollup because I couldn't get it to work. I tried <code>rollup-<wbr>plugin-<wbr>typescript</code>, <code>@rollup/<wbr>plugin-<wbr>typescript</code>, and <code>@rollup/<wbr>plugin-<wbr>sucrase</code> and they all didn't work for different reasons relating to TypeScript compilation.</p>

        Upcoming roadmap
      </h2>
      <p>These features are already in progress and are first priority:</p>
      <ul><li>Code splitting (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/16">#16</a>, <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/#splitting">docs</a>)</li><li>CSS content type (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20">#20</a>, <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#css">docs</a>)</li><li>Plugin API (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/111">#111</a>)</li></ul>
      <p>These are potential future features but may not happen or may happen to a more limited extent:</p>
      <ul><li>HTML content type (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/31">#31</a>)</li><li>Lowering to ES5 (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/297">#297</a>)</li><li>Bundling top-level await (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/253">#253</a>)</li></ul>
      <p>After that point, I will consider esbuild to be relatively complete. I'm planning for esbuild to reach a mostly stable state and then stop accumulating more features. This will involve saying "no" to requests for adding major features to esbuild itself. I don't think esbuild should become an all-in-one solution for all frontend needs. In particular, I want to avoid the pain and problems of the "webpack config" model where the underlying tool is too flexible and usability suffers.</p>
      <p>For example, I am <em>not</em> planning to include these features in esbuild's core itself:</p>
      <ul><li>Support for other frontend languages (e.g. <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>)</li><li>TypeScript type checking (just run <code>tsc</code> separately)</li><li>An API for custom AST manipulation</li><li>Hot-module reloading</li><li>Module federation</li></ul>
      <p>I hope that the extensibility points I'm adding to esbuild (<a href="https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/">plugins</a> and the <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/">API</a>) will make esbuild useful to include as part of more customized build workflows, but I'm not intending or expecting these extensibility points to cover all use cases.

<p>Jazzer is a coverage-guided fuzzer for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It works on the bytecode level and can thus not only be applied directly to compiled Java applications, but also to targets in other JVM-based languages such as Kotlin or Scala.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Jazzer consists of two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Jazzer driver</strong> is a native binary that links in <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html" rel="nofollow">libFuzzer</a> and runs a Java fuzz target through the Java Native Interface (JNI).</li>
<li>The <strong>Jazzer agent</strong> is a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">Java agent</a> that runs in the same JVM as the fuzz target and applies instrumentation at runtime. The information obtained through this instrumentation is fed back to libFuzzer <span>just as it would be for a compile-time instrumented native binary.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, the driver and the agent make it seem to libFuzzer as if it were fuzzing an ordinary native binary. Our goal is to make all of libFuzzer's features work with Jazzer <span>out of the box</span>. In the following, we want to highlight some of the most interesting aspects of the engineering effort required to achieve this goal.</p>
<h2>Instrumenting JVM bytecode for fuzzing</h2>
<p>The JVM bytecode of a compiled Java class is much more higher-level than the machine code of an equivalent C/C++ binary. This makes it possible to instrument a JVM application at runtime rather than at build-time, which means that neither the code nor the build script requires any changes. The Jazzer agent, which is written in Kotlin, instruments the classes right as <span>they are being loaded</span> by the JVM.</p>
<p>To obtain coverage information from the JVM fuzz target, the Jazzer agent inserts bytecode instructions together with a unique ID at the beginning of every basic block. When we enter a block, the previous basic block’s shifted ID is XORed with the current ID to obtain an identifier for the control flow edge between the two blocks.&nbsp;This idea to obtain edge-level coverage information from basic block instrumentation originated in <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt" rel="nofollow">AFL</a> and has already featured in the early AFL-based Java fuzzer <a href="https://github.com/isstac/kelinci">Kelinci</a>. By relying on memory shared directly between the JVM and the Jazzer driver through a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html" rel="nofollow">direct <code>ByteBuffer</code></a> as well as implementing a branch-free saturating counter increment, we found this approach to coverage instrumentation to be very efficient in practice (take a look at <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/agent/src/main/java/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/instrumentor/AFLCoverageMapInstrumentor.kt">AFLCoverageMapInstrumentor.kt</a> if you want to know how this is done).</p>
<p>Since coverage is not the only type of information that is used by libFuzzer to guide its exploration of the fuzz target, Jazzer also instruments other JVM constructs (see <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/agent/src/main/java/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/instrumentor/TraceDataFlowInstrumentor.kt">TraceDataFlowInstrumentor.kt</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>bytecode-level compares, such as the <span><code>lcmp</code></span>, <span><code>if_*</code></span>, and <span><code>if*</code></span> opcodes</li>
<li>higher-level method-based compares, such as <span><code>String#equal</code></span> or <span><code>Arrays#compare</code></span></li>
<li><code><span>switch</span></code> statements (corresponding to the <span><code>lookupswitch</code></span> and <span><code>tableswitch</code></span> opcodes)</li>
<li>integer divisions (corresponding to the <span><code>idiv</code></span> and <span><code>ldiv</code></span> opcodes and the <span><code>divideUnsigned</code></span> methods)</li>
<li>constant array indices (corresponding to the <span><code>*aload</code></span> opcodes and <span><code>get*</code></span> methods on array-like objects)</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, interesting observed values are forwarded to libFuzzer callbacks such as <span><code>__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4</code></span> (for comparisons of 32-bit integral types) and <span><code>__sanitizer_weak_hook_strcmp</code></span> (for string comparisons). The values populate libFuzzer's table of recent compares and will be incorporated into the fuzzer input bytes via random mutations.</p>
<h2>Value profile support</h2>
<p>The table of recent compares is usually quite effective at letting the fuzzer progress through simple compares in which the required input can be obtained directly by inserting bytes reported via the compare hooks. But real-world fuzz targets are rarely that simple. For example, a function might encode the input into Base64 or apply a simple, non-cryptographic checksum function, followed by a comparison. In these cases, the relation between the input required to explore the fuzz target further and the bytes reported via callbacks is highly non-trivial.</p>
<p>libFuzzer's <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#id33" rel="nofollow">value profile</a>, which can be enabled with the runtime flag <span><code>-use_value_profile=1</code></span>, can be very helpful in this situation. In this mode, for every comparison between two values<span></span>, an extra set of coverage counters will be incremented for every matching bit position in <span><code>A</code></span> and <code><span>B</span></code>. This allows the fuzzer to track its partial progress in getting <span><code>A</code></span> and <span><code>B</code></span> to match, thereby simplifying the problem from brute force (exponential time) to a linear search (linear time).</p>
<p>Since Jazzer builds on libFuzzer and reports string comparisons using <span><code>__sanitizer_weak_hook_strcmp</code></span>, basic value profile support is automatic.&nbsp;Allowing the value profile to track comparisons between integral types is a more difficult task as the relevant fuzzer hooks such as <span><code>__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4</code></span> do not take the address of the compare instruction as an argument. Instead, these hooks retrieve the return address from the stack via the <span><code>__builtin_return_address</code></span> compiler intrinsic.</p>
<p>While this is a very natural approach for instrumented native binaries, our calls to the callbacks all go through the JNI and will thus have the same native return address somewhere in the JNI dispatcher. This would mean that the fuzzer would not be able to distinguish between different compare instructions, which would render the value profile <span>largely useless for non-string types</span>. We initially considered submitting a patch to LLVM that would add variants of the compare callbacks that take a call site address as an additional argument, but then found a way to provide full value profile support even without upstream changes.</p>
<p>A small piece of inline assembly in the Jazzer driver implements a "trampoline" that can invoke any of the libFuzzer callbacks with an arbitray fake return address <span><code>addr</code></span>, e.g., a unique ID assigned to a bytecode instruction (see <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/driver/sanitizer_hooks_with_pc.cpp">sanitizer_hooks_with_pc.cpp</a> for the implementation). The trampoline first pushes an address pointing to the <span><code>addr &amp; 0xFFF</code></span>-th entry in a "sled" of <span><code>0xFFF + 1=4096</code></span>&nbsp;ASM <span><code>ret</code> </span>instructions to the (native) stack and then performs a direct jump (also called a "tail call") to the sanitizer callback.&nbsp;The callback will see the address of the <code>ret</code> corresponding to the lower 12 bits of the synthetic address <span><code>addr</code> </span>as the return address via <span><code>__builtin_return_address</code> </span>and associate the bit-wise progress made in the comparison with it in the value profile map.&nbsp;Since libFuzzer only uses the lower 12 bits of an address for the purpose of the value profile, this allows for fast and complete value profile support also for integral types.</p>
<h2>FuzzedDataProvider</h2>
<p>Both libFuzzer and Google’s Python fuzzer <a href="https://github.com/google/atheris" rel="noopener">Atheris</a> provide convenience functions that transform the raw byte input received from the fuzzer into useful primitive types, such as strings, integers, and arrays. While working on Jazzer's analogue of such a <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code></span>, we found the two prior implementations to differ in <span>quite a few relevant ways</span>. Adding our own experience with building fuzzers to the mix, we arrived at the following design decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jazzer's <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>turns raw fuzzer input bytes into valid JVM strings by carefully applying the least number of bit changes required to turn the input bytes into valid UTF-8. This differs from the approach taken by Atheris, which randomly chooses between ASCII, UTF-16 and UTF-32. We found the fuzzing to be more stable if a consistent, ASCII-compatible encoding is used throughout the <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>and the libFuzzer callbacks. This however comes at the cost of added complexity in the implementation of the string generation functions: The JNI internally uses an encoding that historically predates UTF-8 and is best described as "UTF-16 code points encoded using UTF-8, with special handling of zero bytes". <span>We found this additional complexity</span> to be worth it based on the increased fuzzing efficiency.</li>
<li>The provider distinguishes between "data byte" and "choice bytes". More complex data which is likely to be parsed by the fuzz target, such as strings or arrays of primitive types, is consumed from the beginning of the fuzzer input. Small primitive types such as single integers, floats, and booleans, which are more likely to guide control-flow, are consumed from the end of the fuzzer input. This idea goes back to libFuzzer's <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>and has two key benefits: It makes the consumed fuzzed data more stable under the typical mutations applied by libFuzzer<span>and also ensures</span> that corpus entries preserve the structure of valid input files (e.g., JSON, PDF, or JPEG files) as much as possible.</li>
<li>Reproducing crashes in fuzz targets using a <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code></span> would be challenging if it always required running the crashing input through the driver. For this reason Jazzer, in addition to the crashing input dumped by libFuzzer, creates a Java-only reproducer for every crash. This reproducer contains all values consumed from the <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>in serialized form and can be run like any other Java program without any native dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Custom method hooks</h2>
<p><a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2020/may/27/science-on-memory-unsafety-and-security/" rel="nofollow">Experience shows</a> that roughly 65% of all serious security bugs found in projects using languages without memory-safety guarantees stem from incorrect memory handling. For the most part this high percentage is likely explained by how difficult memory handling can get if memory-safety is not built into the language from the ground up. However, there is another part to this story: With the likes of AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, there is excellent tooling available to detect such bugs with fuzzing.</p>
<p>While there is no need to detect violations of memory-safety for Java applications (at least those without native libraries), <span>other vulnerabilities </span>such as SQL injections, path traversals, or infinite loops occur in JVM-based languages just as often as they do in C/C++. One of the core ideas behind Jazzer is that the higher-level structure of JVM bytecode compared to native binaries coupled with suitable "sanitizers" should make these bugs detectable via fuzzing. For this purpose, Jazzer includes a flexible <a href="https://codeintelligencetesting.github.io/jazzer-api/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/api/MethodHook.html" rel="nofollow">annotation-based mechanism to hook methods</a>, regardless of …</p></article></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p>Creating a traditional computer program involves a fixed sequence of steps. First, we need to understand the problem and translate it into formal logic. Then, we implement that in code. Often surprisingly, the implementation of a program’s logic is comparatively easy. The challenging part is understanding and translating the problem.</p>
<p>The more complex systems become, the more brainpower we spend to understand them. It becomes necessary to distill the problem and its logic into components, which are easier to work with. Given an input to a component, we know which output to expect. Even before writing a single line of code, we formalize these expectations in <em>contracts</em>. These contracts describe how various components interact with each other. And ultimately, how the overall system interacts with the real world. Once the software is written, we can ensure that the contracts hold. This process makes the concept of failure transparent and clearly defined.</p>
<p>This way, we have managed to build <em>extremely</em> safe software systems that can operate in real-world environments. For example, software autopilots for airplanes, which have been in use for half a century<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, don’t fail even once in a billion flight hours. To put this in perspective, think about flying a Boeing 747 around Earth 22 million times<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. We don’t expect it to fail once in that time! Flying is the safest mode of transport<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> for a good reason. It is designed with failure in mind.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-era-of-machine-learning">The New Era of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>But things have changed over the past decade. More recently, the idea of letting a computer learn program behavior with data has heralded a new era of <em>machine learning</em>. It is now one of the most powerful tools of our age.</p>
<p>Machine learning can leverage statistical dependencies in data to learn complex input-output mappings. The program behavior is deduced from data. Therefore, we no longer need to distill the logic and implement it in code. Instead, the computer does so from data. We no longer have to translate the problem into formal logic. Instead, the computer does so from data. To some extent, we don’t even have to understand the problem anymore – or at least we are fooled into believing that we don’t.</p>
<p>Through machine learning, a computer can learn behaviors that are much more complex than anything humans can describe with hand-written rules. On well-designed datasets, or sometimes even in well-controlled environments, we can now do things that we couldn’t even imagine with traditional software.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://david-haber.github.io/images/aisafetyreqs.png" alt="AI systems have all of the developmental and operational problems of traditional code, plus a vast additional set of AI-specific issues. AI software typically operates with more uncertainty, and it is challenging to demonstrate its safety and compliance."> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Traditionally, we left the difficult parts – like understanding and translating the problem – to humans. We explicitly defined the behavior of traditional programs. Now machine learning solves this for us. It automatically distills the problem and its assumptions into a model. As a result, we can learn much more complicated program behaviors. But, at the same time, the understanding and behavioral guarantees of traditional software are lost. The contracts, which we previously relied on, no longer exist. This makes it much more difficult to analyze AI behavior, let alone to demonstrate its safety.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-mindset-for-ai-development">A New Mindset for AI Development</h2>
<p>AI systems have the same developmental and operational problems as traditional software, plus a vast set of AI-specific issues. As a result, <a href="https://david-haber.github.io/posts/ai-discipline/" target="_blank">companies can create impressive demos but fail to translate them into real products</a>. Or even worse, they operate AI software with a lot more uncertainty. This has already led to catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Regulatory organizations, industry-specific working groups, and researchers are investigating how existing safety standards can be extended to cover the additional challenges of AI software. With decades of experience certifying traditional software, they know that safety <em>follows</em> from adopting a system-level view. Moreover, it requires a mindset that holds all stages of the development process accountable, from requirements collection to end-user interaction.</p>
<p>AI development teams must adopt a similar top-down approach. Crucially, this means a development workflow that looks beyond the model. We need to systematically combine the best practices from traditional software with the tools specific to AI. Only then can we reestablish the contracts that traditional software relies on, reduce the uncertainty around AI applications, and achieve the failure rates that mission-critical applications require.</p>
<p>With quickly evolving regulatory standards and improving machine learning tools, we now have a chance to get this right. Both sides of the table, regulators and industry, need to work together to create frameworks that support innovation, not stifle it.</p>

<h3 id="best-overall-date-fns">Best overall: <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/date-fns">date-fns</a></h3>
<p><strong>date-fns</strong> offers great documentation, functional architecture, and utilities that handle almost any task you can think of. If dates are a critical concern for your JavaScript application, use <strong>date-fns.</strong>&nbsp;Each feature has clear documentation written in ESM (ES Modules) for the browser. Logical and consistent function names encourage readable code. A modular architecture allows build tools to trim away unused code for a slimmer final build.</p>
<h3 id="best-for-time-zones-luxon">Best for time zones: <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/luxon">Luxon</a></h3>
<p>If time zones or localization are your primary concern, we recommend <strong>Luxon</strong>. <strong>Luxon</strong> leverages JavaScript’s <code>Intl</code> for speed and slimness while providing what <code>Intl</code> doesn’t: an immutable user-friendly API. Concise, well-written documentation eases the learning curve for getting started.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="best-minimalist-option-dayjs">Best minimalist option: <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/dayjs">Day.js</a></h3>
<p>For basic handling of dates, <strong>Day.js</strong> is a minimalist library that offers an excellent API without much overhead. While <strong>Day.js</strong> has fewer features than <strong>Luxon</strong> or <strong>date-fns</strong>, it’s much smaller in size.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-a-datetime-package">When to use a JavaScript date library</h2>
<p>Why not just use JavaScript’s built-in <strong>Date</strong> object? A good JavaScript date library provides a clear advantage over JavaScript’s <strong>Date</strong> in several ways: immutability, parsing, and time zones. In addition, JavaScript date libraries offer useful utilities for date manipulation and formatting, which can save developers time and energy.</p>

<p>JavaScript’s <strong>Date</strong> is mutable, which can lead to unintentional bugs. Let’s say you create a <strong>Date</strong> object named <code>currentTime</code>. You display it on top of the website. Another developer comes in and wants to create a widget that displays next weeks events. They use <code>currentTime.setDate(currentTime.getDate() + 7)</code> at the top to the widget to display next week’s date. However it also changes the date in the header! Oops. With an immutable date library, adding a week would create a new instance so the original would not change.</p>
<p>While <strong>Date</strong> has a <code>parse</code> method, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date">MDN documentation for <strong>Date</strong>‘s <code>dateString</code> notes</a> that usage is “strongly discouraged.” An excellent answer in the Stack Exchange question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20463521">Why does Date.parse give incorrect results?</a> describes in detail differences in formatting standards and browsers lead to inconsistent and unreliable results. If you need to parse, a date library is a must.</p>

<p>Time zones are another major frustration. <strong>Date</strong> in the browser always represents the local system date stored as milliseconds since January 1st, 1970 in UTC. A <strong>Date</strong> can rendered as a <code>string</code> in a different time zone using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl"><strong>Intl</strong></a>, but the <strong>Date</strong> itself is always the local system time.</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong> also lacks utilities for common tasks like creating human-readable relative dates. Using library utilities for such tasks can save a lot of time.</p>

<p>In the meantime, be aware of the limitations of <strong>Date</strong> and use a library when you need one.</p>
<h2 id="our-previous-pick-momentjs">Our previous pick: Moment.js</h2>
<p>For a long time <strong>Moment.js</strong> was king of the JavaScript date libraries, but in 2020 <strong>Moment.js</strong>‘s maintainers published a <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status">Project Status</a> announcing they consider Moment.js a legacy project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The maintainers argued that there was no way to refactor <strong>Moment.js</strong> to meet the demands of modern JavaScript development such as immutability and tree shaking. Lighthouse (Chrome’s built-in auditing tool) warns against using Moment because of its large size (329 kb).</p>
<p>For these reasons, we do not include it as one of our recommended picks. If you are looking for a replacement to <strong>Moment.js</strong> that closely matches its API, try <strong>Day.js</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-picked">How we picked</h2>
<p>We looked at data from <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a> and <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/">NPM trends</a> to identity the most popular and trending libraries and evaluated them against these core criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser-friendly</strong>: We evaluated JavaScript date libraries for use directly by the browser rather than the Node.js backend.</li>
<li><strong>Great documentation</strong>: Users look to this to implement the library correctly. We looked at the parts the facilitate this process: organization, search, examples, and the individual pages relating to the methods we tested.</li>
<li><strong>Modularity + Tree shaking</strong>: Modular architecture allows you to shrink your library size by “tree-shaking” out any library code you’re not using. Common build tools capable of tree-shaking include <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a> and <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: Feature-richness was just one factor. We also considered whether a library was especially good at certain tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Measuring performance gives us a clue at how fast each library performs common operations. This usually isn’t noticeable but in large, complex apps can cause lag.</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: One of the biggest problems people had with <strong>Moment.js</strong> was size. A large library can substantially increase page load times.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-bug features</strong>: Immutability, readability, and informative error messages can help prevent bugs. When code is readable, you can learn a lot about what it does by reading it. Format, syntax, and naming conventions can make all the difference in readability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h3>
<p>When evaluating each library we made a CodePen using Skypack. We attempted to pick out common use cases that illustrate differences between libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rendering the current date &amp; time</li>
<li>Rendering the current date using a custom format</li>
<li>Modifying a date to add/remove time</li>
<li>Working with timezones</li>
<li>Parsing arbitrary date strings</li>
</ul>
<p>First we implemented these cases using JavaScript’s <strong>Date:</strong></p>
<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="15606" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="melissamcewen" data-slug-hash="NWRMoLm" data-preview="true" data-pen-title="datetime example">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen/pen/NWRMoLm"> datetime example</a> by melissa (<a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen">@melissamcewen</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>We wrote up examples for performance testing on <a href="https://perf.link/">perf.link</a> and all of the tests and code are available in the <a href="https://github.com/melissamcewen/date-time-perf-examples/">Date/time performance examples GitHub repository</a>. If you have a specific use-case, you can modify one of the provided examples. JavaScript date libraries contain hundreds of methods and features that we couldn’t test them all. Instead, we opted to test the same methods demonstrated in our Codepens.</p>
<figure id="attachment_79" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/testing-performance-perf-link-skypack-javascript-date-library-1024x559.jpg" alt="A code block imports all the tested libraries via Skypack, then there are four blocks showing code for adding a week to a date using each JavaScript date library.

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen/pen/YzGMyyd">A chart of the performance data is also available on CodePen</a>. The data&nbsp; doesn’t indicate a clear advantage for any one library. Each JavaScript date library implements different features differently, so that’s not surprising.</p>

<p>The sizes listed on each review are based on loading via the Skypack CDN. If you’re using a build tool to tree-shake and the library is tree-shakable (like <strong>date-fns</strong>), the size will depend on what parts you use. For evaluating libraries with tree-shaking we recommend <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/">Bundlephobia.</a></p>
<p>A caveat to our testing is we did not consider back-end <code>Node.js</code> use. Many JavaScript date libraries rely on browser APIs so may not work correctly on the back-end.</p>
<h4 id="other-cases-to-test">Other cases to test</h4>
<p>Depending on your needs there are lots of other tests you could do. If you’d like to test other features not covered here, you can make changes to any of the examples in our embedded Codepens or <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/DKYbjR">CodePen date collection</a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it let us know if we have an invalid date when we pass in invalid items? For example moment(undefined) behaves like moment() and doesn’t output an error, which could lead to bugs.</li>
<li>How well does it handle different languages and locales?</li>
<li>Can it render relative dates (like “4 days ago”)? Can it do this in different languages?</li>
<li>Does it work in older browsers?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-picks-in-detail">Our picks in detail</h2>
<h3 id="date-fns"><a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/date-fns">Date-fns</a></h3>
<p>Size: 58.9 kb (tree-shakable)</p>

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="15606" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="melissamcewen" data-slug-hash="bGwjaGV" data-preview="true" data-pen-title="datetime example: date-fns">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen/pen/bGwjaGV"> datetime example: date-fns</a> by melissa (<a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen">@melissamcewen</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p><strong>date-fns</strong> is a pleasure to use, offering all the benefits of a modular architecture and covering almost any date use case. Our example shows the power of good naming and syntax in conveying information. Code like <code>add(now, {days: 7})</code> is straightforward to understand even if you’re unfamiliar with <strong>date-fns</strong>.</p>
<p>To get the most out of <strong>date-fns’</strong>s modular architecture, use a tree-shaking build tool (see our criteria section) and import only the features you need:</p>
<pre><code>import { format, add, getHours, parse } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/date-fns@2.16.1";
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, a tree-shaking build tool would remove all code from <strong>date-fns</strong> that’s not used in <code>format</code>, <code>add</code>, <code>getHours</code>, or <code>parse</code>. The final build would be much slimmer. Still at 58.9kb for the whole package, it’s not giant in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>date-fns</strong> doesn’t package a browser build for NPM (<a href="https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/1780">see the related GitHub issue</a>) and therefore only works on CDNs that transform for the browser like <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a> and <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/esm">ESM.run</a>. However, documentation has examples labeled for the browser as both ESM(ES Modules) and ES2015. This ensures developers don’t get confused trying to run <code>Node.js</code> backend code in the browser.</p>
<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
<p>Although we liked almost everything about <strong>date-fns</strong>, it is not for everyone. For starters, <strong>date-fns</strong> seems geared towards experienced developers working with a professional tool chain. Working without a build tool, the tree-shaking advantage disappears.</p>
<p>Note that our CodePen example starts with a <code>const now = new Date()</code>, which is the default JavaScript <strong>Date</strong> object. As noted in our <strong>Date</strong> section a <strong>Date</strong> is always the current system’s time zone. <strong>date-fns</strong> has a separate library for working with time zones using helper functions. We found the documentation and examples for these helper functions less consistent than the main <strong>date-fns</strong>. Our resulting code is less readable than the rest of the examples. Our time-zone example for <strong>date-fns</strong> is 4 lines of code, compared to 1 for <strong>Luxon</strong>.</p>
<p>Another quirk we encountered was if you Google “date-fns parse” the top results take you to the <a href="https://date-fns.org/v2.0.0-alpha.9/docs/parse">v2.0.0-alpha docs for parse</a>, which no longer work (the current version is 2.16). We found ourselves using Google because the documentation’s built-in search seems to search only title and descriptions of sub-pages. The information architecture of the menu could also use improvement, as we would it overwhelmingly …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>There are a whole bunch of popular interview questions that can be solved in one of two ways:
Either using common data structures and algorithms in a sensible manner, or by using some properties of XOR in a seemingly hard to understand way.</p>

<p>While it seems unreasonable to expect the XOR solutions in interviews, it is quite fun to figure out how they work.
As it turns out, they are all based on the same fundamental trick, which we will derive in a bottom-up way in this post.
Afterwards we will look at a bunch of applications of <em>that XOR trick</em> ™, such as solving this popular interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are a number of straightforward ways to solve this problem, but there is also a perhaps surprising one using XOR.</p>

<h3 id="xor">XOR</h3>

<p>XOR is a logical operator that works on bits.
Let’s denote it by <code>^</code>.
If the two bits it takes as input are the same, the result is <code>0</code>, otherwise it is <code>1</code>.
This implements an <em>exclusive or</em> operation, i.e. exactly one argument has to be <code>1</code> for the final result to be <code>1</code>.
We can show this using a truth table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Most programming languages implement <code>^</code> as a bitwise operator, meaning XOR is individually applied to each bit in a string of bits (e.g. a byte).</p>

<p>For example:</p>



<p>since</p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because of this, we can apply XOR to anything, not just booleans.</p>

<h3 id="deducing-some-useful-properties">Deducing Some Useful Properties</h3>

<p>We can derive a bunch of properties from the previous definition.
Let’s go through them one by one, and then compose them to solve the interview questions previously mentioned.</p>

<h4 id="xor-and-0-x--0--x">XOR and 0: <code>x ^ 0 = x</code></h4>

<p>If one of the two arguments to XOR is <code>0</code>, then the remaining argument is the result.
This directly follows from the truth table by checking the rows where <code>y = 0</code>, namely the first and third row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="xor-on-the-same-argument-x--x--0">XOR on the same argument: <code>x ^ x = 0</code></h4>

<p>If the two arguments are the same, the result is always <code>0</code>.
Again, we can convince ourselves that this is true by inspecting the truth table.
This time we have to check the rows where <code>x = y</code>, i.e. the first and last row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Intuitively, this means that if we apply XOR to the same arguments, they cancel each other out.</p>

<h4 id="commutativity-x--y--y--x">Commutativity: <code>x ^ y = y ^ x</code></h4>

<p>XOR is commutative, meaning we can change the order in which we apply XOR.
To prove this, we can check the truth table for both <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
      <th><code>y ^ x</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As we can see, <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code> always end up with the same value.</p>

<h4 id="sequences-of-xor-operations">Sequences of XOR operations</h4>

<p>By combining all of this, we can deduce the central insight behind everything that is about to follow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The XOR trick</strong>: If we have a sequence of XOR operations <code>a ^ b ^ c ^ ...</code>, then we can remove all pairs of duplicated values without affecting the result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commutativity allows us to re-order the applications of XOR so that the duplicated elements are next to each other.
Since <code>x ^ x = 0</code> and <code>a ^ 0 = a</code>, each pair of duplicated values has no effect on the outcome.</p>

<p>Let’s go through an example of this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>  a ^ b ^ c ^ a ^ b     # Commutativity
= a ^ a ^ b ^ b ^ c     # Using x ^ x = 0
= 0 ^ 0 ^ c             # Using x ^ 0 = x (and commutativity)
= c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because <code>^</code> is a bitwise operator, this will work regardless of what kind of values <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are.
This idea is really at the heart of how XOR can be used seemingly magically in many situations.</p>

<h3 id="application-1-in-place-swapping">Application 1: In-Place Swapping</h3>

<p>Before we solve the problem of finding the missing number, let’s start with this simpler <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/">problem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swap two values x and y in-place, i.e. without using any helper variables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out that one can easily solve this problem using the following three XOR instructions:</p>



<p>That seems a bit mysterious.
Why do we end up swapping <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> if we do this?</p>

<p>To see how it works, let’s go through this step by step.
The comment after each instruction shows the current values of <code>(x, y)</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x ^= y # =&gt;                      (x ^ y, y)
y ^= x # =&gt; (x ^ y, y ^ x ^ y) = (x ^ y, x)
x ^= y # =&gt; (x ^ y ^ x, x)     = (y, x)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that this is really just using the properties derived earlier.</p>

<p>The fundamental insight here is that having <code>x ^ y</code> in one register and <code>x</code> in the other, allows us to perfectly reconstruct <code>y</code>.
Once <code>x ^ y</code> is stored (instruction 1), we can just put <code>x</code> into the other register (instruction 2), and then use it to change <code>x ^ y</code> to just <code>y</code> (instruction 3).</p>

<h3 id="application-2-finding-the-missing-number">Application 2: Finding the Missing Number</h3>

<p>Let’s finally solve the problem posed in the beginning of this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are many straightforward ways of solving this, but we did set out to do it using XOR.</p>

<p>From the XOR trick we know that having a sequence of XOR statements means we can remove all duplicated arguments.
If we just XOR all values in the given list, however, we cannot apply this trick because there are no duplicates:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code>A[n - 2]</code> is the last index of a list of <code>n - 1</code> elements.</p>

<p>What we can do additionally is to also XOR all values between 1 and n:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>1 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ n ^ A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give us a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All values in the given list now appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The missing value appears exactly once:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we XOR all of this, we essentially remove all values that appear twice, thanks to the XOR trick.
This means that we are left with the missing value, which happens to be exactly what we were looking for in the first place.</p>

<p>Coded up, it looks something like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>

<p>Just looking at the code, this seems to be a difficult to understand algorithm.
When knowing how the XOR trick works, however, it becomes fairly trivial.
I think that also shows why it is unreasonable to expect this solution in an interview: It requires knowledge of a very specific trick but not much algorithmic thinking beyond that.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the next application, let me follow up with two remarks.</p>

<h4 id="generalizing-this-beyond-integers">Generalizing this beyond integers</h4>

<p>While we worked on integers from 1 to n so far, this is not required.
In fact, the previous algorithm works in any situation where there is (1) some set of potential elements and (2) a set of elements actually appearing.
The sets may only differ in the one missing element.
This worked out nicely for integers because the set of potential elements just corresponds to the elements from 1 to n.</p>

<p>One could imagine applications where the elements are not integers from 1 to n:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The set of potential elements are <code>Person</code> objects and we ought to find the <code>Person</code> missing from a list of values</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are all nodes in a graph and we are looking for a missing node</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are integers in general (not necessarily from 1 to n) and we want to find a missing integer</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="arithmetic-operators-instead-of-xor">Arithmetic operators instead of XOR</h4>

<p>If the algorithm still seems a bit magical – which I hope it does not – it might help to think about how one could achieve the same result using arithmetic operators.
This is actually fairly straightforward:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># Add all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># Subtract all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>-=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add all potential integers and then subtract the ones actually appearing.
The solution is not as nice because one would need to handle overflows and because it requires the type of the elements to support <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> with certain properties.
It, however, has the same logic of elements canceling each other out because they appear a certain number of times (once positive, once negative).</p>

<h3 id="application-3-finding-the-duplicate-number">Application 3: Finding the Duplicate Number</h3>

<p>Here’s where it gets fun: We can apply the <em>exact</em> same solution to a similar interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n + 1</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is <strong>duplicated</strong>. Find this duplicated number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s think about what happens if we just apply the exact same algorithm as in the previous solution.
We would get a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The duplicated value appears three times:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>twice because it was duplicated in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All other values in the given list appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were unique in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As previously, all the duplicated elements cancel each other out.
This means we are left with exactly what we are looking for: the element that was duplicated in the original array.
This element appearing three times, combined with XOR, reduces to that very element:</p>


<p>All other elements cancel each other out because they appear exactly twice.</p>

<h3 id="application-4-finding-two-missingduplicate-numbers">Application 4: Finding Two Missing/Duplicate Numbers</h3>

<p>It turns out we can take this even further.
Consider the following, slightly more difficult, problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n - 2</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except <strong>two</strong> numbers, which are missing. Find these two missing numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As before, the problem is completely equivalent when looking for two <em>duplicated</em> numbers, instead of two <em>missing</em> numbers.</p>

<p>And I am sure you guessed it, but we will stick with what worked before and start exactly the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <figure> <img src="https://blog.tinybird.co/images/clickhouse.png" alt="Tinybird uses Clickhouse"> <figcaption>Tinybird uses Clickhouse</figcaption> </figure> <p>There are two extremes in the open source world: companies creating open-source and the ones that just use it. And in between, some companies contribute from time to time.</p> <p>Let’s use Linux kernel development as an example: if you look at the contributor list you’ll see Redhat, IBM, Facebook, and many more. But those companies don’t control the project in this case, there is a foundation behind it. This is the ideal situation, when there is no company behind the project. Of course, each company pushes in their direction, but no one can change the project license.</p> <p>On the other hand you have Mongo or Elastic, they created the project and control it. Their business model depends on the project, so to protect it they’ll do whatever is needed. There are plenty of examples of companies changing license terms to limit what other companies -basically large cloud services providers- can offer. Mongo, Elastic, Redis, Mapbox are recent examples.</p> <p>We truly believe in open source. Ideally following the foundation way, but any piece of code that enables others to do things is welcome in our book. Open source is one of the things that make the world a better place: COVID vaccine scientists used spark for its development, Wikipedia uses Kafka (and runs entirely on open source software), OpenStreetMap uses Postgres and PostGIS.</p> <p>In our previous companies, we based most of our products on open source technology but we often felt we weren’t contributing enough. Not just because you should feel the pressure to contribute if you are making money out of it; also because if you are contributing to it, it probably means you really understand how it works and therefore your product will be better.</p> <p>Our service relies heavily on Clickhouse, the database Yandex published as open source a few years ago. It’s one of the best pieces of technology I’ve seen, the kind of software you get when you put the best minds to solve one hard problem.</p> <p>We have been contributing to the database with some pull requests, but not as many as we would like. And even though we understand Clickhouse inside and out now, we feel that’s not enough. That’s why we have decided to hire developers to work on the open-source project full-time.</p> <p>For a company of our size this means a long-term effort but we are pretty sure it will pay off in the short and medium-term. And not just for us but for everybody facing the same problems we are trying to solve.</p> <p>If you are a C++ developer and like working on high-performance projects you’ll feel at home at Tinybird. Please take a look at the <a href="https://www.tinybird.co/jobs/clickhouse-developer">Clickhouse Developer job offer</a> and consider applying.</p> </div>  </article>  </div> </div></div>]]>

                    <p><code>I2C</code> is a communication protocol which was originally designed and used for inter-board communications between peripherals, like the processor talking to an EEPROM in a system. These days it is also used for short distance communication with sensors - not what it was designed for, but it works anyway. Wikipedia has this to say about <code>I2C</code>:</p>

<p><i>I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), pronounced I-squared-C, is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus invented in 1982 by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors). It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. Alternatively, I2C is spelled I2C (pronounced I-two-C) or IIC (pronounced I-I-C).</i> (thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">Wikipedia</a>!)</p>


<p>I've been playing around with some <code>I2C</code> based sensors from SparkFun. They have <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic">QWIIC</a> connectors making it easy to speak to them from SparkFuns <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16832">OpenLog Artemis</a>. The OpenLog Artemis can log sensor data to SD card and also presents itself as a serial device where it streams data from the sensors in a CSV-like format. It works great and I can highly recommend the whole <code>QWIIC</code> ecosystem.</p>

<p>Occationally I need to use one of the <code>QWIIC</code> sensors from some FreeBSD based system, without the <code>OpenLog Artemis</code>. In this case I am using a <code>Raspberry PI Zero</code> with FreeBSD a 13-CURRENT from December. This is easy because the <code>QWIIC</code> system is just plain <code>I2C</code> underneath, so it is easy to hook a sensor up directly to the <code>GPIO</code> pins of the RPI with <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14988">one of these</a>.</p>

<p>In FreeBSD land we have <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=i2c&amp;sektion=8">i2c(8)</a> which is a userspace utility for reading and writing to <code>I2C</code> devices. I will start by going over basic usage before diving deeper into the actual sensors I am playing with in this learning session.</p>

<p>My test rig for this blogpost looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://people.bornhack.org/tyk/i2c/IMG_20210206_201331.jpg"><img src="https://people.bornhack.org/tyk/i2c/IMG_20210206_201331.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<h3>Basic I2C on FreeBSD</h3>
<p>First things first, I need some hardware with an <code>I2C</code> bus which is exposed to FreeBSD. I am using a <code>Raspberry PI Zero</code> and the <code>I2C</code> bus looks like this in <code>dmesg</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# grep I2C /var/run/dmesg.boot 
iicbus0: &lt;OFW I2C bus&gt; on iichb0
iic0: &lt;I2C generic I/O&gt; on iicbus0
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>The first sensor I've hooked up is a SparkFun <code>TMP117</code> temperature sensor. According to the <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-tmp117-high-precision-digital-temperature-sensor-hookup-guide">hookup guide</a> the default <code>I2C</code> address of this sensor is <code>0x48</code> which matches what I am seeing after hooking up the hardware and running <code>i2c(8)</code> with the <code>-s</code> flag to make it scan the <code>I2C</code> bus for devices:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -s
Hardware may not support START/STOP scanning; trying less-reliable read method.
Scanning I2C devices on /dev/iic0: 48 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>After connecting an additional sensor which has a default <code>I2C</code> address of <code>0x60</code> the bus scan can see that device too:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -sv
dev: /dev/iic0, addr: 0x0, r/w: r, offset: 0x00, width: 8, count: 1
Hardware may not support START/STOP scanning; trying less-reliable read method.

[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<h3>Reading From I2C Devices</h3>
<p>Reading from the sensor is straightforward. I specify that I want to read with <code>-d r</code> (meaning <code>read</code>), the length of data to get with <code>-c 2</code> (meaning 2 bytes) and the address of the device to read from with <code>-a 48</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr
0d 67 
[root@pizero1 ~]# while true; do date; i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr; sleep 1; done
Sun Dec 20 00:51:45 UTC 2020
0d 67 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:46 UTC 2020
0d 67 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:48 UTC 2020
0d 66 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:49 UTC 2020
0d 66 
^C
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>After some trial and error I also add <code>-m tr</code> to set the <code>addressing mode</code> to <code>complete-transfer</code> which is needed on this I2C bus to make everything work.</p>

<p>The reading shown is a hex value, exactly two bytes as requested with <code>-c 2</code>.</p>

<p>When reading temperature from this sensor I don't need to add <code>-o</code> to the <code>i2c(8)</code> command to specify an offset, since the temperature is stored in the first register in the device. If I wanted to read from the next register (which for the <code>TMP117</code> is where the configuration is stored) I would use <code>-o 1</code>:

</p><pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 1
22 20 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>All the registers in the <code>TMP117</code> are 16 bits (or two bytes), but the <code>I2C</code> command can read or write any number of bytes, just specify the width with <code>-c</code>.</p>

<p>Trying to read more data than the register size just results in FF bytes being returned:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr
0c bc 
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 4 -m tr
0c bc ff ff 
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 40 -m tr
0c bd ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>


<h3>Writing To I2C Devices</h3>
<p>The <code>i2c(8)</code> utility also makes it easy to write values back to the device. The <code>TMP117</code> sensor has a programmable low and high thresholds in registers 2 and 3. The first one defaults to <code>0x6000</code> and changing it is much like reading, except we want the bytes to be written on <code>stdin</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 00 
[root@pizero1 ~]# echo -en "\x60\x01" | i2c -a 48 -d w -c 2 -m tr -o 2
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 01 
[root@pizero1 ~]# echo -en "\x60\x00" | i2c -a 48 -d w -c 2 -m tr -o 2
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 00 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>


<h3>Understanding Readings From the TMP117 Sensor</h3>
<p>Reading the <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/e/5/1/8/tmp117.pdf">datasheet</a> for the <code>TMP117</code> sensor I learned that the temperature readings are stored in the first register, as a 16-bit value, which means I use <code>-c 2</code> for <code>i2c(8)</code> so it reads two bytes (16 bits) from the sensor.</p>

<p>The datasheet for the <code>TMP117</code> has this to say about the register where the temperature is stored: <code>The data in the result register is in two's complement format, has a data width of 16 bits and a resolution of 7.8125m °C.</code>.</p>


<h3>Two's Complement Format</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">Two's complement</a> is a widely used and convenient way to work with signed (negative) numbers in binary. Basically the most significant bit is used to indicate if what follows is a positive or a negative binary number.</p>

<p>The following table is from the <code>TMP117</code> datasheet, it shows some sample temperatures in celcius and what those readings translate to in decimal, two's complement binary, and hex:</p>

<p>I haven't worked much with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's complement format</a>, so I started out by familiarising myself with it in Python. I borrowed the following function from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1604464/twos-complement-in-python/37075643#37075643">SO</a> and started out by reproducing the values in the above table:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# cat twos.py 
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def twos(binary_str, bytecount):
    integer = int(binary_str, bytecount)
    bytes = integer.to_bytes(bytecount, byteorder="big", signed=False)
    return int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder="big", signed=True)

print(twos(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])))

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-c57517e3-7fff-7dc7-5bfe-84839fb3df5f"><span><span>I’m super proud of my mom, Amanda Milne! She was among the first to earn a degree in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, has worked in the field of software development her entire career, and worked her way up to become president of her own custom software development company here in Michigan, and later on, a Senior Vice President of a Fortune 500 company.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><img height="400" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/I_JBY1MgrnV3vaSDYSKCmbpPcdBqZgHi3_BHf75JmS1hqsBnafdWNLk0FXO_znQO7STWS7LDumylUgns2hWV2RzUXClodbjRT04DPAvs8RRt0l_G7b8z9c7-nQRB5d2N5szEdbnT" width="400"></span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>This is an interview with Amanda about her early years in software development, back in the 1970s and 1980s, and about one project in particular that I remembered her doing from my days as a grade school kid.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>You were among the first Computer Science graduates at the University of Michigan, right?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I was! I graduated from Michigan with a Computer Science Degree in 1974. The Computer Science degree program was fairly new back then. We had no textbooks, just mimeographed handouts (which I wish I’d kept!).&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Nearly all of our work was done on an IBM System/360 Mainframe Computer, primarily by submitting our code on punched cards via a remote card reader. I took one class on a DEC PDP-8 Mini Computer, and I learned to build logic boards by soldering chips in an elective Electrical Engineering course. The programming languages were primarily Fortran and Assembler.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Only 43 of us graduated with a Computer Science degree from U of M in ‘74. Fun Fact: I graduated without ever actually seeing the IBM System/360 Computer!</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>What did you do after graduation?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I worked as a Programmer for various companies (and customer accounts).&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>My first assignment was to single-handedly write the real time process control code to run a custom carburetor test stand for Oldsmobile.&nbsp; The computer was a16-bit Modcomp mini computer with 16K of memory, and no disk! When I started that project, I knew nothing about Modcomp computers, their operating system, their language -- or what a carburetor was!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I wrote the code in an Assembler level language, and loaded my compiled code into the machine via paper tape.&nbsp; When I found a bug in my code, I wrote the fix, de-compiled it by hand, converted it to hexadecimal, and keyed the fix into memory using 16 binary switches.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Writing process control code was fun because I could actually see my code working as it opened and closed mechanical valves, and turned stepping motors. I was only 21, but I did successfully complete the project.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>That’s pretty amazing! As a developer these days, there are so many layers of indirection between code we write, and what’s actually happening at the hardware level.&nbsp; You actually got to add instructions to memory directly, with no steps in between! (And without Google or StackOverflow to help you know what to do!)</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>After that, you worked at a startup called Custom Software Services, right? What was your role there?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>In 1981, Custom Software Services, a programming consultancy startup in the Detroit area, hired me to work part-time on a two-month project. I only had 3 years of programming experience at the time, because I took a 4-year break when you and Jeremy were born. My assignment was to single-handedly develop a daily Profit and Loss system for a local restaurant chain on an IBM Series/1 Computer (a 16-bit mini computer with the EDX Operating System), using a low level language called EDL. At the time, CSS had only one employee. After the project was completed, I stayed on to work on other projects. After 4 years, I went full time as a programmer.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>Highland Superstores was a big appliance sales company back in the 1980s, right? What was the project that you did for them?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores was a national chain of 100 appliance stores selling TVs, electronics, washers, dryers and refrigerators. In 1987, the Internet did not yet exist. Highland Superstores wanted a networked Point of Sale (POS) system in all of their stores, and headquarters. The system would track their inventory, daily sales, gross margins, commissions, and so forth.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores wanted a system to enable the salespeople on the floor to negotiate pricing, view how a lowered price negatively affected their own commission, check accurate up-to-date store inventories, sell the items, and schedule delivery.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Before this system, a salesperson had to leave the customer (or make a phone call) to check inventory in the back of the store. Salespeople had no idea if the next closest store had the item in stock that his customer desired. It was important to Highland to have up-to-date inventories of ALL of their stores available in each store. With this feature, a salesperson would be able to sell the item, and send the customer to the next closest store to pick it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>The POS system in each store had to communicate and update the headquarters computer every 15 minutes. It also had to download inventory updates from the other stores every 15 minutes.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>How did IBM get involved in this project?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores had spent 2 years working with another local software company to develop the POS system using PC LANs, but it wasn’t working and Highland was getting frustrated.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Rick Teague, Highland’s IBM Salesperson, told them that putting an IBM System/36 in each store, all communicating with an IBM System/38 at their headquarters, would work.&nbsp; The hardware was up to the job.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>With no Internet, how did this kind of communication work? Dial-up modems?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Yes, dial-up modems. The POS system had to dial the headquarters IBM System/38 every 15 minutes, establish a connection, upload the local store inventory, and download updated inventories from the other 99 stores.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>You mentioned Highland was getting frustrated? What was the issue with the other company’s in-progress implementation?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Well, they couldn’t get their PC LAN system to work. If I remember correctly, their software could perform&nbsp; the in-store functionality, but it had a great deal of trouble getting the communications with headquarters to work properly and quickly.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>So how did you, and CSS, get involved in this project?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>The IBM System/36 hardware solution was a good idea, but there was no POS software to run on that platform. Since Highland Superstores had been paying another software company, they weren’t willing to fund another software development project on a different platform.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Rick said, “If I can get your POS system up and running in one of your stores on an IBM System/36, will you buy 100 System/36s?” Highland Superstores said maybe, provided they didn’t have to spend any money for the trial, and that the system would be up and running in the pilot store in 90 days!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores also made it clear they were keeping their focus and money on the PC LAN-based solution. The new IBM System/36-based solution would have to out-perform a solution that had a two-year head start!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>IBM approached several software companies in the Detroit area, and asked if they would be willing to develop the POS system for free, demonstrate that it worked, and then hope to get paid afterwards. They all said “No”... except my boss, Don George, who owned Custom Software Services.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Our company had about 15 employees at the time, business was slow, and we were in danger of going under.&nbsp; Don was an ex-IBM Systems Engineer, so he knew the guys in the local IBM office. He sat down and had some serious discussions with them about the project, and then he decided to take on the risk and tackle the project. I got involved when my boss asked me to manage the project.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>That does sound like quite a risk! What was it like working on a project, and leading a team, that would have a zero payout for everyone involved if it wasn’t successful?&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>It was extremely challenging. We couldn’t afford to pay a team of developers to write the software, so Don came up with a creative idea to share the risk. He offered several local developers a double-or-nothing deal. If they signed on with our project, we’d track all of their hours, and then pay them double their going hourly rate at the end -- if it was successful and Highland Superstores purchased it. If not, they’d get zero.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Surprisingly, he found 7 developers who were willing to take his offer, but they all had to keep their day jobs. So, they worked on our POS project nights and weekends.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>And you were in charge of managing this? How did you approach that?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I was 34 years old, and this was my very first project management assignment. The first thing I did was to read 3 books on project management. I knew that the project would be very difficult, and that I’d have to use every bit of education, new knowledge, guts, and perseverance I had!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>As it turned out, it was even more stressful, and challenging that I’d first thought. The project lasted 5 months, not 3. At the 90 day mark, we had accomplished enough that we earned another month or two as a grace period.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>The developers and I were all working 2 shifts, 7 days a week. Over that summer, none of us had any family time, or vacation time. There were many days when I came home late at night, dropped my clothes on the floor and fell into bed. Then, the next morning, I showered, grabbed clean clothes and was gone again. We worked 2 shifts, 7 days a week. The good news is that as the project progressed, everyone had more skin in the game. The developers saw their potential earnings mount, and became more and more unwilling to walk away.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>When we had the code (in the RPG language) running on a remote IBM System/36, IBM installed a System/36 in one of the Highland Superstores (for a free trial), and we spent about a month troubleshooting and debugging the software in a live store environment.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>That must have been exhausting! How about the flip side? Was there a best part about the project?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Yes! No scope creep! This was the only software development project I’ve ever worked on with zero scope creep.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>We didn’t realize at first, how important this would be, but it was one of the biggest contributors to the project’s success. There was no scope creep because Highland Superstores had already invested 2 years in hammering out the functionality of the system. All we had to …</span></span></span></p></div></div>

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I spend a fair amount of time wandering around in the terminal. The chances
are that you are too since you dared to open this story. My daily activities
led me to contribute to various kinds of projects (professional, personal and
open-source). For my sanity, I tend to follow strict rules to organize my
workspace, which helps me keep things tidied up and easily reachable. Or so I
thought.</p>
<p>I decided to arrange my projects by following the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces">Go
philosophy</a>: make the
arborescence mirrors the urls where they are reachable. e.g.,
<code>~/Workspace/src/github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles</code> would contain the
project <a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> owned by
<a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet">@aymericbeaumet</a> and accessible at
<a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. That’s great, but I am now facing a complex
directory structure tedious to navigate quickly. Making it, in the end,
harder to access the resources I need.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/back-end
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Nobody wants to manually deal with this.</em></p>
<p>Remembering and typing the location of each project (even while leveraging
autocomplete) is time-consuming. Creating shell aliases is not scalable.
Instead, I would like to rely on the pseudo-unicity of each project name to
find it among all the directories on my computer.</p>
<h2 id="z">z?</h2>
<p>Several tools exist to tackle this problem. My favorite is
<a href="https://github.com/rupa/z"><em>z</em></a>. It follows the Unix philosophy by being
small, focused and interoperable. <em>z</em> allows jumping around swiftly,
automatically learning from your habits. The entries are ranked based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency">frecency</a> at which you access the
directories.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the basics of this tool. Below is how I advise to install
it for Zsh on macOS (the install process should be similar for other shells
and operating systems):</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>brew <span>install </span>z
<span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"source '</span><span>$(</span>brew <span>--prefix</span> z<span>)</span><span>/etc/profile.d/z.sh'"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> ~/.zshenv
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Install z for Zsh on macOS.</em></p>
<p>Note how installing <em>z</em> is not enough to start using it. You have to source
<code>z.sh</code> at the beginning of each shell session to activate it. The <code>~/.zshenv</code>
configuration file is appropriate as Zsh <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html">loads it in most
circumstances</a>, making the
tool accessible in a wide-variety of contexts (terminals, editors, IDEs,
scripts, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="lets-play">Let’s play</h2>
<p>Once the install and setup are complete: start a new shell session, <code>cd</code>
through some folders and execute <code>z</code> to confirm it has been accurately
tracking your activity:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z | <span>sort</span> <span>-rn</span> | <span>head</span> <span>-3</span>
5331.72    /Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/back-end
637.255    /Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/ops
386.198 /Users/aymericbeaumet/.config/dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Top 3 directories based on frecency.</em></p>
<p>As shown above, I spend quite some time navigating through
<a href="https://github.com/brigad">Brigad</a> projects, but it seems I also often
access my <a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> to tweak
some configuration. The ranking score is volatile, and one could observe
significant changes in a brief amount of time.</p>
<p>Now that <em>z</em> has accumulated some knowledge try it by navigating to one of
the tracked folders. Navigating is as simple as executing the <code>z</code> command
followed by the directory name:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z dotfiles
<span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/Users/aymericbeaumet/.config/dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Navigating by matching with a whole directory name.</em></p>
<p>As a matter of facts, I do prefer to leverage partial matching (imagine <code>**</code>
surrounding your search pattern) to type fewer characters. Hence, <code>z dot</code> is
valid and should produce a similar behavior as <code>z dotfiles</code> (modulo possible
name collisions, but you get the idea). This works because <em>z</em> relies on
regular expressions. For example, the snippet below will navigate to the
directory ending with the letters “tmp” (with the highest score):</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z tmp<span>$</span>
<span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/private/tmp
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Navigating by matching with a regular expression.</em></p>
<p>Neat right? I guess you start seeing the possibilities of this tool. And we
have only scratched the surface of its capabilities. I suggest you dive in
its <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z/blob/master/README">documentation</a> to get an
idea of its full potential. Features such as autocomplete, subdirectories
matching, consecutive matching, etc. are a game changer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><em>z</em> is tremendous. This tool saves me a non-trivial amount of time every
single day. When one starts relying on it, there is no going back. And I hope
it’s going to fit your workflow as well as mine.</p>
<p>I would be grateful to hear any of your time-saving tricks. Feel free to
share your experiences!</p>

(tip: you don't get $150k/year for fixing printers).</p> <p>You also can't really talk to normal people about IT, because they use this industry, but they don't get it.

Once you lose your right to privacy you're screwed. Most of the people can easily be caught in a mind trap <em>"I have nothing to hide, why would I care?"</em>. Common mistake. You shouldn't worry about stuff you wanna hide, you should worry about what is in plain sight.</p> <p>This topic is so broad I was forced to come up with a categorization of a sort. I thought of it for no less than 3 minutes and this is the result: the most important thing is how obvious it is for an end user who stores the data, what the data really is and how it is manipulated. So, 3 variables: actor, data, and manipulation. A simple 3-dimensional matrix — you remember I wrote even a dumbass will understand the article? you don't remember? Me neither. Apparently, I didn't write it.</p> <p>Actor:</p> <ol> <li><strong>immediate receiver</strong>. When you give your phone number to get a new discount card the store gets your phone number. Yes, it's the first incredible insight from the article, thanks, Dan — you're welcome, my fellow reader.</li> <li><strong>shadow receiver</strong>. Is it obvious though that in that case your phone number will be sold to anyone else? Would you like it if Google and Facebook found out you are a regular customer of a brothel called "Tight flower bud"? Have no doubt, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/technology/facebook-expands-targeted-advertising-through-outside-data-sources.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they will buy that shit</a>. You're only starting to type "Epstein didn…" and the FBI already checks what toilet paper you use to threaten your ass using Braille writing system — all thanks to your Walmart discount card, ffs.</li> </ol> <p>Data:</p> <ol> <li><strong>stuff you give away consciously</strong>. You open another app that turns you into a cutie doggie. It asks for access to your photo gallery and camera, and you obviously allow it. What can go wrong?</li> <li><strong>stuff you didn't mean to give away</strong>. Mmm, 3896 photos you took over the last 3 years. These photos also contain <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXIF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meta-tags</a> with geo-coordinates of the place the photo was taken. So it means it is a very <a href="https://github.com/KrauseFx/detect.location" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accurate history of your moving</a>. Who would have thought the app gets programmatic access to all the photos and not just the one you choose.</li> </ol> <p>Manipulation:</p> <ol> <li><strong>storing</strong>. Let's get back to the photos. If you choose a photo to add a doggie face, this photo can be stored on the servers of this service for god knows how long. Nothing strange.</li> <li><strong>calculation</strong>. But, as I said, the app also gets access to the whole gallery. Is it that obvious that the app can get a pretty accurate guess on what is your home and work addresses are based on the time and geo-location of each photo? Or that it can run every image against <a href="https://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/151148689421/open-sourcing-a-deep-learning-solution-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an ML algorithm that finds NSFW images</a> and securely upload it to the servers? I hope your fucking doggie face was worth it.</li> <li><strong>selling</strong>. <em>If you don't pay for the product, you are the product</em>. What a cliché. Instagram is free because every single person on Earth can buy ads for a very specific audience. Those who travel to beaches, who loves certain food or have a high income. Instagram calculates all of this from the enormous data set they have, and the advertiser can combine these segments however they want. Of course, once you click an ad the advertiser knows exactly what segment you are in. <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/targeting.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Targeting accuracy" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/targeting.png" height="543" width="600"> </a> </li> <li><strong>hacks or leaks</strong>. Oh, guys and gals, when we get to this I'll turn your camera on to capture how surprised you'd be. For now, just believe me: <em>all the companies</em> lose the data from time to time, from a small garage startup to Google, from a small accounting firm to Revenue Service of an entire country. I get chills from some of the most notorious cases, really.</li> </ol> <p>Some of the bullets require some explanation (and we'll get to that!) because laymen for some reason think Big Corporations are not that bad and want good for humanity.

We call it "domain".</p> <p><em>God save you if you'll come telling me about ipv6.</em></p> <p>But the computers still work — all thanks to a thing called DNS (Domain Name Server, clear, isn't it?). Think of it as a huge table in Excel that translates a domain into an ip-address.</p> <p>DNS will be the first leak. The problem is that the founding fathers of the internet didn't foresee this informational revolution and they made the information exchange with the DNS completely unencrypted. Later we'll talk about transport layer security, but the idea is simple: your internet provider will always know what sites you visit. Sometimes it can even modify the answer from the original DNS if the site owner does not implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNSSEC</a>.</p> <p>Answering your question: yes, your provider knows you visit <em>the site</em>, which makes you sweat like a dog.</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong>: we have a few. You can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS-over-TLS (DoT)</a>. There's some difference that smart people get (I really don't), but you shouldn't dive into these details.</p> <p>You remember those tech guys who came to your house that set up the internet? They should have given you a piece of paper and said "don't lose this". You immediately threw it in the garbage after that, AND YOU DID RIGHT. It had your provider's DNS there, and that tech guy set up your router to use it. "It helps you with speed" — they said. "Insecure shit" — we understand. They do not support DoT and unlikely they will ever support it, because why would they.</p> <p>Try to use independent DNS-servers. I recommend using Cloudflare DNS with a cool ip-address: <strong>1.1.1.1</strong>. It's free, fast and they promise a zero-logs policy, so they don't save anything about your dirty little secrets. They have <a href="https://1.1.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps for smartphones</a>, that setup everything magically, so use them, otherwise it's kind of difficult to setup.</p> <p>It gets trickier for desktops. First, you need to setup a DNS <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setting-up-1.1.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the OS level</a>, and then turn on <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-will-eventually-roll-out-in-all-major-browsers-despite-isp-opposition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an experimental DoH support in the browser</a>.</p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#device-provider-datacenter-server" id="device-provider-datacenter-server"> <h2>Device → Provider → Datacenter → server</h2> </a><p>There are two types of connections: secure and not secure. You'll get a notification about an insecure connection from the browser if it's not an old piece of mammoth shit. If it's not an old piece of black rhino's shit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rhinoceros" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which got extinct in 2013</a>, it will even ask you to think carefully if you should use this site at all.</p> <p>If you see a notification about an insecure connection, you'd be safer to just close this site and do nothing there. Believe me, this site may be as bad as having unprotected sex with a partner that has radial red stripes spreading from their genitalia.</p> <p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/secure_channel.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Most secure connection of all" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/secure_channel.png" height="720" width="600"> </a> </p> <p>Insecure connections have no real vulnerabilities, except a small one: every single intermediary has complete control over stuff you send and receive — so it means a complete lack of any security at all. Some mobile operators, for example, <a href="https://tjournal.ru/tech/62611-pochemu-megafon-bessovestno-pokazyvaet-reklamu-na-chuzhih-saytah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">embed their fullscreen ads</a> on insecure sites without asking any permission from site owner.</p> <p>So let's talk about secure connections. I'll give you a small lecture about cryptography (no, it has near to no connection to cryptocurrencies) and how the network works so you can impress your grandma.</p> <p>If you're not a Ph.D. in cryptography and haven't launched an ICO from school's canteen, it good enough to know there are two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric is the one that has a single key for both encryption and decryption. Asymmetric one is where you use one key to encrypt stuff (it's called <strong>public key</strong>) and another key to decrypt it (it's called <strong>private key</strong>).</p> <p>Nobody really knows how the math works (like nobody really knows how so heavy-looking planes manage to fly the sky), but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol</a> that powers all this voodoo-shenanigan is safe enough for you to send sacred cat photos to your family.</p> <p>So, we use both types of encryption. It's rather boring to read, so I wrote a play that illustrates the whole process.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Characters</strong>:</p> <p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: young Alamaba fella having troubles with girls for some strange reasons.</p> <p><strong>Hannah</strong>: just a girl I added here to make a full picture.</p> <p><strong>Jimmie's phone</strong>: the device that sends messages.</p> <p><strong>Pinder</strong>: an app. <em>(any similarities to reality are entirely coincidental)</em></p> <p><strong>Pinder's server</strong>: the server that receives messages.</p> <p><strong>Act 1</strong></p> <p><em>Jimmie types a message to Hannah in Pinder</em></p> <p><strong>Jimmie's phone</strong> (talks to Pinder's server_): Hi there, good fellow. My guy wants to write yet another message (<em>signs</em>). Let's do this quickly and securely. I know HTTPS.</p> <p><strong>Pinder's server</strong>: Hi there, pal. Yeah, I get it.

		<p><em>Update: an updated version of the ideas in this blog post appears in <a href="https://manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">chapter 9 of my book</a>. </em></p>
<p>URLs are a cornerstone of the web, and are the basic means by which content and resources are shared and disseminated. People copy and paste URLs into Slack or WhatsApp to share interesting links. Google crawls the web, discovering and indexing such links. But what happens when the page you want to link is not public and requires credentials in order to view or interact with it? Suddenly a URL is no longer sufficient, unless the recipient happens to already have credentials. Sometimes they do, and everything is fine, but often they do not. If we really do want to give them access, the problem becomes how to securely pass along some credentials with the URL so that they can access the page we have linked.</p>
<p>A commonly desired approach to this problem is to encode the credentials into the URL itself. While convenient, this solution is fraught with dangers and frequently results in credentials being exposed in insecure contexts. In this article, we’ll look at various ways to accomplish this, the ways that things can go wrong, and conclude with a set of guidelines for cases where this can be made secure, and actually improve security overall.</p>

<h2>What kind of credentials?</h2>
<p>The most usual kind of credential to grant access to a protected resource would be a username and password. Way back in the prehistory of the web there was a standard way to encode a username and password into a URL using the following syntax:</p>
<pre>http://bob:sekret@example.invalid/some/path</pre>
<p>Here “bob” is the username and “sekret” is the password. The way this was supposed to work is that when you clicked on that link, the web browser would automatically submit the username and password using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic</a> authentication (or possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication">Digest authentication</a>, but we should never talk of that). This turned out to be a terrible idea for many reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, putting your username and password in plaintext into a URL that can then be copied far and wide is a really quick way to account compromise. Giving your username and password to somebody else just so they can look at one of your cat photos is not the best idea in the world.</li>
<li>Basic authentication just Base64-encodes the credentials, so unless you were using SSL then the password would be recoverable to anybody observing the network traffic. While sites sometimes put SSL on the login page, they often didn’t bother for other parts of the site (relying on time-limited session cookies instead), so sending a username and password to a random URL was quite risky. This is much better now with the widespread adoption of HTTPS.</li>
<li>Due to the way Basic authentication works, after you have logged into one page with it, your browser will helpfully and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617#section-2.2">proactively send the username and password to every other page on the site</a> under the same path. This can leak credentials to unrelated pages.</li>
<li>It was soon realised that using a URL like <code><a href="http://www.google.com:search@example.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com:search@example.com</a></code> was a really easy way to create convincing-looking phishing links.</li>
<li>If the target of the URL is a login endpoint, then the attacker can attempt to get you to click on the link to perform a <a href="https://support.detectify.com/customer/portal/articles/1969819-login-csrf">Login CSRF</a> attack. In this case the honest user ends up with a session cookie for an account under the control of the attacker.</li>
</ol>
<p>For all these reasons, this specific form of URL was deprecated back in 2005, and now support within browsers is patchy: Safari for instance will just silently ignore any username:password component when following such a link. Other browsers will tolerate them in some cases, but this varies considerably by browser and often by version to version. Some versions of Chrome refuse to follow such links and instead display a large red phishing warning page.</p>
<p>So if not a username and password, then what kind of credentials could we put in a URL? Ideally you’d want a limited-scope credential that provides only permission to access that one specific URL in just the ways that the sharer of the link intends (e.g., read-only access). This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least authority</a> (POLA). Typically this is done by creating an unguessable <em>bearer token</em> that grants limited access to anybody that holds the token (the token bearer). There are two basic approaches to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The token on its own is sufficient to grant access. This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capability-based security</a>. This is similar to how keys work in the physical world, with the token here acting as the key. Just as with a real key, you can have different keys (capabilities) for different doors (URLs) so that one key does not grant access to everything.</li>
<li>The token grants some subset of the permissions of the person/agent who authorised it. Access is granted based on the permissions granted by the token as well as the identity of the user that approved it (the <em>resource owner</em>). This is the model used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Home">UMA</a>, and a real-world analogy would be a signed note from a teacher granting a child permission to go and fetch something from a store cupboard at school. The teacher’s signature and identity grant the authority here, and the note describes the scope of the permission being granted.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will refer to both methods as <em>capability URLs</em> in this article, although strictly speaking that term only applies to the first option.</p>
<h2>Why put tokens in URLs at all?</h2>
<p>The OAuth approach is pretty popular these days as a way of granting limited access to third parties without giving away your username and password. The capability approach is less common, but has some <a href="http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/Walnut/Secure_Distributed_Computing#Capabilities">attractive security properties</a>. In both cases, if we want to follow POLA then we will end up with many fine-grained tokens that grant access to specific resources. We then have to make sure that we use the right token with the right URL, otherwise we might be denied access and also leak security tokens to unauthorized parties.</p>
<p>If we instead use broad-scope tokens and reuse them for many URLs then we run the risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy</a> attacks, where an attacker tricks us into adding our token to a request of their choosing. This is the basis of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF attacks</a> against session tokens, and the same thing can happen with OAuth tokens if the code that adds access tokens to requests is not carefully written. Often UI code is written to add an access token to every request transparently, as a convenience for the developer. If an attacker can influence any of the requests you make, such as by manipulating URL parameters or the URL fragment, then they may still be able to trick your UI code into adding its token to a request of the attacker’s choosing.</p>
<p>Capability-based systems avoid confused deputy attacks because they fundamentally combine <em>permission to act on something </em>with the <em>ability to name that thing</em>. You can’t name an object you don’t have access to, and you can’t just add a permission token to any request to any resource. In an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">object-capability</a> programming language, capabilities are references to objects; if you hold a reference to an object you can call the methods on it, and you can’t just create a reference out of nowhere. On the web, we can achieve some of the same advantages by combining unforgeable tokens with URLs. CSRF attacks become impossible as the attacker cannot construct a valid URL in the first place (think of this as a bit like anti-CSRF tokens directly in the URL itself). Phishing becomes pointless as there are no credentials to phish independent of the links they are part of. In certain cases, even XSS attacks become less effective, as we shall see later.</p>
<h2>How to do it safely</h2>
<p>Many security professionals reading this will baulk at the very idea of putting security tokens into URLs, and with good reason. A <em>lot</em> can go wrong. Let’s look at some ways to add credentials to URLs and how they can go wrong. Firstly, there are some issues that are common to all methods of putting credentials in URLs:</p>
<ul>
<li>URLs may be saved in the history of a browser, making them potentially accessible to the next user of a public terminal. Most browsers support private browsing modes that can be used on public browsers to prevent this, but use of a public terminal is always a risk. If somebody gains access to your computer or phone, then this may also be a threat even on your own device. Using time-limited tokens in URLs can help mitigate against these threats.</li>
<li>URLs within page content may be cached by the browser and by web proxies. Use of TLS and proper <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control">Cache-Control</a> headers can reduce this risk.</li>
<li>URLs in the content of a HTML page may be sniffed by other scripts running in the page. Sandboxing untrusted 3rd-party scripts in iframes can help, but a more general technique is to avoid links directly in HTML, as we shall see later.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tokens in the path or in query parameters</h3>
<pre>https://example.com/users/<span>Kay2xVuid_tiWxJ5NI0NWmGxQ7Y</span> https://example.com/users/bob?key=<span>Kay2xVuid_tiWxJ5NI0NWmGxQ7Y</span></pre>
<p>An obvious place to put a token in a URL is either into the path (perhaps using random names for resources) or into the query parameters. This is nice and simple, but suffers from some drawbacks.</p>
<p>Firstly, such URLs might inadvertently leak in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer">Referer header</a> when loading resources from other sites. This can also happen via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/referrer">document.referrer</a> field available in Javascript when a third-party resource is loaded in an iframe (ironically, often done to isolate the 3rd-party code). These days the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy">Referrer-Policy</a> header can be used to prevent these kinds of leaks, but browser support is not yet 100%.</p>
<p>A second drawback is that URL path elements and query parameters are often logged in access logs of any servers that the request passes through, making tokens vulnerable to anybody who has access to those logs. The more widespread deployment of HTTPS has reduced this risk, but it still common to terminate TLS at a load balancer or reverse proxy (or even <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204144518-SSL-FAQ">in the cloud</a> before it ever reaches your own servers). The request may then pass through several other gateways and services before being processed (even more …</p></div></article></div>

  <p><i>Posted on <code>16 Feb 2021</code> by
  <code>Boris Kolpackov</code> with comments on <a href="https://redd.it/ll1l6z"><code>r/cpp/</code></a></i></p>

  <p><b>TL;DR</b>: <code>build2</code> now provides conforming and scalable
  support for all the major C++20 Modules features when used with GCC. This
  includes named modules, module partitions (both interface and
  implementation), header unit importation, and include translation. All of
  these features are also supported in libraries, including consumption of
  installed libraries with information about modules and importable headers
  conveyed in <code>pkg-config</code> files. As part of this effort we have
  also created a collection of <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/">examples</a> that
  demonstrate C++20 Modules features that impact the build process.</p>

  <p>Before going into detail on each of these features, let's clarify what we
  mean by <i>conforming</i> and <i>scalable</i>. With GCC (and soon with
  Clang), <code>build2</code> uses the module mapper mechanism to discover
  module and header unit dependencies and communicate their mapping to the
  compiler. As a result, <code>build2</code> does not place any restrictions
  on the structure of translation units or module features used. In other
  words, it is able to handle any conforming C++ module or header unit.</p>

  <p>Similarly, <code>build2</code> does not place on the user any modules
  support burden that would not scale to general, real-world projects and
  use-cases. Specifically, it does not expect the user to manually specify and
  maintain module name to file name mapping, their dependency information, or
  arrange pre-building of any modules or header units, including of system
  headers. In particular, <code>build2</code> will automatically build header
  units if and when imported or include-translated.</p>

  <div>
  <p>While <code>build2</code> support for modules is complete and reasonably
  reliable, at the time of writing the same cannot be said about GCC. As a
  result, until the situation improves, the implementation is meant more for
  early experimentation rather than production use. See <a href="#try">How to
  Try</a> for details.</p>

  <p>One <code>build2</code> feature that is not yet handled by the module
  mapper is support for auto-generated headers. However, this support has
  already been successfully prototyped during the early modules development in
  GCC and we hope to revive and complete it in the near future (see <a href="https://wg21.link/P1842">P1842</a> for details).</p>

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-module"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-module</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  

  <p>Building named modules with <code>build2</code> is fairly
  straightforward. Here is a minimal example consisting of three files,
  <code>hello.mxx</code>, <code>main.cxx</code>, and
  <code>buildfile</code>:</p>

  <pre>// hello.mxx

export module hello;

import &lt;string_view&gt;;
import &lt;iostream&gt;;

export namespace hello
{
  void
  say_hello (const std::string_view&amp; name)
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; '!' &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
}</pre>

  <pre>// main.cxx

import hello;

int
main ()
{
  hello::say_hello ("World");
}</pre>

  <pre># buildfile

cxx.std = experimental
cxx.features.modules = true

using cxx

assert $cxx.features.modules "no modules support for $cxx.signature"

mxx{*}: extension = mxx
cxx{*}: extension = cxx

exe{hello}: {cxx mxx}{*}</pre>

  <p>If you place all three files into some directory, you should be able to
  build it like this (see <a href="#try">How to Try</a> for details):</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11
c++ .../include/c++/11.0.0/h{string_view}
c++ .../include/c++/11.0.0/h{iostream}
c++ mxx{hello}
c++ cxx{main}
ld exe{hello}

$ ./hello
Hello, World!</pre>

  <p>As you might have noticed, we used a different extension
  (<code>.mxx</code>) for our module interface (<code>hello.mxx</code>)
  compared to other source files (for example, <code>main.cxx</code>). We
  recommend that you follow this practice (using the <code>.mpp</code>
  extension if your source files use <code>.cpp</code>). If, however, you
  would like to use the same extension for all translation units, you can, you
  will just have to sort them out in your <code>buildfiles</code>, for example
  (after renaming <code>hello.mxx</code> to <code>hello.cxx</code>):</p>

  <pre>mxx{*}: extension = cxx
cxx{*}: extension = cxx

exe{hello}: mxx{hello} cxx{main}</pre>

  <p>If you compare the above three files to the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-module"><code>hello-module</code></a>
  example, you will notice that the latter has quite a few more files and some
  internal structure. The reason is that <code>hello-module</code> is a
  package with a structure more suitable for real-world projects. In contrast,
  the above three files are a simple build system-only project more suitable
  for quick tests and prototypes.</p>

  <div>
  <p>Because modules support in GCC is currently experimental and incomplete,
  we have to explicitly force this feature either with the following in our
  <code>buildfile</code>:</p>

  <pre>cxx.std = experimental
cxx.features.modules = true</pre>

  <p>Or by overriding on the command line:</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx.std=experimental config.cxx.features.modules=true ...</pre>
  </div>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-partition"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-partition</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  <p>There is not much difference in dealing with module partitions compared
  to primary module interfaces: both interface and implementation partitions
  should use the same extension as module interfaces (or otherwise be
  explicitly listed as <code>mxx{}</code> targets, as shown above). See the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-partition"><code>hello-partition</code></a>
  example which shows the use of both interface and implementation
  partitions.</p>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-header-import"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-header-import</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  <p>Importing header units is straightforward: simply replace
  <code>#include</code> directives with <code>import</code> declarations and
  hope the compiler can handle it. In fact, we've already used header units in
  our named module example above. Here is another example:</p>

  <pre>// main.cxx

import &lt;iostream&gt;;

int
main ()
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}</pre>

  <pre># buildfile

cxx.std = experimental
cxx.features.modules = true

using cxx

assert $cxx.features.modules "no modules support for $cxx.signature"

cxx{*}: extension = cxx

exe{hello}: cxx{*}</pre>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11
c++ .../include/c++/11.0.0/h{iostream}
c++ cxx{main}
ld exe{hello}</pre>

  <p>Naturally, importation is not limited to standard library headers and we
  can also import our project's own headers as demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-header-import"><code>hello-header-import</code></a>
  example.</p>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-header-translate"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-header-translate</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  <p>Instead of manually replacing <code>#include</code> directives with
  <code>import</code> declarations in our source code we can translate them on
  the fly. To control which headers are translated we use the
  <code>config.cxx.translate_include</code> configuration variable. For
  example, we can try to translate all the importable headers:</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11 config.cxx.translate_include=all-importable</pre>

  <p>Since include translation is non-intrusive, you can try it on any project
  that uses <code>build2</code> by forcing modules support and enabling
  include translation, for example:</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11 \
  config.cxx.std=experimental \
  config.cxx.features.modules=true \
  config.cxx.translate_include=all-importable</pre>

  <p>Which headers are importable? The C++20 standard specifies that all the
  C++ standard library headers (but not the C library wrappers) are
  importable. For example, this is how we can translate only importable
  standard library headers:</p>

  <pre>config.cxx.translate_include=std-importable</pre>

  <p>We can also mark our own headers as importable with the
  <code>cxx.importable</code> variable, for example:</p>

  <pre># buildfile

...

# Assume headers are importable unless stated otherwise.
#
hxx{*}: cxx.importable = true</pre>

  <p>There could also be third-party headers that are not explicitly marked as
  importable. To handle this, we can request the translation of specific
  headers or header wildcard patterns, for example:</p>

  <pre>config.cxx.translate_include='&lt;iostream&gt; "&lt;boost/container/*.hpp&gt;"'</pre>

  <p>We can also disable the translation of specific headers or header groups,
  for example:</p>

  <pre>config.cxx.translate_include='all-importable std-importable@false'
config.cxx.translate_include='std-importable &lt;iostream&gt;@false'</pre>

  <p>You can also attempt to translate all headers by specifying the
  <code>all</code> header group. This is primarily useful for experimentation,
  for example, to discover which headers would break the build if
  translated.</p>

  <p>Finally, if we need to adjust or disable include translation for our
  project or for specific translation units in our project, we use the
  <code>cxx.translate_include</code> variable, for example:</p>

  <pre># buildfile

cxx.translate_include += &lt;iostream&gt;@false

obj{main}: cxx.translate_include = # Don't translate anything.</pre>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-module"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-library-module</code></a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-header"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-library-header</code></a>
  for the complete examples.</p>

  <p>Building modules as part of a library does not pose any additional
  complications. Here is how we can convert our example from the <a href="#named-modules">Named Modules</a> section to build a library:</p>

  <pre># buildfile

...

exe{hello}: cxx{main} lib{hello}
lib{hello}: {cxx mxx}{* -main}</pre>

  <p>However, installing libraries with modules and then consuming the result
  in other projects (and potentially with other build systems) requires
  additional mechanisms. Specifically, the installation needs to convey which
  modules are provided by the library and the location of their module
  interface source files (the consuming build system also needs to arrange for
  the compilation of these interfaces on the side).</p>

  <p>Instead of inventing yet another file format, we choose to reuse the
  <code>pkg-config</code> files that <code>build2</code> automatically
  produces for every library it installs. Specifically, the
  <code>pkg-config</code> format supports free variables which is what we use
  to convey the modules information. For example, this is the relevant
  fragment from the <code>libhello.pc</code> file in the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-module"><code>hello-library-module</code></a>
  example (<code>..</code> in <code>hello..check</code> encodes the
  <code>:</code> module partition separator):</p>

  <pre>cxx_modules = \
  hello..check=/usr/include/libhello/check.mxx \
  hello=/usr/include/libhello/hello.mxx</pre>

  <p>Naturally, the same mechanism is used to convey which library headers are
  importable (from the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-header"><code>hello-library-header</code></a>
  example):</p>

  <pre>cxx_importable_headers = \
  /usr/include/libhello/check.hxx \
  /usr/include/libhello/hello.hxx</pre>

<p> <a href="https://www.de24.news/"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; editors of Titanic can currently no longer deliver the digital edition of their satirical magazine via the app in the Google Play Store. <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; background is a dispute with the tech company, which, according to the Titanic editor-in-chief, took offense at several magazine covers.</p>



<p>In particular, the December 2020 issue was rejected by Google because of the depiction of a sacred motif (profanity), which was rated as “obscene”: <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; cover of the magazine shows the Pope with a bare backside with a crucifix, and an angry one (because he is jealous of God ) Seeing Jesus with his genitals bared. <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; cover alludes to a cover picture of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, on which the Turkish prime minister could be seen in a similar scene.</p>

<h3>Titanic 12.2020</h3><figcaption> (Image: Titanic Magazine)</figcaption>
<h3 id="nav_antrag_auf__0">Application for re-listing rejected for the time being</h3>
<p>Two weeks ago, shortly before the appearance of the second edition in 2021, Google blocked the app of the satirical magazine with an automatically generated notice without warning, said the Titanic editorial team. This was followed by the demand to delete some older magazine covers with depictions of nudity and sexuality. It is curious that the Titanic app has been listed in the store since 2014 and actually had an age rating of 12 years due to the assignment as satire, explained Titanic editor-in-chief Moritz Hürtgen <em>heise online</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; East German magazine Eulenspiegel, for example, continues to be listed in the store with similarly drastic cover pictures, which is even available without age restriction. According to Hürtgen, as a compromise solution, his magazine had submitted an application for re-approval as an adult app with the age rating “18 and over”. However, Google rejected the application on Monday.</p>

<h3 id="nav__quot_verkniffen__1">“Connected Humor of Monopolwichsern”</h3>

<p>Moritz Hürtgen also affirmed that the satirical magazine will not bow to pressure from Silicon Valley: “TITANIC will not censor itself in order to do justice to the pinched humor of monopoly wankers in San Fernando Valley, err: Silicon Valley.” One would rather accept the loss of digital subscriptions and leave the store permanently if Google does not fully reactivate the Titanic app and its motifs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp;re had already been a misunderstanding with the Apple App Store in the past, but this could be resolved quickly (the lock was lifted, the Titanic app is still available in the App Store). <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; long-suffering Titanic was also temporarily blocked once on Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="nav_alternative__2">Alternative delivery routes for subscribers</h3>
<p>Titanic claims that it has appealed against Google’s censorship request and is now also considering withdrawing its own app permanently from the Play Store. In the meantime, subscribers will be “supplied by other means”, says the Titanic website.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; Titanic editorial team currently offers subscribers direct delivery of print and PDF editions. Since, according to the editor-in-chief, the magazine “has no access to the contact details of the” Play Store “subscribers,” those affected by the app lock should report by email. Further information can be found in the entry in the Titanic news ticker. Anyone who would like to support the satirical magazine in the matter can still take out a classic print subscription.</p>
<h3 id="nav_die__3"><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; tech corporations and censorship</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; incident calls to mind censorship decisions on Facebook, for example, where in January the Board of Appeal had four of the five blocked bans revoked after a review. A Goebbels quote posted in English without context (which did not serve as a satire), false promises of salvation for COVID-19 and the depiction of bare breasts in the course of a breast cancer campaign were then again considered permissible.</p>
<p>In the past, breastfeeding mothers had successfully protested against the deletion of their pictures on Facebook. In the course of the “breast puritanism”, the ZDF Facebook page was temporarily blocked due to a medical image. In a recent report, Amnesty International criticized Facebook and Google for participating in the suppression of people and opinions.</p>

The MicroPython version that supports the Raspberry Pi Pico is still very limited. So, I extended it to include the <code>ucryptolib</code> package.</p><p>I included the compiled custom firmware in the <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/micropython-pico-mbedtls">lemariva/micropython-pico-mbedtls</a> repository. But if you want to build the firmware from scratch, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>First, clone the Micropython official repository, and pull the pico-sdk submodule following these steps:
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git
cd micropython
#
# usually this shouldn't be necessary, but the master branch is not compatible with the actual pico-sdk
git checkout tags/v1.14
#
git submodule update --init -- lib/pico-sdk
cd lib/pico-sdk
git submodule update --init</code></pre></li><li>To build the RP2040 MicroPython port, you’ll need to install some extra tools (toolchain, etc.):
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi build-essential</code></pre></li><li>and build the <code>mpy-cross</code> tool:
<pre><code>cd ../..
make -C mpy-cross</code></pre></li><li>After that, add these <code>define</code>s lines to the <code>mpconfigport.h</code> file inside the <code>ports/rp2</code> folder:
<pre><code>#define MICROPY_PY_UCRYPTOLIB                   (1)
#define MICROPY_SSL_MBEDTLS                     (1)</code></pre></li><li>This means you need to add to the pico-sdk and compile the library <code>MBEDTLS</code>, which is nowadays not included. Therefore, I included that to the CMake project using this file:
<pre><code>include(ExternalProject)

<p>As you may already have seen, you need a <code>pico_config.h</code> file, which is included in the repository. I duplicated some of the configurations of the ESP32. Copy that file inside the <code>ports/rp2</code> folder.</p></li><li>Finally, add/modify two lines to the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file inside the <code>ports/rp2</code> folder:

<pre><code>cd ports/rp2

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			

<p>In late August 2020 I read <a href="https://press.stripe.com/#the-dream-machine">The Dream
Machine</a> and it is my favorite
book of 2020. It is an incredible overview of a sliver of computer pioneers in
the 1960s-1980s and how one man was instrumental in tying all their narratives
together. One of the strands the book follows is the group at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">PARC</a> (and other places) that
firmly believed in the notion of interactive computing. Over the last year,
I’ve repeatedly been introduced to this strand of thinking. There is Douglas
Engelbart’s <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned/Doug_Engelbart-AugmentingHumanIntellect.pdf">Augmenting Human
Intellect</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>
and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">mother of all
demos</a>. The notion that
computers should allow humans to <em>think better</em>, and one way to do that is to
allow humans to express and try out ideas better. <em>Writing</em> is a useful skill
to form coherent, but generally linear streams of thought. <em>Computing</em> is the
closest we can yet get to a non-linear exploration of a problem domain, and
freed from the limitations of time and space, we can recreate our thoughts in a
malleable, explorable way. By applying <a href="https://doriantaylor.com/softwares-ailing-mythology">a known process to known information,
but turning a few billion cranks at a
time</a> we can get to better
solutions, faster. The notion is, if we could have a <em>computer</em> (the physical
device including the software) that would allow people to iteratively express
their problems, get immediate sensory (primarily visual, but nothing prevents
using the other senses) feedback and <em>extend the computer as necessary</em>, we can
really liberate the human mind from some of its limitations. It is a very
different vision from the consensus reality of vendors that deliver
pre-packaged applications that all come with restrictions.</p>

<p>Smalltalk<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup> is one of the outputs of this strand of thinking and has had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#History">big impact on general purpose programming
languages</a><sup id="fnref:bak"><a href="#fn:bak">3</a></sup>. However the
focus on object orientation and test-driven development have robbed the world
of what I think are its most important aspects:</p>

<ol>
<li>programming as a dialogue with the computer, with meaningful feedback and <em>assistance</em>.</li>
<li>the environment being just as important to programming as the language, and empowering users to <em>modify the environment to help solve their problem</em>.</li>
<li>semantic simplicity as a necessity for easier comprehension in the face of the above points.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aditya Siram has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/baxtyeFVn3w">this excellent
talk</a> giving a taste of Smalltalk.
If you had to take only one thing away from this post, it is to go and watch
that. I knew I had to try this thing out! While I worked through the <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2021/experiencing-smalltalk/TODO">Pharo
MOOC</a> for a few days, I quickly lost interest in their examples. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent
of Code 2020</a> (AoC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> seemed like a much
better avenue to really try out Smalltalk. All my experiences are based on the
<a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a> variant, which seems to be the leading
implementation right now.</p>

<p>While I was working my way through AoC, Mike Levins wrote <a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/">On repl-driven
programming</a>. I
think he wasn’t fully able to convey the ideas of Smalltalk, because the term
“REPL” is too strongly associated with Python/JavaScript/Ruby REPLs at this
point. I hope I did my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642699">bit</a> of
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642717">evangelizing</a> to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642741">correct
that</a>. Alright, lets jump into
my experience.</p>



<h2 id="a-truly-integrated-development-environment-ide">A truly integrated development environment (IDE)</h2>

<p>What do I mean? Well Smalltalk really facilitates creating a program in an
exploratory style, including test-driven development. As an example, for Day 5,
I wrote the following:</p>



<p>Now, as soon as I “accept” this code (by pressing Ctrl+S), Smalltalk will ask
me if I would like to define this <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code> class. It will pop up
a little window to let me do that. It will also detect I wrote a test case
(because when I created a class for the test case, I inherited from <code>TestCase</code>)
and the system browser and other elements of the interface will have these
little gray/green/red dots next to every test case, letting me run the test and
observe the results right away. Now, this is offered in modern IDEs like
IntelliJ and PyCharm, but this was available 40 years ago in Smalltalk! But
that is just the beginning.</p>

<p>I can now run this test (remember I’ve only defined the <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code>
class at this point) and it will encounter the missing method <code>toSeat:</code> on the
class (think of this like a “static method” in Java/Python<sup id="fnref:static"><a href="#fn:static">5</a></sup>). In a
statically typed language, you would get a compilation error or have your IDE
highlight it for you. If you were in a dynamic language, then you’d just have
an exception thrown when running the program – <code>AttributeError</code> in Python.
Unless you explicitly ran the test in a debugger, that is all you would get and
now you’ve to go back to the editor, fix this, then re-run the test.</p>

<p>Not so in Smalltalk. First this isn’t just an IDE in the sense of a
language-aware editor. The IDE is also very aware of the runtime environment.
It will break at the stack frame with the missing method, and pop up a window.
You can <em>create</em> a method right there. This window has a full fledged editor
with code completion and all the other fanciness right there. I’m not aware of
any other environment<sup id="fnref:lisp"><a href="#fn:lisp">6</a></sup> that does this. Ok so we quickly recover by
creating the method. But I don’t know exactly what to put in there yet. Don’t
worry, this is Smalltalk. We don’t need to go through this cycle of rerunning
the entire test. The state of the running program is <em>preserved</em> until the
point where you hit the error, and you just tell the IDE “ok, I’ve fixed the
immediate error, let’s try again” and it will resume execution from there! You
can do this as many times as you wish, developing the code as a function of
encountering errors and test failures. This very fast iteration cycle feels
amazing! Imagine writing a much more complex program that was running for
minutes to hours but then hit an error. In most languages you would have to fix
it and start from the beginning, but in Smalltalk you would just fix it right
there and proceed.</p>

<p>I think browser developer tools are the closest we can come to having this kind
of interactivity in widespread computing environments. They don’t do that yet,
but they could. But we need to acknowledge how much work had to be put in to
those tools vs Smalltalk. In addition, the that implementation would likely
need to be in C++ instead of JavaScript, which means users wouldn’t be able to
extend and improve it as necessary. Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<h2 id="ide-extension-and-visualization">IDE extension and visualization</h2>

<p>Where most IDEs and language implementations are written in C/C++/Java,
Smalltalk prides itself on bootstrapping from a very minimal native code core.
After that nearly everything about the runtime and the IDE is written in
Smalltalk. The program and the environment are not 2 separate things, they are
one. When you execute your program, it is just another “thread” in the same
environment that you are creating the program in. You can do bizarre things
like remapping <code>true</code> to <code>false</code> or redefining what addition means and the
entire system will reflect the change right away (to disastrous results!). The
fact that the IDE and the program share a language means that any Smalltalk
programmer can understand and extend the IDE itself. Would you like a menu with
your most commonly used commands? Sure, just use the inspector/debugger to find
out where the menus are defined and add an entry there. Boom!</p>

<p>This also offers the really powerful ability to customize the debugger for the
task at hand. <a href="http://kursjan.github.io/petitparser2/">PetitParser2</a> is
probably the best example of this. It is a parser-combinator library. As Aditya
demonstrates in his talk, when you build up a parser, the parser provides
several hooks into the Smalltalk debugger. It can show you the matches it has
built up so far(including negative matches!) and you can run various inputs
against the parser to understand behavior. So you can start with a very simple
parser and iteratively make it complicated, observing the parse tree and
getting the behavior you want.</p>

<p>Whereas a lot of AoC implementations on reddit used various regex and string
operations for parsing inputs, I’d lean to PetitParser for anything beyond
simple white-space delimited numbers. It was just so easy and straightforward.
Instead of having to find subtle bugs in string parsing, I could actually see a
domain specific debugging view as my parser encountered tokens.</p>

<p>You could similarly imagine having domain specific drawings for your project.
If I was writing a build system in Smalltalk, I would write a build graph
viewer, and instead of a <a href="https://graphviz.org/">static graphviz image</a>, it
could be very interactive. While the build was running, it could update the
graph with file modification times, or indicate whether it thinks a file needs
to be rebuilt, and then I could easily debug why a particular file wasn’t being
built.</p>

<p>The folks at <a href="https://feenk.com/">Feenk</a> are really leveraging this in their
<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to fantastic effect! I highly
recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLZHVq_-2D2-iI4rA2O8Ug">their
videos</a>.</p>

<h2 id="minor">Minor</h2>

<p>I appreciated the built-in Array2D class for the various game-of-life
implementations as well as <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20">Jurassic
Jigsaw</a> where it was easy to reason in
terms of rows and columns, and quickly slice those out.  Similarly, the Point
class and special “syntax”<sup id="fnref:point"><a href="#fn:point">7</a></sup> made Day 12 <a href="https://github.com/nikhilm/AdventOfCode2020/blob/bbc331e2af2d948e683cade9ff4f93b4e4a3f667/AdventOfCode/AOCFerry.class.st">really
easy</a>.</p>



<p>Of course everything wasn’t magical. The Smalltalk/Pharo community is very
small, so this shouldn’t be considered a rant, just my disappointments.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>This was my biggest frustration. If we accept that <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">documentation has 4
distinct types</a>, Smalltalk does a great job
of Reference docs, because everything can easily be inspected and browsed, so
reading method documentation, while seeing its implementation is really easy.
You can also easily inspect what an object is at the point of use, and then see
what methods are available on it. However there is still plenty of scope for
improvement here, as not all non-trivial methods have docstrings. In addition,
for such a powerful IDE, the lack of documentation tooltips on hover is very
odd.</p>

<p>It really lags behind in the other categories. There is a wealth of great
content in <a href="http://books.pharo.org/">various free books</a> and the
<a href="http://mooc.pharo.org/">MOOC</a> that explains the language and getting around
the IDE. However all the books on various useful libraries are really out of
date. It isn’t fair to expect someone to …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Web performance isn’t going to save you in this crisis.</p>
<p>But if you’re building a software product, chances are you’re relatively unaffected. And in this case, having a quick app is more important than ever. Internet <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-affecting-internet-performance">is slowing down</a> due to increased demand, and people <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/mobile-phone-shipments-will-drop-to-10-year-low-this-year-as-coronavirus-hurts-demand/">are holding on to their phones</a> for longer – so if your app is slow, your users <em>will</em> be affected by it.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://wpostats.com/"><em>slow app</em> means <em>worse business</em></a>.</p>
<p>Today, let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> – an advanced note-taking web app. Notion is a great product, but one thing customers complain about is its startup time:</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Notion app and my laptop OS take the same time to boot.</p><p>Beautiful application but it's tooooo slow😔</p></div>— Aniket Mandle (@aniketmandle11) <a href="https://twitter.com/aniketmandle11/status/1256659106464698368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Notion <a href="https://twitter.com/NotionHQ/status/1228074819784073216">shipped tremendous speed enhancements recently</a>, but there’s still a lot of space to improve. Let’s reverse-engineer it and see what else can be optimized!</p>


<p>Notion is a React web app embedded into a native shell. This means its “startup time” is largely the “loading time of the web part”.</p>
<blockquote><div><p><strong>To be concrete.</strong> On the desktop, the Notion app is a web app wrapped with Electron. On mobile, from my understanding, the Notion app runs both React Native parts (likely responsible for some mobile experiences) and web parts (likely responsible for the overall editing UI).</p><p>Due to (apparently) HTTPS certificate pinning in the Android Notion app, I wasn’t able to verify whether the mobile app runs the same bundles the desktop app does. But even if the bundles are different, issues they are having are, likely, similar.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>To understand how the web part is loading, let’s create <a href="https://www.notion.so/iamakulov/Job-Board-f96cfe500e7d47108f44e0b6102e7c01">a public Notion page</a>:</p>

<p>It takes a couple more seconds to finish loading all the hero image.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.2 seconds for a desktop computer is quite a lot. However, with a medium-tier phone like Nexus 5, this time <a href="https://webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=200420_7E_24739856690fea9cbdadeea3e0b934a2-r%3A1-c%3A0&amp;thumbSize=200&amp;ival=100&amp;end=visual">increases to 12.6 seconds</a>. Here’s how that feels:</p>

<p>Let’s see how we can improve it.</p>

<p>When one talks about “loading speed”, one typically means <em>networking performance</em>. From the networking standpoint, Notion is doing well: they’re using HTTP/2, they’re gzipping files, and they’re using Cloudflare as a proxying CDN.</p>
<p>However, another part of “loading speed” that people talk less about is <em>processing performance</em>. All downloaded resources have a processing cost: gzip archives need to be decompressed; images need to be decoded; JS needs to be executed.</p>
<p>Unlike networking performance, processing performance doesn’t improve with better networks – it’s only as fast as the user’s CPU is. And user’s CPUs in phones – especially Android phones – <a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4">are <em>bad</em></a>:</p>

  </figure>
<p>For Notion, processing performance is even more significant. It’s easy to avoid networking costs by caching network resources in the app. But processing costs are paid <em>every single time</em> the app starts – which means a phone user may see a 10-second splash screen multiple times a day.</p>
<p>On our test Nexus 5, executing <code>vendor</code> and <code>app</code> bundles takes 4.9 seconds. This whole time, the page – and the app – stay non-interactive and empty:</p>

    </figure>
<p>What’s happening there? WebPageTest doesn’t record JS traces, but if we go to DevTools and run a local audit, we’ll see this:</p>

<p>First, the <code>vendor</code> bundle is being compiled (for 0.4s). Second, the <code>app</code> bundle is being compiled (for 1.2s). Third, both bundles start executing – and spend 3.3s doing so.</p>
<p>So how can we reduce that time?</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the bundle execution phase. What are all these functions?</p>

<p>Turns out that’s bundle initialization:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Functions with four-character names</em>, like <code>bkwR</code> or <code>Cycz</code>, are application modules.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->

<p>  |
| When webpack builds a bundle, it wraps each module with a function – and assigns it an ID. That ID becomes the function name. In the bundle, this looks as follows:
|
| <em>Before:</em>
|
| <code>js
  | import formatDate from './formatDate.js';
  | 
  | // ...
  |</code>
|
| <em>After:</em>
|
| <code>js
  | fOpr: function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {
  |   "use strict";
  |
  |   __webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);
  |
  |   var _formatDate__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ =
  |     __webpack_require__("xN6P");
  |
  |   // ...
  | },
  |</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>And the <code>s</code> function</em> is actually <code>__webpack_require__</code>.</p>
<p><code>__webpack_require__</code> is the webpack’s internal function that it uses for requiring modules. Whenever you write an <code>import</code>, webpack transforms it to <code>__webpack_require__()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bundle initialization takes so much time because it executes all the modules. Each module may take just a few milliseconds to execute, but with Notion’s 1100+ modules, this adds up.</p>
<p>The only way to fix it is to execute fewer modules upfront.</p>
<h2 id="use-code-splitting"><a href="#use-code-splitting" aria-label="use code splitting permalink"></a>Use code splitting</h2>
<p>The best way to improve the startup time is to code-split away some features that’re not needed immediately. In webpack, this is done <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">using <code>import()</code></a>:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Button</span></span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>openModal<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>


<span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Button</span></span>
  <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./Modal'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>=&gt;</span> m<span>.</span><span>openModal</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span>
<span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><mark>Code splitting is the best first optimization you can do.</mark> It brings huge performance benefits: after doing code splitting, Tinder reported <a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani/a-tinder-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-78919d98ece0">a 60% decrease in the complete load time</a>; and our client, Framer, managed to <a href="https://3perf.com/#clients">cut 40-45% off the CPU Idle time</a>.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://medium.com/js-dojo/3-code-splitting-patterns-for-vuejs-and-webpack-b8fff1ea0ba4">several common approaches to code splitting</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>splitting the bundle by pages,</li>
<li>splitting away below-the-fold code,</li>
<li>and splitting away conditional content (any dynamic UIs that are not visible immediately)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Notion app doesn’t have pages, and code-splitting below-the-fold content is hard because pages are very dynamic. This means the only useful approach is code-splitting conditional content. The following parts may be good candidates for that:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settings</em>, <em>Import</em>, <em>Trash</em> – all UIs that are rarely used</li>
<li><em>Sidebar</em>, <em>Share</em>, <em>Page options</em> – all UIs that are frequently used but are not needed immediately when the app starts. Those could be preloaded and initialized right after the app starts</li>
<li><em>Heavy page blocks.</em> Some page blocks are quite heavy – e.g. the <em>Code</em> block supports highlighting 68 languages, which bundles 120+ minified KBs of language definitions from Prism.js. Notion seems to be code-splitting some blocks already (e.g., <em>Math equation</em>), but it might make sense to extend it to others as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="check-that-module-concatenation-is-working"><a href="#check-that-module-concatenation-is-working" aria-label="check that module concatenation is working permalink"></a>Check that module concatenation is working</h2>
<p>In webpack, the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/">module concatenation</a> feature is responsible for merging multiple small ES modules into one large. This reduces the module processing overhead and makes removing unused code more effective.</p>
<p>To confirm that module concatenation is working:</p>
<ul>
<li>check that you’re not transpiling ES modules to CommonJS with Babel. <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env"><code>@babel/preset-env</code></a> doesn’t transpile ES modules into CommonJS</li>
<li>check that <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/#optimizationconcatenatemodules"><code>optimization.concatenateModules</code></a> is not disabled explicitly</li>
<li>run the production webpack build with <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/#debugging-optimization-bailouts"><code>--display-optimization-bailout</code></a> to see if there are any cases where module concatenation bails out</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><div><p><strong>Fun fact.</strong> Remember that all imports are transformed into the <code>__webpack_require__</code> function?</p><p>Well, what happens when the same function is called 1100 times throughout initialization? Right, it becomes a hot path taking 26.8% of the total time:</p><figure>

  </figure><p>(<code>s</code> is the minified name of <code>__webpack_require__</code>.)</p><p>Unfortunately, apart from concatenating more modules, <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2219">there’s not much to optimize there</a>.</p></div></blockquote>
<h2 id="try-the-lazy-option-of-babels-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs"><a href="#try-the-lazy-option-of-babels-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs" aria-label="try the lazy option of babels plugin transform modules commonjs permalink"></a>Try the <code>lazy</code> option of Babel’s <code>plugin-transform-modules-commonjs</code></h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> this suggestion relies on disabling module concatenation. Because of that, it’s incompatible with the previous one.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy"><code>@babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs</code></a> is an official Babel plugin that transforms ES imports into CommonJS <code>require()</code>s:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
<span>import</span> formatDate <span>from</span> <span>'./formatDate.js'</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>getToday</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>formatDate</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>const</span> formatDate <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'./formatDate.js'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
exports<span>.</span><span>getToday</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>getToday</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>formatDate</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And with its <code>lazy</code> option enabled, it also inlines all <code>require</code>s right into where they’re used:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
exports<span>.</span><span>getToday</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>getToday</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'./formatDate.js'</span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Thanks to this transformation, if the <code>getToday()</code> function is never called, <code>./formatDate.js</code> is never imported! And we don’t pay the import cost.</p>
<p>There are a few drawbacks, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching the existing codebase to <code>lazy</code> might be tricky. Some modules may rely on side effects from other modules, which we’re delaying here. Also, <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy">the plugin docs</a> warn that the <code>lazy</code> option breaks cyclic dependencies</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>Switching to CommonJS modules disables <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/">module concatenation</a>. This means the module processing overhead will be higher</li>
</ul>
<p>These drawbacks make this option riskier compared to others – but if it plays right, its benefits might far outweigh its costs.</p>
<blockquote><div><p><strong id="note-coverage">How many modules could be deferred like this?</strong> Chrome DevTools let us find an easy answer.

The page will reload, and you’ll see how much code was executed in the initial render.</p><p>In Notion, 39% of the vendor bundle and 61% of the app bundle are unused after the page renders:</p><figure>

<p>Self-control isn't merely a matter of eliminating your own weaknesses. Self control is primarily about compensating for those weaknesses. When you go on a diet, you don't just commit yourself to eating well – you also throw away the Oreos so you won't be tempted.</p>
<p>This manoeuvre has a name: a Ulysses Pact, named for the passage in the Odyssey in which Ulysses pilots his ship through the sirens' sea, eschewing wax-stoppered ears so that he could hear their song, protecting himself by lashing himself to the mast.</p>
<p>Ulysses knew he would face a moment of weakness in the future, so he used his strength in the moment to guard against his future self.</p>
<p>Tech was built on a Ulysses Pact: the irrevocable free software license: once a hacker applies the GPL, they can't unchoose it.</p>
<p>No pressure from investors, not even the risk of bankruptcy or physical coercion can remove a free software license once it has been applied.</p>
<p>A Ulysses Pact is an act of humility, an admission of frailty. Alas, humility is in short supply in tech (the GPL is an exception).</p>
<p>Far more common is to build systems that can be abused, and assume that you – and your successors, collaborators, and underlings – will never yield to temptation.</p>
<p>Think of when the W3C incorporated DRM into browser standards, sure that none of its members would use this to exclude future rivals, only to be proven wrong a mere three years later, when Google blocked all free/open entrants into the field.</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/08/three-years-after-the-w3c-approved-a-drm-standard-its-no-longer-possible-to-make-a-functional-indie-browser/">https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/08/three-years-after-the-w3c-approved-a-drm-standard-its-no-longer-possible-to-make-a-functional-indie-browser/</a></p>
<p>Or when Apple arrogated to itself the power to decide which software you can run on your phones and tablets, only to have the Chinese state order it to block working privacy tools to facilitate a system of violent, totalitarian control.</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/01/cory-doctorow-neofeudalism-and-the-digital-manor/">https://locusmag.com/2021/01/cory-doctorow-neofeudalism-and-the-digital-manor/</a></p>
<p>As Pavel Chekov counselled us all those years ago on the Desliu lot, a phaser on the bulkhead in act one will go off by act three.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, we bought – and then returned – a Canary security camera. We'd just immigrated to the US and were feeling a little nervous.</p>
<p>I was suspicious of this gadget. Though I wasn't technically capable of auditing its software, I WAS able to read its privacy policy, in which they promised not to share footage from your home unless ordered to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/canary-debuts-flex-cam-suited-for-your-living-room-and-your-lawn/?comments=1&amp;amp;post=31916515">https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/canary-debuts-flex-cam-suited-for-your-living-room-and-your-lawn/?comments=1&amp;amp;post=31916515</a></p>
<p>I suspected that meant that Canary didn't employ end-to-end encryption, meaning that company insiders could peek at that footage, and the only thing preventing such peeking was policy and integrity, not that such a thing was impossible.</p>
<p>I wrote to the company and they confirmed that this was so, explaining that having access to cleartext video streams helped them use ML models that could distinguish between intruders and pets, and promising that they carefully vetted people with access to the footage.</p>
<p>So far as I know, Canary hasn't had such a breach…yet. But ADT – an industry leader whose major investor is Google – did. An ADT technician named Telesforo Aviles admitted to spying on at least 200 ADT customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-home-security-worker-hacked-into-surveillance-systems-1846111569">https://gizmodo.com/a-home-security-worker-hacked-into-surveillance-systems-1846111569</a></p>
<p>Aviles wanted to spy on attractive women in order to see them in naked and having sex. ADT's system was designed to allow this; the primary means by which it was prevented was vetting staff – a process that is obviously too imperfect to trust in a high-stakes environment.</p>
<p>When ADT discovered this was happening, they tried to cover it up, offering laughable cash payments to survivors of Aviles's spying in exchange for confidentiality.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/19/adt-worker-accused-of-using-app-to-spy-on-people-for-7-years/">https://nypost.com/2020/05/19/adt-worker-accused-of-using-app-to-spy-on-people-for-7-years/</a></p>
<p>Doubtless certain technical aspects of the administration of ADT's security system were made simpler by choosing to create a system that was vulnerable to insider attacks. But by making this tradeoff, ADT demonstrated its unfitness to be in this market.</p>
<p>Maturity, after all, isn't about resisting temptation – it's about recognizing your own fallibility and taking measures to limit it. Exposing millions of customers to insider attacks on the obviously false belief that you will never hire the wrong person is unforgivable.</p>

<p>The pandemic has afforded all of us a refresher course on the five stages of grief, a theoretical and controversial framework for describing how people cope with tragedy: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief</a></p>
<p>A far slower-moving unfolding of these stages can be seen in the reactions of the super-wealthy to the breakdown in neoliberal orthodoxy, the tale that says that inequality results from meritocracy, and makes us all better off:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/13/data-protection-without-monopoly/#inequality">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/13/data-protection-without-monopoly/#inequality</a></p>
<p>Denial came out in the "rationalist" view: the world is better off than ever – richer, less violent, healthier, and any discontent you feel with your plummeting fortunes and the contracting possibilities for your kids is just your tunnel vision. Lack of perspective.</p>
<p>But the Great Financial Crisis and Occupy triggered the anger of the elites: violent suppression of protests, the "Doom Boom" in new luxury bunkers, Howard Schultz's insistence that "billionaire" is a slur (he says we should call him a "person of wealth").</p>
<p>The pandemic – and the "K-shaped recovery"- has revealed the existential threat inequality poses for our species, between price-gouging, fraud, profiteering, flouting health directives, and coercing the poor and vulnerable into risking their lives to keep the economy afloat.</p>
<p>A palpable desperation has set in among the ultra-wealthy, and with it, bargaining. VR execs and their major investors have begun to quietly assert that it will stabilize our unequal society by anaesthetizing the have-nots with virtual wealth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/billionaires-use-vr-avoid-social-change/">https://www.wired.com/story/billionaires-use-vr-avoid-social-change/</a></p>
<p>John Carmack: "Not everyone can have a mansion. Not everyone can have a home theater. These are things we can simulate, to some degree, in virtual reality."</p>
<p>Gabe Newell: "The real world will seem flat, colorless, blurry compared to the experiences you'll be able to create in people's brains"</p>
<p>None of this will work. VR as opiate for the masses is a great Ernie Cline plot, but it's lousy social policy. After all, providing the desperate victims of the Great Financial Crisis unlimited access to Oxycontin and Fentanyl did not stabilize our society.</p>
<p>As Matthew Gault writes in Wired: "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a Facebook-branded set of VR goggles strapped to an emaciated human face—forever."</p>

<p>This week on my podcast, a spoken-word version of "Privacy Without Monopoly: Data Protection and Interoperability," a major new white-paper that Bennett Cyphers and I co-authored for EFF.</p>
<p><a href="https://craphound.com/news/2021/02/15/privacy-without-monopoly-data-protection-and-interoperability-part-1/">https://craphound.com/news/2021/02/15/privacy-without-monopoly-data-protection-and-interoperability-part-1/</a></p>
<p>It’s a paper that tries to resolve the tension between demanding that tech platforms gather, retain and mine less of our data, and the demand that platforms allow alternatives (nonprofits, co-ops, tinkerers, startups) to connect with their services.</p>
<p>I read the first half of it this week – about 40 minutes' worth – and I'll finish it next week. If you don't want to wait, you can dive in with the written version straightaway:</p>

I’m not diabetic or even prediabetic. But when I stumbled on the chance to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as part of a challenge partnered with Levels, I jumped on it. I’ve been conscious of blood sugar my whole life because I suffered from spells of hypoglycemia as a child.</span></p><p><span>Hypoglycemia is when your blood sugar drops below 70mg/dL. I still don’t know why it happened, but it wasn’t fun. When my glucose levels dropped too low, I’d experience cold sweats, lightheadedness, trembling hands, and an elevated heart rate. These symptoms were likely the result of my body releasing epinephrine (adrenaline) to stabilize my blood glucose.</span></p><p><span>Over the years, I started to pick up on which foods caused my blood sugar to crash. The biggest culprits were cereal for breakfast and sweet tea later in the day. Every time I ate a big bowl of cereal before school (usually Frosted Mini-Wheats or Honey Nut Cheerios), I would crash around 10:30 a.m. like clockwork. Sometimes the crashes were so bad that I thought I might pass out, so I’d call my mom to check me out of school.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w" data-sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w"></p><p><span>Experiencing low blood sugar not only made it hard to focus but was, quite frankly, a scary experience for someone who didn’t understand what was going on. After missing a few classes from these episodes, my mom decided it was time to change my diet.</span></p><p><span>I went from eating cereal in the mornings to eggs, bacon, and fruit (berries or avocado) and cut out the sweet tea (tough to do for a boy raised in Alabama). Once I made those changes, the crashes stopped, and I had energy throughout the day.</span></p><p><span>At the time, I didn’t fully understand why the switch worked, but I did understand even at a young age that consuming a bunch of carbs and sugar wasn’t good for me. Since then, I’ve become fascinated with maintaining a healthy lifestyle and finding ways to improve my health. My curiosity for seeking ways to optimize my diet is what eventually led me to put a CGM on my arm.</span></p><h2>The Challenge</h2><p><span>I first learned about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span> from following </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares"><span>Justin Mares</span></a><span> on Twitter. I’ve followed Justin for quite a while since he knew a lot about the health-and-wellness space after founding two health food companies, </span><a href="https://www.kettleandfire.com/"><span>Kettle &amp; Fire</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://perfectketo.com/"><span>Perfect Keto</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In October, Justin shared an </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares/status/1315696415213936641"><span>interesting tweet</span></a><span> about a weight-loss challenge that only required participants to track their blood glucose with a </span><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/"><span>Levels</span></a><span> CGM. After reading the tweet, I knew this was something I had to try. Even though the challenge focused on weight loss, I enrolled immediately because I wanted to experiment with a CGM to see how my body reacts to my diet.</span></p><p><span>The challenge required me to keep my glucose levels below 120mg/dL even after a meal. For every day I went over, I’d lose $25 (talk about having skin in the game). The challenge started with a three-day grace period, so I could experiment with my diet to see how it impacted my glucose without getting penalized.</span></p><p><span>(For context, according to the</span><a href="https://www.idf.org/component/attachments/attachments.html?id=728&amp;task=download"> <span>International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines</span></a><span>, your glucose values are “normal” if they stay below 140mg/dL after meals and return to pre-meal levels within two to three hours. Since this is a challenge geared towards weight loss, the upper limit was set slightly lower.)</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/what-should-my-glucose-levels-be-ultimate-guide"><b>What should your glucose levels be? Here’s the ultimate guide to healthy blood sugar ranges</b></a></p><p><span>To help stay in the target range, each member of the challenge had access to a WhatsApp group chat to support each other. The group chat was a place for members to share what diet was working well, vent their frustrations when they failed, and provide a positive environment for motivation and encouragement. This aspect was less useful for me (I ended up muting it after a few days) because my goals were different. Still, I could see how much other members appreciated the accountability and support.</span></p><h2>What I Learned</h2><p><span>Overall, I found the challenge to be a learning experience filled with joyful moments of self-confirmation, times of utter disappointment, and a few surprises in between.</span></p><h3>The Good</h3><p><span>The best news was discovering that my typical breakfast of three eggs, bacon, and half an avocado drizzled in olive oil caused almost no glycemic response, nor did my afternoon snack of raw almonds. The app showed that these foods consistently hit a perfect score. Since I eat these foods most often, it was comforting knowing that I had a strong foundation.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" alt="" width="400" height="600" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w" data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w"></p><p><span>The challenge also confirmed my belief that eating a low-carb paleo/keto-inspired diet consisting of mostly meat, vegetables, and healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, and butter/ghee) was optimal for maintaining consistent glucose levels.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>Over the past four years, I’ve made a conscious effort to cook meals that avoid simple carbs, vegetable oils, and sweeteners, and it felt really good knowing I’d been making the right choices.</span></p><h3>The Not-So-Good</h3><p><span>The foods with the most considerable impact on my blood sugar were white rice and craft beer, although I can’t say I was surprised. Unfortunately, I love both of these things (so long Chipotle burrito bowls). It was disappointing to finally have to stare down the truth instead of continuing to live in willful ignorance.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>I was also disappointed to learn how much sweet potato spikes my blood sugar. I knew sweet potatoes had a lower </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods"><span>glycemic index (GI)</span></a><span> than regular potatoes, but they still pushed me over the limit. I plan to keep them in my diet but will be more conscious about how often I eat them.</span></p><h3>The Surprising</h3><p><span>The biggest surprise of the challenge was discovering that quality tequila (G4 Reposado) had almost no effect on my blood sugar. Tequila that is 100% agave has zero carbs because of the distillation process (an average craft IPA has around 13g of carbs). Since beer is my usual go-to if I want a drink, I was happy to learn there was a healthier substitute I already enjoyed.</span></p><p><span>I also recognize I need to be careful here. Just because I didn’t experience a glucose spike doesn’t mean I didn’t have a biological response. </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/6/1545/4632987"><span>Research suggests</span></a><span> that alcohol decreases the liver’s ability to make new glucose, so it can trigger hypoglycemia, especially if you’re fasting or in a ketogenic state.</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/alcohol-and-metabolic-fitness"><b>What does alcohol do to my glucose levels?</b></a></p><p><span>Another big surprise was discovering that my glucose levels aren’t just impacted by <em>what</em> I eat but also <em>when</em> I eat. I confirmed this because I meal prep twice a week to save time by eating the same meal multiple days in a row. (You may find that boring; I find it efficient.)</span></p><p><span>Eating the same thing for lunch and dinner on several challenge days was great for understanding how my body responds to food at different times of the day. All else being equal, my glucose spikes more after dinner than it does for lunch—sometimes by as much as 20mg/dL!</span></p><p><span>Even more surprising was noticing how little change there was from eating the same meal from day to day, but then having a large variance between lunch and dinner. I’m sure there’s a reason why, but I couldn’t tease a convincing explanation out of the data.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><h2>What’s Changed</h2><p><span>Since the challenge ended, I’ve made a few adjustments to my diet. I’m not one to make radical changes (like cutting out a particular food from my diet forever), but now I’m more careful when I still want to splurge. Here are some of the changes I’ve made:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>If I’m going to drink, I opt for quality spirits (neat or on the rocks) over craft beer or cocktails loaded with sugar.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’ve reconsidered the idea of a cheat day. I still plan on enjoying the occasional night of pizza and beer or tacos and margaritas, but a cheat day isn’t just a day. Now that I’m aware that the effects of an unhealthy meal can last for 2-3 days, I better make sure that the meal is worth it.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I need to avoid any sweetened beverage, no matter how “healthy.”&nbsp; Smoothies, sweetened kombucha, and sweetened coffee wrecked my glucose levels, even though they’re often touted as healthy choices. Better to eat my sweets after a hearty meal than to drink them.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’m now more conscious of what I order when I eat out. For example, I opt for the salad at Chipotle instead of the burrito bowl. I’ve also switched to eating more sashimi instead of sushi to avoid eating as much rice.</span></li></ul><p><span>Even though the challenge only lasted 28 days, I learned more about my diet and lifestyle in those four weeks than I had from any previous blood test or book on dieting. The challenge confirmed that I already eat a healthy diet, but I need to make a few changes to ensure a healthy life for decades to come.</span></p><p><em><span>To learn more about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/">, click here</a>.</span></em></p><p><em>Adapted from an original post <a href="https://lawsonblake.com/continuous-glucose-monitoring-levels-health/">here</a>.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div></div></section><section id="blog-single-content-related" data-ani-anchor=""></section></main>

        <p>Thread-local storage (TLS) provides a mechanism allocating distinct objects for different threads. It is the usual implementation for GCC extension <code>__thread</code>, C11 <code>_Thread_local</code>, and C++11 <code>thread_local</code>, which allow the use of the declared name to refer to the entity associated with the current thread. This article will describe thread-local storage on ELF platforms in detail, and touch on other related topics, such as: thread-specific data keys and Windows/macOS TLS.</p>
<p>An example usage of thread-local storage is POSIX <code>errno</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each thread has its own thread ID, scheduling priority and policy, errno value, floating point environment, thread-specific key/value bindings, and the required system resources to support a flow of control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different threads have different <code>errno</code> copies. <code>errno</code> is typically defined as a function which returns a thread-local variable.</p>
<p>For each architecture, the authoritative ELF ABI document is the processor supplement (psABI) to the System V ABI (generic ABI). These documents usually reference <em>The ELF Handling for Thread-Local Storage</em> by Ulrich Drepper. The document, however, mixes general specifications and glibc internals.</p>
<h2 id="representation">Representation</h2>
<h3 id="assembler-behavior">Assembler behavior</h3>
<p>The compiler usually defines thread-local variables in <code>.tdata</code> and <code>.tbss</code> sections (which have the section flag <code>SHF_TLS</code>). The symbols representing thread-local variables have type <code>STT_TLS</code> (representing thread-local storage entities). In GNU as syntax, you can give <code>a</code> the type <code>STT_TLS</code> with <code>.type a, @tls_object</code>. The <code>st_value</code> value of a TLS symbols is the offset relative to the defining section.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>.section .tbss,"awT",@nobits</span><br><span>.globl a, b</span><br><span>.type a, @tls_object</span><br><span>.type b, @tls_object</span><br><span>a:</span><br><span>  .zero 4</span><br><span>  .size a, .-a</span><br><span>b:</span><br><span>  .zero 4</span><br><span>  .size b, .-b</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>In this example, <code>st_value(a)=0</code> while <code>st_value(b)=4</code>.</p>
<p>In Clang and GCC produced assembly, thread-local variables are annotated as <code>.type a, @object</code> (<code>STT_OBJECT</code>). When the assembler sees that such symbols are defined in <code>SHF_TLS</code> sections or referenced by TLS relocations, <code>STT_NOTYPE</code>/<code>STT_OBJECT</code> will be upgraded to <code>STT_TLS</code>.</p>
<p>GNU as supports an directive <code>.tls_common</code> which defines <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols. This is an obsecure feature. It is not clear whether GCC still has a code path which emits <code>.tls_common</code> directives. LLVM integrated assembler does not support <code>.tls_common</code>.</p>
<h3 id="linker-behavior">Linker behavior</h3>
<p>The linker combines <code>.tdata</code> input sections into a <code>.tdata</code> output section. <code>.tbss</code> input sections are combined into a <code>.tbss</code> output section. The two <code>SHF_TLS</code> output sections are placed into a <code>PT_TLS</code> program header.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>p_offset</code>: the file offset of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_vaddr</code>: the virtual address of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_filesz</code>: the size of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_memsz</code>: the total size of the thread-local storage. The last <code>p_memsz-p_filesz</code> bytes will be zeroed by the dynamic loader.</li>
<li><code>p_align</code>: alignment</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>PT_TLS</code> program header is contained in a <code>PT_LOAD</code> program header. Conceptually <code>PT_TLS</code> and <code>STT_TLS</code> symbols are like in a separate address space. The dynamic loader should copy the <code>[p_vaddr,p_vaddr+p_filesz)</code> of the TLS initialization image to the corresponding static TLS block.</p>
<p>In executable and shared object files, <code>st_value</code> normally holds a virtual address. For a <code>STT_TLS</code> symbol, <code>st_value</code> holds an offset relative to the virtual address of the <code>PT_TLS</code> program header. The first byte of <code>PT_TLS</code> is referenced by the TLS symbol with <code>st_value==0</code>.</p>
<p>GNU ld treats <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols as defined in <code>.tcommon</code> sections. Its internal linker script places such sections into the output section <code>.tdata</code>. LLD does not support <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-loader-behavior">Dynamic loader behavior</h3>
<p>The dynamic loader collects <code>PT_TLS</code> program headers from the main executable and immediately loaded shared objects (via transitive <code>DT_NEEDED</code>), and allocates static TLS blocks, one block for each <code>PT_TLS</code>. For each <code>PT_TLS</code>, the dynamic loader copies <code>p_filesz</code> bytes from the TLS initialization image to the TLS block and sets the trailing <code>p_memsz-p_filesz</code> bytes to zeroes.</p>
<p>For the static TLS block of the main executable, the module ID is one and the TP offset of a TLS symbol is a link-time constant. The linker and the dynamic loader share the same formula.</p>
<p>For a shared object loaded at program start, the offset from the thread pointer to its static TLS block is a fixed value at program start, albeit not a link-time constant. The offset can be referenced by a GOT dynamic relocation used by the initial-exec TLS model.</p>
<p><em>The ELF Handling for Thread-Local Storage</em> describes two TLS variants and specifies their data structures. However, only the TP offset of the static TLS block of the main executable is a hard requirement. Nevertheless, libc implementations usually place static TLS blocks together, and allocate a space for both the thread control block and the static TLS blocks.</p>
<p>For a new thread created by <code>pthread_create</code>, the static TLS blocks are usually allocated as part of the thread stack. Without a guard page between the largest address of the stack and the thread control block, this could be considered as vulnerable as stack overflow can overwrite the thread control block.</p>
<h2 id="models">Models</h2>
<h3 id="local-exec-tls-model-executable-non-preemptible">Local exec TLS model (executable &amp; non-preemptible)</h3>
<p>This is the most efficient TLS model. It applies when the TLS symbol is defined in the executable.</p>
<p>The compiler picks this model in <code>-fno-pic/-fpie</code> modes if the variable is</p>
<ul>
<li>a definition</li>
<li>or a declaration with a non-default visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first condition is obvious. The second condition is becuase a non-default visibility means the variable must be defined by another translation unit in the executable.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>_Thread_local <span>int</span> def;</span><br><span>__attribute__((visibility(<span>"hidden"</span>))) <span>extern</span> <span>thread_local</span> <span>int</span> ref;</span><br><span><span><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> </span>{ <span>return</span> def + ref; }</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>For the static TLS block of the main executable, the TP offset of a TLS symbol is a link-time constant. Here is a list of common relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_LE32</code></li>
<li>aarch64:
<ul>
<li>-mtls-size=12: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_ADD_TPREL_LO12</code></li>
<li>-mtls-size=24 (default): <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_ADD_TPREL_HI12</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_ADD_TPREL_LO12_NC</code></li>
<li>-mtls-size=32: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G1</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G0_NC</code></li>
<li>-mtls-size=48: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G2</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G1_NC</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G0_NC</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>i386: <code>R_386_TLS_LE</code></li>
<li>x86-64: <code>R_X86_64_TPOFF32</code></li>
<li>mips: <code>R_MIPS_TPREL_HI16</code>, <code>R_MIPS_TPREL_LO16</code></li>
<li>ppc32: <code>R_PPC_TPREL_HA</code>, <code>R_PPC_TPREL_LO</code></li>
<li>ppc64: <code>R_PPC64_TPREL_HA</code>, <code>R_PPC64_TPREL_LO</code></li>
<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_HI20</code>, <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_I</code>, <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_S</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For RISC architectures, because an instruction typically has 4 bytes and cannot encode a 32-bit offset, it usually takes two instructions to materialize a TP offset.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D93331">https://reviews.llvm.org/D93331</a>, I patched LLD to reject local-exec TLS relocations in <code>-shared</code> mode. In GNU ld, at least arm, riscv and x86's ports have the similar diagnostics, but aarch64 and ppc64 do not error.</p>
<h3 id="initial-exec-tls-model-executable-preemptible">Initial exec TLS model (executable &amp; preemptible)</h3>
<p>This model is less efficient than local exec. It applies when the TLS symbol is defined in the executable or a shared object available at program start. The shared object can be due to <code>DT_NEEDED</code> or <code>LD_PRELOAD</code>.</p>
<p>The compiler picks this model in <code>-fno-pic/-fpie</code> modes if the variable is a declaration with default visibility. The idea is that a symbol referenced by the executable must be defined by an immediately loaded shared object, instead of a dlopen loaded shared object. The linker enforces this as well by defaulting to <code>-z defs</code> for a <code>-no-pie/-pie</code> link.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>extern</span> <span>thread_local</span> <span>int</span> ref;</span><br><span><span><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> </span>{ <span>return</span> ref; }</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Because the offset from the thread pointer to the start of a static block is fixed at program start, such an offset can be encoded by a GOT relocation. Such relocation types typically have <code>GOT</code> and <code>TPREL/TPOFF</code> in their names. Here is a list of common relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_IE32</code></li>
<li>aarch64: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSIE_ADR_GOTTPREL_PAGE21</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSIE_LD64_GOTTPREL_LO12_NC</code></li>
<li>i386: <code>R_386_TLS_IE</code></li>
<li>x86-64: <code>R_X86_64_GOTTPOFF</code></li>
<li>ppc32: <code>R_PPC_GOT_TPREL16</code></li>
<li>ppc64: <code>R_PPC64_GOT_TPREL16_HA</code>, <code>R_PPC64_GOT_TPREL16_LO_DS</code></li>
<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TLS_GOT_HI20</code>, <code>R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If the TLS symbol does not satisfy initial-exec to local-exec relaxation requirements, the linker will allocate a GOT entry and emit a dynamic relocation. Here is a list of dynamic relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_TPOFF32</code></li>
<li>aarch64: <code>R_AARCH64_TLS_TPREL64</code></li>
<li>mips32: <code>R_MIPS_TLS_TPREL32</code></li>

<p>While they have <code>TPREL</code> or <code>TPOFF</code> in their names, these dynamic relocations have the same bitwidth as the word size. This is a good way to distinguish them from the local-exec relocation types used in object files.</p>
<p>If you add the <code>__attribute((tls_model("initial-exec")))</code> attribute, a thread-local variable can use this model in <code>-fpic</code> mode. If the object file is linked into an executable, everything is fine. If the object file is linked into a shared object, the shared object generally needs to be an immediately loaded shared object. The linker sets the <code>DF_STATIC_TLS</code> flag to annotate a shared object with initial-exec TLS relocations.</p>
<p>glibc ld.so reserves some space in static TLS blocks and allows dlopen on such a shared object if its TLS size is small. There could be an obscure reason for using such an attribute: general dynamic and local dynamic TLS models are not async-signal-safe in glibc. However, other libc implementations may not reserve additional TLS space for dlopen'ed initial-exec shared objects, e.g. musl will error.</p>
<h3 id="general-dynamic-and-local-dynamic-tls-models-dso">General dynamic and local dynamic TLS models (DSO)</h3>
<p>The two modes are used when the TLS symbol may be defined by a shared object. They do not assume the TLS symbol is backed by a static TLS block. Instead, they assume that the thread-local storage of the module may be dynamically allocated, making the models suitable for dlopen usage. The dynamically allocated TLS storage is usually referred to as dynamic TLS.</p>
<p>Each TLS symbol is …</p></div></div>

The bounty ended yesterday. How did it go? This blog entry will answer that question.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> is a SQL database with Git-style versioning.

<p>Now that the bounty is complete, we must figure out what to do with this data. How do we get the most out of our investment in the data?</p>
<h2>Clean up the data we got</h2>
<p>Given the heavily keyed nature of this data, we decided early on to not accept PRs for standardization or normalization of things like party names. Because most columns are part of the primary key, any change looks like a deletion and corresponding addition to Dolt. Thus, changes like that give the corrector credit for the whole row in the bounty instead of just the cell he or she changed. We queued up a number of these types of changes and we'll execute them now that the bounty is over.</p>
<h2>Find some users</h2>
<p>We collected the best US presidential Precinct level results on the internet. Now, we want people to use it. We think potentially the data is good enough that an open data community could be bootstrapped around it. The people who use it would have incentive to finish it as new state level data is released. We will reach out to the people at <a href="http://openelections.net/">Open Elections</a> and <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Elections Lab</a> and start a conversation. If you know anyone else who could use this data, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">come let us know in our Discord</a>.</p>
<h2>Run another bounty?</h2>
<p>We're still missing 12 states and about 22% of the vote from 2020. If we want to get complete data and an open data community can't be bootstrapped, we may run another bounty in a couple months to finish the dataset. Let us know if you'd be interested in another bounty or the complete dataset.</p>

<p>We think <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/bounties">DoltHub Bounties</a> may be the fastest, cheapest way to build databases from open data. For $25,000 and 8 weeks, we were able to assemble a 1.7GB database of election results. </p>
<p>Our plan is to run at least one bounty per month for the rest of the year across a number of distinct data disciplines. We're running a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-01-14-hopsital-prices-bounty/">hospital price transparency bounty</a> right now. We'll be launching two more over the next month or so. Hang out in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">our Discord</a> to keep up to date. Start wrangling data as your new side hustle.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a> has become a popular (20K stars on GH) way of beautifying CLIs, and I'm pleased to see a number of projects using it.</p>
<p>Since Rich is mature and battle-tested now, I had considered winding-down development. Until, I saw this tweet:</p>
<h2>The Tweet</h2>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Do you want to see something really cool you can do with <a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@willmcgugan</a> 's rich library? </p><p>Checkout ghtop <a href="https://t.co/mn7oLbpw8e">https://t.co/mn7oLbpw8e</a>. It's a really fun CLI tool that demonstrates the power of rich (and other things).</p><p>Examples below 🧵👇 (1/8)</p></div>— Hamel Husain (@HamelHusain) <a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1357771218095546368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain">@HamelHusain</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward">@jeremyphoward</a> used Rich to enhance <a href="https://github.com/nat/ghtop">ghtop</a> (a repo owned by the CEO of Github, no less). Ghtop shows a realtime a stream of events from the Github platform. And it looks good! So good that I realised how much potential Rich has for these type of htop-like applications.</p>
<p>Hamel and Jeremy had to overcome a few technical hurdles to make that work. Fortunately this will no longer be required as the latest version of Rich has first-class support for full-screen interfaces via a new Layout system.</p>
<h2>Full-screen terminal interface</h2>
<p>Here's a video demonstration of a terminal interface built with Layout:</p>
<p>
<iframe width="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slrdSojCvlk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<h2>Layout API</h2>
<p>The API to create a flexible layout is surprisingly simple. You construct a <code>Layout()</code> object, then call <code>split()</code> to create sub-layouts. These sub-layouts may then be further divided. Layouts have a small number of settings which define their size relative to the terminal window. It's a simple system that can create terminal interfaces that almost resemble modern web apps.</p>

<h2>Finally, some code</h2>
<p>Here's how you would create a basic layout with a header, a footer, and two side-panels.</p>
<pre><code>from rich.console import Console
from rich.layout import Layout

console = Console()
layout = Layout()

# Divide the "screen" in to three parts
layout.split(
    Layout(name="header", size=3),
    Layout(ratio=1, name="main"),
    Layout(size=10, name="footer"),
)
# Divide the "main" layout in to "side" and "body"
layout["main"].split(
    Layout(name="side"),
    Layout(name="body", ratio=2),
    direction="horizontal"
)
# Divide the "side" layout in to two
layout["side"].split(Layout(), Layout())

console.print(layout)
</code></pre>
<p>Running the code above produces the following output:</p>

<p>Terminal split in to 5 sub-layouts. The boxes are placeholders, you can insert any content in their place.</p>


</figcaption>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Any renderable (text, table, progress bars etc) may be placed inside those sub-layouts.</p>
<p>We can now use the <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live.html">Live</a> class to create an application that adapts itself to the terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>from rich.live import Live
from time import sleep

with Live(layout, screen=True):
    while True:
        sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>In a real app, that do-nothing loop will be doing something useful like pulling data from the network to update contents.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layout.html">layout docs</a> for an in-depth tutorial.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I think it's clear that Rich is acquiring more TUI (text user interface) features, and I've decided not to fight it. Rich's core purpose is still to beautify CLI output, but I think there is an opportunity here for a new way to create terminal apps. Ultimately it will be less like curses and more like HTML in a browser.</p>
<p>There are a number of things to do before Rich could replace a full TUI library (keyboard and mouse input for one) but the potential is there. Stay tuned for progress.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-contest">About this contest</h3>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>I decided to try new thing at the beginning of 2019. You probably heard about competitive programming and about popular web-sites like <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">Topcoder</a>, <a href="https://www.codility.com/">Codility</a> and others. The idea is that you can try yourself in solving programming puzzles. Usually it’s not enough to just solve the puzzle, your solution must qualify for certain criterias such as algorithmic complexity and memory usage. Also on a real challenges it is improtant how fast you solved the problem.</p>

<p>Those sort of challenges usually test your problem solving skills as well as your knowledge of algorithms and data structures. It is a kind of tasks we usually see on programming job interviews. You need to write the code from scratch to a complete solution.</p>

<p>What I am starting is also a form of contest but aims at developing different set of skills. <strong>We will train to optimize already optimized code</strong>. We will learn hardware optimizations. This is briefly how it will look like: I will pick one existing benchmark of my choice and will send it to all my subscribers. You will have the time to play with the benchmark and find all performance headrooms you can find. You then send all your findings to me (modified sources/assemblies/compiler patches?/whatever speeds up the benchmark) and I check it and run on my hardware. At the end I will anounce the winners.</p>

<p>Before I explain it in more details I feel a need of writing disclaimer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is absolutely non-profit effort. I’m not looking for make any money from it or using someone’s knowledge in my own purposes. I will not use submissions to extract any intellectual property they might have. Also this is not aiming to advertise any particular software product including benchmarks/compilers. That’s why all the benchmarks and compilers I will use require to be open sourced. Neither it aims to advertise any particular HW.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this contest I try to emulate the situation in performance critical projects on the final stages. When all the functionality is delivered and tested. But before shipping the binary to the customers you were asked to tune the app to it’s peak performance. You know the hardware it will be deployed to. You have the sources in your hands and freedom to modify it (without introducing any bugs :) ). You are the build master, so you can add any compiler flags you want.</p>

<p>For the challenges that I will send I’m not looking for optimizations that fall into the category: “Oh, I just used quicksort instead of bubblesort”. Expect the benchmark to be already optimized to some degree. Your task is to tune it for particular hardware to the peak performance.</p>

<h3 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h3>

<h4 id="q0-why-the-hell-on-earth-i-should-participate-in-this-contest">Q0: <em>Why <del>the hell</del> on earth I should participate in this contest?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A0</strong>: You will learn/practice how to do optimizations for HW. This might include eliminating cache misses by inserting prefetch instructions, getting rid of <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2018/01/18/Code_alignment_issues">Code alignment issues</a>, improving performance by helping compiler to vectorize/unroll the loop better. You will learn different techniques as you go.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q1-what-benchmarks-are-taken-into-the-contest">Q1: <em>What benchmarks are taken into the contest?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A1</strong>: It will be open sourced benchmark written in C/C++. Usually several source files. It should be easy to build, require minimal dependencies. Preferably it should have some form of validation.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q2-what-is-the-machineenvironment-we-will-be-optimizing-for">Q2: <em>What is the machine/environment we will be optimizing for?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A2</strong>: Most likely it will be 64 bit Linux with Intel x86 CPU (probably Haswell architecture). For a start I will not bother with disabling CPU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_scaling">dynamic frequency scaling</a> features or setting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_affinity">thread affinity</a>. I might do this in future.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q3-what-if-i-dont-have-the-environment-you-are-using">Q3: <em>What if I don’t have the environment you are using?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A3</strong>: It doesn’t matter much. If you don’t have Intel CPU or you are on Windows/Mac, just optimize for whatever you have. I would be happy to know about optimizations that help other CPUs, operating systems, etc.
<strong>I don’t have real prizes to give, so it’s mostly practicing and learning</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q4-how-i-should-find-performance-headrooms">Q4: <em>How I should find performance headrooms?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A4</strong>: Use all of your knowledge. Start with profiling the benchmark. You can browse through posts on this blog. Additionally I will write a separate post that might help begginers.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q5-what-optimizations-are-allowed">Q5: <em>What optimizations are allowed?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A5</strong>: Good news! <strong>All the dirty tricks allowed</strong>! The goal of this contest is to learn how to squeeze as much performance as possible from the hardware using any means available. You can modify sources and insert any compiler hints like pragmas, builtins, function attributes, etc. Also you can generate assembly listing (<code>-S</code> compiler option) and modify it. Finally, you can add some compiler option that might speed up the benchmark.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q6-whats-not-allowed">Q6: <em>What’s NOT allowed</em></h4>

<p><strong>A6</strong>: 1) Do not rewrite the benchmark completely or introduce major changes in algorithms. The good judging rule is “everything interesting should be calculated in runtime”.</p>

<p>2) Do not manually parallelize the benchmark, e.g converting it from single- to multi-threaded or offload computations to the GPU. I mean, I’m glad that you can do it and I will be happy to take a look what you did, but it’s not the intent of the contest.</p>

<p>3) Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization">PGO</a> is allowed, however you can use it only for driving you optimizations, not for the submission. So, you can check how the benchmark gets better with PGO and understand why. And then make this optimization manually. Again, the purposes is practicing and learning.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q7-how-should-the-submission-look-like">Q7: <em>How should the submission look like?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A7</strong>: 1) I will not accept binaries for security reasons.</p>

<p>2) You can send patch files that I can apply to the sources of the benchmark or just assembly listing. If you did multiple optimizations please split them in separate patches. <code>git format-patch</code> is the right tool for that. This will save me a lot of time.</p>

<p>3) If you send assembly listing files please do also include diff file from the baseline (what you changed in the assembly). If you provide modified assembly listings it should be genearted only with open-sourced C/C++ compilers like gcc and clang. You can of course cheat and generate assembly with some other compiler that is better for the benchmark, but I will probably easily detect that. And it’s not about tricking, it’s about learning.</p>

<p>4) Make sure you specify clearly the compiler options if they are different from the baseline.</p>

<p>5) If you are capable of hacking compiler that’s also acceptable. You can send me patches for gcc/llvm compilers which I can apply and use for building the benchmark. Please use the top of tree revisions because it will be easier for me to apply them. We can then use it for improving our open source compilers. Also it would be very nice if you can send me textual description of all the optimizations you made.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q8-how-i-will-test-your-solutions">Q8: <em>How I will test your solutions?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A8</strong>: I will take your sources, build them on my machine and run the benchmark. I will run your binary multiple times (depends on the running time) and <a href="http://blog.kevmod.com/2016/06/benchmarking-minimum-vs-average/">take the minimum</a>. I’m thinking about testing all the solutions on some cloud machine, but that’s not settled yet.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q9-how-i-will-select-the-winner">Q9: <em>How I will select the winner?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A9</strong>: I will calculate your score as a ratio between execution time of the binary with your optimizations and the baseline.</p>

<hr>
<p>I know there is a lot more concerns you might have. This is just a first attempt with focus on learning how to do HW optimizations. In the end I don’t have real prizes to give out. :) After each contest I will share all the findings people did, so there is a big opportunity to learn from others! I know that a number of really experienced guys read this blog, so I encourage everyone to participate. Everyone is welcome!</p>

<p>All communication (including sending benchmarks and score submissions) will happen through emails, so <strong>make sure to subscribe</strong> using the form at the bottom of the page! I am planning to start first contest in the end of February 2019.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think about it or if you have any ideas or comments. You can also vote if you like it using the buttons below.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Collect the baseline (use <code>time</code> or analogs).</li>
  <li>Find the hotspot (use <code>perf record</code>).</li>
  <li>Find performance headroom
    <ul>
      <li>Take a look at the assembly and try to guess how you can do better.</li>
      <li>Run through <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/09/Top-Down-performance-analysis-methodology">TMAM</a> process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Build the benchmark, run it and compare against baseline.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Do not try to understand the whole benchmark. For some people (including me) it’s crucial to understand how every peace of code works. For the purposes of optimizing it will be wasted effort. There are CPU benchmarks with thousands LOC (like <a href="http://spec.org/cpu2017/">SPEC2017</a>) it’s absoultely impossible to understand them in a reasonable time. What you need to familiarize yourself with are hotspots. That’s it. You most likely need to understand one function/loop which is not more than 100 LOC.</li>
  <li>You have specific workload for which you optimize the benchmark. You don’t need to optimize it for any other input/workload. The main principle behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design">Data-oriented design</a> is that you know the data of your application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Information presented in llvm documentation: <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Benchmarking.html">Benchmarking tips</a> migth also be helpful.</p>

</p><p>In fear of the cold, famines, and war, we chose to huddle in caves, camps, and cities in order to dwell near pooled resources, fearing unknown calamities.&nbsp;But the internet has changed all this. Accessibility no longer requires proximity. You no longer have to physically relocate in order to acquire the tools and resources you need to live a comfortable life. We are moving towards a reality where work and location no longer need to depend on the other. With the rapidly growing infrastructures of telecommunications, green energy, delivery services, and travel flexibility – both in pace of advancement and market size – a new way of working and living is emerging.
</p><p>One in which we no longer need to rely solely on outdated frameworks of metropolitan densities to support a given lifestyle.
</p><p>Flattening density is the way forward.
</p><p>Entire economies will need to re-evaluate what it means to give flexibility just as its users are realizing the boundaries of these new flexibilities. We’re already seeing an exodus of major metropolises. Lockdown hysteria has forced us to consider whether the paths we thought we prescribed ourselves is really ours. As this changes how many will choose to live, LOT is building a mission to earth.
</p><p>ARK 1 is an off-road, mobile dwelling. It features plug and play modular parts, a rechargeable battery pack, solar roof, 4 wheel steering, independent suspension, and can be equipped with full self-driving capabilities. 
</p><p>By treating the home as the ultimate appliance, we’re building a vehicle to nourish the self. If your home could take you anywhere, and there’s no more point A to point B, where would you go? </p></div></div><div><div id="ark-1_crawl-mode"><div><div><p>Crawl Mode</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UFBsLeqcMR8?controls=0&amp;color=white" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><div><div><p>ARK 1 utilizes all of its on-board self-driving cameras/sensors to enable it to drive autonomously on off-road, off-grid terrain.
</p><p>It is also equipped with a drone that acts as eyes by flying ahead to map trickier surfaces in order to provide the best possible route (fog map). This feature is not meant for navigating conventional roads, as there are no lanes to switch or traffic lights to watch for. Only surface and elevation changes to traverse, which it does slowly, so if you wanted to go to bed in the desert and wake up at the coastline, you can.</p></div></div></div></div></div><p>Eyes:</p><div id="ark-1_asset-drone-1"><picture><source media="(max-width: 799px)"

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been doing weekly chaos engineering projects for a while now, so I decided to start a blog. A sort of dumping ground for all the things I do.
If you’re interested in more projects like this, give me a follow on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata">@_mattata</a>. I’m always working on something fun.</p><p>Kicking it off with the first blog post. I’m going to compile this blog post (yes, the very one you’re reading) into a valid Gameboy Advance ROM.</p><p>Full source code can be viewed here: <a href="https://github.com/xen0bit/gbablog">https://github.com/xen0bit/gbablog</a></p><p>You can download the ROM here: <a href="https://remyhax.xyz/gbablog/blog.gba">blog.gba</a></p><p><strong>Feel free to try it out below running in a Gameboy Advance emulator written in javascript:</strong></p><p><em>Controls:</em> Click inside the above box change focus to the emulator. Keyboard UP/DOWN to scroll</p><table><thead><tr><th>Keyboard</th><th>GBA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Z</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>UP</td><td>UP</td></tr><tr><td>DOWN</td><td>DOWN</td></tr><tr><td>LEFT</td><td>LEFT</td></tr><tr><td>RIGHT</td><td>RIGHT</td></tr><tr><td>ENTER</td><td>START</td></tr><tr><td>/</td><td>SELECT</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I got this idea while browsing around and heard about <a href="https://tinygo.org/">TinyGo</a>.</p><blockquote><p>TinyGo is a project to bring the Go programming language to microcontrollers and modern web browsers by creating a new compiler based on LLVM.</p></blockquote><p>One of the <a href="https://tinygo.org/microcontrollers/gameboy-advance/">compiler targets for TinyGo is a Gameboy Advance</a>, but the documentation shows a bunch of “?” in terms of supporting it. Naturally, I decided this seemed stable enough and decided to give it a shot.</p><p>The Gameboy Advance is a handheld videogame paltform based on the ARM7TDMI microcontroller and there was only a single example piece of code written in Tinygo for reference seen below:</p><p>(Images after this point tend to look quite fuzzy in the ROM due to color palette limitations)</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>// Draw a red square on the GameBoy Advance screen.
</span><span></span>
<span>import</span> (
	<span>"image/color"</span>
	<span>"machine"</span>
)

<span>var</span> <span>display</span> = <span>machine</span>.<span>Display</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>display</span>.<span>Configure</span>()

	<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>:=</span> int16(<span>30</span>); <span>x</span> &lt; <span>50</span>; <span>x</span><span>++</span> {
		<span>for</span> <span>y</span> <span>:=</span> int16(<span>80</span>); <span>y</span> &lt; <span>100</span>; <span>y</span><span>++</span> {
			<span>display</span>.<span>SetPixel</span>(<span>x</span>, <span>y</span>, <span>color</span>.<span>RGBA</span>{<span>255</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>255</span>})
		}
	}
	<span>display</span>.<span>Display</span>()
}</code></pre></div><p>Perfect. I compiled the example and ran it in the <a href="https://vba-m.com/">VisualboyAdvance emulator</a> and it ran without issue.
I needed a bit more though. I need to read gamepad input to allow scrolling through the blog post as well as drawing the blog post to the screen.</p><p>The first step was learning how to draw an image to the screen. Since display.SetPixel takes in a color.RGBA I needed to convert my image into something easily readable by the game that can store x, y, Red, Green, Blue, Alpha for each pixel.</p><p>For this task, I started by cheating a bit. A byte can hold any value 0-255 and the resolution of the gameboy advance LCD is 240x160. Conviently, if I want to create a really inefficient file format I can fit each value needed into a single byte. Then each block of 6 bytes represents a pixel.</p><p><img src="https://remyhax.xyz/gbablog/hex.png" alt="Remy TIFF (Terrible Image File Format)"></p><p>I used the Python PIL package to read an image and export a binary file with this format. Next, I used <a href="https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata">go-bindata</a> to convert the file into a []byte slice that can be embedded entirely within my TinyGo program. This looks something like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>myfile</span>() []<span>byte</span> {
	<span>//This byte slice would contain the contents of the image,
</span><span></span>	<span>//allowing me to embed the file in the binary
</span><span></span>    <span>return</span> []<span>byte</span>{<span>0x89</span>, <span>0x50</span>, <span>0x4e</span>, <span>0x47</span>, <span>0x0d</span>, <span>0x0a</span>, <span>0x1a</span>}
}</code></pre></div><p>Surprisingly, this actually worked (somewhat).</p><p><img src="https://remyhax.xyz/gbablog/remy.jpg" alt="Testing Rendering an image to gameboy advance"></p><p>After tweaking some things and generally getting a feel for how stuff worked internally, I switched to my next task: figuring out how to read gamepad input.</p><p>In retrospect, I probably could’ve used CGO which enables the creation of Go packages that call C code. This would’ve been a lot easier if I’d just used the well defined developer SDK’s already written in C, but I’d had a few beers by the time I encountered this problem. Here’s how to do things THE HARD WAY.</p><p><em>Problem Statement:</em> We want to scroll through an image by a set number of pixels when the user presses up or down on the D-Pad.</p><p>Okay, how do we read input from the D-Pad?</p><p>Let me point you to <a href="https://jamiedstewart.github.io/gba%20dev/2019/03/21/GBA-Dev-Input-Handling.html">GBA Development: Button Input Handling</a></p><blockquote><p>you might assume that when a button is pressed that the bit in the IO register that it relates to is turned on. This is infact the opposite of what happens. The REG_KEYINPUT 0x04000130 has all bits turned on when buttons are not pressed. This isn’t really a massive issue, it just means that we need to look for when a button’s bit is in the off state to indicate a press.</p></blockquote><p>Well that sounds complicated and hard, so I’m gonna basically ignore <em>pretty much all of that</em>. I do need to create a pointer to the IO register for the keypad though:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>regKEYPAD</span> = (<span>*</span><span>volatile</span>.<span>Register16</span>)(<span>unsafe</span>.<span>Pointer</span>(uintptr(<span>0x04000130</span>)))</code></pre></div><p>Alright, so we try to get the value of the register and… nothing. We wrap getting the value of the register in a while loop and… nothing.
Why?</p><p><strong>Ah, maybe my timing is off?</strong></p><p>So let’s create a timer that checks the value of the register at a regular interval!</p><p>After countless hours, you will come to the conclusion that “time” actually doesn’t work despite compiling without error.</p><p>We now have 2 problems:</p><ul><li>We need to read button presses from the D-Pad</li><li>We need to invent our own timer</li></ul><p>Super fun stuff.</p><p>After doing some reading, I found <a href="https://mgba-emu.github.io/gbatek/#lcddimensionsandtimings">GBATek</a> (Warning, HUGE page).</p><blockquote><p>V-Blanking 68 lines, 4.994 ms, 83776 cycles - 30% of v-time</p></blockquote><p>Cool, so I can use IRQ_VBLANK interrupt as a timer AND sync my actions with the screen refresh. Makes sense.</p><p>After some fiddling around, we end up with an IRQ interrupt that calls a function “update”. “Update” reads the value of the register regKEYPAD and compares it against the defined values for each button on the Gameboy Advance.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>var</span> (
	<span>//KeyCodes
</span><span></span>	<span>keyDOWN</span>      = uint16(<span>895</span>)
	<span>keyUP</span>        = uint16(<span>959</span>)
	<span>keyLEFT</span>      = uint16(<span>991</span>)
	<span>keyRIGHT</span>     = uint16(<span>1007</span>)
	<span>keyLSHOULDER</span> = uint16(<span>511</span>)
	<span>keyRSHOULDER</span> = uint16(<span>767</span>)
	<span>keyA</span>         = uint16(<span>1022</span>)
	<span>keyB</span>         = uint16(<span>1021</span>)
	<span>keySTART</span>     = uint16(<span>1015</span>)
	<span>keySELECT</span>    = uint16(<span>1019</span>)
)

<span>func</span> <span>update</span>(<span>interrupt</span>.<span>Interrupt</span>) {
	<span>//Read uint16 from register that represents the state of current buttons pressed
</span><span></span>	<span>switch</span> <span>keyValue</span> <span>:=</span> <span>regKEYPAD</span>.<span>Get</span>(); <span>keyValue</span> {
	<span>case</span> <span>keyDOWN</span>:
		<span>//Increase where we draw from in image
</span><span></span>		<span>lineCursor</span> <span>+=</span> <span>106</span>
		<span>//Draw image
</span><span></span>		<span>drawBlog</span>()
	<span>case</span> <span>keyUP</span>:
		<span>//Decrease
</span><span></span>		<span>lineCursor</span> <span>-=</span> <span>106</span>
		<span>//Draw
</span><span></span>		<span>drawBlog</span>()

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>(){
	<span>//Register interrupt using VBLANK and timer, calls update function
</span><span></span>	<span>interrupt</span>.<span>New</span>(<span>machine</span>.<span>IRQ_VBLANK</span>, <span>update</span>).<span>Enable</span>()
}</code></pre></div><p>Finally, We write a function “drawBlog” which handles drawing the scrolled image on the screen based on “lineCursor” which is controlled by the D-Pad, write a blog about it, screenshot it, and stick it into the game running on the blog about the blog.</p><p><strong>Closing Statements:</strong>
At the end, I’ve certainly learned a lot. Way more than I originally intended to, especailly considering I’d never properly written any Golang code when I started this project.</p><p>I think the work that the TinyGo team has put into this is absolutely phenomenal and truly believe that it can be the basis for creating a high level Gameboy Advance SDK in the future. Functionality such as <a href="https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinyfont">text/font rendering</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinydraw">basic drawing</a> is already supported and works on GBA.</p></div></div>]]>

				<p>I have developed&nbsp;some&nbsp;tricks&nbsp;that&nbsp;have helped me survive long flights. Here they are, in case they might help anyone else:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Noise-canceling headphones</strong><br>
I’m sensitive to noise so this is a life-saver. The engines on long-haul flights are way louder than on short-haul flights.</li>
<li><strong>Offline playlist in Spotify</strong><br>
Include&nbsp;tons of music and podcasts.</li>
<li><strong>Pay for Wifi</strong><br>
If you can afford it, pay the $30 or whatever it is for WiFi. It will be slow as hell, but it will be worth it. Do not buy those cheap “10MB” packages, as they will be used up fast.</li>
<li><strong>Dress comfortably<br>
</strong>No jeans. Wear jogging pants or whatever you like. And bring a sweater,&nbsp;for when the plane gets cold</li>
<li><strong>Shoes off</strong><br>
I take my shoes off the moment I sit down in my seat. Having your shoes on that long gets uncomfortable.</li>
<li><strong>Random toilet visits</strong><br>
I go there even if I don’t need to pee. I just sit by myself, relax, and wash my hands for refreshment. Just to switch the setting around.</li>
<li><strong>Books</strong><br>
Load up your phone with EPUBs of books you’ve been wanting to read.</li>
<li><strong>Free food<br>
</strong>Go to the stall (at the end of the airplane) and tell the stewardess that you’re hungry, ask for drinks, sandwiches, whatever you want. They will give it to you for free.</li>
<li><strong>Bring snacks</strong><br>
Buy a Big Mac before boarding the plane, and eat it whenever you want. Bring chocolate and other snacks.</li>
<li><strong>Sit/sleep wherever the fuck you want<br>
</strong>If the plane is half-empty, go walk around and choose a&nbsp;new seat&nbsp;wherever you want. Like a window seat, or take three seats, put up the armrest and stretch out for a nap.&nbsp;Do not ask the stewards if it’s OK to switch seats, they might say no. But if you do it without asking, they won’t give a fuck.</li>
</ul>

</p>
    
  </header>
  
<p>In this text I will explain what makes OpenBSD secure by default when you install it.  Do not take this for a security analysis, but more like a guide to help you understand what is done by OpenBSD to have a secure environment.  The purpose of this text is not to compare OpenBSD to others OS but to say what you can honestly expects from OpenBSD.
</p>
<p>There are no security without a threat model, I always consider the following cases: computer stolen at home by a thief, remote attacks trying to exploit running services, exploit of user network clients.
</p>

<p>Here is a list of features that I consider important for an operating system security.  While not every item from the following list are strictly security features, they help having a strict system that prevent software to misbehave and lead to unknown lands.
</p>
<p>In my opinion security is not only about preventing remote attackers to penetrate the system, but also to prevent programs or users to make the system unusable.
</p>
<h2> Pledge / unveil on userland</h2>
<p>Pledge and unveil are often referred together although they can be used independently.  Pledge is a system call to restrict the permissions of a program at some point in its source code, permissions can't be get back once pledge has been called.  Unveil is a system call that will hide all the file system to the process except the paths that are unveiled, it is possible to choose what permissions is allowed for the paths.
</p>
<p>Both a very effective and powerful surgical security tools but they require some modification within the source code of a software, but adding them requires a deep understanding on what the software is doing.  It is not always possible to forbid some system calls to a software that requires to do almost anything, software designed with privilege separation are better candidate for a proper pledge addition because each part has its own job.
</p>
<p>Some software in packages have received pledge or/and unveil support, like Chromium or Firefox for the most well known.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan2019-unveil/index.html">OpenBSD presentation about Unveil (BSDCan2019)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/BeckPledgeUnveilBSDCan2018.pdf">OpenBSD presentation of Pledge and Unveil (BSDCan2018)</a></p>
<h2> Privilege separation</h2>
<p>Most of the base system services used within OpenBSD runs using a privilege separation pattern.  Each part of a daemon is restricted to the minimum required.  A monolithic daemon would have to read/write files, accept network connections, send messages to the log, in case of security breach this allows a huge attack surface.  By separating a daemon in multiple parts, this allow a more fine grained control of each workers, and using pledge and unveil system calls, it's possible to set limits and highly reduce damage in case a worker is hacked.
</p>
<h2> Clock synchronization</h2>
<p>The daemon server is started by default to keep the clock synchronized with time servers.  A reference TLS server is used to challenge the time servers.  Keeping a computer with its clock synchronized is very important.  This is not really a security feature but you can't be serious if you use a computer on a network without its time synchronized.
</p>
<h2> X display not as root</h2>
<p>If you use the X, it drops privileges to _x11 user, it runs as unpriviliged user instead of root, so in case of security issue this prevent an attacker of accessing through a X11 bug more than what it should.
</p>
<h2> Resources limits</h2>
<p>Default resources limits prevent a program to use too much memory, too many open files or too many processes.  While this can prevent some huge programs to run with the default settings, this also helps finding file descriptor leaks, prevent a fork bomb or a simple daemon to steal all the memory leading to a crash.
</p>
<h2> Genuine full disk encryption</h2>
<p>When you install OpenBSD using a full disk encryption setup, everything will be locked down by the passphrase at the bootloader step, you can't access the kernel or anything of the system without the passphrase.
</p>
<h2> W^X</h2>
<p>Most programs on OpenBSD aren't allowed to map memory with Write AND Execution bit at the same time (W^X means Write XOR Exec), this can prevents an interpreter to have its memory modified and executed.  Some packages aren't compliant to this and must be linked with a specific library to bypass this restriction AND must be run from a partition with the "wxallowed" option.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/hackfest2015-w-xor-x.pdf">OpenBSD presentation « Kernel W^X Improvements In OpenBSD »</a></p>
<h2> Only one reliable randomness source</h2>
<p>When your system requires a random number (and it does very often), OpenBSD only provides one API to get a random number and they are really random and can't be exhausted.  A good random number generator (RNG) is important for many cryptography requirements.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/hackfest2014-arc4random/index.html">OpenBSD presentation about arc4random</a></p>
<h2> Accurate documentation</h2>
<p>OpenBSD comes with a full documentation in its man pages.  One should be able to fully configure their system using only the man pages.  Man pages comes with CAVEATS or BUGS sections sometimes, it's important to take care about those sections.  It is better to read the documentation and understand what has to be done in order to configure a system instead of following an outdated and anonymous text available on the Internet.
</p>
<p><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD man pages online</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/eurobsdcon2018-mandoc.pdf">EuroBSDcon 2018 about « Better documentation »</a></p>
<h2> IPSec and Wireguard out of the box</h2>
<p>If you need to setup a VPN, you can use IPSec or Wireguard protocols only using the base system, no package required.
</p>
<h2> Memory safeties</h2>
<p>OpenBSD has many safeties in regards to memory allocation and will prevent use after free or unsafe memory usage very aggressively, this is often a source of crash for some software from packages because OpenBSD is very strict when you want to use the memory.  This helps finding memory misuses and will kill software misbehaving.
</p>
<h2> Dedicated root account</h2>
<p>When you install the system, a root account is created and its password is asked, then you create an user that will be member of "wheel" group, allowing it to switch user to root with root's password.  doas (OpenBSD base system equivalent of sudo) isn't configured by default.  With the default installation, the root password is required to do any root action.  I think a dedicated root account that can be logged in without use of doas/sudo is better than a misconfigured doas/sudo allowing every thing only if you know the user password.
</p>
<h2> Small network attack surface</h2>
<p>The only services that could be enabled at installation time listening on the network are OpenSSH (asked at install time with default = yes), dhclient (if you choose dhcp) and slaacd (if you use ipv6 in automatic configuration).
</p>
<h2> Encrypted swap</h2>
<p>By default the OpenBSD swap is encrypted, meaning if programs memory are sent to the swap nobody can recover it later.
</p>
<h2> SMT disabled</h2>
<p>Due to a heavy number of security breaches due to SMT (like hyperthreading), the default installation disable half the logical cores to prevent any data leak.
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)">Meltdown: one of the first security issue related to speculative execution in the CPU</a></p>
<h2> Micro and Webcam disabled</h2>
<p>With the default installation, both microphone and webcam won't actually record anything except blank video/sound until you set a sysctl for this.
</p>
<h3> Maintainability, release often, update often</h3>
<p>The OpenBSD team publish a new release a new version every six months and only last two releases receives security updates.  This allows to upgrade often but without pain, the upgrade process are small steps twice a year that help keep the whole system up to date.  This avoids the fear of a huge upgrade and never doing it and I consider it a huge security bonus.  Most OpenBSD around are running latest versions.
</p>
<h3> Signify chain of trust</h3>
<p>Installer, archives and packages are signed using signify public/private keys.  OpenBSD installations comes with the release and release n+1 keys to check the packages authenticity.  A key is used only six months and new keys are received in each new release allowing to build a chain of trust.  Signify keys are very small and are published on many medias to double check when you need to bootstrap this chain of trust.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan-signify.html">Signify at BSDCan 2015</a></p>
<h2> Packages</h2>
<p>While most of the previous items were about the base system or the kernel, the packages also have a few tricks to offer.
</p>
<h3> Chroot by default when available</h3>
<p>Most daemons that are available offering a chroot feature will have it enabled by default.  In some circumstances like for Nginx web server, the software is patched by the OpenBSD team to enable chroot which is not an official feature.
</p>
<h3> Dedicated users for services</h3>
<p>Most packages that provide a server also create a new dedicated user for this exact service, allowing more privilege separation in case of security issue in one service.
</p>
<h3> Installing a service doesn't enable it</h3>
<p>When you install a service, it doesn't get enabled by default.  You will have to configure the system to enable it at boot.  There is a single /etc/rc.conf.local files that can be used to see what is enabled at boot, this can be manipulated using rcctl command.  Forcing the user to enable services makes the system administrator fully aware of what is running on the system, which is good point for security.
</p>
<p><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rcctl">rcctl man page</a></p>

<p>Most of the previous "security features" should be considered good practices and not features.  Limiting users resources, reducing daemon privileges, being strict about memory usage, provide a good documentation, start the least required amount of services and provide the user with a clean default installation that can be customized later.
</p>
<p>There are also many other features that have been added and which I don't fully understand, and that I prefer letting the reader take notice.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There’s a lot of hype behind the new Apple M1 chip. So far, it’s proven to be superior to anything Intel has offered. But what does this mean for deep learning? That’s what you’ll find out today.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new M1 chip isn’t just a CPU. On the MacBook Pro, it consists of 8 core CPU, 8 core GPU, and 16 core neural engine, among other things. Both the processor and the GPU are far superior to the previous-generation Intel configurations.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I’ve already demonstrated how fast the M1 chip is for&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.betterdatascience.com/mac-m1-python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">regular data science tasks</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, but what about deep learning?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Short answer – yes, there are some improvements in this department, but are Macs now better than, let’s say,&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Google Colab</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">? Keep in mind, Colab is an entirely free option.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The article is structured as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#cpu">CPU and GPU benchmark</a></li>
<li><a href="#test">Performance test – MNIST</a></li>
<li><a href="#fashion">Performance test – Fashion MNIST</a></li>
<li><a href="#cifar">Performance test – CIFAR-10</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Important notes</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not all data science libraries are compatible with the new M1 chip yet. Getting TensorFlow (version 2.4) to work properly is easier said than done.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can refer to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">this link</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;to download the .</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">whl</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;files for TensorFlow and it’s dependencies. This is only for macOS 11.0 and above, so keep that in mind.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The test you’ll see aren’t “scientific” in any way, shape or form. They only compare the average training time per epoch.</span></p>
<h2 id="cpu"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CPU and GPU benchmark</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Let’s start with the basic CPU and GPU benchmarks first. The comparison is made between the new MacBook Pro with the M1 chip and the base model (Intel) from 2019.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.geekbench.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Geekbench 5</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;was used for the tests, and you can see the results below:</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3868"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3868" loading="lazy" src="https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-7.png" alt="Image 1 - Geekbench 5 results (Intel MBP vs. M1 MBP) (image by author)" width="1514" height="324" srcset="https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-7.png 1514w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-7-768x164.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1514px) 100vw, 1514px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3868">Image 1 – Geekbench 5 results (Intel MBP vs. M1 MBP) (image by author)</p></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The results speak for themselves. M1 chip demolished Intel chip in my 2019 Mac. So far, things look promising.</span></p>
<h2 id="test"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Performance test – MNIST</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The MNIST dataset is something like a “hello world” of deep learning. It comes built-in with TensorFlow, making it that much easier to test.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The following script trains a neural network classifier for ten epochs on the MNIST dataset. If you’re on an M1 Mac, uncomment the <code>mlcompute</code> lines, as these will make things run a bit faster:</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The above script was executed on an M1 MBP and Google Colab (both CPU and GPU). You can see the runtime comparisons below:</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3869"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3869" loading="lazy" src="https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-6.png" alt="Image 2 - MNIST model average training times (image by author)" width="2146" height="926" srcset="https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-6.png 2146w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-6-768x331.png 768w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-6-1536x663.png 1536w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-6-2048x884.png 2048w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-6-20x10.png 20w" sizes="(max-width: 2146px) 100vw, 2146px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3869">Image 2 – MNIST model average training times (image by author)</p></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The results are somewhat disappointing for a new Mac. Colab outperformed it in both CPU and GPU runtimes. Keep in mind that results may vary, as there’s no guarantee of the runtime environment in Colab.</span></p>
<h2 id="fashion"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Performance test – Fashion MNIST</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This dataset is quite similar to the regular MNIST, but is contains pieces of clothing instead of handwritten digits. Because of that, you can use the identical neural network architecture for the training:</span></p>
<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.19 -->



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As you can see, the only thing that’s changed here is the function used to load the dataset. The runtime results for the same environments are shown below:</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3870"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3870" loading="lazy" src="https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-5.png" alt="Image 3 - Fashion MNIST model average training times (image by author)" width="2146" height="926" srcset="https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-5.png 2146w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-5-768x331.png 768w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-5-1536x663.png 1536w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-5-2048x884.png 2048w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-5-20x10.png 20w" sizes="(max-width: 2146px) 100vw, 2146px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3870">Image 3 – Fashion MNIST model average training times (image by author)</p></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once again, we get similar results. It’s expected, as this dataset is quite similar to MNIST.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But what will happen if we introduce a more complex dataset and neural network architecture?&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="cifar"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Performance test – CIFAR-10</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CIFAR-10 also falls into the category of “hello world” deep learning datasets. It contains 60K images from ten different categories, such as airplanes, birds, cats, dogs, ships, trucks, etc.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The images are of size 32x32x3, which makes them difficult to classify even for humans in some cases. The script below trains a classifier model by using three convolutional layers:</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Let’s see how convolutional layers and more complex architecture affects the runtime:</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3871"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3871" loading="lazy" src="https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-5.png" alt="Image 4 - CIFAR-10 model average training times (image by author)" width="2146" height="926" srcset="https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-5.png 2146w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-5-768x331.png 768w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-5-1536x663.png 1536w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-5-2048x884.png 2048w, https://www.betterdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-5-20x10.png 20w" sizes="(max-width: 2146px) 100vw, 2146px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3871">Image 4 – CIFAR-10 model average training times (image by author)</p></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As you can see, the CPU environment in Colab comes nowhere close to the GPU and M1 environments. The Colab GPU environment is still around 2x faster than Apple’s M1, similar to the previous two tests.</span></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I love every bit of the new M1 chip and everything that comes with it – better performance, no overheating, and better battery life. Still, it’s a difficult laptop to recommend if you’re into deep learning.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sure, there’s around 2x improvement in M1 than my other Intel-based Mac, but these still aren’t machines made for deep learning. Don’t get me wrong, you can use the MBP for any basic deep learning tasks, but there are better machines in the same price range if you’ll do deep learning daily.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This article covered deep learning only on simple datasets. The next one will compare the M1 chip with Colab on more demanding tasks – such as transfer learning.&nbsp;</span></p>

      Let's talk about pricing commissioned work on existing open source projects. Or: things I learned from my past mistakes.
    </p><div>

<p>A followup to <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support/">No, “Open Source” does not mean “Includes Free Support”</a>. Buckle up, this is going to be a long one.</p>

<p>Here’s a situation, maintainers of open source projects might find familiar: an email arrives. The sender introduces himself as the representative of a business and would like to ask, if it is possible to adopt (part of) the project to his (very) specific use case. A custom fork, exposing the desired functionality via a commandline switch would suffice. Shouldn’t be too much trouble, right?</p>

<p>Right! It isn’t. Couple of hours tops to write the code. But under <strong>no</strong> circumstances do I want to have it in the project’s main development branch. Besides, I’m not really going to spend an afternoon, so someone else can cash in on it, am I? This is clearly a commission. I’m going to charge for it. The question is just how much…
</p><figure>
  <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/software-development-cost/wtf.svg">
    <img src="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/software-development-cost/wtf.svg">
  </a>
  
  <figcaption>WTF?! Four figures for a patch of maybe 100 lines of code? How do you even justify that?!</figcaption>
  
</figure>
                             
                             

<p>In the past, I would have spend an hour or so (spoiler alert: that was already a mistake), roughly sketching out in my head, what needs to be done, estimated how long it would take, multiplied that by an <del>arbitrary</del> industry standard hourly rate, tried to somehow justify the number to myself (second mistake), then send a quote, just to receive one of three replies:</p>

<ul>
<li>That’s too expensive! Forget, I asked.</li>
<li>That’s too expensive! Can you make it cheaper?</li>
<li>That cheap <small>(would have expected at least double)</small>
?</li>
</ul>

<p>Great! So, I either wasted an hour preparing for a commission that’s never going to happen, be forced  to waste even more hours on negotiating getting paid less for them, or flat out sold myself short. Welcome to the business world, dumbass!</p>

<p>
  
  <span>An error in reasoning</span>
  
  
Charging an hourly rate for a service is a convenient method for writing offers and bills (easy to digest and therefore more likely to be accepted without hassle), making it the obvious choice. But the real value of a service isn't always expressible as the product of hours × rate. At least not without inflating the factors unrealistically.

</p>
                             
                             

<p>Lesson learned. Nowadays, I just skip the whole cost forecast thing and send a simple response right away: <em>“Can do. Will cost about four figures. When do you need it?”</em> Sounds brazen? Maybe. But, by my experience, everything else is going to end in tears. Let’s break down that line of thought.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-value-of-my-time">What’s the value of my time?</h2>

<p>A common misconception about open source software is that it is developed by hobbyists in their spare time. With a day job to pay for the bills, free time does not have opportunity cost, so it can be bought/must be sold for cheap. That, at least, is what the market theory tells us, but that’s not exactly true, is it? In fact, it is utterly wrong. The opportunity cost of <em>spare time</em> is <em>enjoying life</em>. I, as everyone else, only have one lifetime to spend and I intent to use as much as possible of that, pursuing my own happiness. Work is just a means to that end.</p>

<p>So, if I’m freelancing, which part of my life am I selling? The office hours or my leisure time? In first case, I’m running a business. My price calculation therefore has to cover my cost of living and turn a profit as well. In the second case, the former becomes <strong>my baseline</strong>, as my bills are already paid and I therefore need a pretty good incentive to turn even more of my lifetime into working hours. Either way, nothing about the involvement in open source software compels me to provide cheap labor.
</p><p>
  
  <span>Bottom line</span>
  
  
I'm neither a burger flipper, nor do I work at cost. For me, this is a business, not a charity. So yes, my bill includes profit. If it doesn't pay, I'm not interested in doing it.

</p>
                             
                             

<p>That being said, I do not charge by the hour for software development. <strong>Period</strong>. Hourly billing only works when the required time is easy to pre-estimate, track and review by all involved parties, e.g. when consulting on the phone. But it is the completely wrong model for doing any kind of software development. Here, other considerations come into play that go way beyond the “mere” 100 lines of code, I may eventually end up writing. Hence, my four figures “quote” has nothing to do, whatsoever, with the actual time that goes into <em>typing</em> them.</p>

<h2 id="i-m-an-engineer-not-a-psychic">I’m an engineer, not a psychic</h2>

<p>I have been doing this for a while now and I never ever came across a single client, who even remotely understood what exactly he wanted (even when having a technical background). Sure, they all had a rough idea of the problem they wanted solved, but the steps to getting there were a total mystery.</p>

<p>
  
  <span>Premise</span>
  
  
The client is <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/incompetent">incompetent</a>. Always! That's important to note and to <u>prepare for</u>. If he had the necessary expertise for the job, he'd just do it himself, not hire me.

</p>
                             
                             

<p>My work always starts with figuring out the interface(s) between my code (to be) and the client’s system, as well as explaining to him what can and can’t be done. That process typically takes days of written correspondence. All of it is scaffolding. None of it will show in the final product, but it is preliminary work that must be done before any of the actual work can happen.
</p><p>
  
  <span>Beware of shortcuts</span>
  
  
Discussing a project on the phone is faster, but you quickly get bogged down in details and with no written record of what has been said, requested and promised, either party is going to forget half of those details. That's a lawsuit in the making.

</p>
                             
                             

<p>When a client contacts me for the first time, I have no idea of his prior knowledge and therefore no way of telling how much scaffolding will be needed. Experience taught me, though, to never ever make any estimates based on the initial mail. No matter how crystal clear and straight forward it may seem. </p><figure>

                              The premise is that the client doesn’t know what he is doing. So, he is going to flip flop around. He will come up with last minute “minor” change requests. He will ask an unexpected comprehension question, undoing everything after it was already tied up. In other words: clients tend to unwittingly turn laid out plans into piles of smoldering ashes in an instant, while being totally oblivious to the fact that this drives cost on my end.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, charging <strong>by the hour</strong> for software development <strong>is futile</strong>. When freelancing, my price calculation always contains an error margin, large enough to cover for doing the preliminary work at least twice over. This is non-negotiable and it is also non-refundable.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-more-than-just-writing-code-and-the-job-s-not-done-when-delivering-the-executable">It’s more than just writing code and the job’s not done when delivering the executable</h2>

<p>Writing and compiling the code is the least time consuming part of the deal. It’s what comes afterwards where the hours are burned:</p>

<ul>
<li>The client will probably want instructions on how to use his fork. That means writing documentation and/or walking him through. Usually, both. The later can turn into a nasty surprise in case I overestimated his technical skills.</li>
<li>Just because the mod works on my PC doesn’t mean it will work in the client’s system. More likely than not, there will be a remote debugging session (potentially with a client, whose technical skills I overestimated).</li>
<li>The main development branch will move on. The client may want/need the new version with his custom patch applied eventually. This means, I now have two code branches to maintain and should probably also write some extra unit tests to detect breaking changes.</li>
<li>After completion (and payment), there will likely be “minor” follow up questions. Things, that can be answered in one sentence. Individually, they take up almost no time at all, but they will pile up and are impossible to consolidate into billable units.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, counting hours is pointless. How long the job takes is largely determined by the client’s actions, not by mine. That’s a big variable beyond my control. The client can (<u>and will</u>!) drag this out, putting me into an impossible situation: I’m suppose to give a quote in order to get the commission, based on information, I can only have after finishing. But at that point, it’s too late to change the estimate and simply charging extra after giving a quote is obviously not going to fly.</p>

<p>Now, some people might wonder, why I don’t just write a detailed offer/bill then. Listing all the individual positions, so the client knows exactly what he’s paying for and why it’s costing so much. Am I too lazy? Yes, I am! I am mostly too lazy to argue about why every item is required, having to take it out because it isn’t, having to add it again because it was and in the end renegotiate everything because safety margins were not used to their fullest extent.</p>

<p>Everything that’s on an offer/bill is contestable. Haggling costs additional time and can’t end in my favour, no matter what. I learned the hard way to not put that option on the table.</p>

<h2 id="aren-t-we-forgetting-something">Aren’t we forgetting something?</h2>

<p>The basis for the commission is still an open source project. Yes, it is free to use, but it is not free to maintain and by creating it, I made an investment, indebting myself to myself. Now, why should some people have to pay, while other’s don’t? I could make an elaborate argument here about it being a mixed calculation and not being required to offer everyone the same deal, but I got a much simpler and more compelling …</p></div></div>

<p>On <em>2021-02-15</em> by <em>ThatGeoGuy</em></p>

<p>Since starting my new role at <a href="https://tangramvision.com/">Tangram Vision</a>, I’ve
been doing a lot of programming in Rust. This is a bit of a change for me
having mostly worked in C / C++ / C# over the past 6 years, but my impressions
overall are quite positive.</p>

<p>One of my favourite features of Rust are the enum types. They don’t stick out
among Rust’s set of language features compared to some of the more novel
aspects of the language (borrow checker, lifetimes, safe-multi-threading);
however, Rust’s enum types drive some of the coolest parts of the language, and
make modeling data in terms of types a pleasure.</p>

<p>So I wanted to write something to point out some of the reasons I like Rust
enums so much. There’s gonna be a lot of “compared to C / C++” in here, so do
be warned.</p>



<p>First and foremost, an “enumeration” or enum in Rust is a kind of sum-type.
Rust utilizes an algebraic type system, so there’s a few different ways to
specify what the “type” of some data is.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>In Rust</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Atoms</td>
      <td><code>i32</code>, <code>u64</code>, <code>f32</code>, etc.</td>
      <td>Atoms are types whose values evaluate to themselves. These are more or less the smallest types you’ll encounter, but they are the building blocks for everything else.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sum types</td>
      <td><code>enum</code></td>
      <td>Sum types are types where you can choose one of a set of possible states. The number of possible states a variable can have is the sum of all options.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Product types</td>
      <td><code>struct</code></td>
      <td>Product types are defined similarly to sum types. The number of possible states a variable can have is the product of all combinations of data in the struct.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Generic types</td>
      <td><code>SomeType&lt;T&gt;</code></td>
      <td>A type that is defined in terms of some other type (or types) <code>T</code>.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This may be a bit hand-wavy, and I certainly didn’t cover all possible types (I
ignored traits and functions, for example), but it’s a good start to getting to
know about enums.</p>

<p>Rust enums, or sum-types in general, make the most sense when you want to
represent a “choice” as a type somehow. The easiest example to represent this
in Rust is the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> type, which is a generic enum roughly of the form:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>),</span>
    <span>None</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an enum that represents whether or not you have <code>Some</code> of some <code>T</code>, or
<code>None</code> of it. Other enums are a “choice” in the same way. Every variable of
your enum type can only be one entry in the enum type at a time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>42.0</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> above are the same type, they have to be either something
(<code>Some(42.0)</code>) or nothing (<code>None</code>). They can’t be both.</p>

<p>Based on what we saw above, there’s a couple of interesting ways we can write
an enum type.</p>

<h2 id="no-data">No data</h2>

<p>This is closest to what C++-style enum classes are like, although unlike in C
or C++, these aren’t automatically mapped to a set of integers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Color</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Red</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Green</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Blue</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re coming from C you might think: well, why aren’t these mapped to
integers? Shouldn’t <code>Red</code> be zero, <code>Green</code> be one, <code>Blue</code> as two, etc? Unlike
C, Rust’s type system isn’t entirely based on integers. Types have
significantly more meaning, and it’s difficult to explain this succinctly.
Instead, <code>Color</code> is a type in your program where <code>Color::Red</code> is a distinct
value from <code>Color::Green</code> is a distinct value from <code>Color::Blue</code>, in the same
way that 0 is distinct from 1 or 2.</p>

<p>If one wants to, <a href="https://docs.rs/num-derive/0.3.3/num_derive/index.html">there are
crates</a> for mapping
integers to enum values. This can be useful if you’re serializing to some
low-level protocol, but isn’t very interesting otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="tuple-like">Tuple-like</h2>

<p>One thing I’ve avoided until now is talking about <code>union</code> types in C. C has
enums and unions, which are two separate kinds of abstractions. C-enums give
names to a list of integer values, while C-unions provide a weak kind of
sum-type.</p>

<p>The weakness of C-unions is because while you may have a union which can map
over one option among a set of types, you don’t know <em>which</em> type the union was
actually mapped to. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>union</span> <span>my_union_t</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>a</span><span>;</span>
    <span>float</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above example, you can’t know when you receive a <code>my_union_t</code> type
whether it was created by setting some value <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, or <code>c</code>. You know it’s
one of the options, but not which one. A typical way to work around this is to
type-tag your union with an enum, and pass that around too.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>my_union_type_t</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>A</span><span>,</span>
    <span>B</span><span>,</span>
    <span>C</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means you’re passing around two values just to be able to understand what
your compiler should already know for you! This “idiom” in C is also
error-prone: what if you send the wrong enum value alongside your union?
<em>Undefined behaviour</em>, that’s what. Rust’s enums are much more convenient, and
allow for combining data alongside the enum options themselves:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>MyType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>),</span>
    <span>B</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>),</span>
    <span>C</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because of this, you never need to worry about mismatching your enum / union
types. Likewise, Rust doesn’t need a keyword for unions since the above example
does exactly the same thing as the example in C. I think this was the first
thing that really struck me about how cool enums in Rust are, because manually
tagging and passing around unions and enums in C / C++ is a huge pain and
source of bugs.</p>

<p>
Disclaimer: It's worth mentioning these examples aren't <em>exactly</em> 1:1.
Rust does not yet have a stable ABI, so whatever the compiler spews out for
these isn't going to be exactly what the C ABI demands, and obviously
"String" in Rust is a vastly more comprehensive type than the C-string
equivalent.
</p>

<h2 id="named-data">Named data</h2>

<p>Similar to the above, we can give the data we pass around with our enum types
names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>MyTypeWithNames</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>A</span> <span>{</span> <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span> <span>},</span>
    <span>B</span> <span>{</span> <span>quantity</span><span>:</span> <span>f32</span> <span>},</span>
    <span>C</span> <span>{</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Giving names to things can be a good idea, especially if you’re passing around
a lot of data inside your enum, or passing around multiple values of the same
type. However, sometimes the best name is no name, so don’t overdo it!</p>

<p>One last fun fact: all of these can all be interchanged. Sometimes, depending
on what you’re building, you might even be able to build an enum like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>PixelFormat</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Yuv</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span>
        <span>u</span><span>:</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span>
        <span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>Rgb</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>r</span><span>:</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span>
        <span>g</span><span>:</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span>
        <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>Greyscale</span><span>(</span><span>u16</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Unknown</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It might seem like this complicates your code significantly, but we have to
choose to live with complexity at some level. A bit of extra complexity in the
definition drops a <strong>significant</strong> amount of complexity in how we pass around
and use these types.</p>



<p>Without trying to (entirely) pitch you on <del>Haskell</del> strong type systems and
pure functional programming, enums in Rust are exciting because of what they
make easy. Rust uses enum types throughout the core language, and many of the
common idioms utilize enums in some form.</p>

<p>And if I’m being honest, equivalents can be made in C or C++ but the ergonomics
and language integration just aren’t there. Passing C-enums or C++-enum classes
alongside unions is vastly more error-prone.</p>

<h2 id="optiont"><code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p>Rust doesn’t have “optional” or “defaulted” arguments in functions like C does.
But we don’t need it! Instead, we can use the generic <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, to represent
whether or not something is required. In function parameters:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>add_three_numbers</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span> <span>+</span> <span>value</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While a bit contrived, when calling this you might do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>add_three_numbers</span><span>(</span><span>13</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>);</span>    <span>// =&gt; 25</span>
<span>let</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>add_three_numbers</span><span>(</span><span>13</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>));</span> <span>// =&gt; 29</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, if you avoid using <code>unsafe</code> Rust and raw pointers, the default Rust
types for pointers (<code>Box</code>, <code>Arc</code>, etc) cannot ever exist as a “null” pointer.
Instead, if you want to represent a pointer that can be null, you use
<code>Option&lt;Box&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, and null pointers are represented as <code>None</code>! Unlike in C or
C++, this makes the type of pointers very explicit. You know that you have to
handle the enum differently than you would the pointer itself, and once you get
a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> you know for certain that it points to something. This is one way
safe Rust avoids null de-references!</p>

<h2 id="resultt-e"><code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code></h2>

<p>Similar to <code>Option</code>, <code>Result</code> is Rust’s standard error type. It is a fairly
straightforward enum that roughly takes the form:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>E</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, <code>Result</code> is usually used as the return value <em>from</em> a function,
which tells you if it succeeded and you get an <code>Ok(T)</code> back, or if it failed
and you get some error <code>Err(E)</code> back. In practice, it’s pretty cool how
flexible this is for error handling. It also avoids all the problems with
C++-style exceptions.</p>

<p>Side note: Check out the <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.34/anyhow/">anyhow crate</a> if you haven't already.</p>

<h2 id="matching-enums">Matching enums</h2>

<p>By default Rust has built in support for deconstruction / pattern-matching enum
types (even ones you define!). From our earlier example we can do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>PixelFormat</span><span>;</span> <span>// Assume this is given a value from something</span>

<span>match</span> <span>x</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PixelFormat</span><span>::</span><span>Yuv</span><span>{</span> <span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>}</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Pixel is y: {}, u: {}, v: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>PixelFormat</span><span>::</span><span>Rgb</span><span>{</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>}</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Pixel is r: {}, g: {}, b: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>PixelFormat</span><span>::</span><span>Greyscale</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Greyscale value is: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>g</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>PixelFormat</span><span>::</span><span>Unknown</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Oh no, we don't understand this pixel format!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While Rust doesn’t have switch statements that operate over integers like C
does, this is a very close equivalent that semantically allows for some much
more powerful abstractions.</p>

<p>As I said originally, enum types represent a “choice” of some kind when
programming. The <code>match</code> expression above demonstrates how we dispatch a
“choice” in our program according to our type.</p>



<p>Enums in Rust unify the concept of enums and unions in C-family languages. They
are more expressive and reduce a lot of complexity in managing state or
tracking a union through a program. They also power some of the core types that
are used in almost all Rust code.</p>

<p>Enums are one of my favourite parts of moving to Rust from C++. They are used
in error management, optional arguments, and enable a whole host of different</p></div></div>

<p>Hamel and Jeremy had to overcome a few technical hurdles to make that work. Fortunately this will no longer be required as the latest version of Rich has first-class support for full-screen interfaces via a new Layout system.</p>
<h2>Full-screen terminal interface</h2>
<p>Here's a video demonstration of a terminal interface built with Layout:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>Layout API</h2>
<p>The API to create a flexible layout is surprisingly simple. You construct a <code>Layout()</code> object, then call <code>split()</code> to create sub-layouts. These sub-layouts may then be further divided. Layouts have a small number of settings which define their size relative to the terminal window. It's a simple system that can create terminal interfaces that almost resemble modern web apps.</p>

<h2>Finally, some code</h2>
<p>Here's how you would create a basic layout with a header, a footer, and two side-panels.</p>
<pre><code>from rich.console import Console
from rich.layout import Layout

console = Console()
layout = Layout()

# Divide the "screen" in to three parts
layout.split(
    Layout(name="header", size=3),
    Layout(ratio=1, name="main"),
    Layout(size=10, name="footer"),
)
# Divide the "main" layout in to "side" and "body"
layout["main"].split(
    Layout(name="side"),
    Layout(name="body", ratio=2),
    direction="horizontal"
)
# Divide the "side" layout in to two
layout["side"].split(Layout(), Layout())

console.print(layout)
</code></pre>
<p>Running the code above produces the following output:</p>

<p>Any renderable (text, table, progress bars etc) may be placed inside those sub-layouts.</p>
<p>We can now use the <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live.html">Live</a> class to create an application that adapts itself to the terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>from rich.live import Live
from time import sleep

with Live(layout, screen=True):
    while True:
        sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>In a real app, that do-nothing loop will be doing something useful like pulling data from the network to update contents.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layout.html">layout docs</a> for an in-depth tutorial.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I think it's clear that Rich is acquiring more TUI (text user interface) features, and I've decided not to fight it. Rich's core purpose is still to beautify CLI output, but I think there is an opportunity here for a new way to create terminal apps. Ultimately it will be less like curses and more like HTML in a browser.</p>
<p>There are a number of things to do before Rich could replace a full TUI library (keyboard and mouse input for one) but the potential is there. Stay tuned for progress.</p>

I spent the last 10 years of my career building and growing B2C and B2B startups, too often for others.  </p><p>I’m a bootstrapper at heart and obsessed with the 0 to 1 phase of building something from scratch. </p><p>But bootstrapping rhymes with time and pain and patience, things you and I are already short on. </p><p>If you’ve already built something from scratch and sold it, you’re likely hard-wired to want to do it again. But that is pretty hardcore. Building something totally new is super hard and jarring.</p><p>But it’s no longer the only way. </p><p>It’s possible to keep working on the 0 to 1 process of building micro-SaaS products without all of the pain associated with starting from scratch. You can skip right to the fun part.</p><p>With as little as $5,000, you could land yourself a <em>starter Micro-SaaS</em> that is beyond launch and ready for iteration. </p><p>You can just jump right in and do your thing.</p><p>There is a shift in the world of (micro) entrepreneurship. The scales are tipping in favour of the small guys. And the even smaller ones still.</p><p>My interest in micro-SaaS products, bootstrapping and investing converges at a place that looks a lot like angel investing with a dose of influence from the real estate development world. </p><p>The progress of <a href="https://twitter.com/agazdecki">Andrew Gazdecki from MicroAcquire</a> has paved the way for an entirely new career archetype I will describe as the <em>micro angel.</em></p><p>A <strong>micro angel</strong> is just an individual with a bias for investing in products that they will independently grow and operate. </p><p>The term ‘micro’ probably gives a hint to the size of the transactions. They’re smaller than small. They’re micro. But they don’t have to be.</p><p>Beyond buying and working on a single Micro-SaaS, the future also holds a lot of promise for investing at a portfolio scale:</p><ul><li><p>microacquire simplifies both sourcing and selling assets</p></li><li><p>products can be acquired for relatively low multiples in cases where revenue is flat or founder interest to sell is high</p></li><li><p>products are default-alive<a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a> which means buy-and-hold nearly guarantees a higher valuation 24 months later</p></li><li><p>products are extremely simple by nature, and thus low maintenance → less reliance on active management</p></li><li><p>products are high-margin and cashflow positive → provide immediate return on investment over fund’s lifetime, and any exit at maturity becomes pure bonus that exponentiates IRR</p></li><li><p>personal cashflow liberates the micro angel to choose between buy-and-hold (4 hour workweek, bank revenue) or buy-and-grow (actively work on the portfolio, cashflow pays self)</p></li></ul><p>There are two approaches:</p><p><strong>1) The Operator approach buys and grows:</strong> you buy products with the intent to actively work on them and grow ARR over the lifetime of the investment. This assumes you’re buying back most of your time through portfolio cashflow, reinvesting it into growing ARR and driving your return through that ARR multiple; or</p><p><strong>2) The Investor approach buys and holds:</strong> you buy products with the intent to passively maintain them, collect cashflows and recollect your original investment when you exit the investment. Your return is manifested in the cashflows you perceive, and any additional capital-gain when you exit is a pure bonus. You’re free to work on something else with your time (i.e. big startup idea).</p><p>There are probably more approaches and hybrids. It’s an exciting world to explore.</p><p>I’m inspired by the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/awilkinson">Andrew Wilkinson</a> and team at <a href="https://www.tinycapital.com/">Tiny Capital</a> (disclosure: I hold $WE stock). Their value prop has made it possible for founders clearing $500K-$5M/year to exit cleanly, quickly and painlessly. </p><p>In an indirectly related world, I also regularly follow what <a href="https://twitter.com/sweatystartup">Nick Huber</a> does with his approach to real estate investing. Nick specializes in self-storage for many of the same reasons I want to specialize in micro-SaaS products. They run themselves, are high margin, and command excellent cash-on-cash returns.</p><p>There’s a big opportunity for micro angels to build micro-SaaS portfolios producing ARR in the $50k-$500k/year range. These products fall <em>way</em> out of the range of the VC and PE firm world, and they also fall out of the scope of Tiny Capital and other similar funds. </p><p>But they’re perfect for micro angels. </p><p>This year, I’m going to invest $500k of my own money to build the first micro-angel portfolio of its kind. </p><p>My goal is to source and acquire products and grow the portfolio valuation so I can return at least 2x on my investment, 2 years later. While collecting the free cashflows in the meanwhile. </p><p>I’m going to share every little detail from designing the fund’s purpose and vision to sourcing, negotiating and closing deals. I expect to release monthly portfolio reports and share all of the revenue details along the way.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://microangel.so/p/coming-soon?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share">tell your friends</a>!</p></div></div>]]>

<h3>noirlab2108 — Science Release</h3>



<h3>Gemini North helps define remote object’s distance and orbit</h3>
<p>10 February 2021</p>






<p>With the help of the international Gemini Observatory, a Program of NSF’s NOIRLab, and other ground-based telescopes, astronomers have confirmed that a faint object discovered in 2018 and nicknamed “Farfarout” is indeed the most distant object yet found in our Solar System. The object has just received its designation from the International Astronomical Union.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Farfarout was first spotted in January 2018 by the <a href="https://subarutelescope.org/en/">Subaru Telescope</a>, located on Maunakea in Hawai‘i. Its discoverers <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/planetx">could tell</a> it was very far away, but they weren’t sure exactly how far. They needed more observations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>At that time we did not know the object’s orbit as we only had the Subaru discovery observations over 24 hours, but it takes years of observations to get an object's orbit around the Sun,” </em>explained co-discoverer Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science. <em>“All we knew was that the object appeared to be very distant at the time of discovery.</em><em>”</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sheppard and his colleagues, David Tholen of the University of Hawai‘i and Chad Trujillo of Northern Arizona University, spent the next few years tracking the object with the <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/gemini-observatory/gemini-north/">Gemini North</a> telescope (also on Maunakea in Hawai‘i) and the Carnegie Institution for Science’s <a href="https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/Magellan">Magellan Telescopes</a> in Chile to determine its orbit. <a href="#1">[1]</a> They have now confirmed that Farfarout currently lies 132 astronomical units (au) from the Sun, which is 132 times farther from the Sun than Earth is. (For comparison, Pluto is 39 au from the Sun, on average.)&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Farfarout is even more remote than the previous Solar System distance record-holder, which was discovered by the same team and nicknamed “Farout.” Provisionally designated 2018 VG<sub>18</sub>, Farout is 124 au from the Sun.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the orbit of Farfarout is quite elongated, taking it 175 au from the Sun at its farthest point and around 27 au at its closest, which is inside the orbit of Neptune. Because its orbit crosses Neptune’s, Farfarout could provide insights into the history of the outer Solar System.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>Farfarout was likely thrown into the outer Solar System by getting too close to Neptune in the distant past," </em>said Trujillo.<em>&nbsp;</em>“<em>Farfarout will likely interact with Neptune again in the future since their orbits still intersect.</em><em>”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Farfarout is very faint. Based on its brightness and distance from the Sun, the team estimates it to be about 400 kilometers (250 miles) across, putting it at the low end of possibly being designated a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The IAU's Minor Planet Center in Massachusetts <a href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K21/K21CI7.html">announced today</a> that it has given Farfarout the provisional designation 2018 AG<sub>37</sub>. The Solar System’s most distant known member will receive an official name after more observations are gathered and its orbit becomes even more refined in the coming years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>Farfarout takes a millennium to go around the Sun once,</em><em>”</em><em>&nbsp;</em>said Tholen.<em> “Because of this, it moves very slowly across the sky, requiring several years of observations to precisely determine its trajectory.</em><em>”</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Farfarout’s discoverers are confident that even more distant objects remain to be discovered on the outskirts of the Solar System, and that its distance record might not stand for long.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>The discovery of Farfarout shows our increasing ability to map the outer Solar System and observe farther and farther towards the fringes of our Solar System</em>,<em>”</em>&nbsp;said Sheppard. “<em>Only with the advancements in the last few years of large digital cameras on very large telescopes has it been possible to efficiently discover very distant objects like Farfarout. Even though some of these distant objects are quite large — the size of dwarf planets — they are very faint because of their extreme distances from the Sun. Farfarout is just the tip of the iceberg of objects in the very distant Solar System.</em><em>”</em></p>
<h3>Notes</h3><p><a name="1"></a>[1] The Gemini North observations of Farfarout were done on 1 May and 2 May 2019 Universal Time, using <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/sciops/observing-gemini/proposal-routes-and-observing-modes/director039s-time">Director's Discretionary Time</a>.</p>

		<p><span>Millions of databases are being migrated to PostgreSQL today.

</ul>
<p><span>While it is great that there are several features available with Postgres by default, it may be challenging if there are no solutions to help with migrations to postgres. Fortunately, there are several contributions through extensions and Open source tools that made migrations to PostgreSQL very easy. In this blog post, we are going to discuss just one of those features.</span></p>
<h4><span>Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW)</span></h4>
<p><span>As of the most recently updated SQL standard, </span><span>ISO/IEC 9075:2016 aka SQL:2016,</span> <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_compliance"><span>PostgreSQL tops the compliance chart</span></a></span><span> when compared with Oracle, DB2, SQL Server and MySQL, qualifying </span><span><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/features.html"><span>170 of the 177 SQL standards</span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>SQL/MED</strong> is one of the standards that was originally defined as part of the SQL standard updated in 2003 (SQL:2003). MED stands for Management of External Data, the data that is accessible but not managed by the DBMS itself. Using FDW(s), objects of a heterogeneous database can be transparently mapped to PostgreSQL. This helps a user to SELECT FROM or WRITE TO a remote homogeneous/heterogeneous database from a Postgres database.</span></p>
<p><span>As seen in the following image, we can join an Oracle table with a Postgres table using Oracle FDW on a postgres server.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.migops.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blank-board-1.png" alt="FDW" width="544" height="334" srcset="https://www.migops.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blank-board-1.png 1003w, https://www.migops.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blank-board-1-300x184.png 300w, https://www.migops.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blank-board-1-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px"></p>
<h5><strong>Features offered by some of the foreign data wrappers</strong></h5>
<ol>
<li><span> Optimization of remote queries to reduce the amount of data transferred between the servers.</span></li>
<li><span> Predicate push down</span></li>
<li><span> Join push down</span></li>
<li><span> Aggregate push down</span></li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Advantages of FDW(s) while migrating to PostgreSQL</strong></h5>
<p>Following are some of the advantages of foreign data wrappers while migrating to PostgreSQL.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Schema Migrations to PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p><span>Some of the database migrations from Oracle like databases can be simply done using oracle_fdw like foreign data wrappers. Using the IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA syntax, a schema similar to Oracle can be created in the postgres database. Oracle_FDW does an automatic conversion of Oracle data types to an appropriate postgres data type and creates tables and views with the same structure as of the Oracle schema.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Following is an example of how the schema : HR of an Oracle database : xepdb1 running on host : 192.168.10.1 is being migrated to PostgreSQL using oracle_fdw.&nbsp;</span><span>All these steps will be executed on the Postgres database and nothing on the Oracle database.&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre>CREATE SERVER oracle_server<br>FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER oracle_fdw<br>OPTIONS (dbserver '//192.168.10.1:1521/xepdb1');<p>GRANT USAGE ON FOREIGN SERVER oracle_server TO postgres;</p><p>CREATE USER MAPPING FOR postgres<br>SERVER oracle_server<br>OPTIONS (user 'SYSTEM', password 'SYSTEM');</p><p>CREATE SCHEMA hr_fdw;</p><p>IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA "HR" FROM SERVER oracle_server INTO hr_fdw;</p><p>postgres=# select count(*) from hr_fdw.countries;<br>&nbsp;count<br>-------<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 25<br>(1 row)</p></pre>
<p>As seen in the above log, we could run a select on a postgres database that is getting the count of records of a table from an Oracle table.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Data Migration to PostgreSQL</b></p>
<p><span>FDW(s) can be used to migrate data from a remote heterogeneous database to PostgreSQL. As seen in the following example, using oracle_fdw, we can run a simple insert command that can select data from an oracle database table and insert it into a postgres table.&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><span>INSERT INTO hr.countries (country_id, region_id, country_name) <br>     SELECT (country_id, country_name, region_id) FROM hr_fdw.countries;</span></pre>
<p><b>Data validation upon migration to PostgreSQL</b></p>
<p><span>One of the challenges faced by developers and admins migrating to PostgreSQL is the data validation. It is very difficult to validate the data between 2 heterogeneous databases. One may have to write an application comparing the data or find some other complex ways to do the same. Foreign data wrappers can be a saviour here. We can join the postgres table and the source table to check for any missing data using different combinations of the powerful SQL language.&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><span>SELECT id<br></span><span>FROM oracle_table ora<br></span><span>WHERE NOT EXISTS<br></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(SELECT *<br></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM postgres_table pg<br></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHERE pg.id = ora.id);</span></pre>
<p><strong>Please note :</strong></p>
<p><span>Not all DBaaS platforms allow us to create foreign data wrappers. For example, Amazon RDS or Aurora does not list <span><a href="https://github.com/laurenz/oracle_fdw">oracle_fdw</a></span> as one of the supported extensions. What to do in such cases ? Let us see a step by step technical approach on how to deal with that in our next blog post. Please subscribe to our blog posts to follow our latest updates on migrations to postgres.

				<p>In this post, I’ll go over how to decrypt your own 2G GSM SMS messages by pulling encryption keys off your SIM card and processing the data with gr-gsm.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://harrisonsand.com/posts/gsm-security/">previous post</a>, I looked at how to decode and start analyzing GSM traffic. If you haven’t read that yet, I suggest you start there. I’m going to assume you have your environment set up to that point.</p>

<p>Before you take your capture, it’s helpful to know a bit about how GSM encryption works. There are two important keys to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ki (Subscriber key)</strong> - Essentially a “master key” that’s stored in your SIM card and never leaves. The key is set during SIM production and doesn’t change.</li>
<li><strong>Kc (Cipher key)</strong> - The key used to encrypt traffic over the air. Kc is a derivative of the Ki and rotated at regular intervals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before a call or text, the mobile network sends an Authentication Request message to the phone. Inside this message is a 16-byte random value (RAND). RAND is sent to the SIM card and combined with Ki to make Kc. The SIM then exposes Kc to the modem so the session can be encrypted.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that the Kc will change <em>before</em> each call or text. So if we want to decrypt our traffic, we need to get the key <em>after</em> a particular session has occurred.</p>

<p>You essentially have two ways to get the Kc off the SIM. Either by interfacing with the modem or by talking to the SIM directly with a card reader. Both methods work, but I find using a card reader less complicated.</p>
<p>The process for getting access to the modem is highly dependent on what type of phone you have. You have to find the modem’s serial interface and send it raw AT commands. Sometimes the serial interface is exposed over USB, or if you have root access, you might be able to find it in the <code>/dev/</code> directory. If you do get access to the modem, I have had luck with the following AT command: <code>AT+CRSM=176,20256,0,0,9</code>.</p>
<p>If you use a card reader, tools like <a href="https://github.com/L1L1/cardpeek">Cardpeek</a> or <a href="http://www.nobbi.com/download.html">SIMspy II</a> can help you read the Kc from the SIM.</p>

<p>Using Cardpeek is reasonably straightforward. After you perform your capture insert the SIM card into the reader, plug the reader into the computer, and select <code>Analyzer &gt; GSM SIM</code>.</p>

<p>The last byte (<code>03</code> in the screenshot) is a sequence number and is not part of the key.</p>

<p>As discussed in the previous post, the first step to decoding traffic is to figure out what channel the communication takes place on. The phone and base station (BTS) make this decision over the BCCH channel.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you receive something:</p>
<ol>
<li>The BTS sends a <em>Paging Request</em> to the phone</li>
<li>The phone sends a <em>Channel Request</em> to the BTS</li>
<li>The BTS sends an <em>Immediate Assignment</em> to the phone</li>
<li>Communication continues on a dedicated channel</li>
</ol>
<p>(You skip the first step when sending)</p>
<p>For this test, we’re only capturing downlink traffic from the BTS. Because of this, we only see one side of the assignment procedure, and it’s not possible to determine which Immediate Assignment messages are our own. However, if you keep your capture time short, it’s easy enough to figure out. There usually aren’t too many different channel configurations sent out within a limited time window.</p>
<p>Use this display filter to show relevant Immediate Assignment messages: <code>gsm_a.rr.dedicated_mode_or_tbf == 0</code></p>
<p>Under <code>Channel Description</code> make a note of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timeslot</li>
<li>Hopping Channel</li>
<li>MAIO</li>
<li>HSN</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll assume you’ve already read the de-hopping section in the <a href="https://harrisonsand.com/posts/gsm-security/">previous post</a>. However, a key difference here is that we’ll export the raw bursts to a file after de-hopping them in GRC. Exporting the bursts allows us to keep things simple and use the <code>grgsm_decode</code> utility for decryption.</p>

    <figcaption><p>De-hopping traffic and exporting the bursts</p></figcaption>

<p>You’ll need to configure the blocks to match the data found in the Immediate Assignment packet, as well as a few other parameters discussed in the last post. You can download my GRC bursts example <a href="https://harrisonsand.com/posts/decrypting-gsm/grgsm_hopping_bursts.grc">here</a>.</p>
<p>After executing the flow graph, you should have a burst file to use with <code>grgsm_decode</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plaintext">grgsm_decode -b /tmp/bursts -t 1 -m SDCCH8
</code></pre></div><p>If you see a <code>Ciphering Mode Command</code> message you’ve successfully de-hopped the traffic.</p>

<p>At this point, decrypting traffic is easy. All you need to do is add the <code>-e</code> flag with the mode from the Cipher Mode Command message, and the <code>-k</code> flag with the Kc key from the SIM.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plaintext">grgsm_decode -b /tmp/bursts -t 1 -m SDCCH8 -e 3 -k AB8CE2B5B7F7477B

						<p>Add <em>fast-check</em> to your project:</p>
						<pre><code>npm install --save-dev fast-check</code></pre>
						<p>Example of integration with <em>Jest</em> or <em>Mocha</em>:</p>
						<pre><code>import * as fc from 'fast-check';

const sort = arr =&gt; arr.slice(0).sort((a,b) =&gt; a-b);

test('should order elements from the smallest to the highest', () =&gt; fc.assert(

));</code></pre>
						<p>In a nutshell:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><em>fc.assert</em> runs the property</li>
							<li><em>fc.property</em> defines the property</li>

						<p>Let's consider a simple <em>serialize</em> function, offering its users the ability to set custom settings to tweak the resulting string</p>
						<pre><code>function serialize&lt;T&gt;(instance: T, params: Parameters): string { /* code */ }</code></pre>
						<p>
							In the scenario above, an exhaustive test would have to run throughout all the possible combinations of <em>params</em> with many possible <em>instance</em>.
							An alternative to such example-based tests would be to rely on properties.
							It would offer an exhautive coverage of the possible inputs.
							Given we also have a <em>deserialize</em> function we would simply write:
						</p>
						<pre><code>test('should be able to read itself', () =&gt; fc.assert(
	fc.property(
		fc.jsonObject(),
		fc.record({
			crlf: fc.boolean(),
			indent: fc.boolean(),
			sortKeys: fc.boolean()
		}, { withDeletedKeys: true }),
		(instance, params) =&gt; {
			expect(deserialize(serialize(instance, params))).toEqual(instance);
		}
	)
));</code></pre>

					<div>
						<p>Whenever <em>fast-check</em> detects a problem, it will print an error message containing the settings required to replay the very same test</p>
						<pre><code>Error: Property failed after 1 tests (seed: 1527423434693, path: "0:0:0"): ["","",""]
Shrunk 2 time(s)
Got error: Property failed by returning false</code></pre>
						<p>
							Given this message the test can easily be replayed by using:
						</p>
						<pre><code>test('the failing test', () =&gt; fc.assert(
	fc.property(
		// some arbitraries... 
		// check method
	), { // seed and path taken from the error message
		seed: 1527423434693,
		path: "0:0:0"
	}
));</code></pre>
						<p>
							Setting both <em>seed</em> and <em>path</em> will replay the test starting with the latest failing case.
							If you want to replay the whole test suite, you should only set the <em>seed</em>
						</p>

							Whenever a test fails, <em>fast-check</em> will try to ease your investigations by providing you with the minimal failing case.
							Sometimes it is not enough and having all the failures might help.
							For this precise need, <em>fc.assert</em> accepts an optional configuration: <em>verbose: true</em>.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
<h4>What We Made</h4>
<p>Malouf Electronics ESP8266 Development Board</p>
<p><img src="https://www.maloufelectronics.com/global-assets/files/ad9072c350d0156b4d3f977706980586.jpg" alt="dev-boards-photo"></p>
<ul>
<li>High-capacity ESP8266 with 16MB flash</li>
<li>Compatible with the latest Arduino IDE/Mongoose IoT/Micropython</li>
<li>Built-in Micro-USB with CH340C chip</li>
<li>MAX232 chip with terminal block</li>
<li>Relay with terminal block ( NO/COM/NC )</li>
<li>IR blaster LED and IR receiver</li>
<li>Features red and green indicator LEDs and easily accessible GPIO pins</li>
<li>Includes terminal block for 5V power &amp; RX/TX for RS-232</li>
<li>Available for around $20 bucks on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GY2GTW5?ref=myi_title_dp">Amazon</a> </li>
</ul>
<h4>How We Got Here</h4>
<p>We work for Maloufâ„¢, a home good and sleep tech company in Logan, Utah. Our company employs about 800 people (including our team of 26 software engineers, hardware engineers, and data specialists) to create, sell, market, and distribute thousands of products. Unsurprisingly, a development board was never on our list of items to create for consumersâ€”but itâ€™s now available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GY2GTW5?ref=myi_title_dp">Amazon</a>. </p>
<p>So how did we get here? One of our teamâ€™s jobs is optimizing distribution technology at our network of six facilities (and growing). A distribution center we purchased from Toys Râ€™ Us in Midlothian, Texas came equipped with miles of conveyor belts designed to streamline the shipping and packing process, but we couldnâ€™t get the system to communicate with the technology we had.  Rather than call in outside specialists, our company decided to use the resources at handâ€”us. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.maloufelectronics.com/global-assets/files/fa39759b49db1a0c506b4d1fcccbf537.jpg" alt="over-head-scanners"></p>
<p>We set up a electronics lab in our corporate office and got to work on creating a PCB board for use in gigantic distribution centers to read barcode data from our parcels and sort the packages. But as we were building it, we realized we were creating an ideal board for makers. You can essentially use it to build whatever you want. </p>
<p>As a rule, most builders and makers have issues with the establishment. We agree, though we ironically work for a corporationâ€”albeit a cool one. Our engineering team wanted to manufacture and sell the board online and to show others how to build it by making the tech <a href="https://github.com/MaloufSleep/ME-ESP8266">open source</a>. Profit was never a goal, even though we had to pitch it to our CTO and get the company to invest on the initial order. We expected a hard no. </p>
<p>He said "Yes". </p>
<p>Today, you can buy our ESP8266 development for around $20 (which covers our costs) and use our code to simply create any program. We use a CH340C USB to serial chip, so most modern operating systems will detect and work with this board without the need to install any drivers. Our goal was creating a maker-friendly design thatâ€™s experimental, flexible, and educational. </p>
<p>Pick up a board and see what you can create today. Itâ€™s easier than you think.</p>

<p>Deep learning vision models like Inception Net achieve state-of-the-art performance on image recognition. However, I’m curious about when these models <em>don’t work well</em>. I tested Inception Net on a large number of natural images, and here is a collection of things that the model doesn’t predict well. Note: I’m only including <strong>examples where the correct class is one of the 1,000 valid ImageNet classes</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Try it Yourself</em>: Along with each example is a link to the model demo (<a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">built with Gradio</a>) where you can try the image yourself directly from the browser.</p>

<h3 id="1-upside-down-cars">1. Upside down cars</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Inception Net doesn’t recognize the <strong>car</strong> category at all when the car is upside down</li>

<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>

<p>So we’ve found some examples where Inception Net fails… so what? Well, deep learning-based image classifiers like Inception Net are believed to be highly accurate, to the point that many companies release them as APIs [1, 2, 3] designed to be used by the <em>general public</em>. The release is rarely accompanied by descriptions of <em>failure points</em> of the model, so users don’t really know when to expect the model to be reliable and when not to.</p>

<p>By simply experimenting with the model via a web interface, I found several blind spots of Inception Net: for example, objects in unusual positions (#1) or items from non-Western cultures (#3) or even images in non-standard artistic styles (#6). The Gradio library also made it easy for me try to natural image manipulations like rotations, cropping, or adding noise on my images directly through the web interface, making it easier to surface problems with the model. These failure points should be thoroughly investigated and documented so that users known when to trust deployed image recognition models.</p>

<p>It was really easy to try Inception Net with images that were accessible for me (I simply did Google Image searches or tried images from my computer). Try the model yourself (http://www.gradio.app/hub/abidlabs/inception) and let everyone know in the comments what other blindspots you find!</p>

		<p><span>Amazon recently announced the release of <span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/01/amazon-aurora-supports-postgresql-12/">Aurora PostgreSQL 12</a></span>. This announcement may have encouraged several customers to upgrade from their existing Aurora PostgreSQL 10.x or 11.x to Aurora PostgreSQL 12.4. The Community PostgreSQL 12 has been one of the greatest releases ever with a big list of features and performance optimizations. So, it </span><b>may be</b><span> fair to assume that Aurora PostgreSQL 12.4 works on the same lines.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the customers as well upgraded their Aurora PostgreSQL 11.9 environments to Aurora PostgreSQL 12.4. Indeed, testing always plays a key role before performing any upgrades. Similarly, the functional testing was done and everything seemed to be perfect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The actual issue started in less than a day after the upgrade. The performance of some queries started degrading. After taking a deeper look, it was noticed that the queries on just one of the tables started behaving badly. We then saw a very strange behaviour on Performance Insights similar to the following image. I have reproduced the same issue on Aurora PostgreSQL 12 and the following is an image from my test scenario.</span></p>

<p><span>The size of the table (fairly small) and a completely inactive database with perfectly tuned autovacuum settings should not make the vacuum process to run forever. To know the internals of autovacuum settings and how to tune it well, I would recommend read to see </span><span><a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/08/10/tuning-autovacuum-in-postgresql-and-autovacuum-internals/"><span>this blog post</span></a></span><span> I wrote sometime ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Following is the test case I have quickly created to reproduce this issue. I have created a table and created a GiST Index on one of the columns and then performed some inserts and updates in random.</span></p>
<pre>migops=&gt; CREATE TABLE foo.bar (id int PRIMARY KEY, sometext varchar(10), loc point);
CREATE TABLE
migops=&gt; CREATE INDEX gist_bar_idx ON foo.bar USING GIST (loc);

migops=&gt; INSERT INTO foo.bar VALUES (generate_series(1,100000),'migops',point '(1,2)');
INSERT 0 100000
migops=&gt; UPDATE foo.bar SET sometext = 'junk' where id between 1000 and 100000;
UPDATE 99001</pre>
<p><span>Now, let me run a VACUUM on the table and check if it’s completing successfully. </span></p>
<pre>migops=&gt; VACUUM VERBOSE foo.bar ;

VACUUM</pre>
<p><span>Yes, the above log says that the VACUUM successfully completed. However, let me insert some more data and see if VACUUM succeeds. </span></p>

<p><span>As you rightly noticed in the above logs, the VACUUM runs forever.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For a customer who runs mission critical databases, time is money. The first thought when this happened right after a Production database got upgraded was if the GiST Index got corrupted during the upgrade.&nbsp; So, the Index was rebuilt using REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY.

<pre>migops=&gt; REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY foo.gist_bar_idx;

VACUUM
Time: 53.344 ms</pre>
<p><span>As noticed in the above logs, upon rebuild of the Index, the VACUUM succeeded. Some relief for the customer running their Production clusters on Aurora PostgreSQL 12.4 that the VACUUM succeeded now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But, what about the next autovacuum ? Wait, is it stuck again ? This is what the following logs tell us. While reproducing the issue, I ran some inserts.</span></p>
<pre>migops=&gt; INSERT INTO foo.bar VALUES (generate_series(10000002,11000000), 'migops', point '(3,4)');
INSERT 0 999999

-- The following ran for more than 30 mins before me terminating it. 
migops=&gt; VACUUM VERBOSE foo.bar ;
INFO: vacuuming "foo.bar"
^CCancel request sent
ERROR: canceling statement due to user request</pre>
<p><span>So, it again requires a REINDEX of the GiST Index to let the vacuum succeed again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Conclusion :</strong> We will now need to wait and see if AWS sends any notification or a public announcement to let everybody know about this issue or maybe remove the Aurora PostgreSQL 12.4 version from the list of options to implement a fix, just like </span><span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/16/aws_aurora_postgresql_versions_disappeared/"><span>it happened earlier</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;Please subscribe to our blog posts to follow our latest updates on migrations to postgres.

      <p><strong>An exploration of threads, processes, and coroutines in Python, with interesting examples that illuminate the differences between each.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://python.hamel.dev/cpu.jpg" alt=""> Credit:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As <a href="https://hamel.dev/">a data scientist who is spending more time on software engineering</a>, I was recently forced to confront an ugly gap in my knowledge of Python: concurrency.  To be honest, I never completely understood how the terms async, threads, pools and coroutines were different and how these mechanisms could work together.  Every time I tried to learn about the subject, the examples were a bit too abstract for me, and I hard time internalizing how everything worked.</p>
<p>This changed when a friend of mine<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> recommended <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4">a live coding talk</a> by <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/">David Beazley</a>, an accomplished Python educator.</p>
<p><em>Because of restrictions with this YouTube video, I couldn’t embed <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4">the video</a> in this article, so you will have to open it in a different window</em>.</p>
<p>This talk is incredibly intimidating at first.  Not only is it coded live from scratch, but it also jumps immediately into socket programming, something that I had never encountered as a data scientist.  However, if you go through it slowly and understand all the components (as we do in this blog post) it turns out to be the best educational material on Python concurrency I have ever encountered.  This blog post documents what I learned along the way so others can benefit, too.</p>

<p>Before getting started, David sets up the following infrastructure that is used to demonstrate concurrency.</p>
<h2 id="a-cpu-bound-task-fibonacci">A cpu-bound task: Fibonacci</h2>
<p>To demonstrate concurrency, it is useful to create a task that can saturate your CPU (such as mathematical operations) for a noticeable period of time.  David uses a function that computes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci number</a>.</p>

</div>
</div><p>This function takes much longer for large inputs versus smaller inputs<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, which allows us to profile different workloads.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-web-server">A Simple Web Server</h2>
<p>A web server is one of the best ways to illustrate different types of concurrency.  However, to really demonstrate how things work it is useful to use something that is sufficiently low level enough to see how all the pieces work.  For this, David sets up a web server using socket programming.  If you aren’t familiar with socket programming, I’ll explain the important bits below, but feel free to dive deeper <a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/">with this tutorial</a> later if you like.</p>
<p>To begin with, David starts with the below code (I’ve highlighted the most interesting bits):</p>

</div>
</div><p>Here is an explanation of this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines 6-9 are socket programming boilerplate.  It’s ok to just take this for granted as a reasonable way to set up a socket server.  This also matches the <a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/">the tutorial</a> I linked to above.</li>
<li>Line 11 waits for an incoming connection from a client.  Once a connection is made, the server can begin receiving data from a client.  The code will stop execution on this line until a connection is made.</li>
<li>Line 13: Once a connection is established, the client object is passed to a function which can handle data sent by the client.</li>
<li>Line 17: waits for data to be sent by the client.  The code will stop execution on this line until data is received from the client.</li>
<li>Line 21: The server sends a response back to the client.  The code <em>could</em> stop execution on this line if the send buffers are full, but unlikely in this toy example.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above example, the server will only be able to accept a connection from a single client, because the call to <code>fib_handler</code> will never return (because it will run in an infinite loop unless a kill signal is received).  This means that <code>sock.accept()</code> can only be called once.</p>
<p>You can test this out by first running the server:</p>
<p>Then establish a client:</p>
<p>You can type numbers in <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4?t=293">as David does in his video</a> and verifies that fibonacci numbers are returned.  However, if you try to connect with another client at the same time from a different terminal session:</p>
<p>You will notice that the second client just hangs and doesn’t return anything from the server.  This is because the server is only able to accept a single connection.  Next, we explore how to tackle this issue.</p>

<p>We can solve this issue with threads.  You can add threads to the handler so that more connections can be accepted with the following code highlighted in yellow:</p>

</div><p>You can verify that this works by connecting two separate clients to the server by running the following command in two separate terminal windows:</p>
<p>By executing the <code>fib_handler</code> in a thread, the main while loop in <code>fib_server</code> will continue, allowing <code>sock.accept()</code> to receive additional clients.  If you haven’t encountered threads before <a href="https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/">this tutorial</a> provides a good introduction to the topic.</p>
<h2 id="thread-performance--the-gil">Thread performance &amp; the GIL</h2>
<p>When code stops execution and waits for an external event to occur (like a connection to be made, or data to be sent), this is often referred to as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2407589/what-does-the-term-blocking-mean-in-programming">blocking</a>.</p>
<p>One important utility of threads is that it allows blocking tasks to release control of the CPU when the CPU is not being used.  However, the Python interpreter can only run on one thread at a time due to the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Global Interpreter Lock</a>.  Because Python can only run a single thread at any given time, any CPU-bound work in threads must take turn running one after the other.</p>
<p>Therefore, you have to think carefully about what kind of tasks you execute in threads with Python.  If you try to execute CPU bound tasks, these tasks will slow each other down.  David demonstrates this with the below script that sends requests to our threaded server:</p>

</div>
</div><p>If you run several instances of this script (after starting the server first):</p>
<p>You will see the execution times for each script linearly increase as you increase the number of these scripts running in parallel.  <strong>For this particular task, adding threads does not make anything faster.  But why?</strong>  This is because the fibonacci task is CPU bound so threads will compete with each other for resources.</p>
<p>Python threads work by interleaving the execution of different tasks on your CPU.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  Only one thread runs at a time, and have the ability to take turns executing in small bits until all threads are done.  The details of how thread processing is interleaved is carried out by the GIL and your operating system, so you need not worry about this detail (with one exception mentioned below).  Interleaving a bunch of CPU bound tasks will not speed up the total runtime of those tasks.  However, if your tasks involve lots of non-CPU time, such as waiting for network connections, or disk I/O, threading tasks may result in a considerable speedup.  A canonical way of simulating a non-cpu bound task in python is to use the built-in function <code>time.sleep()</code>.</p>
<p>To check my understanding about threads and performance, I ran the below experiment<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and changed <code>time.sleep(2)</code> to <code>fib(20)</code> and back again:</p>

<![CDATA[The Most Valuable Question When Interviewing Managers]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Interviewing managers is difficult.</p>

<p>For starters, the role has high volatility. Managers can elevate a team well past what was thought possible. On the flip side, they can blow up a high-functioning team, destroying it’s magic in unrecoverable ways.</p>

<p>Second, it’s hard to fire mediocre managers. When a mediocre individual contributor leaves the company, usually they have a mediocre volume of things to transition. When a mediocre manager leaves the company, they’ll often have a bunch of plates spinning in various states of wobble. Someone has to keep those plates spinning, it’s likely going to be you, and you hired this person  because you didn’t have the time to do that well.</p>

<p>So, you want to hire a great manager. To do that you need to evaluate them on a large number of competencies - people management, process management, subject matter expertise, communication, and more. That’s a lot of ground to cover. However, my favorite question can get you a reasonable read in under 15 minutes.</p>



<p>The three most important decisions in management are hiring, firing, and promoting. Asking prospective managers how many times they’ve done each, and asking follow-up questions about their responses, gets to the heart of a manager’s competency faster than any other question I’ve tried.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-people-have-you-hired">How many people have you hired?</h2>

<p>Great managers are great recruiters. Asking someone how many people they’ve hired gets you critical information, fast. If they’ve only hired a couple people, you can’t count on this person to come in and revamp your hiring process on day 1. If they’ve hired a bunch, ask some quick followups to understand how they did it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What’s your offer acceptance rate? Where do you want it to be?</li>
  <li>What’s your top source for top-of-funnel pipeline?</li>
  <li>How do you make sure you’re counteracting bias in the hiring process?</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest red flag for this question is if someone acts like hiring is easy. That’s a sure-fire way to know that they have no idea how to hire top talent.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-people-have-you-fired">How many people have you fired?</h2>

<p>Firing is a gut-wrenching, stressful, angst-inducing, and essential function of a manager.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, most effective managers have fired around 1 out of every 7-10 people they’ve ever managed. Proportions much lower than that start to raise concerns that this candidate has had issues effectively performance managing. Ask follow-ups to understand anomalous report:firing ratios.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if a candidate has only managed a few people and never had to fire someone, then you’ve gotten the signal that it’s something you’ll need to help them with if and when the time comes. You can also avoid accidentally giving a manager with no firing experience a report with material performance issues.</p>

<p>The biggest red flag for this question is anyone is if someone acts like firing is anything besides a life-changing event that requires the utmost seriousness and attention.</p>



<p>Growing your team is an essential manager function. Promotions are also a rough proxy for the effectiveness of your team. Great managers should have promoted a significant proportion of their team and have clear examples of how they helped their team advance their career. For someone in a role for more than a couple years, a good quick response to this question is “most of the team”.</p>

<p>The biggest red flag for this question is multi-year management stints with very low promotion counts. Dive into that signal to uncover if it was happenstance, a faulty reward mechanism, or a failure in team execution.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>You should be able to get through this three-part question in under 15 minutes. By the end of it you’ll have a quick but useful read on the candidate’s ability to hire, fire, and promote effectively. A nice benefit of this rapid-fire discovery is that it explores the candidate’s ability to communicate effectively when concise information is needed.</p>

<![CDATA[Write HTML, Not JavaScript]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I don't hate it, I just hate overuse of it</p>

<p>If there's one thing we can all appreciate about the rise of <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMSTACK</a>, is that it brought about renewed vigor even amongst the mainstream for <em>static</em> built and deployed websites.</p>
<p>This is a good thing. The web has become increasingly bloated for various reasons, and along with that we've also seen increasingly complex websites/apps that put ever increasing load on the server, in terms of those that dwell sorely server-side. With static generated websites being back in vogue since, I dunno, 2016 or so, we've seen more and more pure HTML and CSS being deployed that only do (or connect to) server stuff when they have to, instead of the server itself being responsible for spitting out the HTML and CSS. A healthy bit of Separation of Concerns, if you will.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, somehow this has also led to websites being increasingly written in and depending on JavaScript (JS). Entire JavaScript frameworks have risen (almost too many to count nowadays) and become incredibly popular. I wish I were joking, but it's even fairly common to write HTML (or even CSS) <em>inside</em> JavaScript. Even one of the more sane JS driven frameworks, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, tends to save all the HTML and CSS (well, if the CSS is written inline in the HTML anyway) inside the JavaScript bundles. When coupled with it's sister project, <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a>, which allows you to actually generate a static website, this is especially awkward as you have both static pages AND a copy of all the HTML and CSS in the <code>.js</code> bundle files as well. Hello bloat.</p>
<p>For mine, JavaScript has its place. To assist with rudimentary actions or effects on a webpage, or to do a little bit dynamic fetching of data (ala AJAX, as long as it has <em>graceful degraduation</em>). But having a website that could otherwise be written completely statically, instead pulling in hundreds of kilobytes just to "hydrate" the interface and create a kind of "SPA" (Single Page Application) feel...? I don't know, but it seems a little insane.</p>
<p>I know this because I myself once fell victim to the hype and wrote a website that was for all intents and purposes, a normal website. A home page, about section, a few other pages related to the business it was for. I did this with the aforementioned Sapper/Svelte combination. Now, the only really dynamic part of this website was a quotation form, i.e it took user input and generated a quotation of item costs, and then the user could choose to proceed (or not) in which case the system would send an email.</p>
<p>The quotation portion of the site could have been done in, at the very least, just a small Svelte component, accessed only when and IF the user wanted to get a quotation. Instead, no, old mate Andy here decided to build the entire website in Sapper instead. What Sapper does is, at compile time, builds the site and generates the <code>.js</code> bundle files, and also crawls the urls inside the site to generate a static version of the site as well. So you get a combination of good old <code>.html</code> files, that has links to the bundle files in the footer of the HTML which then loads and "hydrates" the interface, therefore handing off routing responsibility etc to the Sapper engine instead of letting the browser follow the URLs and loading say, <code>about.html</code> in it's entirety. This is meant to give that instant loading "app feel". It's nothing new, developers have been using AJAX to achieve similar effects for years, but projects like Sapper/Svelte exist to try make development faster and less fiddly.</p>
<p>Which is noble enough, and I'm not here to bag out Svelte or Sapper. Or even React, even though I find its syntax abhorrent. These projects exist for a reason and can have legitimate use. And of course there is the whole inbuilt "react-ivity" aspect that all three of the projects I just mentioned tout. The problem is impressionable or inexperienced developers, or just plain Soydevs, coming along and using these frameworks for what may be essentially brochure-style websites, instead of say a mobile application. That's pretty crazy, and that's how you get websites pulling in hundreds of kilobytes of JS on top of already existing static HTML/CSS to basically give a slightly faster response and a smooth transition maybe between pages. However, that's after the website potentially takes twice as long to load initially. </p>
<p>Then there's what I'll call technical-debt. That site I mentioned that I made with Sapper? It'll be one heck of a job pulling it apart and converting it to normal HTML/CSS. I essentially created a bit of vendor lock-in for a site that should never have needed to be that complicated or bloated. Lesson learned.</p>
<p>So, <em>TL;DR</em>: If we're going to encourage a more static web, let's write actual static websites rather than deferring it all to JavaScript. Use JS where necessary, but no more than that. if you have to ask yourself, <em>"should I really need JavaScript just to do this?"</em>, then you probably don't.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> <a href="https://pyodide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Pyodide</a> takes time to initialize.
Initialization completion is indicated by a red border around <em>Run all</em> button.</p>


<p>The <em>Earley</em> parsing algorithm was invented by Jay Earley <sup id="fnref:earley1970an" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:earley1970an">1</a></sup> in 1970. It
can be used to parse strings that conform to a context-free grammar. The
algorithm uses a chart for parsing – that is, it is implemented as a dynamic
program relying on solving simpler sub-problems.</p>

<p>Earley parsers are very appealing for a practitioner because they can use any
context-free grammar for parsing a string, and from the parse forest generated,
one can recover all (even an infinite number) of parse trees that correspond to
the given grammar. Unfortunately, this style of parsing pays for generality by
being slightly expensive. It takes \(O(n^3)\) time to parse in the worst case.
However, if the grammar is unambiguous, it can parse in \(O(n^2)\) time, and
all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser">LR(k)</a> grammars in linear time<sup id="fnref:leo1991a" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:leo1991a">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is an implementation of Earley parsing that handles the epsilon case as
given by Aycock et al.<sup id="fnref:aycock2002practical" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:aycock2002practical">3</a></sup> as well as Leo’s optimizations<sup id="fnref:leo1991a:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:leo1991a">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For a much more complete implementation and
full recovery of parsing forests using iterative solutions,
see our parsing implementation in the <a href="https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Parser.html">fuzzingbook</a>
(See the solved exercises). A very detailed explanation of Earley parsing is
by <a href="https://loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/earley-parsing/">Loup Vaillant</a>.
Further, a fast industrial strength Earley parser implementation is
<a href="https://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/">Marpa</a>.</p>

<p>For this post, we use the following terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>alphabet</em> is the set all of symbols in the input language. For example,
in this post, we use all ASCII characters as alphabet.</li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>terminal</em> is a single alphabet symbol. Note that this is slightly different
from usual definitions (done here for ease of parsing). (Usually a terminal is
a contiguous sequence of symbols from the alphabet. However, both kinds of
grammars have a one to one correspondence, and can be converted easily.)</p>

    <p>For example, <code>x</code> is a terminal symbol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>nonterminal</em> is a symbol outside the alphabet whose expansion is <em>defined</em>
in the grammar using <em>rules</em> for expansion.</p>

    <p>For example, <code>&lt;term&gt;</code> is a nonterminal in the below grammar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>rule</em> is a finite sequence of <em>terms</em> (two types of terms: terminals and
nonterminals) that describe an expansion of a given terminal.</p>

    <p>For example, <code>[&lt;term&gt;+&lt;expr&gt;]</code> is one of the expansion rules of the nonterminal <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>definition</em> is a set of <em>rules</em> that describe the expansion of a given nonterminal.</p>

    <p>For example, <code>[[&lt;digit&gt;,&lt;digits&gt;],[&lt;digit&gt;]]</code> is the definition of the nonterminal <code>&lt;digits&gt;</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>context-free grammar</em> is  composed of a set of nonterminals and 
corresponding definitions that define the structure of the nonterminal.</p>

    <p>The grammar given below is an example context-free grammar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A terminal <em>derives</em> a string if the string contains only the symbols in the
terminal. A nonterminal derives a string if the corresponding definition
derives the string. A definition derives the  string if one of the rules in
the definition derives the string. A rule derives a string if the sequence
of terms that make up the rule can derive the string, deriving one substring 
after another contiguously (also called parsing).</p>
  </li>
  <li>A <em>derivation tree</em> is an ordered tree that describes how an input string is
derived by the given start symbol. Also called a <em>parse tree</em>.</li>
  <li>A derivation tree can be collapsed into its string equivalent. Such a string
can be parsed again by the nonterminal at the root node of the derivation
tree such that at least one of the resulting derivation trees would be the
same as the one we started with.</li>
</ul>

<p>As before, we use the <a href="https://www.fuzzingbook.org/">fuzzingbook</a> grammar style.
Here is an example grammar for arithmetic expressions, starting at <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>.
A terminal symbol has exactly one character
(Note that we disallow empty string (<code>''</code>) as a terminal symbol).
Secondly, as per traditional implementations,
there can only be one expansion rule for the <code>&lt;start&gt;</code> symbol. We work around
this restriction by simply constructing as many charts as there are expansion
rules, and returning all parse trees.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>An Earley parser executes the following steps for parsing:</p>

<p>Use <code>&lt;start&gt;</code> as the entry into parsing. At this point, we want to parse the
given string by the nonterminal <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>. The <em>definition</em> of <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>
contains the possible expansion rule that can match the given string. Each
expansion rule can be thought of as a <em>parsing path</em>, with contiguous
substrings of the given input string matched by the particular terms in the
rule.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When given a nonterminal to match the string, the essential idea is to
get the rules in the definition, and add them to the current set of
parsing paths to try with the given string. Within the parsing path, we have
a parsed index which denotes the progress of parsing that particular path
(i.e the point till which the string until now has been recognized by that
path, and any parents of this path). When a rule is newly added, this parsed
index is set to zero.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We next look at our set of possible parsing paths, and check if any of these
paths start with a nonterminal. If one is found, then for that parsing path to
be completed with the given string, that nonterminal has to be recognized
first. So, we add the expansion rules corresponding to that nonterminal to the
list of possible parsing paths. We do this recursively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, examine the current letter in the input. Then select all parsing paths
that have that particular letter at the parsed index. These expressions can
now advance one step to the next index. We add such parsing paths to the
set of parsing paths to try for the next character.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While doing this, any parsing paths have finished parsing, fetch its
corresponding nonterminal and advance all parsing paths that have that
nonterminal at the parsing index.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue recursively until the parsing path corresponding to <code>&lt;start&gt;</code> has
finished.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The chart parser depends on a chart (a table) for parsing. The columns
correspond to the characters in the input string. Each column represents a set
of <em>states</em>, and corresponds to the legal rules to follow from that point on.</p>

<p>Say we start with the following grammar:</p>

<!--

sample_grammar = {
    '<start>': [['<A>','<B>']],
    '<A>': [['a', '<B>', 'c'], ['a', '<A>']],
    '<B>': [['b', '<C>'], ['<D>']],
    '<C>': [['c']],
    '<D>': [['d']]
}
-->

<form name="python_run_form">
<br>
<pre name="python_output"></pre>

</form>

<p>Earley parser produces a table of possible parse paths at each letter index of
the table. Given an input <code>adcd</code>, we seed the column <code>0</code>  with:</p>



<p>where the <code>|</code> represents the parsing index (also called the dot). This indicates
that we are at the starting, and the next step is to identify <code>&lt;A&gt;</code>. After this
rule is processed, the column would contain two more states</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   &lt;A&gt;: | a &lt;B&gt; &lt;c&gt;
   &lt;A&gt;: | a &lt;A&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which represents two parsing paths to complete <code>&lt;A&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>After processing of column <code>0</code> (which corresponds to input character <code>a</code>), we
would find the following in column <code>1</code> (which corresponds to the input character <code>b</code>)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   &lt;A&gt;: a | &lt;B&gt; c
   &lt;A&gt;: a | &lt;A&gt;
   &lt;B&gt;: | b &lt;C&gt;
   &lt;B&gt;: | &lt;D&gt;
   &lt;A&gt;: | a &lt;B&gt; c
   &lt;A&gt;: | a &lt;A&gt;
   &lt;D&gt;: | d
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, the next column (column <code>2</code> corresponding to <code>d</code>) would contain the following.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   &lt;D&gt;: | d
   &lt;B&gt;: &lt;D&gt; |
   &lt;A&gt;: a &lt;B&gt; | c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, column <code>3</code> corresponding to <code>c</code> would contain:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>   &lt;A&gt;: a &lt;B&gt; c |
   &lt;start&gt;: &lt;A&gt; | &lt;B&gt;
   &lt;B&gt;: | &lt;b&gt; &lt;C&gt;
   &lt;B&gt;: | &lt;D&gt;
   &lt;D&gt;: | d
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, column <code>4</code> (<code>d</code>) would contain this at the end of processing.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>   &lt;D&gt;: d |
   &lt;B&gt;: &lt;D&gt; |
   &lt;start&gt;: &lt;A&gt; &lt;B&gt; |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is how the table or the chart – from where the parsing gets its name: chart parsing – gets filled.</p>

<h2 id="column">Column</h2>

<p>The column contains a set of states. Each column corresponds
to a character (or a token if tokens are used).
Note that the states in a column corresponds to the parsing expression that will
occur once that character has been read. That is, the first column will
correspond to the parsing expression when no characters have been read.</p>

<p>The column allows for adding states, and checks to prevent duplication of
states. Why do we need to prevent duplication? The problem is left recursion.
We need to detect and curtail left recursion, which is indicated by non-unique
states.</p>

<form name="python_run_form">
<br>
<pre name="python_output"></pre>

</form>

<h2 id="state">State</h2>

<p>A state represents a parsing path (which corresponds to the nonterminal, and the
expansion rule that is being followed) with the current parsed index. 
Each state contains the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name: The nonterminal that this rule represents.</li>
  <li>expr: The rule that is being followed</li>
  <li>dot:  The point till which parsing has happened in the rule.</li>
  <li>s_col: The starting point for this rule.</li>
  <li>e_col: The ending point for this rule.</li>
</ul>

<form name="python_run_form">
<br>
<pre name="python_output"></pre>

</form>

<p>The convenience methods <code>finished()</code>, <code>advance()</code> and <code>at_dot()</code> should be
self explanatory. For example,</p>

<!--
############
nt_name = '<B>'
nt_expr = tuple(sample_grammar[nt_name][1])
col_0 = Column(0, None)
a_state = State(nt_name, tuple(nt_expr), 0, col_0)
print(a_state.at_dot())
############
-->

<form name="python_run_form">
<br>
<pre name="python_output"></pre>

</form>

<p>That is, the next symbol to be parsed is <code>&lt;D&gt;</code>, and if we advance it,</p>

<!--
############
b_state = a_state.advance()
print(b_state)
print(b_state.finished())
############
-->

<form name="python_run_form">
<br>
<pre name="python_output"></pre>

</form>

<h2 id="parser">Parser</h2>

<p>We start with a bare minimum interface for a parser. It should allow one
to parse a given text using a given nonterminal (which should be present in
the grammar).</p>

<form name="python_run_form">
<br>
<pre name="python_output"></pre>

</form>

<p>We now initialize the Earley parser, which is a parser.</p>

<form name="python_run_form">
<br>
<pre name="python_output"></pre>

</form>

<h4 id="nullable">Nullable</h4>

<p>Earley parser handles <em>nullable</em> nonterminals separately. A nullable
nonterminal is a nonterminal that can derive an empty string. That is
at least one of the expansion rules must derive an empty string. An
expansion rule derives an empty string if <em>all</em> of the tokens can
derive the empty string. This means no terminal symbols (assuming we
do not have zero width terminal symbols), and all nonterminal symbols
can derive empty string.</p>

<p>In this implementation, we first initialize the list of first level
nullable nonterminals that contain an empty expansion. That is, they
directly derive the empty string.
Next, we remove any expansion rule that contains a token as these
expansion rules will not result in empty strings. Next, we start with
our current list of nullable nonterminals, take one at a time, and
remove them from the current expansion rules. If any expansion rule
becomes empty, the corresponding nonterminal is added to the nullable
nonterminal list. This continues until all nullable nonterminals
are processed.</p></article></div></div></div></div>

          <p>In this paper, we will provide a brief description of what SSM Session Manager is and how it compares to Teleport privileged access management solution. We’ll compare the significant design and feature differences and the operational overhead of the solutions. Because Session Manager is limited to AWS, we’ll limit the scope of the discussion to that cloud provider. Finally, we have provided a feature matrix of the two solutions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>In my RSS reader, I came across the article <a href="https://www.38north.org/2021/02/new-life-for-the-third-network/">New Life for the Third
Network</a> on
the North Korea analysis blog 38 North. I've always been interested in this
system because it is an unusual broadcast technology, and it seems it might
remain relevant as Kim Jong Un has apparently called for the apparently
dilapidated system to be repaired and expanded. What I'm saying is that I don't
just write about obsolete technology, but also foreign policy, apparently.</p>
<p>Anyway, onto the obscure technology. If you're not familiar, the "Third
Broadcast"[1] is a wired radio system installed in at least some cities in
North Korea. Rumors about the system abound, but I will try to stay to facts,
which there are very few of. The system is evidently operated in a similar
fashion to a radio network with central programming produced in Pyongyang with
various slots filled in with programming produced at a regional or local level.
The "receiver" consists of a speaker unit with a volume knob that usually seems
to be plugged into a socket on the wall, but might sometimes be hardwired (or
the plug concealed behind in a recess socket). There is only one channel, so
the volume control is all you need.</p>
<p>Technically, one wonders, what exactly is "wired radio?" Well, there are
various systems that have been referred to as "wired radio" or "wired
broadcast". The term is usually reserved for systems that do not function by
transmitting RF into a coaxial cable, because, well, we usually just call that
cable. Instead, "wired radio" systems usually don't involve "radio" at all but
just directly put the modulated signal onto a wire.</p>
<p>From what little I have been able to figure out, my guess is that North Korea's
example is basically a large-scale 70v audio system. High-voltage audio systems
are fairly common in commercial overhead paging and some sound reinforcement
applications. Basically, the low voltage and high current produced by a
conventional audio amplifier requires a very large-gauge wire to span long
distances without significant loss, and large-gauge wires are expensive. If you
want to install, say, in-ceiling PA speakers throughout a building, you can
save money by using a special paging amplifier which produces a high voltage
and low current.</p>
<p>Typically in these systems the speakers are just normal four or eight ohm
speakers, but each one has a transformer mounted to it that converts the
high-voltage audio to low-voltage at higher current for the speaker coil. You
can also fit the individual speaker with a volume control using a simple
potentiometer, although since paging systems are not usually meant to be
adjusted "on the fly" this isn't especially common, with it being more common
for there to be multiple taps on the amplifier or an internal adjustment knob
so that the installer can do a one-time adjustment for roughly equal loudness
throughout a room [2].</p>
<p>There are a couple of different conventions for these systems, but by far the
most common is 70 volt. For a large-scale system like that in North Korea,
they may use 110 volt, which is also used in some commercial buildings. I'm not
sure how exactly this scales up to a city, do they use yet a higher voltage for
longer distances with neighborhood step-down transformers? In any case,
high-voltage audio is a well understood, commercially available technology
that would be quite consistent with what I've seen of the North Korean system.</p>
<p>That's not to say that I'm sure this is the case. There are other ways of
distributing audio over large areas. The Muzak company, for example, got its
start by distributing background music to clients using a wired network. As I
understand it, the first implementation of Muzak used leased telephone lines
(presumably "toll quality" lines for better audio) to get the sound to each
building, where there was an amplifier to high-voltage audio for the building's
speakers. This was done at a time when recorded music was not common, so the
background music in large stores was sometimes actually a live performance---
just performed elsewhere. North Korea might use a similar arrangement to feed
neighborhood amplifiers.</p>
<p>My assumption that North Korea uses a high-voltage audio system rather than a
low-level signal distribution network is due to the fact that the radios are
only connected to a single socket. They don't seem to require power for
amplification, so the audio must arrive already amplified. I'm not aware of
any good way to do this other than high-voltage audio.</p>
<p>So, is there any other interest I can eek out of high-voltage audio? Of course!
Another common application of high-voltage audio technology, which is basically
just a special case of paging, is audio masking systems. These are typically
used in facilities where sensitive discussions occur in order to prevent
eavesdropping, and vary in sophistication. A therapist's office might use a
simple white noise machine to prevent casual eavesdropping from the waiting
room, while a facility housing corporate or government secrets might use a
wide-area sound masking system intended to be resistant against technical
surveillance. These larger-scale sound masking systems are often essentially
just 70-volt PAs used to broadcast white noise, but the "speaker" designs
tend to be a little more eccentric.</p>
<p>That's because high-end sound masking systems often use transducers coupled
directly to surfaces in order to prevent the capture of audio from the surface
by mechanical or optical means. That means, for example, an audio transducer
adhered to each windowpane which vibrates the windowpane with white noise in a
way that is minimally audible to humans but should be overwhelming to a laser
reflection listening technique. Atlas Sound is a major manufacturer of
these high-end systems and their products run surprisingly cheap on eBay, I
have a TSCM-grade sound masking unit under the bed because I think it helps me
sleep, or at least improves the security of my dreams. They also manufacturer
sound masking speakers intended for use in air ducts, plenum spaces,
transduction to doors and walls, etc. Putting Muzak into such a system might
have an amusing result, as all these untuned surfaces would probably rattle and
resonate in horrifying ways.</p>
<p>A similar wired radio system to North Korea's existed in the Soviet Union,
which might give the impression that wired radio is limited to troubled
Communist states. That's not entirely true, but it is certainly more attractive
to embattled regimes because it has the property of being extremely difficult
to intercept or disrupt (jam) compared to broadcast radio. That said, there
have been other wired radio schemes with little to do with state propaganda.
Well, depending on what you think of the BBC, I suppose.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the other cases of a "wired radio" technology I am aware of is
the television system in Kingston upon Hull, England. As I understand it, the
mid-sized city of Hull is built on geography that made television reception
extremely uneven---too many hills and gulches for good coverage. In the 1930s,
a company called Broadcast Relay Service operated "piped TV" so that Hull
residents could get their television without struggling with reception. This
might sound like it's just cable television, and conceptually it's about the
same, but the implementation was quite different.</p>
<p>Broadcast Relay, later called Rediffusion, actually used sets of twisted pairs,
one to carry each channel. A specially equipped television had a switch box
that connected a different pair to the CRT depending on which channel you
wanted to watch. This was perhaps technically simpler, but less scalable, than
cable television. The scalability problem would not have been evident at the
time, because there were very few television channels in the UK, very far into
the modern day. My recollection is that a typical Broadcast Relay switch box
supported four channels.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, post-war, Broadcast Relay rebranded as Rediffusion and
went into the radio business---wired radio. They operated an audio-only service
nearly identical to the Third Broadcast, except that homes were connected with
multiple pairs for multiple channels. They expanded into various British
colonies and other UK cities, and transitioned more into the television and
radio rental business... This sounds odd to a US audience, but apparently in
the UK it was very common to rent your television and radio.</p>
<p>Of course, by the '70s these wired services had become uncompetitive with the
improved broadcast technology and Rediffusion went the way of history, trying
out a variety of diversified businesses that never caught on.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any successful wired radio services in the US for general
public consumption, although I would not be at all surprised to learn of one.
Similar technology was widely used in the US but generally for background music
applications, as in the case of Muzak. Many of these services transitioned over
time to other, less-expensive distribution networks like FM subcarrier,
mailed-out recorded tapes, and satellite. Of course, today, I assume most
background music is done by IP, but I bet there's still at least one chain
that uses a hired satellite transponder to distribute music to their stores.</p>
<p>Earlier in the history of telecom, it was typical for major cities to have
dedicated wiring run to major businesses for all sorts of specific purposes.
Over time, most of these systems moved to leased telephone lines, then to
dialed telephone lines, and onto the internet. This could be viewed as the
long-term component of the trend of "over the top" or OTT services. Today we
talk about telephone and television being OTTd onto internet services, but
post World War II they were basically talking about OTTing background music
and fire detection onto the telephone system.</p>
<p>And perhaps that leads to another topic: in the not too far future, I will talk
about fire telegraphs and their function as perhaps the earliest urban-scale</p></article></div>

	<div>
		<article>
			<p>If you read articles on career development in software, you’ll already know there are many things a senior engineer is not. They are not, for instance, just someone with ten years of experience. They are not just someone who maintains a popular open source project. They are not just someone who wrote the initial prototype for their company’s flagship product.</p>

<p>Instead, senior engineers possess many disparate skills, the exact composition of which varies from author to author. These laundry lists are <a href="https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/">detailed</a>, <a href="https://frontside.io/blog/2016-07-07-the-conjoined-triangles-of-senior-level-development/">nuanced</a>, and typically leave the reader feeling as if they have a long way to go.</p>

<p>Empirically, though, there are many people who have the title “senior engineer” who do not possess all these skills. Unless all of them can be explained by title inflation or poor management, this is a serious disconnect with reality. We have to treat these articles as aspirational: a description of the industry as it should be. For someone wanting to make a significant, recognized impact on their company, today, these articles are more distracting than helpful.</p>

<p>Senior engineers reduce risk, in every sense. Often, “risk” is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn’t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company’s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.</p>

<h3 id="senior-engineers-affect-the-larger-system">senior engineers affect the larger system</h3>

<p>Most startups die because they build the wrong product. The core risks are rarely technical; if no one wants the product, building it well won’t change the outcome. The most important thing an engineer can do during this time is either speed up the search, or narrow the search space. Building prototypes, gaining domain expertise, and generating metrics all lower the chance the company will run out of money.</p>

<p>Once a company finds product-market fit, the risks change. The product has to work, scale, and easily adapt to anything learned by the customer-facing employees. New users introduce technical risk but, more importantly, new hires introduce risk into the company’s processes and culture. If the company can’t make new hires productive, it will collapse under the weight of its payroll.</p>

<p>The software will need to be broken into manageable pieces, or else new engineers will need to hold the entire growing system in their head to be productive. Where before there may have been one engineer who handled “talking to customers”, the planning process may now need to include salespeople. Above all, each new hire dilutes any clarity that existed around what the company values, and what it doesn’t. Left alone, the company will become whatever people were used to at their last job.</p>

<p>As the company continues to grow, any new project will require collaboration across teams. After a few projects get delayed because of one missing piece, the leadership will start to value predictable results above all else. Processes will be established, recurring “sync” meetings will be scheduled. Variance in productivity, above or below the mean, will be minimized. The largest risk is perceived to be a small component which is never completed, obviating all the other related work. In this environment, a senior engineer is an engineer who works within the processes, and even refines them, to ensure reliable output.</p>

<p>This narrative arc describes the average growing software startup, but no company is exactly average. The precise risks will vary depending on who founded the company, what it does, and who they hire. The senior engineers may reduce risk deliberately, or simply have the right skill set at the right time. A fresh graduate with the right domain expertise can have a huge impact on the larger system without ever understanding it.</p>

<h3 id="senior-engineers-find-leverage">senior engineers find leverage</h3>

<p>Impact can be serendipitous, but the greatest impact comes from a deliberate attempt to effect change with the least effort. If production is unstable, precluding a common failure mode will have a more immediate impact than volunteering for pager duty. If the company is rapidly hiring, improving and standardizing interview practices will have a broader impact than conducting a dozen phone screens every week. If there are any junior engineers, spending an hour to talk over unfamiliar topics will have a longer lasting impact than writing more code.</p>

<p>Where possible, solving the general form of any problem is preferable to solving a single instance. However, this is only possible if the problem space is well understood. Premature abstraction, in code or elsewhere, introduces risk. If the failure modes in production are poorly understood, volunteering for pager duty may be the only way to really help.</p>

<h3 id="senior-engineers-are-storytellers">senior engineers are storytellers</h3>

<p>Most risks, especially where managed effectively, never come to pass. For this reason, it’s often impossible to tell the difference between real risk and perceived risk. By the same token, it can be difficult to tell the difference between real impact and perceived impact. If a senior engineer identifies a significant risk, they have to be able to concisely explain and prioritize it for a non-expert audience.</p>

<p>Some see this as a form of corporate politics; a skilled storyteller can protect their company from non-existent risks, and be seen as a hero. But the fact that storytelling can be misused doesn’t make it invalid, just something that should be approached with a critical eye.</p>

<h3 id="senior-engineers-choose-companies-with-the-right-risks">senior engineers choose companies with the right risks</h3>

<p>Every company has different risks, and so every company expects something different from their senior engineers. An engineer who has spent the last five years making small, continuous improvements to the processes in a larger company may not enjoy or even understand the sort of role expected by a three person startup. The expectation that “senior” is a fungible title is both widespread and harmful, leading to unrealistic expectations from both engineers and companies.</p>

<p>Through trial and error, engineers can identify the sorts of problems they enjoy solving. A senior engineer should find a company which both has those problems, and knows it. Anything else will lead to frustration, and eventually apathy.</p>

<p>Likewise, companies should try to communicate their risks, early and often. If we were to judge by what’s asked in interviews, most companies believe their only risks are technical, but that’s absurd. The interviewers know the real problems facing the company, but the polite fiction is that they’re only temporary, and soon everyone will be able to focus entirely on the algorithms, which are what really matter. Since most companies tell the same story, candidates have to read between the lines to see if there’s a good fit. Honesty would make things much simpler.</p>

<h3 id="senior-engineers-know-titles-dont-mean-much">senior engineers know titles don’t mean much</h3>

<p>Without context, knowing someone was a “senior engineer” tells you almost nothing. Titles can matter a lot in some environments, but in those cases titles are just another tool for reducing risk; if being a senior, or staff, or principal engineer is the only way to make your voice heard, then pursuing those titles is worthwhile. More often, though, it’s just a distraction.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I frequently get asked about breaking into product management. Instead of continuing to share top-of-mind thoughts on a one-off basis I decided it’d be worth writing down my thoughts and sharing them more broadly. So here’s my advice:</p><h2 id="stand-out-from-the-crowd">Stand Out From the Crowd</h2><p>There are a lot of people with general business, marketing, or operations backgrounds trying to break into product management. It’s helpful to differentiate yourself to stand out from the crowd. Below are some ideas:</p><ul><li>Learn how to code</li><li>Work on a side project <!-- -->[1]</li><li>Create product teardowns of companies you’re interested in <!-- -->[2]</li><li>Learn how to use Figma, UXPin, Adobe XD, Balsamiq, or Moqups to express product ideas</li><li>Learn how to perform user research and run an informal study for a company you want to work at</li><li>Learn SQL to analyze data</li></ul><p>There are many existing product managers, developers, and designers applying to Product Manager roles, which can make it harder for someone with no directly relevant experience to break into product management. In addition to Product Manager roles, be on the lookout for:</p><ul><li>Entry level “Associate Product Manager” roles</li><li>Tangentially related roles at a small company that will let you take on product management responsibilities <!-- -->[3]</li></ul><h2 id="be-honest-with-your-strengths--weaknesses">Be Honest With Your Strengths &amp; Weaknesses</h2><p>Don’t worry if you don’t have all the skills “needed” to be a product manager. Product management can mean a million things depending on team dynamics and company stage.</p><p>There are a myriad of skill sets that can be useful for a product manager: technical background, design chops, being data driven, user research, communication, collaboration, strategic thinking, prioritization, project management, business literacy, etc. I’ve met very few people who are above average in 75%+ of these areas. So don’t worry if you’re not an expert in all these areas either! Instead, be honest with your strengths and weaknesses. Both to yourself and to others. It will help make sure there is good alignment between what you’re good at and what the company needs.</p><p>In addition to being upfront about your strengths and weaknesses, be clear about the areas you’re actively working on and excited to improve. Humility and eagerness to learn are very positive traits for aspiring PMs — or anyone for that matter.</p><h2 id="know-what-youre-getting-yourself-into">Know What You’re Getting Yourself Into</h2><p>Make sure you’re excited about product management for the right reasons. I meet a lot of people excited about product management because they envision themselves spending all their time making strategic product decisions, being the one who comes up with all the new ideas, and having authority to make all the calls. However, if you’re breaking into product management it’s likely you will be spending a lot of time doing somewhat less appealing work at first (project management, helping out with whatever is needed, etc). Even after your PM career has gotten off the ground, many of the best PMs I know continue to focus on these types of activities throughout their career. Noah Weiss, Head of Search, Learning, &amp; Intelligence at Slack, does a great job of debunking common PM myths in <a href="https://medium.com/@noah_weiss/five-dangerous-myths-about-product-management-d1d852ed02a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this blog post</a>.</p><p>If you’re not excited about doing a lot of the grunt work and facilitating other people, product management may not be the right role for you.</p><hr><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>📣 <strong> Feb 2021 Update</strong></p><p>My top resource

February 15, 2021 | https://www.larswander.com/posts/plotter-heatmaps.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.larswander.com/posts/plotter-heatmaps.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" href="#maincontent">
    <p><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#plotter">Pen plots</a> can fail
for a variety of reasons: a pen can run out of ink, paper can be misaligned,
the <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#pen-lift-servo">servo</a>
lifting the pen can break… but the most nailbiting is watching the plotter
repeatedly cover the same spot in ink until the page tears!</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.larswander.com/assets/images/heatmaps/failed-plot.webp" alt="Plot with torn paper">
  <figcaption>Circled in red you can see where the paper tore while plotting
  this pattern. Bits of ink-laden paper trail the pen's path leaving the tear;
  the result is an ugly plot!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s not easy to know when a plot will wind up tearing your paper. In fact,
looking at the <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="https://www.larswander.com/posts/rendered-preview">rendered preview</a> for the above plot shows a lot of
closely-drawn lines, but only one spot on the page actually winds up tearing:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.larswander.com/assets/images/heatmaps/source-plot.webp" alt="Rendered plot showing where paper tore">
  <figcaption>Circled in red is the spot that winds up tearing. But why only
  this spot? There are many places on the page that are completely
  black from the many lines that are rendered, but they don't tear.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, looking at the rendered plot is not enough to know
if it will tear or not. We’ll need some extra tools to point out these
problematic areas.</p>



<p>The first step to solving this problem is simply knowing how many lines are
being drawn over the same point. If we can pinpoint “hotspots” on the plot, we
can guess where a plot will tear.</p>

<p>Since the tip of the pen has a non-zero width, it’s not as simple as
calculating where the most line segments intersect – we also need to account
for line segments that are close to one another as ink can bleed between
strokes.</p>

<p>An imperfect, but totally workable solution is to divide our plot into <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#square-size">1x1mm squares</a>, and
then record the squares each line segment covers.
See an example for a single line segment:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.larswander.com/assets/images/heatmaps/bresenham.svg" alt="Bresenham line drawing algorithm visualized">
  <figcaption>Depicted: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm">Bresenham's
    line drawing algorithm</a>. Image credit:
    <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Crotalus_horridus">Crotalus
    Horridus</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This approach of finding the “squares” (i.e. pixels) that a line crosses
over is similar to what your computer does to render lines onto your computer 
screen.  There’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_drawing_algorithm">quite a few
approaches</a>, each
with tradeoffs in accuracy, speed, and simplicity. I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm">Bresenham’s
algorithm</a> works
just fine for my purposes.</p>



<p>Once we know how often each individual 1x1mm square is drawn over, we can turn
that information into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map">heatmap</a>.
Rendering the same plot from above using this approach shows us exactly where
the plot tore!</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.larswander.com/assets/images/heatmaps/source-heatmap.webp" alt="Heatmap showing point where paper will tear">
  <figcaption>The color scale goes from blue (no lines) to red (most lines).
  In this case, red corresponds to 74 lines in a single 1x1mm square (see legend
  in the bottom left). Notice it lines up exactly with where the plot tore!
  </figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Having these heatmaps has been enough to avoid surprise page tears, but there
are a few ways to take this further that I haven’t explored yet:</p>

<h2 id="automatically-preventing-page-tears">Automatically preventing page tears</h2>

<p>We could use this heatmap approach to automatically remove line
segments in very crowded parts of the plot. I don’t know how easy this will be
to do without introducing unintended artifacts, though.</p>

<h2 id="experimenting-with-papers-pens-inks-etc">Experimenting with papers, pens, inks, etc…</h2>

<p>It could be interesting to run some experiments to find out exactly when certain
kinds of paper will tear. I have a hunch that the ink “wetness” on the page
plays a role, meaning factors like ambient humidity, and the time elapsed
between pen strokes over a crowded area wind up factoring into this. These are
quite a few variables to control, and will likely make getting accurate
measurements tricky.</p>

<h2 id="more-accurate-line-drawing">More “accurate” line drawing</h2>

<p>Bresenham’s algorithm does not perform any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing">anti-aliasing</a>, and as a
result we might be misattributing how much a given square is covered by a given
line. However, I haven’t needed this added accuracy so far.</p>



<p>In practice, I’ve found that any more than 20 lines in a given 1x1mm square
will start to damage most Bristol paper, and over 40 lines is asking for a tear.
These numbers will probably vary from setup-to-setup, so I’ll share what I’ve
been drawing with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TWSBI Eco Fountain Pens with an EF nib</li>
  <li>Strathmore 300 Series Bristol Vellum Paper</li>
  <li>Pilot Fountain Pen Ink</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy plotting!</p>

						<p><b>Edit (17/02/21)</b> I changed the title of this post which was unnecessarily incendiary.</p>
<p>There’s a lot that I like about how mathematics operates as a social discipline. We have a great respect for the history of the subject, which in particular includes acknowledging the work that has come before us. In the end, we ultimately agree that it is the mathematics which does the talking. Each of us has our own tastes (of course) and some of us are more prone to be excited about our own work than others, but we are remarkably free from bullshit (about the actual mathematics, at least). This is what all of science should aspire to.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why I find the self-promotion surrounding the <a href="https://galoisrepresentations.wordpress.com/2019/07/07/en-passant-v/">Ramanujan Machine</a> so distasteful. (I wasn’t going to bother wasting any more time on this but here I am, last time I promise.) The idea of trying to automate methods for finding identities is an interesting one. But if want to claim that you have found something <i>new</i>, then some justification is required. For a start, you should at least be expected to do a cursory search of the literature. Perhaps you should even consult an expert? If the authors had been content to be more modest with their claims, merely explaining that automation was their main goal, and that they were merely <i>hopeful</i> to use these ideas to make new discoveries, I would have had no issue at all with their paper. Of course, nobody would have heard about the paper either. I already complained <a href="https://galoisrepresentations.wordpress.com/2019/07/07/en-passant-v/">last time</a> about the overblown rhetoric, but since then, my interactions with one of the authors indicated that the rot lies deeper still.</p>
<p>The author in question seemed happy (while listening to my previous complaints) to indicate that the novelty is not in producing new mathematics but in automatically generating formulas “without knowing Gauss’ work”. As I indicated above, that’s a reasonable and modest claim. But then, the same author will tweet out to the world the false claim that his program has discovered new and amazing mathematical conjectures. (A rather curious set of tweets to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">@elonmusk</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/yurimilner?lang=en">@yurimilner</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/stephen_wolfram">@stephen_wolfram</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RHDijkgraaf">@RHDijkgraaf</a>; is the common thread people who have access to money that can be spent on math?)  Don’t imagine for a minute that this is not a deliberate and conscious decision: the <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-07-ramanujan-machine-automatically-conjectures-fundamental.html">press</a> <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2209213-computer-attempts-to-replicate-the-dream-like-maths-of-ramanujan/">stories</a> generated about “automating the insight of Ramanujan” don’t happen on their own — they need the hook of “exciting conjectures” to be “newsworthy” and this is exactly what has been peddled via a concerted publicity campaign. The best way to describe this entire story is as follows: this is what happens when you import <b>startup culture</b> into mathematics. Maybe such Janus-faced interactions are commonplace in Silicon Valley where qualifiers are merely a distraction from a good sales pitch. But it’s an utterly abhorrent mindset that I think mathematicians must strive to banish at all costs. In particular, the choice to deliberately obscure the fact that the program has generated (as yet) <i>nothing considered remotely new by an expert</i> while simultaneously boasting of a triumph in automating intuition is  absurd; Ramanujan would roll over in his grave.</p>
<p><b>Caveats:</b> The paper has a number of young authors who I consider completely blameless. The possibility of redemption still awaits in the next version of the paper. </p>
<p><b>Random Continued Fraction: </b>I give you one of the author’s lastest tweets, in which one of their amazing conjectures has been generalized! (By a 15 year old apparently, well done to him, I hope he doesn’t waste any more time on this). I’ll spare you the <a href="https://twitter.com/yaronhadad/status/1150767039621062656?s=20">amazing gif</a> animation that builds up to this final climax:</p>

<p>Well … OK I guess? But, pretty much exactly as pointed out last time, not only is the proof only one line, but the nature of the proof makes clear exactly how unoriginal this is to mathematics:</p>
<p><a href="https://box2106.temp.domains/~galoisre///wp-content/uploads/2019/07/latestproof.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://box2106.temp.domains/~galoisre///wp-content/uploads/2019/07/latestproof.png?w=300" alt="" width="615" height="201" srcset="https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/latestproof.png 1484w, https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/latestproof-300x98.png 300w, https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/latestproof-768x250.png 768w, https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/latestproof-1024x334.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px"></a></p>
<p>(There is actually something vaguely interesting about how certain specializations of complicated identities are harder to prove than the original identities, but that is only tangentially relevant to this post.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Someone recently asked me about devirtualization optimizations: when do they happen?
when can we rely on devirtualization? do different compilers do devirtualization
differently? As usual, this led me down an experimental rabbit-hole. The answer
seems to be: Modern compilers devirtualize calls to <code>final</code> methods pretty reliably.
But there are many interesting corner cases — including some I haven’t thought of,
I’m sure! — and different compilers <em>do</em> catch different subsets of those corner cases.</p>

<p>First, let’s observe that devirtualization can (probably?) be done <em>more effectively</em> via
<a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/08/02/the-tough-guide-to-cpp-acronyms/#lto">LTO</a>,
using whole-program analysis. I don’t know anything about the state of the art in
link-time devirtualization, and it’s hard to experiment with on Compiler Explorer,
so I’m not going to talk about LTO at all. We’re looking purely at what the compiler
itself can do.</p>

<p>There are basically two situations where the compiler knows enough to
devirtualize. They don’t have much in common:</p>

<h2 id="when-we-know-the-instances-dynamic-type">When we know the instance’s dynamic type</h2>

<p>The archetypical case here is</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void test() {
    Apple o;
    o.f();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It doesn’t matter if <code>Apple::f</code> is virtual; all virtual dispatch ever does is
invoke the method on the actual dynamic type of the object, and here we <em>know</em>
the actual dynamic type is exactly <code>Apple</code>. Static and dynamic dispatch should
give us the same result in this case.</p>

<p>A sufficiently smart compiler will use dataflow analysis to optimize non-trivial
cases such as</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Derived d;
Base *p = &amp;d;
p-&gt;f();
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It turns out that even this simple dodge is enough to fool MSVC and ICC.
The next test case is</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Derived da, db;
Base *p = cond ? &amp;da : &amp;db;
p-&gt;f();
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is too much for Clang, but GCC actually manages to survive it… until
you move the conversions to <code>Base*</code> inside the conditional! Here is where
even GCC’s analysis fails (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/GE7vsE">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Derived da, db;
Base *p = cond ? (Base*)&amp;da : (Base*)&amp;db;
p-&gt;f();
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="when-we-know-a-proof-of-leafness-for-its-static-type">When we know a “proof of leafness” for its static type</h2>

<p>Okay, let’s suppose that we’re receiving a pointer from somewhere else in the
system. We know its static type (e.g. <code>Derived*</code>), but we don’t know the actual
dynamic type of the object instance to which it points. Still, the compiler can
devirtualize a call to <code>Derived::f</code> if it can somehow prove that no type in the
entire program can ever override <code>Derived::f</code>.</p>

<h3 id="proof-by-final">Proof-by-<code>final</code></h3>

<p>The simplest “proof of leafness” is if you’ve marked <code>Derived</code> as <code>final</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct Base {
    virtual int f();
};
struct Derived final : public Base {
    int f() override { return 2; }
};
int test(Derived *p) {
    return p-&gt;f();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A pointer of type <code>Derived*</code> must point to an object instance that is
“at least <code>Derived</code>” — i.e., <code>Derived</code> or one of its children.
Since <code>Derived</code> is <code>final</code>, it isn’t allowed to have children; therefore
the dynamic type of the instance must be exactly <code>Derived</code>, and the compiler
can devirtualize this call.</p>

<p>Or, you can mark the specific method <code>Derived::f</code> as <code>final</code>.</p>

<p>The same analysis should apply no matter whether <code>Derived::f</code> is declared
in <code>Derived</code> itself, or inherited from <code>Base</code>. So for example the compiler
should be equally able to devirtualize</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct Base {
    virtual int f() { return 1; }
};
struct Derived final : public Base {};
int test(Derived *p) {
    return p-&gt;f();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>GCC, Clang, and MSVC pass this test (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/MnqoM7">Godbolt</a>, case <code>one</code>); ICC 21.1.9 is fooled.</p>

<p>An utterly bizarre proof-of-leafness is to observe that when class <code>C</code>’s destructor is
final, <code>C</code> must be childless — because if <code>C</code> had a child, the child would
have to have a destructor (since you can’t make a class without a destructor),
which would then override <code>C</code>’s destructor, which isn’t allowed.
Clang actually both warns on final destructors, and optimizes on them.
Every other vendor considers this situation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colonel_(Monty_Python)">very silly</a>
and doesn’t dignify it with a codepath as far as I can tell.</p>

<h3 id="proof-by-internal-linkage">Proof-by-internal-linkage</h3>

<p>A class whose name has internal linkage cannot be named outside the current translation unit.
Therefore, it cannot be <em>derived from</em> outside the current translation unit, either!
As long as it has no children in the current TU — or at least no children that override its
methods — calls to its virtual functions are devirtualizable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace {
    class BaseImpl : public Base {};
}
int test(Base *p) {
    return static_cast&lt;BaseImpl*&gt;(p)-&gt;f();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>p</code> really does point to an object instance that is “at least <code>BaseImpl</code>,”
then the compiler can prove that the instance must be exactly <code>BaseImpl</code>.
(And if <code>p</code> doesn’t point to an instance that is “at least <code>BaseImpl</code>,”
the program has undefined behavior anyway.)</p>

<p>This strikes me as a case that might actually come up pretty commonly in real codebases.
It’s common to have a base class exposed publicly in the header file, and then one
or more derived implementations scoped tightly to a single .cpp file. If you
go the extra mile and put those derived implementations into anonymous namespaces,
you might be helping out the compiler’s devirtualization logic. Of course, by definition,
any such benefit will be limited to that single .cpp file!</p>

<p>Another way a type’s name can get internal linkage is when it’s a class template instantiation
where one of the template parameters involves a name with internal linkage. If the name <code>T</code>
has internal linkage, then <code>E&lt;T&gt;</code> also has internal linkage, even if <code>E</code> itself has external
linkage — because you can’t name <code>E&lt;T&gt;</code> without naming <code>T</code>. (Notice that here <code>T</code> must be
a “true name”; we’re not talking about type aliases.)</p>

<p>It’s also possible to make a type whose name has external linkage, but where the
compiler can prove that the type must be incomplete in every other TU. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace {
    class Internal {};
}
class External { Internal m; };
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Any other TU is allowed to forward-declare <code>class External;</code> as an incomplete type,
but those TUs can’t ever complete the type because they can’t name the types of its
data members. You can’t derive from an incomplete type. So all types derived from <code>External</code>
(if any) must be present in this TU; if there are none here, well, that’s a proof-of-leafness!
GCC alone detects this situation.</p>

<h2 id="table-of-results">Table of results</h2>

<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/z/GE7vsE">Godbolt for the known-dynamic-type case</a>;
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/MnqoM7">Godbolt for the proof-of-leafness case</a>.
In the latter, I’ve made separate tests for <code>Derived::f</code>-defined-directly-in-<code>Derived</code>
and <code>Derived::g</code>-inherited-from-<code>Base</code>. GCC frequently gets <code>f</code> right
but fails to devirtualize <code>g</code>.
I’ve filed <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=99093">GCC bug #99093</a> about that.</p>

<p>Steve Dewhurst taught me <code>four</code>’s “silly old-school trick”: Virtual bases
are always constructed in the context of the most-derived class. So,
if class <code>C</code> has a virtual base all of whose constructors are private,
then no child of <code>C</code> will ever be able to construct itself, and therefore
no child of <code>C</code> can exist. (Of course that virtual base will have to list
<code>C</code> among its friends, in order for <code>C</code> itself to be constructible.)
I think this trick is foolproof, and thus constitutes a (very silly)
proof-of-leafness for <code>C</code>; but of course no compiler cares
to trace through this logical tangle, even if it <em>is</em> foolproof.</p>

<p>Can you think of some way to construct a “proof-of-leafness” that I’ve missed?
Tell me about it!</p>

    <p>What is the fastest way to parse &amp; serialize JSON in Scala? Could it be <a href="https://github.com/circe/circe">Circe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/suzaku-io/boopickle">BooPickle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/playframework/play-json">Play Json</a>, or maybe <a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/upickle">uPickle</a>?</p>

<p>What if I told you the fastest Scala JSON library is already on your computer, implemented with native code, and updated regularly with improvements? Yes, I’m talking about the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON">JSON</a> object in Node.js and your browser. Sorry if you feel tricked! But Scala is a multi-platform language; JavaScript is just as much a Scala runtime as the JVM. <code>JSON</code> is <a href="https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks">among the best performing parsers of ANY language</a>, including vectorized C++ libraries. The best ‘Scala’ (and Java) <a href="https://github.com/ngs-doo/dsl-json">library</a> benchmarked is ‘built for invasive software composition’, and comes with its own ‘DSL platform compiler’. <code>JSON</code> is simply the best.</p>

<p>Ok, so let’s create a <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/">Scala.js</a> project, write a case class, and serialize it to JSON!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>import</span> <span>scala.scalajs.js.JSON</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>isAdmin</span><span>:</span> <span>Boolean</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span>

<span>// Compile Error!</span>
<span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>User</span><span>(</span><span>"John Smith"</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>42</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Unfortunately for us, <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/api/scalajs-library/latest/scala/scalajs/js/JSON$.html">JSON.stringify</a> takes only native JavaScript parameters, ie, objects inheriting <code>scala.scalajs.js.Any</code>. As specified in the <a href="http://www.scala-js.org/doc/interoperability/sjs-defined-js-classes.html">interoperability guide</a>, we can make a native class by extending js.Object:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>import</span> <span>scala.scalajs.js</span>

<span>// Compile Error!</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>isAdmin</span><span>:</span> <span>Boolean</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>js</span><span>.</span><span>Object</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Not again! As the compiler tells us, it is forbidden for case classes to extend js.Object. Why is that? It has to do with the semantic difference between Scala.js objects and native JavaScript objects. When you create an object like <code>User("John Smith", true, 42)</code> for example, it does not automatically become</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>{</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>John Smith</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>isAdmin</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
  <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>42</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Instead, after <code>sbt fullLinkJS</code> (which runs the <a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler">Google Closure JavaScript Optimizer</a>), the object properties may very well be ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’. Or, the object could be inlined &amp; removed entirely. This feature is why Scala.js’s <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/doc/internals/performance.html">performance is almost always better than hand-written JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p>It also means that to interop with native JavaScript libraries like <code>JSON</code>, you must give up Scala features like destructuring and pattern matching. Or, create native versions for every class and manually convert:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>import</span> <span>scala.scalajs.js</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>isAdmin</span><span>:</span> <span>Boolean</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span>

<p>I like to be DRY, and <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/overview.html">Scala 3</a> gives us the power to achieve this with Typeclass derivation. Take a look:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>import</span> <span>com.augustnagro.nativeconverter.NativeConverter</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>isAdmin</span><span>:</span> <span>Boolean</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>derives</span> <span>NativeConverter</span>

<span>// to JSON</span>
<span>val</span> <span>u</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span><span>"John Smith"</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>json</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>.</span><span>toNative</span><span>)</span>

<span>// from JSON</span>
<span>val</span> <span>parsedUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>User</span><span>].</span><span>fromNative</span><span>(</span><span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>json</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it, no manual conversion necessary.</p>

<p>A Typeclass lets you add behavior without inheritance. Instead of extending a class or implementing an interface, you create a Typeclass instance that operates on that type, and pass it around. Typeclasses let you add features to types you don’t control, aka <a href="https://august.nagro.us/retroactive-polymorphism-scala.html">Retroactive Polymorphism</a>.</p>

<p>In Java, defining, instantiating, and passing around Typeclass instances would be inconvenient, so people <code>extend</code> instead. But Scala 3 makes it easy. When you write <code>case class User(..) derives NativeConverter</code>, the scala compiler calls method <code>NativeConverter::derived</code>, which generates a <code>given</code> instance in User’s companion object. When you summon a NativeConverter for User, either with <code>summon[NativeConverter[User]]</code> or just <code>NativeConverter[User]</code> via the 0-arg <code>apply</code> helper method in <code>NativeConverter</code>, the same instance is returned.</p>

<p>The implementation of NativeConverter is about 400 lines of 0-dependency Scala, and is NOT A MACRO!
Here’s the contract of the NativeConverter Typeclass:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>trait</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>]</span><span>:</span>
  <span>extension</span> <span>(</span><span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>def</span> <span>toNative</span><span>:</span> <span>js.Any</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>fromNative</span><span>(</span><span>nativeJs</span><span>:</span> <span>js.Any</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can summon built-in NativeConverters for all the primitive types:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>Int</span><span>].</span><span>fromNative</span><span>(</span><span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>"100"</span><span>))</span>

<span>val</span> <span>nativeByte</span><span>:</span> <span>js.Any</span> <span>=</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>Byte</span><span>].</span><span>toNative</span><span>(</span><span>127.</span><span>toByte</span><span>)</span>

<span>val</span> <span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>=</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>String</span><span>]</span>
  <span>.</span><span>fromNative</span><span>(</span><span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>""" "hello world" """</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Char and Long are always converted to String, since they cannot be represented directly in JavaScript:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>// native String</span>
<span>val</span> <span>nativeLong</span> <span>=</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>Long</span><span>].</span><span>toNative</span><span>(</span><span>Long</span><span>.</span><span>MaxValue</span><span>)</span>

<span>val</span> <span>parsedLong</span> <span>=</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>Long</span><span>]</span>
  <span>.</span><span>fromNative</span><span>(</span><span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>""" "${Long.MaxValue}" """</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you want to change this behavior for Long, implement a <code>given</code> instance of NativeConverter[Long]. The example below uses String for conversion only when the Long is bigger than Int.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>given</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>Long</span><span>]</span> <span>with</span>

<p>Functions can be converted between Scala.js and Native:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> <span>helloWorld</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"hello, "</span> <span>+</span> <span>name</span>

<span>// returns "hello, Ray"</span>
<span>nativeFunc</span><span>.</span><span>asInstanceOf</span><span>[</span><span>js.Dynamic</span><span>](</span><span>"Ray"</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>Arrays, Iterables, Seqs, Sets, Lists, and Buffers are serialized using JavaScript Arrays:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>// default NativeConverters are only implemented</span>
<span>// for the collections in scala.collection.*, not the deprecated</span>
<span>// aliases in scala.Predef</span>
<span>import</span> <span>scala.collection.</span><span>{</span><span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>Set</span><span>}</span>

<p>Maps become JavaScript objects:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>import</span> <span>scala.collection.Map</span>
<span>import</span> <span>scala.collection.mutable.HashMap</span>

<span>val</span> <span>map</span> <span>=</span> <span>HashMap</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>"b"</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>

<span>// """ {"a":1,"b":2} """.trim</span>
<span>val</span> <span>mapJson</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>Map</span><span>[</span><span>String</span>, <span>Int</span><span>]].</span><span>toNative</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Only String keys are supported, since JSON requires String keys. If you’d rather convert to an <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/api/scalajs-library/latest/scala/scalajs/js/Map.html">ES 2016 Map</a>, do the following:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>import</span> <span>com.augustnagro.nativeconverter.EsConverters.given</span>

<span>val</span> <span>map</span> <span>=</span> <span>HashMap</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span>

<span>nativeMap</span><span>.</span><span>asInstanceOf</span><span>[</span><span>js.Dynamic</span><span>].</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I haven’t implemented converters for all the native types, but if you ask me or make a pull request for one that’s missing I will merge it.</p>

<p>Option is serialized using a 1-element array if Some, or [] if None:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> <span>nc</span> <span>=</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>Option</span><span>[</span><span>Array</span><span>[</span><span>Int</span><span>]]]</span>
<span>val</span> <span>some</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>))</span>

<span>// "[[1,2,3]]"</span>
<span>val</span> <span>someJson</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>nc</span><span>.</span><span>toNative</span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span>))</span>

<span>// None</span>
<span>val</span> <span>none</span> <span>=</span> <span>nc</span><span>.</span><span>fromNative</span><span>(</span><span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>"[]"</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Any <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Product.html">Product</a> or Sum type (like case classes and enums) can derive a NativeConverter. If the Product is a Singleton (ie, having no parameters) then the type name or <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Product.html#productPrefix:String">productPrefix</a> is used. Otherwise, an object is created using the parameter names as keys.</p>

<p>You can for example redefine Option as a Scala 3 enum:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>enum</span> <span>Opt</span><span>[</span><span>+T</span><span>]</span> <span>derives</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>:</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>Sm</span><span>(</span><span>x:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>Nn</span>

<span>// """ "Nn" """.trim</span>
<span>val</span> <span>nnJson</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>Opt</span><span>.</span><span>Nn</span><span>.</span><span>toNative</span><span>)</span>

<span>// Opt.Sm(123L)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>sm</span> <span>=</span> <span>NativeConverter</span><span>[</span><span>Opt</span><span>[</span><span>Long</span><span>]].</span><span>fromNative</span><span>(</span><span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>""" {"x":123} """</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And of course, you can nest to any depth you wish:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>// recommended but not required for X to derive NativeConverter</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>X</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>String</span><span>])</span>

<span>val</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Y</span><span>(</span><span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>(</span><span>List</span><span>())))</span>
<span>val</span> <span>yStr</span> <span>=</span> <span>""" {"b":[{"a":[]}]} """</span><span>.</span><span>trim</span><span>.</span><span>nn</span>

<span>assertEquals</span><span>(</span><span>yStr</span><span>,</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>.</span><span>toNative</span><span>))</span>

<p>If <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/doc/project/cross-build.html">Cross Building</a> your Scala project you can use one language for both frontend and backend development. Sub-project <code>/jvm</code> will have your JVM sources, <code>/js</code> your JavaScript, and in <code>/shared</code> you can define all of your validations and request/response DTOs once. In the <code>/shared</code> project you do not want to depend on <code>NativeConverter</code>, since that would introduce a dependency on Scala.js in your <code>/jvm</code> project. So instead of writing <code>derives NativeConverter</code> on your case classes, create an object in <code>/client</code> that holds the derived converters:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>// in shared project</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>isAdmin</span><span>:</span> <span>Boolean</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span>

<span>// in js project</span>

<p>I’ve made a sample cross-project you can clone: <a href="https://github.com/AugustNagro/native-converter-crossproject">https://github.com/AugustNagro/native-converter-crossproject</a></p>

<p>But what about performance, surely making your own js.Object subclasses is faster?
Nope, derived NativeDecoders are 2x faster, even for simple cases like <code>User("John Smith", true, 42)</code>:</p>

<p>See <a href="https://august.nagro.us/scalajs-native-type-creation-bench.html">these findings</a> for more info.</p>

<p>The generated JavaScript code is very clean. I was amazed how nice it is when looking at <code>sbt fastLinkJS</code> output. This is all possible because of Scala 3’s <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/metaprogramming/inline.html"><code>inline</code></a> keyword, and powerful type-level programming capabilities. That’s right.. no Macros used whatsoever! The <code>derives</code> keyword on type T causes the NativeConverter Typeclass to be auto-generated in T’s companion object. Only once, and when first requested.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that I am very impressed with Scala 3. And a big thank you to Sébastien Doeraene and Tobias Schlatter, who are first-rate maintainers of Scala.js, as well as Jamie Thompson who gave me advice on …</p></div></div></div>

<p>If you see an active move to change software licensing or governance, it’s likely someone is paying for it and thus could justify the expense to an executive.<span id="more-107529"></span></p>
<h4>A Little History</h4>
<p>Some case study cameos may help. From 2004 onwards, Sun Microsystems had a policy of all its software moving to open source. The company&nbsp;migrated almost all products to open source licenses, and had varying degrees of success engaging communities around the various projects, largely related to the outlooks of the product management and Sun developers for the project.</p>
<p>Sun&nbsp;occasionally received requests to make older, retired products open source. For example, Sun acquired a company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_Design">Lighthouse Design</a> which created a respected suite of office productivity software for Steve Jobs’ NeXT platform. Strategy changes meant that software headed for the vault (while Jonathan Schwartz, a founder of Lighthouse, headed for the executive suite). Members of the public&nbsp;asked if Sun would open source some of this software, but these requests were declined because there was no business unit willing to fund the move.</p>
<p>When Sun was later bought by Oracle, a number of those projects that had been made open source were abandoned.&nbsp;“Abandoning” software doesn’t mean leaving it for others; it means simply walking away from wherever you left it. In the case of Sun’s popular identity middleware products, that meant Oracle let the staff go and tried to migrate customers to other products, while remaining silent in public on the future of the project. But the code was already open source, so the user community was able to pick up the pieces and carry on, with help from Forgerock.</p>
<h4>Liberation Checklist</h4>
<p>It costs a lot of money to open source a mature piece of commercial software, even if all you are doing is “throwing a tarball over the wall”. That’s why companies abandoning software they no longer care about so rarely make it open source, and those abandoning open source projects rarely move them to new homes that benefit others.</p>
<p>If all you have thought about is the eventual outcome, you may be surprised how expensive it is to get there. Costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5><span>For throwing a tarball over the wall:</span></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal clearance.</strong><br>
Having the right to use the software is not the same as giving everyone in the world an unrestricted right to use it and create derivatives. Checking every line of code to make sure you have the rights necessary to release under an OSI-approved license is a big task requiring high-value employees on the “liberation team”. That includes both developers and lawyers; neither come cheap.</li>
<li><strong>Repackaging</strong>.<br>
To pass it to others, a self-contained package containing all necessary source code, build scripts&nbsp;and non-public source and tool dependencies has to be created since it is quite unlikely to exist internally. Again, the liberation team will need your best developers.</li>
<li><strong>Preserving provenance</strong>.<br>
Just because you have confidence that you have the rights to the code, that doesn’t mean anyone else will. The version control system probably contains much of the information that gives confidence about who wrote which code, so the repackaging needs to also include a way to migrate the commit information.</li>
<li><strong>Code cleaning.</strong><br>
The file headers will hopefully include origin information but the liberation team had better check. They also need to check the comments for libel and profanities, not to mention trade secrets (especially those from third parties) and other IP issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5><span>For a sustainable project, all the above plus:</span></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance with host governance</strong>.<br>
It is a fantastic idea to move your project to a host like <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache</a>, <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/">Conservancy</a>, <a href="https://publicsoftware.eu/">Public Software</a> and so on. But doing so requires preparatory work. As a minimum you will need to negotiate with the new host organisation, and they may well need you to satisfy their process requirements. Paperwork obviously, but also the code may need conforming copyright statements and more. That’s more work for your liberation team.</li>
<li><strong>Migration of rights.</strong><br>
Your code has an existing community who will need to migrate to your new host. That includes your staff – they are community too! They will need commit rights, governance rights, social media rights and more. Your liberation team will need your community manager, obviously, but may also need HR input.</li>
<li><strong>Endowment</strong>.<br>
Keeping your project alive will take money. It’s all been coming from you up to this point, but if you simply walk away before the financial burden has been accepted by the new community and hosts there may be a problem. You should consider making an endowment to your new host to pay for their migration costs plus the cost of hosting the community for at least a year.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing</strong>.<br>
Explaining the move you are making, the reasons why you are making it and the benefits for you and the community is important. If you don’t do it, there are plenty of trolls around who will do it for you. Creating a news blog post and an FAQ — the minimum effort necessary — really does take someone experienced and you’ll want to add such a person to your liberation team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Motivations</h4>
<p>There has to be some commercial reason that makes the time, effort and thus expense worth incurring. Some examples of motivations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Strategy.</strong><br>
An increasing number of companies are choosing to create substantial, openly-governed open source communities around software that contributes to their business. An open multi-stakeholder co-developer community is an excellent vehicle for innovation at the lowest cost to all involved. As long as your market strategy doesn’t require creating artificial scarcity.</li>
<li><strong>Contract with a third party.</strong><br>
While the owner of the code may no longer be interested, there may be one or more parties to which they owe a contractual responsibility. Rather than breaching that contract, or buying it out, a move to open source may be better. Some sources suggest a contractual obligation to IBM&nbsp;was the reason Oracle abandoned OpenOffice.org by moving it over to the Apache Software Foundation for example.</li>
<li><strong>Larger dependent ecosystem.</strong><br>
You may have no further use for the code itself, but you may well have other parts of your business which depend on it. If they are willing to collectively fund development you might consider an <a href="https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/">“inner source”</a> strategy which will save you many of the costs above. But the best way to proceed may well be to open the code so your teams and those in other companies can fund the code.</li>
<li><strong>Internal politics</strong>.<br>
From the outside, corporations look monolithic, but from the inside it becomes clear they are a microcosm of the market in which they exist. As a result, they have political machinations that may be addressed by open source. One of Oracle’s motivations for moving NetBeans to Apache seems to have been political. Despite multiple internal groups needing it to exist, the code was not generating enough direct revenue to satisfy successive executive owners, who allegedly tried to abandon it on more than one occasion. Donating it to Apache meant that couldn’t happen again.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is to say a move to open source guarantees the success of a project. A <a href="http://thoughtleadershipleverage.com/field-of-dreams-great-movie-dumb-strategy/">“Field of Dreams” strategy</a> only works in the movies, after all. But while it may be tempting to look at a failed corporate liberation and describe it as “abandonware”, chances are it was intended as nothing of the kind.</p>

February 15, 2021 | https://devrule.dev/r/1000-use-search-oriented-programming/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://devrule.dev/r/1000-use-search-oriented-programming/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<article>


<p>The idea of search-oriented programming is based on two premises:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every useful class, method, or attribute has been used at least once. If nobody is using it, do not use it either.</li>
<li>Every line in mature software has been checked by multiple people. Therefore every class, method, or variable has a descriptive and understandable name.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="search-in-existing-code">Search In Existing Code</h2>
<p>If you know the name of the class or function you can try to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wikipediaapi.Wikipedia">google it</a>. You will get most likely just a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/">package page</a>, <a href="https://wikipedia-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wikipediaapi/api.html#wikipediaapi.WikipediaPage">documentation</a>, or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34869597/wikipedia-api-for-python/47793106#47793106">Stackoverflow questions</a>. This is a good start but you can get better results if you use more specialized search engines. Specific examples will help you to learn not only about the entity itself but also about other entities that are used nearby.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-search">Where To Search</h2>
<ol>
<li>Search in your project. It is just one keyboard shortcut away and it is the best code that you can find. It has passed code review, you can find relevant pull requests, or even talk with people who have written that code. Many IDE allows you to easily find all usages of the entity.</li>
<li>Search in repositories of your organization. It could take a little bit longer and you may not be able to talk with the others of that code. On the other side, there is a greater chance that you will find something.</li>
<li>Search in communication in your company. If you have problems with figuring out how it should be used, you are for sure not the first one. Try to search in wikis, Slack, e-mails, etc.</li>
<li>Search in the source code of that project. If it is a public method, then it should be covered at least with unit tests. By finding these <a href="https://github.com/martin-majlis/Wikipedia-API/blob/master/tests/wikipedia_page_test.py#L23">tests</a>, you can learn what was the intended usage by the authors.</li>
<li>Search in open source repositories. GitHub allows you to search in their 100M+ repositories. So you will find for sure many good examples. If you compare search <a href="https://github.com/search?l=Python&amp;p=5&amp;q=wikipediaapi.Wikipedia&amp;type=Code">GitHub results</a> with initial Google results you can that it is much more useful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another advantage of using GitHub is that you not only find the function itself and its friends, but you will also find how it is used in tests. Documentation of how to use <code>requests.Session</code> is <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced/#session-objects">short</a>, but since it is a lot, you will find many <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22requests.Session%22+import+requests+Session&amp;type=Code">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 id="guess-names">Guess Names</h2>
<p>Since the code was written by sane people and reviewed by other people, there is a very high chance that used names would be descriptive. Therefore you can always try to search for possible class or method names to see if anything useful is there.</p>
<p>If you are searching for code related to login workflow, you can try to search for string <code>login</code>. If you want to find code related to manipulation with items in a shopping cart, you can search for words like <code>cart</code>, <code>basket</code>, or <code>order</code>.</p>

Chunks that, individually, are mere specks in the cloud of millions of such primordial planetary leftovers circling our sun. Or, are you aware that there are those who spend day after day wrestling with how to measure and decode the extraordinary orbital dances of unreachable exoplanets, or to detect and interpret the delicate spectra revealing the composition of alien atmospheres tens of trillions of miles away?</p><p>If not them, then what about those who have, for decades, tackled some of the most daunting questions about the phenomenon we call life itself, including how it began here on Earth billions of years ago, and how it might have begun anywhere else in the cosmos? And can you recall that there are devoted and talented scientists who pursue the exquisite possibility that somewhere there are alien minds sending out structured, information-rich signals, or repurposing their environments in ways that we—other scraps of thinking life—might just be able to spot across the gaping void of interstellar space?</p><blockquote><p>Aliens may be out there. And we are looking for them.</p> </blockquote><p>If you could say yes to any of these questions, well done. You are a well-informed citizen of planet Earth, aware of humanity’s ongoing efforts to make sense of the nature of reality. If, on the other hand, you couldn’t respond in the affirmative then perhaps you wouldn’t blink an eye at newspaper articles or TV headlines asking why (oh why?!) scientists won’t take the task of “looking for aliens” more seriously? Or articles harrumphing about how conservative science is when it comes to “thinking out of the box,” especially if the topic is one that’s been abused so many times over literally centuries that researchers now have little choice but to apply extreme care and caution.<br></p><p>I am, if you are not up on your science news at the moment, referring to a recent flurry of words and opinions that have been, in part, triggered by the publication of the book <i>Extraterrestrial</i> by the theoretical astrophysicist Avi Loeb, in which he attempts to make a case that a recent interstellar object passing through our solar system (<a href="https://nautil.us/blog/how-oumuamua-got-shredded" target="_blank">the ‘Oumuamua object</a>) could have been a piece of technology, conceivably even a tumbling light sail from an alien spacecraft, rather than a piece of frozen rock and gas. Loeb also writes about how science can be overly conservative at times—aiming his complaints in particular on the reticence to elevate the question of alien life to a more prominent place in our hypotheses about what we see in the universe around us.</p><p>But you need only to have spent a little time recently in the hallways of scientific Zoom calls or on social media to see unhappiness being expressed by many researchers about all of this. That unhappiness reaches a red-hot level any time a new opinion piece gets published that picks up this particular thread. Most recently (at least as I write this), is the appearance in <i>The New York Times</i> of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/opinion/aliens-extraterrestrial-life.html" target="_blank">opinion article</a> with the title “Aliens Must Be Out There: Why aren’t we looking for them?”, written by the columnist Farhad Manjoo. I think it’s fair to say that the tone of the headline, erroneously suggesting that alien life exists because we think it must and that we’re not paying attention, reflects much of the thrust of the content. Reaching an apex of sorts when the piece uses Loeb’s thoughts on the matter to admonish science, and science-funding agencies, for their “closed-mindedness” and “reflexive skepticism” when it comes to considering exotic (yes, alien) stuff in the mix for explaining new or unexpected cosmic phenomena.&nbsp;</p><p>What is so incredibly disappointing for a scientist like myself, and for so many of my colleagues across related disciplines—from astronomy to planetary science, to astrobiology—is that there are no other voices represented in this kind of writing. No snippets or quotes from the hundreds of scientists who are the world’s experts on matters like ‘Oumuamua, or other extraterrestrial objects, from asteroids to comets to (yes) interstellar chunks, or the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), or exoplanets, or indeed the very same quest for so-called technosignatures that is fleetingly mentioned. And this one article is by no means alone in that strange incompleteness, where “due diligence” seems to have gone out the window.</p><p>In reality there are people who do think about all of these scientific questions, week after week. They dig through mountains of data, and sweat blood over understanding the delicate nature of astronomical measurements and instrumentation. They build spacecraft to go to other worlds, as well as asteroids and comets, funded by national agencies like NASA, ESA, JAXA, CNSA, and more. These people are eager and driven, motivated by precisely these same extraterrestrial conundrums: Are we alone? Where do we, or any other life, come from?</p><p>These scientists, including those like the remarkable Jill Tarter—one of the driving forces and voices behind SETI for the past 40 years—have pushed their instruments and skills to the absolute limits in the quest for evidence of extraterrestrial life. Often in the face of intense skepticism. Despite this effort, there has been no evidence to date of extraterrestrial life. But that lack of evidence is not because the scientific enterprise is uniformly conservative, rigid, and close-minded, as implied by Loeb and uncritically echoed by some columnists. It’s because no discovery or event has risen to the level where it is inexplicable in any other way. Could greater funding and support change that story? Perhaps, but the same could be said for almost any other ambitious scientific enterprise, and the answer cannot be known beforehand.</p><p>A proposal that a phenomenon like ‘Oumuamua is an alien artifact is certainly going to meet push-back. But that push-back is well founded. It results from the extensive work of scientific experts on precisely this kind of interstellar visitor. Our models of star and planet formation have long hypothesized the existence of leftover pieces of solid material (planetesimals) that could spend eons moving across interstellar space. They have outlined how an interloper like ‘Oumuamua would be a stunning discovery. But it would be a stunning discovery reflecting natural processes; reservoirs of these planetesimals—already suggested by the hazy light seen around certain other stars—that can be ejected and scattered across interstellar space in numbers that may be perfectly consistent with the chances of our solar system being visited by one. This is precisely why an agency like ESA is developing its <a href="https://www.cometinterceptor.space/" target="_blank">Comet Interceptor Mission</a>, to be ready to chase future interstellar visitors.</p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>‘Oumuamua certainly had puzzling characteristics. It was small for an interstellar comet, it was elongated and, despite being barely caught by our best telescopes and nimblest astronomers as it wended its tumbling way back out of the solar system, it exhibited an ethereal acceleration away from the Sun. But even these puzzles are explicable by known processes and are not wildly inconsistent with the properties of other cometary-like objects. Indeed, a number of comparatively straightforward, testable, explanations seem compatible, <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/1718.pdf" target="_blank">including the possibility</a> that the object was a frozen nitrogen “iceberg,” a chip off the block of some distant Pluto-like world.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of all of this rigorous insight, to shield one’s pet hypothesis of an alien object by suggesting that it is not being taken seriously because of a flaw in how we do science is playing a disingenuous game with the facts. As is to suggest that this is actually in aid of raising support for the search for extraterrestrial life. For that to be uncritically echoed elsewhere is truly unfortunate.</p><p>As in any human intellectual endeavor, there are many voices, many insights. It’s too bad that not all insights get the same kind of airtime. If they did, we’d be hearing so much more about the extraordinary ongoing scientific efforts—both institutional and personal—to open up our minds, to explore new worlds, and perhaps discover new life. Are we all carrying out these efforts perfectly? No. Scientific conservatism is present. But so too is a clear memory of the many times where enthusiasm for a provocative idea about alien life has given way to disappointment—from fossils in Martian meteorites to arsenic-laced microbes. Fingers have been burnt before in the quest to find clues to life in the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>They weren’t burned because of misplaced skepticism though. A wide range of scientists did their own due diligence: scrutinizing a hypothesis, gathering more data, weighing the evidence and building their confidence in a conclusion. Science denialism has cursed many cultures in recent years. Thankfully it looks to be receding somewhat. But being blind to how science works and what it’s doing is also a form of denialism. Aliens may be out there. And we are looking for them.</p><p><i>Caleb Scharf is an astrophysicist and the director of astrobiology at Columbia University in New York.

				<p><code>std::jthread</code> stands for joining thread. In addition to <code>std::thread</code> (C++11),<code> std::jthread</code> automatically joins in its destructor and can cooperatively be interrupted. Read in this post to know why <code>std::jthread</code> should be your first choice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/jthread/TimelineCpp20.png" alt="TimelineCpp20" width="650" height="227"></p>
<p>The following table gives you a concise overview of the functionality of <code>std::jthread</code>.</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/jthread/jthread.png" alt="jthread" width="650" height="572"></p>

<p>For additional details, please refer to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/jthread">cppreference.com</a>. When you want to read more post about <code>std::thread</code>, here are they: <a href="http://modernescpp.com/index.php/der-einstieg-in-modernes-c#h1-2-the-threading-interface">my post about std::thread.</a></p>
<p>First, why do we need an improved thread in C++20? Here is the first reason.</p>
<h2 id="h1-automatically-joining">Automatically Joining</h2>
<p>This is the <strong>non-intuitive</strong> behavior of <code>std::thread</code>. If a <code>std::thread</code> is still joinable, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/terminate">std::terminate</a> is called in its destructor. A thread<code> thr</code> is joinable if neither <code>thr.join()</code> nor <code>thr.detach()</code> was called. Let me show, what that means.</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div>
<pre><span>// threadJoinable.cpp</span>

<span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;thread&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>boolalpha;
    
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> thr{[]{ std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Joinable std::thread"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>; }};
    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"thr.joinable(): "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> thr.joinable() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
    
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>When executed, the program terminates when the local object <code>thr</code> goes out of scope.</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/jthread/threadJoinable.png" alt="threadJoinable" width="500" height="279"></p>
<p>Both executions of<code> std::thread</code> terminate. In the second run, the thread <code>thr</code> has enough time to display its message:&nbsp;<code>Joinable std::thread</code>.</p>
<p>In the next example, I use <code>std::jthread</code> from the C++20 standard.</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div>
<pre><span>// jthreadJoinable.cpp</span>

<span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;thread&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>boolalpha;
    
    std<span>::</span>jthread thr{[]{ std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Joinable std::thread"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>; }};
    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"thr.joinable(): "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> thr.joinable() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
    
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Now, the thread<code> thr</code> automatically joins in its destructor if it's still joinable such as in this case.</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/jthread/jthreadJoinable.png" alt="jthreadJoinable" width="350" height="177"></p>
<p>But this is not all that<code> std::jthread</code>&nbsp; provides additionally to <code>std::thread</code>. A <code>std::jthread</code> can be cooperatively interrupted. I already presented the general ideas of cooperative interruption in my last post: <a href="http://modernescpp.com/index.php/cooperative-interruption-of-a-thread-in-c-20">Cooperative Interruption of a Thread in C++20</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h2-cooperative-interruption-of-a-std-jthread">Cooperative Interruption of a<code> std::jthread</code></h2>
<p>To get a general idea, let me present a simple example.</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->

<span>#include &lt;chrono&gt;</span>

        <span>int</span> counter{<span>0</span>};
        <span>while</span> (counter <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span>){
            std<span>::</span>this_thread<span>::</span>sleep_for(<span>0.2</span>s);

    });

        <span>int</span> counter{<span>0</span>};
        <span>while</span> (counter <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span>){

            <span>if</span> (stoken.stop_requested()) <span>return</span>;               <span>// (3)</span>
            std<span>::</span>cerr <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"interruptable: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> counter <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>; 
            <span>++</span>counter;
        }
    });
    
    std<span>::</span>this_thread<span>::</span>sleep_for(<span>1</span>s);
    
    std<span>::</span>cerr <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
    std<span>::</span>cerr <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Main thread interrupts both jthreads"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
    nonInterruptable.request_stop();
    interruptable.request_stop();                              <span>// (4)</span>
    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
    
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>In the main program, I start the two threads <code>nonInterruptable</code> and interruptable (lines 1)and 2). Unlike in the thread <code>nonInterruptable</code> , the thread <code>interruptable</code> gets a <code>std::stop_token</code> and uses it in line (3) to check if it was interrupted: <code>stoken.stop_requested()</code>. In case of a stop request, the lambda function returns, and, therefore, the thread ends. The call <code>interruptable.request_stop()</code> (line 4) triggers the stop request. This does not hold for the previous call <code>nonInterruptable.request_stop()</code> . The call has no effect.</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/jthread/interruptJthread.png" alt="interruptJthread" width="400" height="382"></p>
<p>To make my post complete, with C++20, you can also cooperatively interrupt a condition variable.</p>
<h2 id="h3-new-wait-overloads-for-std-condition-variable-any">New wait Overloads for <code>std::condition_variable_any</code></h2>
<p>Before I write about <code>std::condition_variable_any</code>, here are my post about <a href="http://modernescpp.com/index.php/tag/condition-variable">condition variables</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three wait variations <code>wait, wait_for</code>, and<code> wait_until</code> of the std::condition_variable_any get new overloads. These overloads take a <code>std::stop_token</code>.</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div>
<pre><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>Predicate</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>bool</span> wait(Lock<span>&amp;</span> lock,  
          stop_token stoken,
          Predicate pred);

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>Rep</span>, <span>class</span> <span>Period</span>, <span>class</span> <span>Predicate</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>bool</span> wait_for(Lock<span>&amp;</span> lock, 
              stop_token stoken, 
              <span>const</span> chrono<span>::</span>duration<span>&lt;</span>Rep, Period<span>&gt;&amp;</span> rel_time, 
              Predicate pred);
                
<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>Clock</span>, <span>class</span> <span>Duration</span>, <span>class</span> <span>Predicate</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>bool</span> wait_until(Lock<span>&amp;</span> lock, 
                stop_token stoken,
                <span>const</span> chrono<span>::</span>time_point<span>&lt;</span>Clock, Duration<span>&gt;&amp;</span> abs_time, 
                Predicate pred);
</pre>
</div>

<p>These new overloads need a predicate. The presented versions ensure to get notified if a stop request for the passed <code>std::stop_token stoken</code> is signaled. They return a boolean that indicates whether the predicate evaluates to <code>true</code>. This returned boolean is independent of whether a stop was requested or of whether the timeout was triggered.</p>
<p>After the wait calls, you can check if a stop request occurred.</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div>
<pre>cv.wait(lock, stoken, predicate);
<span>if</span> (stoken.stop_requested()){
    <span>// interrupt occurred</span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>The receiver thread (line 1) is waiting for the notification of the sender thread (line 2). Before the sender thread sends its notification (line 3), the main thread triggered a stop request in<br>line (4). The output of the program shows that the stop request happened before the notification.</p>

is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of
locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least
energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive
showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a
showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good.</p><p>But then, somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the
efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a
human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the
charts.</p><p>And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the
most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with.</p><p>It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMgMrNDlg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=322">Steve Jobs (1980)</a></p></blockquote><p>* * *</p><p><a href="https://www.it-hiroshima.ac.jp/institution/library/pdf/research52%5F007-013.pdf">No one knows</a> when or how we, the human species, started talking to each
other. It is likely a natural progression from gesturing, but we can only
speculate about it.</p><p>Language allowed us to break out of our brains and reveal the inner
workings of our consciousness to others.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/language_speech.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Scott H. Young"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2018/12/04/25-thinking-tools/">Scott H. Young</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Language is the vessel that carried us from the stone age through the
agricultural revolution, the development of written language, the
scientific and industrial revolutions, and now, the digital age.</p><p>Writing allowed us to <em>offload</em> memories to the physical world—outside of
our brains. Through our collective and external memories, each generation
has a head start on the previous one. Little by little, standing on the
shoulders of taller and taller giants, we accumulate knowledge about
ourselves and everything around us.</p><p>We’ve been for long using tools to help us think: notebooks help us
calculate formulas, reason geometrically and preserve our ideas. With
computers, our <em>thinking</em> is now occurring outside of our brains.</p><p>Computers are extensions of our minds in that they allow us to store,
process, and retrieve information from them. With the advent of the
internet we now have immediate access to not only almost all of the
information ever produced by humankind but also to reproducible <em>thinking</em>
encoded into these machines: algorithms.</p><p>Our brain is still a much more impressive device than any of today's
computers. Computers learn
<a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nfsp-1.pdf">mostly</a>
by finding patterns in massive
quantities of examples given by us. Teaching a young kid about cars—how
to recognize one, what they are, what their purpose is, and how they're
related to other things—requires little supervision. Noam Chomsky talks
about it in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdUbIlwHRkY&amp;t=1462">this interview</a>.</p><p>Each of these processes—storing, processing and retrieving
information—have concrete effects on the physical world: if I’m in
Munich, saying “show route to Hamburg” to my phone will immediately show me
the distance, ETAs and paths for different types of transport to reach my
destination. Not only do I now suddenly know how to navigate across the
country to reach another city, I’m also able to follow through the exact
path via GPS—a sixth sense giving me perfect geolocation!</p><p>These <em>things</em> that we created—computers, and the internet—are literally
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502424/">rewiring our brains</a>, right now, shaping how we think, and engage in social
relationships, changing not only our individual selves but the societies we
live in.</p><p>They started as mechanical machines that filled entire laboratories, turned
into beige boxes in our homes and places of work, and are now sleek slabs
of plastic, metal and glass in everyone’s pockets. Step by step they get
closer to our bodies, their interfaces more intuitive and natural.</p><p>The way we communicate with them is changing: before, we could only
interact with them by speaking their language. We have now taught them
ours. The torch of progress blazes on: it’s a matter of <em>time</em> until they’re
connected directly with our brains—which is equally terrifying and
awe-inspiring.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/neuralink.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Neuralink"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Brain-computer interfaces present a monumental scientific and engineering
challenge, and brain-to-brain, a whole other category of difficulty.</p><p>First, we have no idea how information is encoded in the brain. That needs
to be understood. Second, even assuming we’re able to take a perfect
snapshot of a piece of information in someone’s brain—for example, how a
particular movie scene makes them feel—we still need to be able to encode
it in a way that includes the full context of their subjective experiences.
Maybe the scene evokes unique memories of their childhood or is somehow
entangled with the smell of a particular cinema’s leather seats. Third, we
need to figure out how to safely write this perfect snapshot into someone
else’s brain in a way that can be perceived identically.</p><p>Which is to say, it’s a difficult problem. But a worthwhile one: imagine
having the capability to suddenly become aware of answers for questions you
just thought about. To expertly control <a href="https://youtu.be/PLk8Pm%5FXBJE?t=13">truly integrated</a> prosthetics giving
you superhuman abilities. To give movement to the paralized, sound to the
deaf, and sight to the blind.</p><p>What would be the impacts on society if we were able to communicate an
order of magnitude more effectively? What if <em>everyone</em> was equipped with
the same undisputed basic knowledge of history and science?</p><p>There are internal thoughts that we can attempt to describe with a thousand
words, but ultimately fail to capture in a way that’s precise, much less
comprehensible by someone else. Words and sentences are an incomplete
representation of our internal thoughts. In the same way that 3D objects
cast 2D shadows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0WjV6MmCyM">and 4D, 3D</a>) communicating through language doesn’t carry
all of our cultural and developmental context—transmitting all of that
along with every phrase would be impractical. Language is in this sense,
lossily compressed thought.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tesseract_shadow.jpg"></figure><p>Inert strings of words of ink and paper take a life of their own inside our
heads. It’s why the exact same information can be interpreted completely
differently by different people.</p><p>Before language, fire and cooking technology allowed us to reallocate
energy usage from the digestive system to the brain by outsourcing
digestion to outside of our bodies, making macronutrients more efficiently
absorbable. Almost all of a cooked meal is metabolized by the body, whereas
raw foods yield less than half of their nutrients.</p><p>Cooking is an extension of our digestive system, and enabled us to develop
large, calorie-hungry brains. It also gave us time to think: our primate
cousins spend half of their days chewing raw food to consume enough
calories to stay alive.</p><p>Brains can be seen as <em>survival machines</em>, locked inside dark skulls,
constantly building a model of the outside world by predicting and learning
through senses and memory. The biological human brain evolved to have the
necessary sophistication to not only expertly navigate and understand the
brute physical reality but also to construct <em>social</em> reality. Democracy,
religion, money: all made up by us, for us.</p><p>We remember the past so that we can predict the future, and by doing so, we
thrive.</p><p>We create technology, which functions as a non-biological extra layer to
our brains and bodies, augmenting, complementing, and sometimes replacing
our natural capabilities.</p><blockquote><p>The wheel… is an extension of the foot.</p><p>The book… is an extension of the eye…</p><p>Clothing, an extension of the skin…</p><p>Electric circuitry, an extension of the central nervous system.</p><p>—
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964)</a></p></blockquote><p>Relatively speaking, we are done evolving <em>biologically</em>. Further adaptations
and enhancements to our bodies and minds will come through technology.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/brain_layers.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Check out &amp;ldquo;Neuralink and the Brain&amp;rsquo;s Magical Future&amp;rdquo; for a very entertaining primer on the brain."><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Check out “<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future</a>” for a very entertaining primer on the brain.</p></figcaption></figure><p>To be human is to have the ability to change the world around us. The shift
from hunting and gathering to farming allowed us to spend less energy to
acquire food while giving us a predictable calorie supply.</p><p>The resulting food surplus made it possible for populations to settle down
and grow quickly while supporting people not being directly involved in the
production of food—before agriculture that was everyone’s job. For one,
it allowed some to specialize and focus on developing better farming tools
and more resistant crops, starting a vicious cycle of improvement and
consumption that continues until today.</p><p>The transition from active foraging to a more sedentary lifestyle resulted
in worse health for the general population. The average farmer worked
harder than the average forager and got a worse diet in return. Our teeth,
bones and joints became more fragile, and we became afflicted by novel
diseases coming from newly domesticated animals, carriers of pathogens that
incubated in our new densely populated cities.</p><p>Owning land suddenly became really important. Agriculture and the concept
of private property reinforced each other and grew together, allowing us to
create value and secure the fruits of our labor. It also created the
circumstances for slavery to arise, and wars to be waged.</p><p>The groups of people growing the first crops could not have anticipated all
of the collateral effects of their breakthrough. They just wanted more
food.</p><p>If the past has taught us anything is that we have to be mindful of the
consequences of our progress. In an increasingly connected world, change is
often <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/linear-thinking-in-a-nonlinear-world">nonlinear</a> and unpredictable. Cars didn’t just replace horses—they
forever changed the entire outlook of every city. Did Tim Berners-Lee
anticipate his invention adding to forces pulling whole countries apart?</p><p>Our progress will continue to bring us previously unimaginable challenges.
Against an unknowable future, it doesn’t hurt to keep improving our
capabilities to adapt and, more difficultly, to cooperate—especially at
scale.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/humanity.jpg" alt="Figure 6: &amp;ldquo;Humanity&amp;rdquo; by Pawel Kuczynski"><figcaption><p>Figure 6: “<a href="https://www.pictorem.com/24592/humanity.html">Humanity</a>” by Pawel Kuczynski</p></figcaption></figure><p>Computers are getting pretty good at driving cars—even in the most

<div>
<p>Users need to know that they can depend on the service that is provided to them. In practice, because from time to time individual elements will inevitably fail, this means you have to be able to continue in spite of those failures.</p>
<p>In this article, we discuss the concepts of dependability and fault tolerance in detail and explain how the Ably platform is designed with fault tolerant approaches to uphold its dependability guarantees.</p>
<p>As a basis for that discussion, first some definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Dependability</strong> <br>The degree to which a product or service can be relied upon. <strong>Availability</strong> and <strong>Reliability</strong> are forms of dependability.<p><strong>Availability</strong> <br>The degree to which a product or service is <strong>available</strong> for use when required. This often boils down to provisioning sufficient redundancy of resources with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/STXNRM_3.15.1/coss.doc/correlatedFailureMitigation_defining_independent_versus_correlated_failures.html">statistically independent failures</a>.</p><p><strong>Reliability</strong> <br>The degree to which the product or service <strong>conforms to its specification</strong> when in use. This means a system that is not merely available but is also engineered with extensive redundant measures to <strong>continue to work as its users expect</strong>.</p><p><strong>Fault tolerance</strong> <br>The ability of a system to continue to be <strong>dependable</strong> (both available and reliable) in the presence of certain component or subsystem failures.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fault tolerant systems tolerate faults: they’re designed to mitigate the impact of adverse circumstances and ensure the system remains dependable to the end-user. Fault-tolerance techniques can be used to improve both availability and reliability. </p>
<p>Availability can be loosely thought of as the assurance of uptime; reliability can be thought of as the quality of that uptime — that is, assurance that functionality and user experience and preserved as effectively as possible in spite of adversity.</p>
<p>If the service isn’t available to be used at the time it is needed, that’s a shortfall in availability. If the service is available, but deviates from its expected behavior when you use it, that’s a shortfall in reliability. Fault tolerant design approaches address these shortfalls to provide continuity both to business and to the user experience.</p>
<h2 id="availability-reliability-and-state">Availability, reliability, and state</h2>
<p>In most cases, the primary basis for fault tolerant design is <strong>redundancy</strong>: having more than the minimum number of components or capacity required to deliver service. The key questions relate to what form that redundancy takes and how it is managed.</p>
<p>In the physical world there is classically a distinction between</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>availability</strong> situations, where it is acceptable to stop a service and then resume it, such as stopping to change a car tire; and</li>
<li>
<strong>reliability</strong> situations, where continuity of service is essential, with redundant elements continuously in-service, such as with airplane engines. </li>
</ul>
<p>The nature of the continuity requirement impacts the way that redundant capacity needs to be provided.</p>
<p>In the context of distributed systems, at Ably we think of an analogous distinction between components that are <strong>stateless</strong> and those that are <strong>stateful</strong>, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Stateless components</strong> fulfil their function without any dependency on long-lived state. Each invocation of service can be performed independently of any previous invocation. Fault tolerant design for these components is comparatively straightforward: have sufficient resources <strong>available</strong> so that any individual invocation can be handled even if some of the resources have failed.</p>
<p><strong>Stateful components</strong> have an intrinsic dependency on state to provide service. Having state implicitly links an invocation of the service to past and future invocations. The essence of fault tolerance for these components is, as with an airplane's engines, about being able to provide continuity of operation — specifically, continuity of the state that the service depends on. &nbsp;This ensures <strong>reliability</strong>.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this article we will give examples of each of these situations and explain the engineering challenges encountered in achieving fault tolerance in practice.</p>
<h2 id="treating-failure-as-a-matter-of-course">Treating failure as a matter of course</h2>
<p>Fault tolerant designs treat failures as routine. In large-scale systems, the assumption has to be that component failures will happen sooner or later. Any individual failure must be assumed as imminent and, collectively, component failures must be expected to be occurring continuously.</p>
<p>By contrast with the physical world, failures in digital systems are typically non-binary. The classical measures of component reliability (e.g. Mean Time Between Failures, or MTBF) do not apply; services degrade along a gradient of failure. Byzantine faults are a classic example. </p>
<p>For example, a system component might work intermittently, or produce misleading output. Or you might be dependent on external partners who don’t notify you of a failure until it becomes serious on their end, making your work more difficult. </p>
<p>Being tolerant to non-binary failures requires a lot of thought, engineering and, sometimes, human intervention. Each potential failure must be identified and classified, and must then be capable of being remediated rapidly, or avoided through extensive testing and robust design decisions. The core challenge of designing fault-tolerant systems is understanding the nature of failures and how they can be detected and remediated, especially when partial or intermittent, to continue to provide the service as effectively as possible for users.</p>
<h2 id="stateless-services">Stateless services</h2>
<p>Service layers that are <strong>stateless</strong> do not have a primary requirement for continuity of service for any individual component. The availability of resources directly translates into availability of the layer as a whole. Having access to extra resources whose failures are statistically independent is key to keeping the system going. Wherever possible, layers are designed to be stateless as a key enabler not only of availability, but also of scalability. </p>
<p>For stateless objects, it suffices to have multiple and independently available components to continue to provide service. Without state, durability of any single component is not a concern.</p>

    "></figure><p>However, simply having extra resources is not enough: you also have to use them effectively. You have to have a way of detecting resource availability, and to load-balance among redundant resources. </p>
<p>As such, the questions that you have to answer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you survive different kinds of failure?</li>
<li>What level of redundancy is possible?</li>
<li>What is the resource and performance cost of maintaining those levels of redundancy?</li>
<li>What is the operational cost of managing those levels of redundancy?</li>
</ul>
<p>The consequent trade-offs are among the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer requirements for achieving high availability</li>
<li>Business operational cost</li>
<li>Real world engineering practicality of actually making it possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Redundant components, and in turn their dependencies, need to be engineered, configured and operated in <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/documents/624876/1277590549/chapt04-1.pdf">a way that ensures that any failures are statistically independent</a>. The simple math is: statistically independent failures render your chances of a catastrophic failure exponentially lower as you increase the level of redundancy. If the failures are set up to occur in statistical silos, then there is no cumulative effect, and you decrease the likelihood of complete failure by a whole order of magnitude with each additional redundant resource.</p>
<p>At Ably, to increase statistical independence of failures, <a href="https://www.ably.io/network">we place/distribute capacity in multiple availability zones and in multiple regions</a>. Offering service from multiple availability zones within the same region is relatively simple: AWS enables this with very little effort. Availability zones generally have a good track record of failing independently, so this step by itself enables the existence of sufficient redundancy to support very high levels of availability.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t the whole story. It isn’t sufficient to rely on any specific region for multiple reasons – sometimes multiple availability zones (AZs) do fail at the same time; sometimes there might be local connectivity issues making the region unreachable; and sometimes there might simply be capacity limitations in a region that prevent all services from being supportable there. As a result, we also promote service availability by providing service in multiple regions. This is the ultimate way of ensuring statistical independence of failures.</p>
<p>Establishing redundancy that spans multiple regions is not as straightforward as supporting multiple AZs. For example, it doesn’t make sense simply to have a load balancer distributing requests among regions; the load balancer itself exists in some region and could become unavailable. </p>
<p>Instead, we use a <a href="https://knowledge.ably.com/routing-around-network-and-dns-issues">combination of measures</a> to ensure that client requests can at all times be routed to a region that is believed to be healthy and have service available. This routing will preferably be to the nearest region, but routing to non-local regions must be possible when the nearest region is unable to provide service.</p>
<h2 id="stateful-services">Stateful services</h2>
<p>At Ably, <a href="https://www.ably.io/four-pillars-of-dependability#reliability">reliability</a> means business continuity of <em>stateful</em> services, and it is a substantially more complicated problem to solve than just availability. </p>
<p>Stateful services have an intrinsic dependency on state that survives each individual invocation of service. Continuity of that state translates into correctness of the service provided by the layer as a whole. That requirement for continuity means that fault tolerance for these services is achieved by thinking of them in classic reliability terms. Redundancy needs to be continuously in use, in order for the state not to become lost in the case of failure. Fault detection and remediation needs to address the possible Byzantine failure modes via consensus formation mechanisms.</p>
<p>The most simplistic analogy is with airplane safety. An airplane crash is catastrophic because you – and your state – are on a <em>specific</em> airplane; it is <em>that</em> airplane which must provide continuous service. If it fails to do so, state is lost and you are afforded no opportunity to continue by migrating to a different airplane. </p>

    <article>
        <p>It's been a long time since I've written a post on Hydra (my home server). I use Hydra as a testbed to learn new tools, workflows and it just gives me joy to self-host applications while learning something in return.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>A brief history of how <a href="https://github.com/mr-karan/hydra">Hydra's</a> setup evolved over time:</p>
<p><a href="https://mrkaran.dev/posts/home-server-setup/">2019</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>A pretty minimal K3s setup deployed on 2 RPi4 nodes. I couldn't continue with this setup because:
<ul>
<li>Some of the apps didn't have ARM-based image (this was 2019, pre M1 hype era).</li>
<li>Didn't want to risk deploying persistent workloads on RPi.</li>
<li>A lot of tooling to deploy workloads was missing (storing env variables for eg.).</li>
<li>It was so boring to write YAML (that I also did at work). Didn't give me joy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://mrkaran.dev/posts/home-server-updates/">2020 First Half</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>RPi 2x Nodes + K3s + DO Droplet. Tailscale for networking.
<ul>
<li>This was a considerable step up from the previous setup. I deployed a DO node and added <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes/">Node Labels</a> to deploy persistent workloads on DO Node only.</li>
<li>I used my own tooling <a href="https://github.com/mr-karan/kubekutr/">Kubekutr</a> + Kustomize which helped with version control of my configs.</li>
<li>Took quite a bit of time to onboard new services. Got lazy, didn't host much apart from initial 3-4 applications.</li>
<li>Writing long YAMLs. No joy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2020 Second Half:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single node on DO. Terraform for deploying Docker containers.
<ul>
<li>I believe the third iteration nailed it for me. I kept the setup super simple, used Terraform for deploying workloads as Docker containers.</li>
<li>Used Terraform extensively for setting up the node, Cloudflare records, DO firewall rules.</li>
<li>Time to onboard new services reduced from a couple of hours to a few minutes. This was a huge win for me. I deployed around 10-15 new services to try it out on the server directly.</li>
<li>Writing HCL is actually a much better experience than YAML.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-nomad">Why Nomad</h2>
<p><img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/nomad-hydra.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Around a month back, <a href="https://nadh.in/">Kailash</a> had asked about feedback on <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a>. We at <a href="https://zerodha.com/">Zerodha</a> (India's largest stock broker) are evaluating it to migrate our services to Nomad from Kubernetes (more on this later). It was almost 2 years since I last saw Nomad so it was definitely worth re-evaluating (esp since it hit 1.0 recently). I wanted to try out Nomad to answer a personal curiosity: <em>What does it do differently than Kubernetes?</em> No better way than actually getting hands dirty, right?!</p>
<p>After following the brief tutorials from the <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/nomad">official website</a> I felt confident to try it for actual workloads. In my previous setup, I was hosting quite a few applications (Pihole, Gitea, Grafana etc) and thought it'll be a nice way to learn how Nomad works by deploying the same services in the Nomad cluster. And I came in with zero expectations, I already had a nice setup which was reliable and running for me. My experience with a local Nomad cluster was joyful, I was able to quickly go from 0-&gt;1 in less than 30 minutes. This BTW is a strong sign of how easy Nomad is to get started with as compared to K8s. The sheer amount of different concepts you've to register in your mind before you can even deploy a single container in a K8s cluster is bizarre. Nomad takes the easy way out here and simplified the concepts for developers into just three things:</p>
<pre><code><span>job
  \_ group
        \_ task
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Job: Job is a collection of different groups. Job is where the constraints for type of scheduler, update strategies and ACL is placed. </li>
<li>Group: Group is a collection of different tasks. A group is always executed on the same Nomad client node. You'll want to use Groups for use-cases like a logging sidecar, reverse proxies etc.</li>
<li>Task: Atomic unit of work. A task in Nomad can be running a container/binary/Java VM etc, defining the mount points, env variables, ports to be exposed etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're coming from K8s you can think of Task as a Pod and Group as a Replicaset. There's no equivalent to Job in K8s. BUT! The coolest part? You don't have to familiarise yourself with all different types of Replicasets (Deployments, Daemonsets, Statefulsets) and different ways of configuring them.</p>
<p>Want to make a normal job as a periodic job in Nomad? Simply add the following block to your existing Job:</p>
<pre><code><span>periodic {
  cron = "@daily"
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>You want to make a service run as a batch job (on all Nomad nodes -- the equivalent of Daemonset in K8s)? Simply make the following change to your existing job:</p>
<pre><code><span>-type="service"
</span><span>+type="batch"
</span></code></pre>
<p>You see <strong>this</strong> is what I mean by the focus on UX. There are many many such examples which will leave a nice smile on your face if you're coming from K8s background.</p>
<p>I'd recommend reading <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/internals/architecture">Internal Architecture</a> of Nomad if you want to understand this in-depth.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>Tech stack for Hydra:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tailscale VPN: Serves as a mesh layer between my laptop/mobile and DO server. Useful for exposing internal services.</li>
<li>Caddy for reverse proxying and automatic SSL setup for all services. I run 2 instances of Caddy:
<ul>
<li>Internal: Listens on Tailscale Network Interface. Reverse proxies all private services.</li>
<li>Public: Listens on DO's Public IPv4 network interface. Reverse proxies all public-facing services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Terraform: Primary component to have IaC (Infra as Code). Modules to manage:
<ul>
<li>Cloudflare DNS Zone and Records</li>
<li>DO Droplet, Firewall rules, SSH Keys, Floating IPs etc.</li>
<li>Nomad Jobs. Used for running workloads after templating env variables, config files in Nomad job files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="complexity-of-nomad-vs-kubernetes">Complexity of Nomad vs Kubernetes</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mrkaran_/status/1268762357355823104"><img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/k8s-meme.jpeg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Nomad shines because it follows the UNIX philosophy of "Make each program do one thing well". To put simply, Nomad is <em>just</em> a workload orchestrator. It only is concerned about things like Bin Packing, scheduling decisions.</p>
<p>If you're running heterogeneous workloads, running a server (or a set of servers) quickly becomes expensive. Hence orchestrators tend to make sense in this context. They tend to save costs by making it efficient to run a vast variety of workloads. This is all an orchestrator has to do really. </p>
<p>Nomad doesn't interfere in your DNS setup, Service Discovery, secrets management mechanisms and pretty much anything else. If you read some of the posts at <a href="https://k8s.af/">Kubernetes Failure Stories</a>, the most common reason for outages is Networking (DNS, ndots etc). A lot of marketing around K8s never talks about these things.</p>
<p>I always maintain "Day 0 is easy, Day N is the real test of your skills". Anyone can deploy a workload to a K8s cluster, it's always the Day N operations which involve debugging networking drops, mysterious container restarts, proper resource allocations and other such complex issues that require real skills <strong>and</strong> effort. It's not as easy as <code>kubectl apply -f</code> and my primary gripe is with people who miss out on this in their "marketing" pitches (obvious!).</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-nomad">When to use Nomad</h2>
<p>Nomad hits the sweet spot of being operationally easy and functional. Nomad is a great choice if you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run not just containers but other forms of workloads.</li>
<li>Increase developer productivity by making it easier to deploy/onboard new services.</li>
<li>Consistent experience of deployment by testing the deployments locally.</li>
<li>(Not joking) You are tired of running Helm charts or writing large YAML manifests. The config syntax for Nomad jobs is human friendly and easy to grasp.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nomad is available as a single binary. If you want to try it locally, all you need is <code>sudo nomad agent -dev</code> and you'll have a Nomad Server, Client running in dev mode along with a UI. This makes it easy for the developers to test out the deployments locally because there's very little configuration difference between this and production deployment. Not to forget it's super easy to self-host Nomad clusters. I'm yet to meet anyone who self hosts K8s clusters in production without a dedicated team babysitting it always.</p>
<p>Once you eliminate the "blackbox" components from your stack, life becomes easier for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-not-use-nomad">When to not use Nomad</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you're relying on custom controllers and operators. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">Operator Pattern</a> is a new way of managing large complex distributed systems (like databases, job queues etc). There are a lot of community built operators which help in reducing the effort to run these services. However, all of these are tied deeply into the "Kubernetes" ecosystem. If you find yourself running any of such operators, it'll be tough (not impossible) to translate the same in Nomad ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>genuinely</em> cannot think of any other reason to not use Nomad!</p>
<h2 id="practical-scenarios">Practical Scenarios</h2>
<p>Since I migrated a couple of workloads from my DO docker containers setup to Nomad, I'd demonstrate a few use cases which might be helpful if you want to start migrating your services to Nomad</p>
<h3 id="accessing-a-web-service-with-reverse-proxy">Accessing a Web service with Reverse Proxy</h3>
<p>Context: I'm running Caddy as a reverse proxy for all the services. Since we discussed earlier, Nomad <strong>only</strong> is concerned about scheduling, so how exactly do you do Service Discovery? You need Consul (or something like Consul, Nomad has no hard restrictions) to register a service name with it's IP Address. Here's how you can do that:</p>
<p>In the <code>.task</code> section of your Nomad job spec, you need to register the service name with the port you're registering and additional tags as metadata (optional):</p>
<pre><code><span>service {
  name = "gitea-web"
  tags = ["gitea", "web"]
  port = "http"
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nomad's <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/template">template</a> uses <code>consul-template</code> behind the scenes. This is a small utility which continuously watches for Consul/Vault keys and provides the ability to reload/restart your workloads if any of those keys change. It can also be used to <em>discover</em> the address of the service registered in Consul. So here's an example of <code>Caddyfile</code> using Consul Template functions to pull the IP address of the upstream <code>gitea-web</code> service:</p>
<pre><code><span>git.mrkaran.dev {
    {{ range service "gitea-web" }}
    reverse_proxy {{ .Address }}:{{ .Port }}
    {{ end }}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>When a job is submitted to Nomad, a rendered template is mounted inside the container. You can define actions on what to do when the values change. For eg on a redeployment of Gitea container, the address will most likely change. We'd like Caddy to automatically restart with the new address configured in the Caddyfile in that case:</p>
<pre><code><span>template {
  data = &lt;&lt;EOF
${caddyfile_public}
EOF

  destination = "configs/Caddyfile" # Rendered template.

  change_mode = "restart"
}
</span></code></pre>

February 15, 2021 | https://sequoia-pgp.org/blog/2021/01/26/202101-sq-release/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sequoia-pgp.org/blog/2021/01/26/202101-sq-release/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content">
                          <p>Last month we released version 1.0 of our versatile, low-level OpenPGP
library, <a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/blog/2020/12/16/202012-1.0/">sequoia-openpgp</a>.  Now we have released the first version of
<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sq/index.html"><code>sq</code></a>, version 0.23, which is meant for general use.</p>
<p><code>sq</code> is a command-line tool that intends to expose much (but not all!)
of the functionality that the library provides.  Although we fully
intend for <code>sq</code> to be an OpenPGP swiss army knife, and that the truly
arcane should—in general—be possible, we firstly want <code>sq</code> to be
usable by humans at the command line.  We understand this to mean that
it should be possible to use <code>sq</code> to tweak and twiddle OpenPGP data.
But, those who have the desire to use Sequoia to frob it will need to
use the library.  And, they are probably better served by it anyway.</p>
<p><code>sq</code> has a subcommand-style interface similar to git.  This has the
advantage that every command has its own option name space, which
makes it much easier to understand exactly what options influence a
given command.</p>
<p>In terms of functionality, <code>sq</code> already provides the base operations
that any OpenPGP user needs in their day-to-day use: key generation
(<code>sq key generate</code>), encryption (<code>sq encrypt</code>) &amp; decryption (<code>sq decrypt</code>), signing (<code>sq sign</code>) &amp; verification (<code>sq verify</code>), key
certification (<code>sq certify</code>), and key server (<code>sq keyserver</code>) &amp; <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service-11">web
key directory</a> (WKD) (<code>sq wkd</code>) interaction.  It also includes some
utility functions.  It can generate a WKD (<code>sq wkd generate</code>), encode
and decode <a href="https://autocrypt.org/level1.html#the-autocrypt-header">Autocrypt headers</a> (<code>sq autocrypt</code>), manipulate keyrings
(<code>sq keyring</code>), inspect OpenPGP-related data like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(command)"><code>file</code></a> does (<code>sq inspect</code>), and pretty print an OpenPGP file’s contents (<code>sq packet dump</code>).</p>
<p><code>sq</code> is still missing a fair amount of functionality.  In particular,
there is no public or private key store.  (Although prototypes exist.)
This means all OpenPGP certificates must be stored in files, which is
not scalable.  Also, many necessary and useful commands are still
missing.  For instance, it is not currently possible to add new
subkeys to a certificate, or change their expiration date.</p>
<p><code>sq</code> is also not ready to be used from scripts.  Although we are
unlikely to change the current API, the bigger problem is that <code>sq</code>’s
output is not machine readable.  In the medium term, we plan to add a
<code>JSON</code>-output mode to every command.  Given the legion of <code>JSON</code>
parsers, this should effectively eliminate the need for tools that
consume <code>sq</code>’s output to have to parse it manually, and will hopefully
eliminate an entire class of common security-sensitive bugs.</p>
<p>Until now, we haven’t published <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sequoia-sq"><code>sq</code> on <code>crates.io</code></a>, and we’ve
discouraged packagers from including it in their distribution.  We now
think that <code>sq</code> is ready for general use.  If you have suggestions,
please <a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/contribute/">reach out</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-demo">A Quick Demo</h2>
<p>Creating an OpenPGP key is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq key generate --export /tmp/alice.sec -u 'Alice &lt;alice@example.org&gt;'
</code></pre><p><code>sq</code> saves the key in <code>/tmp/alice.sec</code> and a generic revocation
certificate in <code>/tmp/alice.sec.rev</code>.</p>
<p>We can use <code>sq inspect</code> to examine the new key’s structure:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq inspect /tmp/alice.sec
/tmp/alice.sec: Transferable Secret Key.

</code></pre><p>Here we see that <code>sq</code> uses ECC by default, and generates a signing
subkey and an encryption subkey.  (<code>sq key generate</code> has options to
tweak both the cipher suite and the key’s structure.)  <code>sq</code> generates
a signing subkey by default to prevent an attacker from repurposing a
signature over data as a certification or binding signature.</p>
<p>The secret key material is unencrypted by default.  Supplying the
<code>--with-password</code> option will cause <code>sq</code> to prompt for a password and
use it to encrypt the secret key material.</p>
<p>We can use <code>sq packet dump</code> to get even more details:</p>

...
</code></pre><p>For the sake of brevity, I’ve only shown the User ID and the
corresponding self signature.  An interesting thing to note here is
the <code>salt@notations.sequoia-pgp.org</code> notation.  This is a random
32-byte value, which Sequoia inserts into every signature by default.
Because it is unpredictable, it is harder for an attacker to trick a
user into signing a specific message.</p>
<p>It is possible to get even more details by supplying the <code>--hex</code>
option to <code>sq packet dump</code>.  This causes it to print a descriptive map
of the packets' contents, which is useful if you are dissecting an
OpenPGP message.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>This is the resource I wish I had when I was getting started in hacking video games. Specifically, hacking PC video games on the Windows operating system. This article aims to give you a roadmap forward to becoming a video game hacker, along with plenty of resources to dive deeper.</p><h2 id="beginner">Beginner</h2><p>Want to become invincible, have unlimited ammo, or just be super rich in your game? This section is usually all you'll need.</p><h3 id="modifying-values-in-memory">Modifying values in memory</h3><p>When you're playing an offline game (and even with most online games), every value you see in the game is stored in memory. So the first thing you'll need to do is learn how to find those values and modify them. The most common tool to do so is <a href="https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php">Cheat Engine</a>.</p><p>Cheat Engine has its own built-in tutorial for finding and modifying in-memory values. It's not exactly straight-forward to complete as a beginner though, so here's an excellent walkthrough video by the ever helpful <a href="https://twitter.com/guidedhacking">Guided Hacking</a>:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nib69uZJCaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Believe it or not, that's really all you need to do basic game hacking. Yay! 🎉</p><h3 id="aside-cheat-engine">Aside: Cheat Engine</h3><p>Cheat Engine is completely free, and supported by bundled software and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cheatengine">Patreon donations</a>. As with anything, if you find it's of value to you, please consider donating. It's also <a href="https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine">open-source</a>, and oddly written mostly in Pascal (although almost everything outside of the core is written in C &amp; C++).</p><p>This section is all about how to do some more interesting and creative game hacks, as well as how to bypass common restrictions game developers put into their software. It's at this point that you'll need to start looking at assembly code. But don't worry, it's not as complicated as you may think (especially if you have experience with at least one other high level programming language). There are only a small handful of instructions that come up often:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><code>mov</code></li>
<li><code>lea</code></li>
<li><code>jmp</code>/<code>jxx</code></li>
<li><code>cmp</code></li>
<li><code>test</code></li>
<li><code>add</code>/<code>sub</code>/<code>mul</code></li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>A good reference for the x86 &amp; amd64 instruction set can be found here: https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/.</p><h3 id="debugging-reverse-engineering">Debugging &amp; reverse engineering</h3><p>If you want to understand some more complex logic in a game, you're going to need to look at the disassembly of the binary (the assembly code). That means attaching a debugger and setting breakpoints, so you can walk through the exact steps that a game takes for a given functionality. Sometimes you may not be able to debug the source code (see the section on anti-debugging later on), or you may just want to graph out how different functions interact in the game; in this case, you'll want to use a static disassembler.</p><p>Personally, I go for debugging first, as I can usually get a much better understanding for how a game works by watching it as it runs through specific functionality. I then switch to the static disassembly later on if I want to really get an understanding for a specific section of the binary.</p><p>Once you become proficient at following through the assembly of a program, you can do fun things like this...</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KtWpNmaVWk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="debugging-tools">Debugging tools</h3><p>Cheat Engine works really well as a debugger, and it includes pretty much everything you need.</p><p>I also like to use <a href="https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg">x64dbg</a>, as it includes a lot of great features (for example - open multiple dump memory dump tabs at once, built-in scripting support, and an ecosystem of great plugins like <a href="https://github.com/ThunderCls/xAnalyzer">xAnalyzer</a>). x64dbg also displays the meaning of every assembly code as you step through it, and it also translates the values for you (i.e. it fetches the value of a pointer), which is really helpful.</p><p>You <em>*could*</em> use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">WinDbg</a>, but it doesn't handle anti-debug measures very well, and the interface isn't nearly as intuitive as x64dbg.</p><h3 id="static-disassemblers">Static disassemblers</h3><p>The best free static disassembler out there right now is probably <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra">Ghidra</a>, and it's pretty good.</p><p>The gold standard disassembler is <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/">IDA Pro</a>, but be prepared to spend an arm and a leg (in the ballpark of $2000+ USD per year).</p><p><a href="https://binary.ninja/">Binary Ninja</a> is also a good commercial option, but it's lacking the vast plugin ecosystem that IDA Pro (and even Ghidra) has, and they don't (at the time of writing) have any Windows API function signatures like IDA Pro does with <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth/">FLIRT</a> that eases a lot of Windows-based reverse engineering.</p><p>There's also a <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware/">free version of IDA</a> that is great as a standalone disassembler, but you don't get any plugin support, no decompiler, and you're locked at an older version of the product.</p><h3 id="reverse-engineering-resources">Reverse Engineering Resources</h3><p>To see debugging and light reverse engineering in action, I would highly recommend checking out Chris Fayte's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BloodFayte">Cheat The Game</a> YouTube channel.</p><p>For some more advanced reverse engineering videos (with excellent video quality and editing), check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LiveOverflowCTF">LiveOverflow's YouTube channel</a>.</p><h3 id="bypass-anti-debug">Bypass anti-debug</h3><p>Many games come with a range of anti-debug measures that are designed to prevent you from attaching a debugger to the game. If you want to learn more about the exact types of measures they take, I would highly recommend <a href="https://anti-reversing.com/Downloads/Anti-Reversing/The_Ultimate_Anti-Reversing_Reference.pdf">Peter Ferrie's "The Ultimate Anti-Debugging Reference" [pdf]</a>. But if you just want to get on with debugging your game, I'd recommend just doing the following:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>Add <a href="https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide">ScyllaHide</a> as a plugin to x64dbg.</li>
<li>Launch your game using x64dbg. This will launch it with the anti-anti-debug measures in place.</li>
<li>(Optional) Detach from your game in x64dbg and attach using your debugger of choice.</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>You can find some more information about ScyllaHide, as well as the anti-debug measures they counteract in their <a href="https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide/releases/download/docs-2019-05-17/ScyllaHide.pdf">documentation [pdf]</a>.</p><h3 id="automating-with-cheat-engine">Automating with Cheat Engine</h3><p>Cheat engine has a LOT of functionality. When you're looking to do some more complex hacks, you're going to start using the <a href="https://wiki.cheatengine.org/index.php?title=Tutorials:Auto_Assembler:Basics">auto assembler</a> to modify assembly instructions (and not just data types) in memory.</p><p>I don't think there's anyone better than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StephenChapman">Stephen Chapman</a> for showing you how to do this. In fact, he put together an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNffuWEygffbbT9Vz-Y1NXQxv2m6mrmHr">entire YouTube playlist of Cheat Engine tutorials</a> that I would highly recommend. He uses Cheat Engine almost exclusively in his videos, so it'll give you a good idea of some of the magical things you can do with just one tool.</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiX1eQhSboE">make</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnZyZio5FBQ">entire</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2G-09v9rO4">trainers</a> in Cheat Engine.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uiX1eQhSboE?list=PLNffuWEygffbbT9Vz-Y1NXQxv2m6mrmHr" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Cheat Engine even supports Lua scripting, which makes it much easier to customize the functionality of your game hacks. There is an extensive set of both <a href="https://wiki.cheatengine.org/index.php?title=Lua">documented</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/blob/master/Cheat%20Engine/bin/celua.txt">undocumented</a> Lua functions already built-in.</p><p>If you want to see just how much you can do with Cheat Engine, check out <a href="https://github.com/flarn2006/SA2CheatTable">this cheat table for Sonic Adventure 2</a>. I've yet to see a more advanced and comprehensive cheat table.</p><p>Once you get beyond simply finding and replacing values in memory, Cheat Engine can pretty much help you do anything else you want with most games.</p><h3 id="automating-with-c-">Automating with C++</h3><p>If you're really hardcore, you can automate any of your hacks with C++, mostly using the Windows API directly. I won't go into too much depth here, but you'll mostly be using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess"><code>OpenProcess()</code></a> to get a handle to the game process, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-readprocessmemory"><code>ReadProcessMemory()</code></a> to read the memory from the game process, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory"><code>WriteProcesMemory()</code></a> to write to the game process' memory. This method is known as an "external" hack because you're performing your actions from outside of the game process. You can do what's called an "internal" hack, where you first inject your own cheat process into the game process, and then read and write memory from inside the game's process.</p><p>Exactly how to do an internal or external hack goes a little beyond the scope of this article, but if you're interested in doing this, <a href="https://guidedhacking.com/threads/how-to-hack-any-game-tutorial-c-trainer-1-external.10897/">here's an example of an external hack using the Assault Cube game on Windows</a>, including source code. <a href="https://guidedhacking.com/threads/how-to-hack-any-game-tutorial-c-trainer-3-first-internal.12142/">This article</a> builds on that to perform an internal hack, including source code.</p><p>Why would you use C++ over Cheat Engine? It usually comes down to more low-level Windows API access (usually to bypass anti-cheat), or just personal preference. Cheat Engine is enough to do most game hacks, until you get into the more advanced game hacking...</p><h2 id="advanced">Advanced</h2><p>Some advanced topics that go beyond the scope of this beginner resource include:</p><h3 id="bypassing-anti-cheat">Bypassing anti-cheat</h3><p>Many online games include anti-cheat measures that go way beyond simple anti-debug tricks. More modern online games are also moving to anti-cheat solutions that operate in kernel mode, which makes it even trickier to bypass without writing your own Windows kernel driver, or exploiting a vulnerability in an existing kernel mode driver (<a href="https://guidedhacking.com/threads/vulnerable-kernel-drivers-for-exploitation.15979/#post-97057">here are a few you can use</a>). If you're interested in seeing how this is done, <a href="https://secret.club/">Secret Club</a> has a whole bunch of high quality articles on bypassing kernel mode anti-cheat software.</p><h3 id="visual-overlays">Visual overlays</h3><p>If you want to do something like an ESP hack (see where everyone is on the map) without writing to the game's process (for example, to prevent tripping anti-cheat software), you'll need to start writing overlay windows using something like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/directx-12-programming-guide">Microsoft DirectX</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i8Cn7fydNUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="network-interception-traffic-modification">Network interception &amp; traffic modification</h3><p>With online games in particular, some data may not even be exposed in client-side memory. In these cases, you'll need to intercept and modify traffic sent to the game servers. In most cases (but not all) these days, that traffic is encrypted, and the SSL certificate is usually pinned in the app, so traditional SSL interception measures won't work. Luckily, the traffic needs to be decrypted at <em>*some point*</em> in memory, which means you can still read and modify that data if you know where to look.</p><h2 id="other-resources">Other resources</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Here are some resources that I haven't mentioned in the post, but are still noteworthy:</p>

This assessment lasted eight hours but I did not need that long to make a decision on whether I was going to join the team, should an offer be made. I made that decision during the lunch break. At lunch I met a future colleague who had strong opinions about 3D printing. Over our meals of rice and chicken stew, we had a fascinating discussion about additive manufacturing techniques. He made very good points and I was enchanted by the fact that GRIT had brilliant engineers who were heterodox in their thinking and approach. I was completely sold on the company.</p><p>At the time, I had recently graduated with a degree in Physics and was a self-taught electronics hobbyist with an internship at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ayukuelect/"><span>Ayuku Electronics</span></a> under my belt. At Ayuku, I had learnt to produce custom LED display products but nothing on the scale as my new job would require.</p><p>Looking back now, a year and four months after I left GRIT Systems, I remember my time there fondly. The company is not active anymore, and my former colleagues have by now moved on to other things. But the technology we built together stands for itself. In many ways I became a real engineer at GRIT Systems: performed some amazing technical feats, delivered projects for multinationals, hired brilliant people, and led a great team. And this is the story of how we did it.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1613321120902_5099"><div>

Even those with access to the grid do not have a steady supply. This is one of the causes of the country’s underwhelming manufacturing sector, it also affects the general productivity. GRIT Systems was founded in 2015 against this backdrop, with the belief that to solve a problem as endemic as Nigeria’s power crisis, having reliable data on electricity usage was the key. If one had data across the entire value chain - from generation, to distribution, and then consumption - one could solve real problems. So we set out to collect this data.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1613321291084_7092"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1613321291084_8843"><div><p>The company built hardware devices to measure electricity usage of buildings as well as a software platform (web and mobile) for data analytics. The company also designed a series of modern smart electricity meters for the larger electricity distribution market. The products were targeted at building owners, energy auditors, and IPPs (independent power producers).</p><p>The company built an enviable structure that enabled rapid prototyping, but manufacturing was a hard nut to crack. Making electronics is easy on paper. You need your design, simulate the circuit behaviour with computer software, then prototype on a breadboard. Some more complex circuits require a PCB (printed circuit board) from the beginning. We kept an inventory of the most utilized components so that most prototypes could be made quickly. The stash was quite something, we probably had more variety of passive and active components than many electronics shops in Arena Market, Lagos.&nbsp;</p><p>For more involved concepts, the components were sourced online through Chinese suppliers or bought on popular online platforms such as Digi-Key, Arrow or Farnell. Shipping from Europe or North America was always quite expensive. Most components arrive in Nigeria by air, usually through a freight company. But getting here is the easy part. Delays to clear the ports, seizure for frivolous reasons, and other customs inefficiencies complicate the simple process of buying a component online and getting it delivered. Some entrepreneurs like <a href="https://hub360.com.ng/"><span>Hub360</span></a> are trying to solve this problem. But for anyone building something unique or moderately complex, sourcing overseas is inevitable.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from component sourcing, another big problem we had at GRIT was PCB fabrication. Printed Circuit Boards, popularly known as ‘board’ or ‘panel’ on the streets of Alaba or Computer Village, are at the heart of any electronic product. Our ecosystem is yet to produce PCBs at scale. Local PCB houses that can churn out prototypes in days or a week are needed, these companies will eliminate the challenge of rapid prototyping most hardware teams face in the country. However, it remains to be seen if the market is large enough to sustain these kinds of businesses. It’s almost a chicken and egg question to which I have no definite answer. GRIT&nbsp; solved many of these challenges in unique ways that ultimately slowed us down.&nbsp;</p><h3>Running on all cylinders</h3><p>GRIT Systems had a formal hierarchical organizational structure on paper, although in reality it was flat. At the very top of its management was Ifedayo, who was the CEO and founder. The engineering team was led by the CTO, supported by the software and hardware team leads. But in truth, everyone reported to the CEO.</p><p>When it came to company culture, it was a high-octane environment. GRIT was a very difficult place for those who are not high achieving: first class degree in EE, started coding in high school, solved maths while dreaming, built racing drones in university, would prefer a dev board&nbsp; instead of a cake on their birthday - that type of high-achieving. People were expected to be self-starters, and capable of learning new things very quickly with little or no supervision.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1613321291084_11577"><div>

Friday (not his real name) struggled when he first joined us for his 6 months undergraduate internship. He was handed tasks he felt were beyond his capabilities, and I remember supervising him as he designed a device to easily test the magnetic hysteresis of ferrite cores. Ultimately, the experience he got from such a difficult task helped crystalize his academic knowledge into real know-how. He gained confidence in his abilities and he even went on to design software that was very valuable to the company.</p><p>Arguments happened a lot at GRIT and a lot of them were over technical details. For example, we once spent weeks evaluating the best Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for a major project. An RTOS is a piece of firmware that a processor uses to manage real-time tasks. Unlike other types of software, physical computing sometimes has real-time constraints and a failure to meet this constraint could be catastrophic. This firmware helps manage the timing requirements in an efficient way that’s almost impossible for an applications programmer to do from scratch, which makes it expensive.</p><div><p>With cost, efficiency and safety certification in mind, an engineer at GRIT spent weeks evaluating different RTOS options, he profiled different pieces of software and made a final recommendation that saved us thousands of dollars. Sometimes, the new intern prevailed over the battle-tested engineer in a technical debate. It was really a meritocracy. </p><p>Everybody at GRIT was an expert at something, and more importantly, everyone was willing to share their expertise. There are not many companies where the CEO is willing to have pair-programming sessions with an intern, although I am still undecided on whether this was a positive thing in itself. I have to give credit to the brilliant and amazing people I met and worked with at GRIT Systems. Ifedayo, Ikenna (my immediate boss), and Emmanuel were big influences in my career. I learnt a great deal talking to them and since I didn’t have an engineering education, conversations with my colleagues filled many gaps for me.&nbsp;</p></div><h3>Where it went downhill</h3><div><p>GRIT was not a perfect place, I must have made that pretty clear by now. There are things I wish I did differently. We ran at a fast pace, and sometimes hired brilliant engineers who were not just compatible with our speed. I feel I did not do enough for some junior colleagues who needed help. Once, we hired a brilliant engineer who was a great programmer on the hardware team but the hardware team required full-stack engineers. Not full-stack in the software sense but full-stack in the sense that they are comfortable with designing hardware, writing firmware for microcontrollers, doing math analysis, and writing python scripts for systems automation.</p><p>This engineer was evidently skilled at web development and he would have been immediately productive on the software team, but he envisioned a career in robotics so he stuck to his guns and remained on the hardware team. He made mistakes which hurt his confidence and as a result I didn’t like assigning difficult tasks to him. I should have been more patient with him and more forceful in my defense of his performance during reviews. He was eventually let go, and he moved on to software development at his next job. I believe the whole event traumatized him enough that he left hardware.&nbsp;</p></div><p>The organization as a …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></main></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
        
<p>It surprises me to no end that founders and VCs, which pride themselves on being economically rational actors, can't imagine a world where everyone else is also a somewhat economically rational actor.</p>
<h2>i - Maintenance cost disease</h2>
<p>For most software companies and products, development costs seem to increase as they age. Even if the core focus of those companies or products remains unchanged, easy examples being Uber, eBay, Paypal, Lyft and Facebook.</p>
<p>I can present the paradox in a single drawing</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cerebralab.com/images/corp_cost_1.png" alt="img 1"></p>
<p><em>(lines represent trends, not absolute values)</em></p>
<p>The hidden variable here is "team size". As these companies get older they accumulate engineers, but the quality of developers decreases.</p>
<p>The mean salary isn't decreasing due to salary cuts to the original team, it decreases because of the original team cashing out, retiring or starting their own companies, leading to a desperate attempt at replacing each of them with a lot of low paid interns.</p>
<p>This trend seems ubiquitous among large companies, the bit where their core product becomes worst is arguable, the bit where average salaries decrease is fairly indisputable if you include the shares early developers get as part of their compensation.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>I'd expect a "healthy" version of the above graph to look closer to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cerebralab.com/images/corp_cost_2.png" alt="img 1"></p>
<p>The hidden variable, "team size", starts going down instead of up after the company matures. Salaries increase for longer and remain high because the original developers must be paid large amounts to stay in the team, even though most still probably leave after a while. Getting "replacements" for them is very expensive, they might need months or years of training to get up to speed (the codebase is old and complicated) and arguably have to be smarter than the original devs. After all, creating code is usually easier than understanding the code someone else created, I know many people that can do the former, but few that can do the latter.</p>
<h2>ii - Dying a good death</h2>
<p>The product has now matured. New features might get shuffled around, but overall you just have to sit back and watch as gradual improvements in hardware, network and compilers make your good product even better by catching bugs, improving performance and reducing server costs.</p>
<p>This is not to say sales, marketing and legal don't have an increased workload as the audience grows, but software, in principle, is the same thing, just add 100x the servers to your cluster and you're good to go.</p>
<p>Some might say that "scale" is the thing that causes dev team costs to go up, and that would be a confounder if people were to only <a href="https://cerebralab.com/Stop_future_proofing_software">design for scale when needed</a>, but they aren't, so we use expensive IaaS providers, adopt serverless designs and run Kubernetes clusters from day 1. So I don't think the scale is the issue here, everything is already designed for scale. Furthermore, as I often like to point out, bigger machines can bring you a long way, you can fit 12TB of ECC DDR4 on a single instance and by the time I'm done writing this article those numbers might be 24 and 6, we are living at the end of Moore's law and it's amazing.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just a fundamental rule of everything that <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/">costs must go up forever</a>, no matter how big or small the system, until it collapses. I'm rather optimistic and think the problem here is solvable and has been solved by a few companies, but it's that very solution that makes them boring.</p>
<hr>
<p>You will see I use "decay" in the graph above to represent the final phase of a company, the one where usually the dev team grows exponentially with quality being sacrificed in exchange for quantity.</p>
<p>Despite the word I chose, I don't think this "decay" phase is necessarily bad. In the best of cases, it's synonymous with the product being forever enshrined in amber, continuing to be enjoyed by generations to come. At worst, its user base will very slowly dwindle as the market moves away from whatever generators of needs caused it's existence to being with.</p>
<p>A good example of a company going through a good "decay" period is Craigslist. A company making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigslist">694 million a year with 50 employees</a>. It seems to be doing exactly what I'd have loved it to do if I ever invested in it, generating millions for me each year, playing it safe in a space it knows well, slowly expanding and improving. Will craigslist live forever? No. But even greed must know some limits, and if Craigslists is made defunct after generating dozens or hundreds of billions in revenue, I think everyone that started it will be fine with that.</p>
<p>Also note, only 500 millions of those are income, what's happening with 194 millions? Even if 50-80% go on something other than salaries, that's still an average salary of... oh god, I mean, I love my job and I'm not particularly inspired by craigslist and all... but... but anyway, I digress.</p>
<h2>iii - How to make stake</h2>
<p>I believe the reason that most companies are not going the Craiglist route is one of stake. Say you've got the funding team plus investors that have 90% of the stake in a venture, the rest is divided between late-stage investors and later employees. The funding team wants to cash out and stop working forever, which is fine, except that now only 10% of the stake in the success of the company is held by people working for the actual company.</p>
<p>So now you are left with two options:</p>
<p>a) Have workers that are interested in doing a good job for reasons other than the ultimate success of the business.</p>
<p>b) Make the stakes very high.</p>
<p>The first option seems to be what most public companies went with, and in principle is the reason why 2-men startups are able to wipe the floor with behemoths wielding hundreds of billions in assets. It's more or less the same problem that a government has in employing people, the lack of external incentives means that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/279812.Moral_Mazes">everyone is focused on gaming internal systems</a> (e.g. trying to maximize political influence and department budgets at any cost), and those who aren't are soon kicked out of the game.</p>
<p>The second option seems to be what the Googles and Amazons of the world are doing, aiming to keep exponential growth going so that even if the stakes are very tiny relative to the company's size, employees still feel motivated by sharing in the product's success. This <a href="https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/maintenance-as-innovation-2n">seems to have some flaws</a>, for one, there's only so much growth a company like Google or Amazon can benefit from since their revenue is very tied into the overall economy, which doesn't seem to grow that quickly, if at all.</p>
<p>The third option seems to be the one that almost nobody is taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on what you did well the first time.</li>
<li>Downscale (or at least keep the team small) to save on internal costs.</li>
<li>Get very good developers and pay them (presumably) insane amounts to keep them motivated and make sure they never leave.</li>
</ul>
<h2>iv - Working without feedback</h2>
<p>Why am I saying one must pay developers exorbitant amounts to keep them motivated? It seems that most are doing just fine with what is getting closer and closer to minimal wage nowadays.</p>
<p>This is true, developers are cheap, but also, somehow, companies find they must hire hundreds of them to upkeep a similar product that was originally maintained by a few, if not one. And for some reason, the really good ones seem to prefer to work as CEOs and CTOs, or get out of the game entirely and work in academia or become FIRE minimalists.</p>
<p>That is because low wages lead to corrupt incentives. Low wages means developers are not too concerned about the company going under, or being fired. They'd prefer for that <em>not</em> to happen, but they can find another job that pays them about as much, maybe they even welcome the change of setting.</p>
<p>The only way to make monetary and stake progress is going up the chain, i.e. into management. But that just reinforces the problem, since it means good developers get promoted into positions where most of their skills become progressively more useless.</p>
<hr>
<p>If that picture seems wrong to you, reflect upon the last 20 years of software development consisting of hundreds if not thousands of teams of 1 to 3 loners achieving market dominance against well-organized teams of dozens of thousands of people with billions backing them.</p>
<p>So why don't companies have this model internally? Why wait for a startup to beat them when they could foster that kind of environment internally? Sure, Facebook can buy Instagram, but why spend dozens of billions buying Instagram instead of building it themselves.</p>
<p>Maybe it all boils down to fairly obvious insights about how humans think when they are "part of a team" and how people that "got there first" feel cheated if other people end up prospering equally with seemingly much smaller risks. More likely I'm wrong here and the current growth patterns are the best we could get, even given an ideal founding team.</p>
<h2>v - Extra thoughts</h2>
<p>Capitalism is great, it's the closest human have gotten to whatever magic the gods of love and peace bestow upon their clerics. It turns status-obsessed would-be mass murderers, your Ghnigish Khans, Alexanders the Greats and Stalins, into preference-utility maximizing specialists.</p>
<p>The one problem with capitalism is the wealth accumulation bit, it losses appeal without it, but the hierarchy of competition becomes hopelessly corrupt with it. Happily, enough death and taxes take care of that and have managed to help things move along ok for hundreds of years, granted, with a few hiccups, but hey, what system of running human affairs hasn't caused a genocide or two? We ought to look at the aggregate picture.</p>
<p>Corporations mirror capitalism, as above so bellow and all that jazz, in that the stakes available for any would-be participant get progressively lower. After all, if you buy in and work for google in the very beginning, you're getting shares that price in a great amount of risk. If you work for the google of today, the publically traded capital A google, there's no risk in taking shares as salary, you can sell them the next day for the equivalent cash amount, so no astronomical gains are possible.</p>

<p>Let’s try a new format – <strong>“shorts”</strong>; small blog posts where I elaborate on ideas that I’d discuss at my twitter, but they either come back over and over, or the short form doesn’t convey all the nuances.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lc0z89hwcBtH59QnEvHrU__d1Be5uxjtjrjaBYi3updGObpyYlmpYvhlhXobMLWwyeRB2Sh--pEO7_oupCuDWdQXMtQnjcYfBjrO0TLDB_Zn5CJQLmDQm27enOR1C-tUEvmGGDL_" alt="" width="370" height="333"></figure></div>



<p>I often see advice about avoiding “if” statements in the code (especially GPU shaders) at all costs. The worst of all is when this happens in glsl and programmers replace some simple if statements with (subjectively) horrible <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/step.xhtml">step instruction</a> which IMO completely destroys all readability, or even worse – sequences of mixes, maxes, clips and extra ALU.</p>



<p>After all, <strong>those ifs are branches, and branches are bad, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>TLDR: No, definitely not – on all accounts.</strong></p>



<h2>Why do programmers want to avoid branches?</h2>



<p>Let’s first address why programmers would like to avoid branches. There are some good reasons for that.</p>



<h3>Scalar CPU</h3>



<p>On the CPU, “branches” in a non-SIMD code might seem “innocent”, it’s just a conditional jump to some other code. Instead of executing an <em>instruction a</em> next address, we jump to <em>instruction b</em> at some other address. Unfortunately, there are many complicated things going on under the hood: All modern CPUs are heavily pipelined, superscalar, and out-of order.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/aJOrhsi_sQ7C4gG6z0cov73NA_qt-UckHrz10Uo5OGX22TuwRRf_n1ogyaRUSBsTsCU3wigOkYwIZMclAGslXKSruRk9P7ieNjYvyukZ9erHFaCr-QMuKvwPjMbLNuBfyMZGTqjc" alt="" width="344" height="330"><figcaption>All modern CPUs are superscalar and deeply pipelined. Many instructions are processed and executed at the same time. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor">wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To extract maximum efficiency, they use a model of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor">speculative execution</a> – a CPU “gambles” and “guesses” results of a branch ahead of time, not knowing if it will be taken or not, and starts executing those instructions. If it’s right – great! However if it’s not, then the CPU needs to stall, cancel all the guesses, go back to the branch, and execute the other instructions. Oops.</p>



<p>Luckily, CPUs are usually very good at this “guessing” (they actually analyze past branch patterns and take them into account!). On the other hand, without going into too much detail – each branch consumes some of the branch predictor unit resources. One extra branch on some short, innocent code can make results of the branch prediction worse, and slow down other code (where branch predictor might be necessary for good performance!).</p>



<h3>SIMD and the GPU</h3>



<p>When considering SIMD or the GPU, the situation is even worse.</p>



<p>Simplifying – single program and same instruction stream executes on multiple “lanes” of the same data, processing 4/8/16/32/64 elements at the same time.</p>



<p>If you want to take a branch when some of the elements take one path, some another one, you have two main options: <strong>either abandon vectorization and scalarize code</strong> (very bad option; usually means that it’s not worth vectorizing given piece of code), or <strong>execute both code paths</strong> – first the first one, store the results somewhere, execute the second one, and “combine” the results.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GmopPKjJ_t4QpsGIhaIhjJn6cTfUjVaMSl9lDj74skwpNRUVIYtWQ8-V0j4mMLIyZk1CZEgn-9z5C1kExAlVjIw8Oikdx0L-gJnyrB-qUc5oi3_4aQmmcGwCcP51YutgGoAlRHdT" alt="" width="448" height="194"></figure></div>



<p>This is a general (over)simplification, and example GPUs have dedicated hardware to help do it efficiently and without wasting resources (hardware execution masks etc), but generally means extra cost of managing those masks, storing results somewhere, double execution costs and finally – branches can serve as barriers, preventing some <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2014/03/27/gcn-two-ways-of-latency-hiding-and-wave-occupancy/">latency hiding (see my old blog post on it)</a>.</p>



<h3>Combined</h3>



<p>Given those two, it might seem that avoiding branches seems reasonable, and the common advice of avoiding ifs makes sense. But whether it makes sense to avoid branch or not is more complicated (more on it later), and the second one (whether an if is a branch) is not the case.</p>



<h2>Are if statements branches?</h2>



<p>Let’s clear the worst misconception.</p>



<p><strong>When you write an “if” in your code, the compiler won’t necessarily generate a branch with a jump</strong>.</p>



<p>I will focus now on CPUs, mostly because how easy it is to test it with <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Matt Godbolt’s amazing compiler explorer</a>. 🙂 (Plus how there are two mainstream architectures, unlike many different shader ISAs)</p>



<p>Let’s have a look at the following simple integer function.</p>


<pre title="">int is_this_a_branch(int v, int w) {
    if (v &lt; 10) {
        return v + w; 
    } 
    else {
        return 2 * v - 2 * w;
    }
}
</pre>


<p>I tested it with 3 x64 compilers (GCC x64 trunk, Clang x64 trunk, MSVC 19.28) and one ARM (armv8-a clang), and only MSVC generates an actual branch there.</p>



<pre><code><strong>clang</strong>              
        mov     eax, edi
        sub     eax, esi
        add     esi, edi
        add     eax, eax
        cmp     edi, 10
        cmovl   eax, esi
        ret
<strong>gcc</strong>
        mov     eax, edi
        lea     edx, [rdi+rsi]
        sub     eax, esi
        add     eax, eax
        cmp     edi, 9
        cmovle  eax, edx
        ret
<strong>msvc </strong>       
        cmp     ecx, 10
        <strong>jge     SHORT $LN2@is_this_a_ BRANCH!!!
</strong>   BRANCH!
        lea     eax, DWORD PTR [rcx+rdx]
        ret     0
$LN2@is_this_a_:
        sub     ecx, edx
        lea     eax, DWORD PTR [rcx+rcx]
        ret     0

<strong>arm clang
</strong>        sub     w9, w0, w1
        add     w8, w1, w0
        lsl     w9, w9, #1
        cmp     w0, #10                         // =10
        csel    w0, w8, w9, lt</code></pre>



<p>When using floats:</p>


<pre title="">float is_this_a_branch2(float v, float w) {
    if (v &lt; 10.0f) {
        return v + w; 
    } 
    else {
        return 2.0f * v - 2.0f * w;
    }
}
</pre>


<p>Now 2 out of 4 compilers generate a branch:</p>



<pre><code><strong>clang</strong>           
        movaps  xmm2, xmm0
        addss   xmm2, xmm1
        movaps  xmm3, xmm0
        addss   xmm3, xmm0
        addss   xmm1, xmm1
        cmpltss xmm0, dword ptr [rip + .LCPI1_0]
        subss   xmm3, xmm1
        andps   xmm2, xmm0
        andnps  xmm0, xmm3
        orps    xmm0, xmm2
        ret

<strong>gcc
</strong>        movss   xmm2, DWORD PTR .LC0[rip]
        comiss  xmm2, xmm0
        <strong>jbe     .L10  BRANCH!!!
</strong>
        addss   xmm0, xmm1
        ret
.L10:
        addss   xmm1, xmm1
        addss   xmm0, xmm0
        subss   xmm0, xmm1
        ret

<strong>msvc
</strong>        movss   xmm2, DWORD PTR __real@41200000
        comiss  xmm2, xmm0
        <strong>jbe     SHORT $LN2@is_this_a_  BRANCH!!!</strong>
        addss   xmm0, xmm1
        ret     0
$LN2@is_this_a_:
        addss   xmm0, xmm0
        addss   xmm1, xmm1
        subss   xmm0, xmm1
        ret     0

<strong>arm clang
</strong>        fadd    s2, s0, s1
        fadd    s3, s0, s0
        fadd    s1, s1, s1
        fmov    s4, #10.00000000
        fsub    s1, s3, s1
        fcmp    s0, s4
        fcsel   s0, s2, s1, mi
        ret</code></pre>



<h3>What are those conditionals and selects?</h3>



<p>This is basically CPUs’ and compilers’ way of “serializing” both code paths. If it considers overhead of a branch larger than the amount of work it can save, it makes sense to compute both code paths, and use a single instruction to select which one is the actual result.</p>



<p>This obviously “depends” on the use case and whether it is even “legal” for a compiler to do such a transformation (like “side effects”; or if a compiler executed some reads of memory, it could be unsafe and lead to segmentation fault).&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Does writing ternary conditional help avoid branches?</h2>



<p><strong>No.</strong></p>



<p>This is a common advice, but it’s generally not true. If you look at the above example rewritten slightly:</p>


<pre title="">float is_this_a_branch3(float v, float w) {
    return v &lt; 10.0f ? (v + w) : (2.0f * v - 2.0f * w);
}
</pre>


<p>The generated code is <strong>identical </strong>(!).</p>



<p>It might be <em>possible</em> (?) that some compilers do generate branchless code for like this, but giving this as a general advice makes no sense. Whether you write an actual if, or a ternary expression, it’s still a high level if statement, just expressed differently.</p>



<h2>What about the GPU?</h2>



<p><strong>On the GPU, it’s the same; the compiler will generate conditional selects when appropriate.</strong></p>



<p>I used <a href="http://shader-playground.timjones.io/">Tim Jones Shader Playground</a> and AMD ISA (mostly because I know it relatively better than the others), and the unfortunate step function:</p>


<pre title="">#version 460

layout (location = 0) out vec4 fragColor;
layout (location = 0) in float inColor;

void main()
{
#if 1
	fragColor = vec4(step(1.0, inColor));
#else
    float x;
    if (inColor &lt; 1.0)
        x = 1.0;
   	else
        x = 0.0;
   	fragColor = vec4(x);
#endif
}
</pre>


<p>See for yourself, both versions generate identical assembly:</p>



<pre><code>  s_mov_b32     m0, s3
  s_nop         0x0000
  v_interp_p1_f32  v0, v0, attr0.x
  v_interp_p2_f32  v0, v1, attr0.x
  v_cmp_gt_f32  vcc, 1.0, v0
  v_cndmask_b32  v0, 1.0, 0, vcc
  v_cvt_pkrtz_f16_f32  v0, v0, v0
  exp           mrt0, v0, v0, v0, v0 done compr vm</code></pre>



<p>When using fastmath and not obeying strict IEEE float specification (which is standard for compiling shaders for real time graphics), compilers can even generate other instructions like min or max from your if statements. But YMMV and be sure to check the assembly.</p>



<p>So generally – using “step” just to avoid if statements is <strong>pointless</strong>.</p>



<p>If you like it for your coding style, then it’s obviously up to you, use as much as you like just for this reason. But please consider programmers who don’t have as much shader or GLSL experience and will be always puzzled by it. 🙂 </p>



<h2>Are branches always to be avoided?</h2>



<p><strong>No.</strong></p>



<p>This is way beyond my aimed “short” format, but <strong>branches are not necessarily “bad”</strong>.</p>



<p>They can be actually an awesome optimization, even on the GPU!</p>



<p>If you start to use a lot of conditionals</p>



<p>Lots of advice on how branches are bad and have to be avoided comes from a prehistoric era of old CPUs and GPUs or old compilers; an advice that is passed without re(verifying) – which is understandable, I am not re-checking my whole knowledge or intuition every few months either. 🙂 </p>



<p>But the CPU/GPU/compiler architects improved designs significantly and adapted them to general, highly branchy code, and whether there is a penalty or not depends on way too many details to list or give advice.</p>



<p><strong>Rule of thumb</strong>: if a branch is generally coherent, it makes sense to use it when it allows to save on memory bandwidth or cache utilization. On GPUs it is usually worth adding branches if you can avoid texture fetches this way with a high probability and coherence. And it’s usually better to have some conditional masks and selects around …</p></div></div>

All data is sourced from SimilarWeb's public data. I estimate revenue with [traffic * global ecom conversion rate * price of best selling product]. Facebook spend is estimated by [social traffic * 1.8 ]. SimilarWeb tells us how much traffic they receive from social channels and I multiply that by an average CPC of 1.8 as they tend to under-report this figure when I cross-reference it against large social media accounts that I manage.

		<p>My answer to questions on Quora:&nbsp; <strong><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-your-favorite-basic-math-hacks?no_redirect=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What are some of your favorite basic math hacks?</a></strong>&nbsp; and also to <strong><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-greatest-trick-in-mathematics/answer/Alexandre-Borovik" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is the greatest trick in mathematics?</a></strong></p>
<p>I have to apologise: I do not have favorite math hacks. I have never used hacks/tricks. The essence of mathematics is in universal methods for solving <strong>all</strong> problems in a particular class of problems. Use of “hacks”/”tricks” is a replacement of mathematics by cheap surrogates. Hacks/tricks can work at a certain level, but frequently obstruct students’ progress at the next level of learning of mathematics. Hacks/tricks are frequently favoured by teachers who always taught students at a certain level but never at higher levels. These teachers tend not to care much about their students’ progress beyond their class.</p>
<p>In my opinion, teachers have to be assessed not by their students’ marks in their classes, but by their students’ success at the next stages of education. In that environment, any desire to teach “hacks” somehow disappears.</p>
<p>I apologise to be so firm in my opinion on that matter, but for at least a decade I taught mathematics at a Foundation Studies programme in a very big university: up to 400 students in a lecture theatre who failed mathematics at secondary school and had to be brought up to the level where they could start studies in (relatively) mathematically intensive degree programmes at the university level. Hacks/tricks were the last thing they needed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<h2 id="whywriteanebookanyway">Why write an eBook anyway?</h2>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company - for a lunch &amp; learn, brownbag, or to better understand Serverless</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the options add some value, it seems that people are willing to pay a little more and enjoy the choice.</p>
<p>There was no pre-launch and I didn't collect email addresses. I just tweeted about the eBook on Friday afternoon, and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure because I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You tend to get what you focus on, like when you think of installing a satellite dish, then realise that everyone on your street has one, and can't stop seeing them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way, I saw failure to find market fit. In those first hours I convinced myself that the lack of sales was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>The sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/alexellis">GitHub Sponsors</a> came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="The initial spike at launch"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered again if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page from search engines.</p>
<p>Still, it was more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The discount resulted in another large spike in sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>Gumroad has no way to offer a discount for a single tier, or to enable upgrades. So how did I fulfil the upgrade?</p>
<p>I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi. Gumroad can be configured to send a webhook (also called "a ping") to a HTTPS endpoint whenever there is a sale. My code just had to validate the sender, parse the dollar amount and email address, and then send out an email to the customer. I evaluated a few email services and settled on AWS SES for its simplicity and predictable pricing. I used <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2021/02/11/secure-letsencrypt-tunnel.html">inlets PRO</a> to receive webhooks.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>You can see the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a sharp drop-off in sales, again. I started to wonder why I was seeing this pattern?</p>
<p>At that time 99% of referrals had come from Twitter and from email. Had I exhausted my network? Had everyone who was going to buy an eBook on learning open-source serverless, already become a customer?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">openfaas.com</a> and <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/">on my blog</a> at the end of each post, to try and get more eyes on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but seemed to have no obvious effect on sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk. As they say, "nothing ventured, nothing gained".</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>

<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back. Part of <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/still-in-the-game-my-2020-year-in-review/">my 2021 goals</a> is to find a way to make OpenFaaS sustainable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If You Always Do What You've Always Done, You'll Always Get What You've Always Got." - Henry Ford</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The eBook has already brought in more revenue in a month, than the OpenFaaS GitHub Sponsors account has in a year.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">The Right It</a> has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea, because it is likely to fail. That's just the way things go. Instead I'll be testing ideas out through small experiments that take a few hours or days, and using data to decide whether to invest more.</p>
<p>I'm happy to answer questions <a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk/">via Twitter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="update12feb2021">Update (12 Feb 2021)</h2>
<p>It took 27 days, but the eBook has now reached the milestone of 10k USD in sales! Most of the purchases being made now are from links on the OpenFaaS website, the faasd repo or my own blog. This is also known as long-tail, a slow and (mostly) steady stream of revenue.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2021/02/update-rev6.png" alt="Launch event, offers and longtail"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Visualised: Launch event, offers and longtail</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've also released revision 6 of the eBook which has a much more detailed section on CI/CD and recipes for multi-arch builds. I'm using it to deploy endpoints directly to my Raspberry Pi from GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>If you're curious about how Serverless functions can be of use for your next side-project or idea, why not try the eBook and / or video workshop? You can get your money back within 7 days if you're not satisfied.</p>
<p>Events and webhooks can be used to build custom extensions for SaaS products or existing systems. You can see an example in my <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">gumroad-responder</a> which forwards messages to Slack, and sends emails via AWS SES to customers during a promotion.</p>

<h2 id="type-checking-and-type-inference">Type Checking and Type Inference</h2>
<p>Type checking is the process of taking a given program in some programming language and working out whether all variables and expressions have the correct types, i.e.&nbsp;strings are assigned to strings, arithmetic expressions involve only numbers, etc. Some languages also offer <em>type inference</em>, tasking the compiler with the task of figuring out correct types on its own. Depending on a language’s features the type checking and type inference problems range from trivial to undecidable.</p>
<h2 id="common-terms">Common terms</h2>
<h3 id="completeness">Completeness</h3>
<p>A type checker is complete if it can check every correctly typed program.</p>
<h3 id="soundness">Soundness</h3>
<p>A type checker is sound if it only accepts correctly typed programs.</p>
<h3 id="decidability">Decidability</h3>
<p>A decision problem is <strong>decidable</strong> if for any input we can compute whether the input satifies the problem in finite time. Examples of decidable problems include primality testing and boolean satisfiability. The halting problem for example is <strong>undecidable</strong>: We cannot check whether a program runs infinitely long in finite time. We are interested in the type checking and type inference problems for programming languages: Given some input program, does it type check? And given some program, which types should we assign to the expression such that it typechecks?</p>
<h3 id="hindley-milner-type-system">Hindley-Milner Type System</h3>
<p>The Hindley-Milner (HM) type system is a type system for the simple typed lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism, which is used as a base for many functional languages. Type-checking for HM is decidable and efficient, its complexity is linear in the size of the program. Type inference is more difficult than type checking, since the compiler has to solve the type constraints incurred for expressions in the program. It is <strong>decidable</strong> for the HM type system, however the problem itself is PSPACE-hard and EXPTIME-complete, meaning that in the worst case it needs at least a polynomial amount of extra space and exponential time relative to the input size. Fortunately, the type inference algorithm is linear when the nesting depth of polymorphic variables is bounded, as is the case for most applications. There exist many type inference algorithms, the best known one is the so-called <em>Algorithm W</em>. Many functional programming languages implement variants of the HM type system.</p>
<h3 id="dependent-types">Dependent types</h3>
<p>In simple terms dependent types allow types to depend not only on other types, but on values. This is best understood by an example: Normally we can only encode very coarse information, such as “x is of integer type”. Dependent types allow us to define more detailed types. For example we could then create a type “even integer”, whose only inhabitants are even integers. This is strictly more powerful than the previous setting: Dependent types in general make type inference undecidable as <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBFb0037103.pdf">can be shown</a> by reduction to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_correspondence_problem">Post Correspondence Problem</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-hard-is-type-checking-your-favorite-language">How Hard is Type-Checking Your Favorite Language?</h2>
<p>Below I’ve compiled a list of languages and how hard type checking/type inference is in these languages. If you find a mistake or are missing a language please <a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~bfiedler/typing-is-hard">file an issue</a> with your language, its type checking complexity and optimally a resource that supports your claim. I do not claim completeness nor correctness of the properties shown here, it is mainly an amalgamation of blog posts I’ve been collecting.</p>
<h3 id="c">C++</h3>
<p><strong>undecidable</strong>, <a href="https://rtraba.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/cppturing.pdf">C++ Templates are Turing Complete, Todd L. Veldhuizen (2003)</a>, even its <a href="https://medium.com/@mujjingun_23509/full-proof-that-c-grammar-is-undecidable-34e22dd8b664">grammar is undecidable</a></p>
<h3 id="c-1">C#</h3>
<p><strong>unsound, undecidable</strong>, there is an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23939168/is-c-sharp-type-system-sound-and-decidable">excellent SO answer by Eric Lippert</a> on this topic. Other fun things include <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ericlippert/lambda-expressions-vs-anonymous-methods-part-five">a SAT solver using the C# type-checker</a></p>
<h3 id="elm">Elm</h3>
<p><strong>decidable</strong>, uses Hindley-Milner, but currently <strong>unsound</strong>, due to an <a href="https://github.com/elm/core/issues/960">interesting compiler bug</a>: <code>(String.length "  ") ^ (-1) : Int</code></p>
<h3 id="f">F#</h3>
<p><strong>undecidable</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/cannorin/FSharp.TypeLevel">GitHub user cannorin implemented the untyped lambda calculus in F#</a></p>
<h3 id="go">Go</h3>
<p><strong>decidable</strong>, since type inference is only used for variable initialization</p>
<h3 id="haskell">Haskell</h3>
<p>1998 standard, no extensions: <strong>decidable</strong>, variant of HM</p>
<p>2010 standard, no extensions: <strong>decidable</strong>, restriction of System F</p>
<p>with sufficient<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> extensions: <strong>undecidable</strong>, as type checking in System F is undecidable. There exist <a href="https://www.lochan.org/keith/publications/undec.html">Turing Machines in Haskell types</a>. A simpler variant is to implement the <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2006-August/018355.html">SKI calculus</a>.</p>
<h3 id="idris">Idris</h3>
<p><strong>decidable</strong>, surprisingly. Idris has dependent types, but <a href="https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/faq/faq.html#evaluation-at-the-repl-doesn-t-behave-as-i-expect-what-s-going-on">at compile time it will only evaluate expressions which it knows to be total (terminating and covering all inputs)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
<p><strong>undecidable</strong>, because <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05274.pdf">Java Generics are Turing complete</a>. Java 5 or later is <strong>unsound</strong>, as shown by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2983990.2984004">Amin and Tate (2015)</a></p>
<h3 id="ocaml">OCaml</h3>
<p><strong>undecidable</strong>, since we can <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/caml-list/1507.html">cause the type checker to loop infinitely</a></p>
<h3 id="ml">ML</h3>
<p><strong>decidable</strong>, uses Hindley-Milner</p>
<h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>
<p><strong>undecidable</strong>, both type inference (since Rust has rank-3-types) and type checking, as shown by this <a href="https://sdleffler.github.io/RustTypeSystemTuringComplete/">Smallfuck interpreter implemented using traits</a>.</p>
<h3 id="scala">Scala</h3>
<p><strong>undecidable</strong>, since it admits a <a href="https://michid.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/scala-type-level-encoding-of-the-ski-calculus/">type-level SKI calculus</a>, <strong>unsound</strong>, as shown by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2983990.2984004">Amin and Tate (2015)</a>. Scala 2.13.3 (newest as of writing this) also exhibits the same problem.</p>
<h3 id="swift">Swift</h3>
<p><strong>undecidable</strong>, as proven <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-type-checking-is-undecidable/39024">here</a> by reduction to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_for_groups">word problem for finitely generated groups</a><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3>
<p><strong>undecidable, unsound</strong>. The <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html#a-note-on-soundness">TypeScript documentation</a> mentions its unsoundness and the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html#function-parameter-bivariance">motivations</a> <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html#optional-parameters-and-rest-parameters">behind</a> them.</p>
<p>Undecidability: TypeScript’s type system was <a href="https://gist.github.com/hediet/63f4844acf5ac330804801084f87a6d4">proven Turing complete</a> until <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14837">they disallowed self-referential types</a>.

<h3 id="zig">Zig</h3>
<p><strong>undecidable</strong>, since evaluation of recursive functions at compile time is possible, thus requiring the compiler to solve the halting problem.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="where-are-python-bash-etc.">Where are Python, Bash, etc.?</h3>
<p>Type checking and type inference work primarily for statically typed languages. While there exist extensions to some dynamic languages imbuing them with static type checking these are not part of the language, and the complexity depends not on the language but the extension.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-unsafe-casts">What about unsafe casts?</h3>
<p>Some languages offer explicit unchecked casts, which are accepted by the type checker and may potentially fail at runtime. Examples are casting from <code>Object</code> to some subclass in C# and Java, casting values of type <code>interface{}</code> in Go or using <code>unsafeCoerce</code> in Haskell. I’ve chosen not to account for such casts/coercions since unchecked downcasting is an inherently unsafe operation not covered by type checker guarantees.</p>
<h3 id="ive-spotted-a-mistakeimprecision-what-should-i-do">I’ve spotted a mistake/imprecision, what should I do?</h3>
<p>Great work! Please report it on the <a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~bfiedler/typing-is-hard">official issue tracker</a> detailing what is wrong and I will try to fix it as soon as possible.</p>

Open, clear, and constant communication about the tasks at hand and to come is absolutely essential to successful task management.</li><li><strong>Delegation:</strong> Task management is not about shouldering the entire load alone.

It’s such an important process that there have been countless books, coaching sessions, articles, and methods created around making it more effective. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>Task management can help you stay on track, focus your efforts, and stop missing deadlines, big and small.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We have identified a few methods that are especially worth consideration. They are actionable strategies that can be implemented as-is or tweaked to fit your personal preferences. Let’s take a look at some specific methods for task management.</p><h3 id="eat-that-frog">Eat That Frog</h3><p>This method has a silly name but it gets seriously impressive results! The moniker comes from an oft-cited alleged quote from Mark Twain. He is quoted to have said, “If it’s your job to eat a frog, it’s best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it’s your job to eat two frogs, it’s best to eat the biggest one first.” Esteemed <a href="https://www.briantracy.com/">author and productivity expert Brian Tracy</a> ran with this evocative quote and turned it into a task management method and book by the same name.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>If it’s your job to eat a frog, it’s best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it’s your job to eat two frogs, it’s best to eat the biggest one first.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The main idea with the <a href="https://blog.doit.io/eat-that-frog/">Eat That Frog method</a> is that you should jump right into hard, important, and difficult to deal with tasks first. Once they are done you can move on to other tasks that are easier to swallow, if you will. It is beautiful in its simplicity. It works because it aligns your focus, helps you prioritize, and urges you to take action. </p><h3 id="the-ivy-lee-method">The Ivy Lee Method</h3><p>This task management method is also rooted in a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ivy-lee-method-productivity-2018-9">historical account of folkloric proportions</a>. As the story goes, a man by the name of Charles Schwab (yes, <em>that</em> Charles Schwab) wanted to help his employees increase their productivity. He hired a consultant called Ivy Lee who promised to teach his employees a sure-fire method for improved productivity in just a few minutes. </p><p>Better still, Schwab would pay absolutely nothing up front. Lee asked that the employees use the method for a period of three months and then Schwab should pay Lee what he felt the method was worth. Ivy Lee was paid $25,000 way back in 1918 which is worth over $450,000 in today’s dollar.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>The key to meeting deadlines and staying on track to complete projects is effective task management.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The secret is out and now we all have access to the <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-ivy-lee-method/">Ivy Lee Method</a>. It goes like this. Every day at the conclusion of your work day, spend a mere ten minutes thinking about what you have to accomplish tomorrow. Write down the six most important tasks and order them by priority. When you start work the next day, start with the most important task and work your way down one task at a time. Whatever is left undone should be included in the next day’s list. That’s it. </p><h3 id="get-things-done-or-gtd">Get Things Done or GTD</h3><p>This method comes from author David Allen whose book on the process remains popular since it’s publication nearly 20 years ago. It stands the test of time because it is fairly simple to implement and it actually works. The basic assumption is that our minds are cluttered with a flurry of things we need to remember or that we want to accomplish. If we can get those thoughts out of our heads and onto paper, our minds will be cleared and we can get things done.</p><p>GTD has five steps that we have<a href="https://blog.doit.io/getting-things-done-gtd-method/"> explained in greater detail</a> in a separate article. They are:</p><ol><li><strong>Capture:</strong> Dump all ideas, thoughts, ideas, tasks out of your mind and into the space or place of your choosing.</li><li><strong>Clarify:</strong> Go through the list and eliminate anything that is not actionable. From what is left, see if any tasks can be broken down into smaller tasks.</li><li><strong>Organize</strong>: At this stage, you take each task and prioritize it against the others.</li><li><strong>Reflect:</strong> The list must be reflected upon regularly as circumstances and priorities change. Make adjustments as needed.</li><li><strong>Engage:</strong> Get going! Start taking action and get things done, one by one.<br></li></ol><h3 id="the-eisenhower-matrix">The Eisenhower Matrix</h3><p>This method is aimed specifically at prioritization. It comes from the legendary productivity of former U.S. president, five-star army general, and all-around amazing accomplisher Dwight Eisenhower. The method was made popular by its inclusion in Stephen Covey’s perennial bestseller <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519">The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>Recognizing which tasks need urgent attention and which tasks can be put off until later is a key skill for task management.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The core idea of the Eisenhower Matrix is determining whether or not a particular task is important, urgent, both, or neither. Importance and urgency are not the same thing. A task is important only if it moveImportance refers to how much a task moves us forward in achieving a long-term goal or mission. Urgency refers to how quickly something has to get done or how “in the moment” it is. Urgency doesn’t always equal importance.</p><p>Tasks that are both urgent and important must be assigned the highest priority. Tasks that are urgent but not important should be delegated to someone else. Those that are important but not urgent should be planned. And those that are neither should be eliminated all together.

<p>This blog post is an in-depth dive into the security features of the Intel/Windows platform boot process. In this post I'll explain the startup process through security focused lenses, next post we'll dive into several known attacks and how they were handled by Intel and Microsoft. My wish is to explain to technology professionals not deep into platform security why Microsoft's SecureCore is so important and necessary.</p>



<p>We must first begin with a brief introduction to the hardware platform. Skip this if you have read the awsome material available on the web about the Intel architecture, I'll try to briefly summarize it here.</p>

<p>The Intel platform is based on one or two chips. Small systems have one, the desktop and server ones are separated to a CPU complex and a PCH complex (PCH = Platform Controller Hub).</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-19_14-3-0.png" alt="Intel architecture"></p>

<p>The CPU complex deals with computation. It holds the "processor" cores, e.g. Sunny Cove that implement the ISA, as well as cross core caches like the L3 cache, and more controllers that are grouped together as "the system agent" or the "uncore". The uncore contains the memory controller and display, e.g. GPU and display controller.</p>

<p>The PCH handles all other IO, including access to the firmware through SPI or eSPI, wifi, LAN, USB, HD audio, SMBus, thunderbolt and etc'. The PCH also hosts several embedded processors, like the PMC, the Power Management Controller.</p>

<p>An additional part of the PCH is a very important player in our story, the CSME, or Converged Security &amp; Management Engine, a i486 IP block (also called Minute IA). CSME is responsibly for much of the security model of Intel processors as well as many of the manageability features of the platform. The CSME block has its own dedicated ~1.5mb of SRAM memory and 128KB of ROM, as well as a dedicated IOMMU, called the A-Unit (that even has its own <em>acode</em> microcode) located in the CSME's <em>uncore</em>', thats allows access from ME to the main memory, as well as DMA to/from the main memory and using the main memory as an encrypted paging area ("virtual memory"). The CSME engine runs a customized version of the Minix3 microkernel, also recent versions have changed it beyond recognition adding many security features.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-19_14-14-4.png" alt="CSME structure"></p>

<h2 id="buses">Buses</h2>
<p>Lets use this post to also introduce the main interconnects in the system. The main externally facing interconnect bus is PCI-E, a fast bust that can reach 64GBps in its latest incarnations. A second external bus is the LPC, or Low Pin Count bus, a slow bus for connecting devices such as SPI flash, the TPM (explained below), and old peripherals such as PS/2 touchpads.</p>

<p>Internally the platform is based around the <strong>IOSF</strong>, or Intel On-chip System Fabric, which is a pumped up version of PCI-E that supports many additional security and addressing features. For addressing IOSF adds SourceID and DestID fields that contain the source and destination of any IOSF transaction, extending PCI-E Bus-Device-Function (BDF) addressing to enable routing over bridges. IOSF also extends addressing by adding support for multiple address root namespaces, currently defining three: RS0 for host memory space, RS1 for CSME memory space, and RS2 for the Innovation-Engine (IE), another embedded controller currently present only on server chipsets.
There are two IOSF busses in the PCH - the Primary Fabric and the Sideband Fabric. The Primary Fabric is high speed, connecting the CPU to the PCH (through a protocol call DMI), as well as high speed devices such as Gigbait Ethernet, WiFi and eSPI. The Sideband Fabric is used to connect the CSME to low-speed devices, including the PMC (Power Management Controller), the RNG generator, GPIO pins, USB, SMBus, and even debugging interfaces such as JTAG.</p>

<h2 id="more-components">More Components</h2>
<p>Another interesting component is the <strong>ITH</strong>, or Intel Trace Hub, which is codenamed North Peak (NPK). The ITH can trace different internal hardware component (VIA - Visualization of Internal Signals, ODLA - On-chip logic analyzer, SoCHAP - SOC performance counters, IPT - Intel Process Trace, AET - Intel Architecture Trace), and external component like CSME, the UEFI firmware, and you can even connect it to ETW. This telemetry eventually finds its way to Intel in various methods.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-22_0-52-2.png" alt="Intel Trace Hub"></p>

<p>The <strong>TPM</strong> is designed to provide a tamper proof environment to enforce system security through hardware. It implements in hardware many essential functions: sha1 &amp; sha256 hashing algorithms, many crypto and key derivation functions, measurment registers call the Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs), a secret key - Endorsment Key - used to derive all other keys, and non-volatile storage slots for storing keys and hashes. Discrete TPM chips (i.e. those that are a separate chip on the mainboard or SOC and connected through the LPC) are call dTPMs, or can be implemented in the CSME module's firmware and called fTPMs.</p>

<p>The TPM's <strong>PCR</strong> are initialized to zero when the platform boots and are filled up with measurements through the boot process. PCRs 0-15 are intended for "static" use - they reset when the platform boots; They are supposed to give the OS loader a view of the platform initialization state.
PCRs 17-22 are for "dynamic" use - they get reset on each secure launch (GETSEC[SENTER]); They are supposed to be used by the attestation sofware that checks if the OS is trusted.</p>

<h2 id="the-flash-chip">The Flash Chip</h2>
<p>SPI flash has 5 major regions: the Descriptor regions, the CSME region, the Gigabit Ethernet Region, the Platform Data Region, and the UEFI region. In the image below you can see an example of how the flash is organized.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2019-11-11_1-18-53_1.png" alt="Partition regions in SPI flash">
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2019-11-11_1-19-12.png" alt="Serial flash sizes"></p>

<p>Later versions added more regions:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2019-11-25_22-49-41.png" alt="SPI region evolution"></p>

<p>These regions are categorized as fault tolerant (FTPs) and non fault tolerant partitions (NFTPs).
Fault tolerant partitions are critical for boot, and verified during early boot (like the RBE, the CSME ROM Boot extensions will discuss in a few paragraphs). If verification fails - the system does not boot. Examples of non fault tolerant partitions are the Integrated Sensor Hub (or ISH) firmware.</p>

<p>SPI flash protection is applied at multiple levels: On the flash chip itself, in the SPI flash controller (in the PCH), in UEFI code and in CSME code.</p>

<p>The SPI controller maps the entire flash to memory at a fixed address, so reads/writes are usually done simply by reading/writing memory. The SPI controller translates this to flash-specific commands issued on the SPI bus, using a table of flash-specific commands stored in the flash descriptor region.
This is called "Hardware Sequencing", meaning the SPI controller issues the actual SPI commands
When hardware sequencing is in use, the SPI controller enforces several flash protections based on the masters region table in the flash (but can be overriden using a hardware PIN).</p>

<p>The SPI controller also implements a FLOCKDN flag. FLOCKDN is a write-once bit that, when set, disables use of software sequencing and modification of the PR registers until the next reset. The CSME sets this in the Bring-UP process (bup_storage_lock_spi_configuration(), see below). This happens when the UEFI notifies it that it is at the end of POST. In addition to the region access control table, the SPI controller also has an option to globally protect up to five regions in the flash from write access by the host using five registers, called Protected Registers (PRs), which are intended for the UEFI firmware to protect itself from modification while the OS is running.</p>

<p>It is also possible to issue direct flash commands using "Software Sequencing" by writing to the OPTYPE/OPMENU registers, since this can be used circumvent the SPI-enforced protections, software sequencing is usually disabled after POST using the FLOCKDN bit.</p>

<p>How is the flash updated?</p>

<p>UEFI region is updated through an UEFI capsule, This update happens during POST, before PRs and FLOCKDN is set, therefore, the BIOS region is still accessible to UEFI code.</p>

<p>Many OEMS have then own UEFI anti-tamper protections. For example, HP has SureStart on laptops and workstations, and Dell has TrustedDevice SafeBIOS. SafeBIOS copies bad firmware images to the EFI system partition, and the Dell Trusted Device software on Windows sends their hashes plus the hash of the UEFI firmware currently in memory to a Dell cloud server (*.delltrusteddevicesecurity.com) to check against a list of "authorized" hashes. Server platforms have similiar protections, including iLO for HP and iDRAC in Dell.
The CSME region can usually be updated only from within the CSME. However, for more complicated upgrades CSME can temporarily unlock the ME region for host read &amp; write.</p>


<p>In the next sections we'll look over all the stages of boot.
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-20_14-56-23.png" alt="Serial flash sizes"></p>


<p>Boot starts the PMC, the Power Management Controller.
In modern Intel systems the PMC is an ARC core and its the first controller to execute code once electricity is applied to the system. We'll talk more about PMC in a later post as its quiet interesting and has its own microcode and firmware, and event generates telemetry over the IOSF SB bus (which we'll talk about in a moment).</p>

<p>While the PMC does its init, the rest of the system is held at bay at a RESET state.</p>

<p>The next part to start running is the CSME. Recall from the first post in the series, CSME, or Converged Security and Managment Engine is a MinuteIA (i486 CPU IP block) embedded in the Platform Controller Hub (PCH).
The CSME begins running from its own embedded 128KB ROM - the CSME-ROM. This ROM is protected with a hardware fuse that is burned by Intel during production.
When started the CSME ROM starts like a regular 486 processor BIOS - in the reset vector in real mode. Its first order of business is to …</p></section></div>

				<p>I finally wrote a piece of software that I've wanted for years - a bot that regularly monitors the stock market for good, fundamentally sound companies that are undervalued, and then lets me know as soon as it finds them.</p><h2 id="automating-value-investing">Automating value investing</h2><p>I like the idea of buying something at a bargain that would likely truly increase in value over time, not because of it being a fad or fashion, but because it is really produces a net benefit to its stakeholders. Damn, that line sounded a bit more corporate than I intended, but it's relatively succinct and I stand by it.</p><p>If we're being honest, everything else is merely speculation. Although I do dabble in stuff like crypto, I do not view it as investing. To me it's just one or two steps up from gambling. </p><p>Why? Because it does not <em>produce</em> any additional value over time, its value merely depends on what a bunch of people collectively think it's worth. A value based on... feelings? Hopes? Peer pressure? Who knows. </p><p>To me that's not truly reliable and definitely not measurable enough to base longterm decisions on. Wow, as I wrote that I could just <em>feel</em> the multitude of objections undulating across the internet and socials; "what about smart contracts!?", and mentions of "stores of value", and cries of "gold-is-just-as-bad". Quite.</p><p>And some of those criticisms might have interesting points. And yes, the same could perhaps even be said about other more traditional forms of 'investment', like residential property and precious metals. But since all of that is only tangentially related to this post, and I'm in control of what's being discussed here, let's declare it a digression, side-step the horrified, and swiftly move along.</p><p>Sure, the line between investing and speculation can be very nebulous, and I do not really want to get into that an intricate of discussion and comparison with this post, but in short, I believe it comes down to that some people like pumping money into things they <em>feel or hope</em> would be worth more in the future. They prefer hunches, gut feelings, popularity and the wisdom of the crowd to analysis of the old-school and boring. They often have slogans too, mentions of moons and diamonds and, of course, lots and lost of cheering each other on.</p><p>Others(and this is where I align myself) prefer to pump money into things they think will increase in value in due to some more concrete and measurable properties, and often puts great emphasis on the output such an entity produces. They consider that measuring and processing those properties could give one a better idea of what that thing might be realistically worth in real monetary terms, regardless of what yours or others fluctuating feelings and hunches might suggest in a moment-by-moment basis.</p><p>You see, people and their opinions are fickle. And being due to human beings being spooked, ignorant, confused or distracted, things of real value might be worth more than most people feel it is in the open market, at any particular moment in time, due to random reasons.</p><p>Everyone can suddenly get all excited about that new tech-car company, and perhaps totally forget about the boring, ancient company that might produce a lot of the chemicals used in that very same tech-car company's production lines. </p><p>The market value of companies goes up and down daily, based on what's said in the news, what's being tweeted and what some random politician might have said. But thinking about it, how can that make sense? How can a company's real value change on a whim, a whisper or mere rumour? </p><p>And that, essentially, is what the concept of value investing entails - basing investment decisions on some measurable intrinsic properties of the investment instrument, and not being swayed by the markets' irrational ups and downs. I'll also offer the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp">definition of value investing from Investopedia</a>, to give you a clearer idea of what I'm angling for.</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp">Value investing</a> is an investment strategy that involves picking <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp">stocks</a> that appear to be trading for less than their <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp">intrinsic</a> or book value. Value investors actively ferret out stocks they think the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp">stock market</a> is underestimating. They believe the market overreacts to good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that do not correspond to a company's long-term <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp">fundamentals</a>. The overreaction offers an opportunity to profit by buying stocks at discounted prices—on sale.</blockquote><p>Thus the aim of the bot I wanted to build was to automate the process of fundamental analysis on a particular stock market index - in my case the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500">S&amp;P500</a> - and have it notify me when it finds an opportunity where the market might be considering a stock worth less than it possibly is in reality.</p><h2 id="the-bot-spec">The bot spec</h2><p>I wanted to automate everything I previously did manually, when it came to deciding what to buy and when, except for the actual trading part. I would still like to leave that particular task manual, as I want to have the final say in if I think a stock is a good purchase or not.</p><p>That being said, the bot does the following;</p><ul><li>It updates and caches a list of stocks in the S&amp;P500 every 3 months.</li><li>It fetches and/or calculates the latest fundamental metrics for each stock, including stuff like PE, EPS, FCF, Pietroski F-Score, book value, sales and earnings every 3 months, and caches it in between.</li><li>It ranks them from most profitable, productive and stable to least, then drops the bottom ones leaving only the top 8</li><li>It calculates an estimate per share value for each company with a customised form of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graham-number.asp">Benjamin Graham formula</a></li><li>It then compares the latest price of that top 8 with their calculated estimated value twice a day, and sends me an email report of this process on every other check(thus once a day)</li><li>It notifies me via SMS and email when it finds a stock that's going at a rate a little below the estimate, so that I can have a look and decide if it's a good buy or not myself.</li></ul><h2 id="choosing-a-stack">Choosing a stack</h2><p>I chose to use NodeJS, as that's the stack I use most frequently at my day job. This helps me move comfortably fast, as I'm fluent enough in it to be able to put most of my mental effort going towards architecting the app itself, and not towards trying to figure out a new language or framework.</p><p>I could also reuse a lot of code from previous side-projects, in order to get it built much faster. Some of the code I recycled included comms functions like sending email and SMS, error loggers and Dockerfile setups.</p><p>I also opted to not use TypeScript, as I found the basic application easy enough to build and reason about without having to worry about types too much, and because it's merely a personal project that doesn't need to be sanity-checked for other team members' sake.</p><p>Although I worked on it on my free time on-and-off, sometimes in the early mornings and sometimes on weekends, I estimate it took me about 6-8 hours to get it done and in its current relatively satisfactory state.</p><h2 id="fundamental-analyst-bot-in-action-">Fundamental analyst bot in action!</h2><p>The bot currently doesn't have a dashboard or web UI, but I can offer you a screenshot from the console.</p><figure><img src="https://www.riknieu.com/content/images/2021/02/StockMonitor-2.png"><figcaption>StockMonitor in action</figcaption></figure><h2 id="conclusions-and-disclaimers">Conclusions and disclaimers</h2><p>Now, I'm not a professional trader, financial advisor or a particularly astute financially literate person, so I'm not sure of how much worth this thing really is. But this was a fun project to work on and helps me keep a regular albeit automated eye on the market to help find opportunities as defined by my own personal investment preferences and inclinations. </p><p>I'm sure some of you would disagree with the validity of the metrics I'm tracking or some of the things I might have said in the post, but for me, this bot is pretty nifty. </p><p>I'd certainly not use it to advise others on what to buy or not, but for me and my own funds it's perfect, because it automates what I did manually anyway, just way more often and regular, thereby freeing up some of my time and mental energy for other endeavours. </p><p>It hasn't identified anything for me to buy as of yet, so I obviously can't vouch for its practical usefulness at this point, but it's only been running a couple of days and the market is rather bullish in general at the moment. But I'm patient, I'll wait. I know my bot's got my back.</p><p>I'll post an update again once it's made its first recommendations, and hopefully again after that, with some concrete results.</p><p>Thanks for reading.

      <p>The news that Tesla had invested $1.5 billion of its corporate cash in Bitcoin had all the components of a perfect storm for tech enthusiasts: Elon Musk tweets, magic internet money, and a graph pointing up and to the right. Just like his Twitter follower count, after the announcement:</p>

<p>Crypto advocates were euphoric. Tesla’s move would be the tipping point for Bitcoin, and crypto in general, to hit the mainstream, <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1358764055285145605?s=20" target="_blank">Bitcoin boosters crowed</a>. Indeed, crypto’s usual antagonist, Wall Street, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-tesla-quotes/tesla-announces-1-5-billion-bitcoin-bet-makes-payments-pledge-idUSKBN2A81PD" target="_blank">cheered along</a> this time. And if App Store ratings for Coinbase are any guide, enthusiasm for crypto investing among the retail crowd is at an all time high:</p>

<p>But the news provoked a backlash from an unexpected demographic: software developers. Check out <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26063920" target="_blank">this thread</a> at developer watering-hole Hacker News, for instance. It generated 1,271 comments. Here are some highlights:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Bitcoin is a mystery to me. Somehow it's hailed as revolutionising the economy, by replacing currency with a worse kind of currency.” — rzodkiew</p>

<p>“How is there a network effect if people aren't using Bitcoin to make or receive payments? Bitcoin is no more useful to me if my friend uses it versus a stranger. "Meme effect" is more like it -- the more hype there is, the better it is for anyone holding coins. The value comes from convincing enough new people to keep buying in. It's like a ponzi scheme in that respect.” —&nbsp;eli</p>

<p>“There's a lot of very very smart people who are totally lost among the trees on the technicalities of Bitcoin who don't get this one simple aspect. It's never happening.” —&nbsp;vp8989</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The backlash has not gone unnoticed in crypto-land. Here’s what one Ethereum core developer —&nbsp;the folks who make the whole protocol work —&nbsp; experienced on Twitter when the Tesla news broke:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>My timeline is interesting:</p><p>Post 1: Tesla, Bitcoin, Mooon, Mars<br>Post 2: Musk brought shame to Tesla<br>Post 3: Crypto is going mainstream<br>Post 4: You life is not about making money</p><p>Loop.</p></div>
— Péter Szilágyi (@peter_szilagyi) <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1358885818761379843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>What lies behind this apparent antipathy to crypto in what we might call “traditional” tech? I turned to a longtime developer who straddles the crypto world and more conventional tech circles named Lauren Garcia. The Bay Area native is developing an <a href="https://microsponsors.io/" target="_blank">advertising system</a> that swaps intrusive tech for blockchain tokens. She has also worked at places like Yahoo and DuckDuckGo over the years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Garcia says crypto is “the most polarizing subject” among her fellow developers. In one incident, a longtime collaborator expressed shock when he was told she was working on a crypto project. “I thought you were a good person,” was his sign off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Garcia attributes the tension to a clash of values: between well-off tradtechers who associate decentralization with open-source projects, who inevitably turn to Big Tech for patronage; and crypto millennials who believe they can tokenize their way to a decentralized internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Open-source folks have complained that there’s no way to monetize their work, and it’s true - I’ve spent hundreds of hours developing open-source work that gets no compensation,” she says. “It’s always been this unsolved problem, and the default is these open-source contributors get paid handsomely by a startup or enterprise company that can afford to support that project. It’s a patronage model, and the patronage comes from Big Tech.”</p>

<p>By contrast crypto is a grassroots movement with a hodgepodge of projects that get generated by enthusiastic young developers. Crypto projects have the advantage of being able to raise capital seemingly out of thin air, through mechanisms like initial coin offerings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The projects that get funded are what people are interested in,” Garcia says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Garcia might have a point. The researcher <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/" target="_blank">Nadia Eghbal</a> observed in her book ‘Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software’ that open-source developers generally complain about funding, but that the money problems were just a symptom of something deeper at work. Eghbal diagnoses the underlying issue as a disconnect between open-source developers’ utopic conception of their work and the reality they inhabited.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You see, open-source software was supposed to be a huge collaborative effort where developers would contribute code voluntarily to a commons, gifting their creations to humanity. But Eghbal discovered that open-source projects were becoming increasingly centralized, relying on a handful of developers instead of a broad cohort, even as the projects themselves gained massive adoption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eghbal calls this model of open-source development “the stadium,” where a coterie of software developers are encircled by occasional contributors. The devs are in turn encircled by ever expanding rings of software users, who simply consume the software. Stadium models, Eghbal writes, operate on access to the key developers’ attention.</p>

<p>“Much like a lake that requires paid licenses from fisheries to reduce overfishing, an open source project can require companies to pay to “appropriate” attention from the project’s developers,” Eghbal writes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The roots of the angst on Hacker News and elsewhere in the developer world might simply come from the fact that crypto people figured out a way to get themselves paid. Traditional devs might not like the fact that this solution requires spinning up — sometimes legally questionable —&nbsp;tokens and trading them, but the crypto market is worth well over $1 trillion dollars by now, according to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/global-charts/" target="_blank">TradingView data</a>. The coin slingers might be on to something.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it’s difficult to pinpoint the cultural divide between tradtech and crypto devs precisely, it’s clear that cryptocurrencies have proved to be a divisive and polarizing topic in just about every sphere it touches, from finance to politics and even to that supposedly most neutral of realms —&nbsp;technology.&nbsp;</p>


      

      
      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.
      </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			

<p>In late August 2020 I read <a href="https://press.stripe.com/#the-dream-machine">The Dream
Machine</a> and it is my favorite
book of 2020. It is an incredible overview of a sliver of computer pioneers in
the 1960s-1980s and how one man was instrumental in tying all their narratives
together. One of the strands the book follows is the group at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">PARC</a> (and other places) that
firmly believed in the notion of interactive computing. Over the last year,
I’ve repeatedly been introduced to this strand of thinking. There is Douglas
Engelbart’s <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned/Doug_Engelbart-AugmentingHumanIntellect.pdf">Augmenting Human
Intellect</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>
and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">mother of all
demos</a>. The notion that
computers should allow humans to <em>think better</em>, and one way to do that is to
allow humans to express and try out ideas better. <em>Writing</em> is a useful skill
to form coherent, but generally linear streams of thought. <em>Computing</em> is the
closest we can yet get to a non-linear exploration of a problem domain, and
freed from the limitations of time and space, we can recreate our thoughts in a
malleable, explorable way. By applying <a href="https://doriantaylor.com/softwares-ailing-mythology">a known process to known information,
but turning a few billion cranks at a
time</a> we can get to better
solutions, faster. The notion is, if we could have a <em>computer</em> (the physical
device including the software) that would allow people to iteratively express
their problems, get immediate sensory (primarily visual, but nothing prevents
using the other senses) feedback and <em>extend the computer as necessary</em>, we can
really liberate the human mind from some of its limitations. It is a very
different vision from the consensus reality of vendors that deliver
pre-packaged applications that all come with restrictions.</p>

<p>Smalltalk<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup> is one of the outputs of this strand of thinking and has had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#History">big impact on general purpose programming
languages</a><sup id="fnref:bak"><a href="#fn:bak">3</a></sup>. However the
focus on object orientation and test-driven development have robbed the world
of what I think are its most important aspects:</p>

<ol>
<li>programming as a dialogue with the computer, with meaningful feedback and <em>assistance</em>.</li>
<li>the environment being just as important to programming as the language, and empowering users to <em>modify the environment to help solve their problem</em>.</li>
<li>semantic simplicity as a necessity for easier comprehension in the face of the above points.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aditya Siram has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/baxtyeFVn3w">this excellent
talk</a> giving a taste of Smalltalk.
If you had to take only one thing away from this post, it is to go and watch
that. I knew I had to try this thing out! While I worked through the <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2021/experiencing-smalltalk/TODO">Pharo
MOOC</a> for a few days, I quickly lost interest in their examples. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent
of Code 2020</a> (AoC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> seemed like a much
better avenue to really try out Smalltalk. All my experiences are based on the
<a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a> variant, which seems to be the leading
implementation right now.</p>

<p>While I was working my way through AoC, Mike Levins wrote <a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/">On repl-driven
programming</a>. I
think he wasn’t fully able to convey the ideas of Smalltalk, because the term
“REPL” is too strongly associated with Python/JavaScript/Ruby REPLs at this
point. I hope I did my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642699">bit</a> of
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642717">evangelizing</a> to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642741">correct
that</a>. Alright, lets jump into
my experience.</p>



<h2 id="a-truly-integrated-development-environment-ide">A truly integrated development environment (IDE)</h2>

<p>What do I mean? Well Smalltalk really facilitates creating a program in an
exploratory style, including test-driven development. As an example, for Day 5,
I wrote the following:</p>



<p>Now, as soon as I “accept” this code (by pressing Ctrl+S), Smalltalk will ask
me if I would like to define this <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code> class. It will pop up
a little window to let me do that. It will also detect I wrote a test case
(because when I created a class for the test case, I inherited from <code>TestCase</code>)
and the system browser and other elements of the interface will have these
little gray/green/red dots next to every test case, letting me run the test and
observe the results right away. Now, this is offered in modern IDEs like
IntelliJ and PyCharm, but this was available 40 years ago in Smalltalk! But
that is just the beginning.</p>

<p>I can now run this test (remember I’ve only defined the <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code>
class at this point) and it will encounter the missing method <code>toSeat:</code> on the
class (think of this like a “static method” in Java/Python<sup id="fnref:static"><a href="#fn:static">5</a></sup>). In a
statically typed language, you would get a compilation error or have your IDE
highlight it for you. If you were in a dynamic language, then you’d just have
an exception thrown when running the program – <code>AttributeError</code> in Python.
Unless you explicitly ran the test in a debugger, that is all you would get and
now you’ve to go back to the editor, fix this, then re-run the test.</p>

<p>Not so in Smalltalk. First this isn’t just an IDE in the sense of a
language-aware editor. The IDE is also very aware of the runtime environment.
It will break at the stack frame with the missing method, and pop up a window.
You can <em>create</em> a method right there. This window has a full fledged editor
with code completion and all the other fanciness right there. I’m not aware of
any other environment<sup id="fnref:lisp"><a href="#fn:lisp">6</a></sup> that does this. Ok so we quickly recover by
creating the method. But I don’t know exactly what to put in there yet. Don’t
worry, this is Smalltalk. We don’t need to go through this cycle of rerunning
the entire test. The state of the running program is <em>preserved</em> until the
point where you hit the error, and you just tell the IDE “ok, I’ve fixed the
immediate error, let’s try again” and it will resume execution from there! You
can do this as many times as you wish, developing the code as a function of
encountering errors and test failures. This very fast iteration cycle feels
amazing! Imagine writing a much more complex program that was running for
minutes to hours but then hit an error. In most languages you would have to fix
it and start from the beginning, but in Smalltalk you would just fix it right
there and proceed.</p>

<p>I think browser developer tools are the closest we can come to having this kind
of interactivity in widespread computing environments. They don’t do that yet,
but they could. But we need to acknowledge how much work had to be put in to
those tools vs Smalltalk. In addition, the that implementation would likely
need to be in C++ instead of JavaScript, which means users wouldn’t be able to
extend and improve it as necessary. Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<h2 id="ide-extension-and-visualization">IDE extension and visualization</h2>

<p>Where most IDEs and language implementations are written in C/C++/Java,
Smalltalk prides itself on bootstrapping from a very minimal native code core.
After that nearly everything about the runtime and the IDE is written in
Smalltalk. The program and the environment are not 2 separate things, they are
one. When you execute your program, it is just another “thread” in the same
environment that you are creating the program in. You can do bizarre things
like remapping <code>true</code> to <code>false</code> or redefining what addition means and the
entire system will reflect the change right away (to disastrous results!). The
fact that the IDE and the program share a language means that any Smalltalk
programmer can understand and extend the IDE itself. Would you like a menu with
your most commonly used commands? Sure, just use the inspector/debugger to find
out where the menus are defined and add an entry there. Boom!</p>

<p>This also offers the really powerful ability to customize the debugger for the
task at hand. <a href="http://kursjan.github.io/petitparser2/">PetitParser2</a> is
probably the best example of this. It is a parser-combinator library. As Aditya
demonstrates in his talk, when you build up a parser, the parser provides
several hooks into the Smalltalk debugger. It can show you the matches it has
built up so far(including negative matches!) and you can run various inputs
against the parser to understand behavior. So you can start with a very simple
parser and iteratively make it complicated, observing the parse tree and
getting the behavior you want.</p>

<p>Whereas a lot of AoC implementations on reddit used various regex and string
operations for parsing inputs, I’d lean to PetitParser for anything beyond
simple white-space delimited numbers. It was just so easy and straightforward.
Instead of having to find subtle bugs in string parsing, I could actually see a
domain specific debugging view as my parser encountered tokens.</p>

<p>You could similarly imagine having domain specific drawings for your project.
If I was writing a build system in Smalltalk, I would write a build graph
viewer, and instead of a <a href="https://graphviz.org/">static graphviz image</a>, it
could be very interactive. While the build was running, it could update the
graph with file modification times, or indicate whether it thinks a file needs
to be rebuilt, and then I could easily debug why a particular file wasn’t being
built.</p>

<p>The folks at <a href="https://feenk.com/">Feenk</a> are really leveraging this in their
<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to fantastic effect! I highly
recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLZHVq_-2D2-iI4rA2O8Ug">their
videos</a>.</p>

<h2 id="minor">Minor</h2>

<p>I appreciated the built-in Array2D class for the various game-of-life
implementations as well as <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20">Jurassic
Jigsaw</a> where it was easy to reason in
terms of rows and columns, and quickly slice those out.  Similarly, the Point
class and special “syntax”<sup id="fnref:point"><a href="#fn:point">7</a></sup> made Day 12 <a href="https://github.com/nikhilm/AdventOfCode2020/blob/bbc331e2af2d948e683cade9ff4f93b4e4a3f667/AdventOfCode/AOCFerry.class.st">really
easy</a>.</p>



<p>Of course everything wasn’t magical. The Smalltalk/Pharo community is very
small, so this shouldn’t be considered a rant, just my disappointments.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>This was my biggest frustration. If we accept that <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">documentation has 4
distinct types</a>, Smalltalk does a great job
of Reference docs, because everything can easily be inspected and browsed, so
reading method documentation, while seeing its implementation is really easy.
You can also easily inspect what an object is at the point of use, and then see
what methods are available on it. However there is still plenty of scope for
improvement here, as not all non-trivial methods have docstrings. In addition,
for such a powerful IDE, the lack of documentation tooltips on hover is very
odd.</p>

<p>It really lags behind in the other categories. There is a wealth of great
content in <a href="http://books.pharo.org/">various free books</a> and the
<a href="http://mooc.pharo.org/">MOOC</a> that explains the language and getting around
the IDE. However all the books on various useful libraries are really out of
date. It isn’t fair to expect someone to …</p></section></div>

<p>Today, I looked up how many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS">floating point operations per second</a> (FLOPS) that an iPhone can do. It turns out the A14 chip in the iPhone <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/10/15/apple-claims-the-iphone-12s-a14-bionic-challenges-laptops-but-gives-no-details/">can do about 11 TFlOPS according to Apple</a>. Let's give Apple the benefits of the doubt and not get too deep into how they got that number, and put it to perspective and compare the iPhone with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_supercomputing">Top 500 Supercomputers</a> in the world over the years:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/iphone-vs-supercomputers.png" alt="iPhone vs Supercomputers"></p>
<p>The green line is how much computing power that little phone I'm holding in my hands has. If released in 2009, it would have made it to the list of top 500 supercomputers in the world! It has more computing power than the most powerful computer in the world in 2002. It has the combined computing power of the 1997's top 500 supercomputers in the whole world.</p>
<p>People talked about how the computer on Appolo was so slow. I get it, but I can hardly relate to that. I wasn't born then. However, 2009 was just 12 years ago. I could still remember it vividly. I was a freshman student then.</p>
<p>Reflecting on that, I figured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something with the form factor and power envelope of the phone alone is already exceedingly powerful. It could potentially do things that humankind couldn't achieve just ten years ago.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I don't need to have the most whizz-bang computer or phone to make programs that do amazing things. Writing programs for older hardware can be a pleasure. Supporting older hardware makes programs I create more accessible to a larger part of the human population.</li>
<li>As a programmer, when I complain about the phone or any computer I have is not powerful enough for whatever I want to do, it's much more likely it's me doing something wrong.</li>
<li>The world changes faster than my mind conceives. I need to be humble about what I know. Things I know to be fast becomes slow sooner than I expect. In the same realm, maybe ideas that I know to be good become bad sooner than I expect. Those ideas are not necessarily limited to technology: Maybe ideas in science, humanities, and society also envolve that way. It is just harder to put into numbers like TFLOPS.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have the most power computer in our pocket. Doing something amazing with that power should constantly be a question on our mind. All that power just to push one more ads is a fucking stupid and disgusting idea.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img alt="Chaos Engineering - How to simulate I/O faults at runtime" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/how-to-simulate-io-faults-at-runtime-39daaf89aa83a5be58402f763db0d5c5.jpg"></p><p>In a production environment, filesystem faults might occur due to various incidents such as disk failures and administrator errors. As a Chaos Engineering platform, Chaos Mesh has supported simulating I/O faults in a filesystem ever since its early versions. By simply adding an IOChaos CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), we can watch how the filesystem fails and returns errors.</p><p>However, before Chaos Mesh 1.0, this experiment was not easy and may have consumed a lot of resources. We needed to inject sidecar containers to the Pod through the mutating admission webhooks and rewrite the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> command. Even if no fault was injected, the injected sidecar container caused a substantial amount of overhead.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 has changed all this. Now, we can use IOChaos to inject faults to a filesystem at runtime. This simplifies the process and greatly reduces system overhead. This blog post introduces how we implement the IOChaos experiment without using a sidecar.</p><h2>I/O fault injection<a href="#io-fault-injection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>To simulate I/O faults at runtime, we need to inject faults into a filesystem after the program starts <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">system calls</a> (such as reads and writes) but before the call requests arrive at the target filesystem. We can do that in one of two ways:</p><ul><li>Use Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF); however, it <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/2336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot be used to inject delay</a>.</li><li>Add a filesystem layer called ChaosFS before the target filesystem. ChaosFS uses the target filesystem as the backend and receives requests from the operating system. The entire call link is <strong>target program syscall</strong> -&gt; <strong>Linux kernel</strong> -&gt; <strong>ChaosFS</strong> -&gt; <strong>target filesystem</strong>. Because ChaosFS is customizable, we can inject delays and errors as we want. Therefore, ChaosFS is our choice.</li></ul><p>But ChaosFS has several problems:</p><ul><li>If ChaosFS reads and writes files in the target filesystem, we need to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount</a> ChaosFS to a different path than the target path specified in the Pod configuration. ChaosFS <strong>cannot</strong> be mounted to the path of the target directory.</li><li>We need to mount ChaosFS <strong>before</strong> the target program starts running. This is because the newly-mounted ChaosFS takes effect only on files that are newly opened by the program in the target filesystem.</li><li>We need to mount ChaosFS to the target containter's <code>mnt</code> namespace. For details, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount_namespaces(7) — Linux manual page</a>.</li></ul><p>Before Chaos Mesh 1.0, we used the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mutating admission webhook</a> to implement IOChaos. This technique addressed the three problems lists above and allowed us to:</p><ul><li>Run scripts in the target container. This action changed the target directory of the ChaosFS's backend filesystem (for example, from <code>/mnt/a</code> to <code>/mnt/a_bak</code>) so that we could mount ChaosFS to the target path (<code>/mnt/a</code>).
Modify the command that starts the Pod. For example, we could modify the original command <code>/app</code> to <code>/waitfs.sh /app</code>.</li><li>The <code>waitfs.sh</code> script kept checking whether the filesystem was successfully mounted. If it was mounted, <code>/app</code> was started.</li><li>Add a new container in the Pod to run ChaosFS. This container needed to share a volume with the target container (for example, <code>/mnt</code>), and then we mounted this volume to the target directory (for example, <code>/mnt/a</code>). We also properly enabled <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount propagation</a> for this volume's mount to penetrate the share to host and then penetrate slave to the target.</li></ul><p>These three approaches allowed us to inject I/O faults while the program was running. However, the injection was far from convenient:</p><ul><li>We could only inject faults into a volume subdirectory, not into the entire volume. The workaround was to replace <code>mv</code> (rename) with <code>mount move</code> to move the mount point of the target volume.</li><li>We had to explicitly write commands in the Pod rather than implicitly use the image commands. Otherwise, the <code>/waitfs.sh</code> script could not properly start the program after the filesystem was mounted.</li><li>The corresponding container needed to have a proper configuration for mount propagation. Due to potential privacy and security issues, we <strong>could not</strong> modify the configuration via the mutating admission webhook.</li><li>The injection configuration was troublesome. Worse still, we had to create a new Pod after the configuration was able to inject faults.</li><li>We could not withdraw ChaosFS while the program was running. Even if no fault or error was injected, the performance was greatly affected.</li></ul><h2>Inject I/O faults without the mutating admission webhook<a href="#inject-io-faults-without-the-mutating-admission-webhook" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>What about cracking these tough nuts without the mutating admission webhook? Let's get back and think a bit about the reason why we used the mutating admission webhook to add a container in which ChaosFS runs. We do that to mount the filesystem to the target container.</p><p>In fact, there is another solution. Instead of adding containers to the Pod, we can first use the <code>setns</code> Linux system call to modify the namespace of the current process and then use the <code>mount</code> call to mount ChaosFS to the target container. Suppose that the filesystem to inject is <code>/mnt</code>. The new injection process is as follows:</p><ol><li>Use <code>setns</code> for the current process to enter the mnt namespace of the target container.</li><li>Execute <code>mount --move</code> to move <code>/mnt</code> to <code>/mnt_bak</code>.</li><li>Mount ChaosFS to <code>/mnt</code> and use <code>/mnt_bak</code> as the backend.</li></ol><p>After the process is finished, the target container will open, read, and write the files in <code>/mnt</code> through ChaosFS. In this way, delays or faults are injected much more easily. However, there are still two questions to answer:</p><ul><li>How do you handle the files that are already opened by the target process?</li><li>How do you recover the process given that we cannot unmount the filesystem when files are opened?</li></ul><h3>Dynamically replace file descriptors<a href="#dynamically-replace-file-descriptors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><strong>ptrace solves both of the two questions above.</strong> We can use ptrace to replace the opened file descriptors (FD) at runtime and replace the current working directory (CWD) and mmap.</p><h4>Use ptrace to allow a tracee to run a binary program<a href="#use-ptrace-to-allow-a-tracee-to-run-a-binary-program" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ptrace</a> is a powerful tool that makes the target process (tracee) to run any system call or binary program. For a tracee to run the program, ptrace modifies the RIP-pointed address to the target process and adds an <code>int3</code> instruction to trigger a breakpoint. When the binary program stops, we need to restore the registers and memory.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x86_64 architecture</a>, the RIP register (also called an instruction pointer) always points to the memory address at which the next directive is run.
To load the program into the target process memory spaces:</p></blockquote><ol><li>Use ptrace to call mmap in the target program to allocate the needed memory.</li><li>Write the binary program to the newly allocated memory and make the RIP register point to it.</li><li>After the binary program stops, call munmap to clean up the memory section.</li></ol><p>As a best practice, we often replace ptrace <code>POKE_TEXT</code> writes with <code>process_vm_writev</code> because if there is a huge amount of data to write, <code>process_vm_writev</code> performs more efficiently.</p><p>Using ptrace, we are able to make a process to replace its own FD. Now we only need a method to make that replacement happen. This method is the <code>dup2</code> system call.</p><h4>Use <code>dup2</code> to replace file descriptor<a href="#use-dup2-to-replace-file-descriptor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The signature of the <code>dup2</code> function is <code>int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);</code>. It is used to create a copy of the old FD (<code>oldfd</code>). This copy has an FD number of <code>newfd</code>. If <code>newfd</code> already corresponds to the FD of an opened file, the FD on the file that's already opened is automatically closed.</p><p>For example, the current process opens <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code> whose FD is <code>1</code>. To replace this opened file with <code>/var/run/test/a</code>, this process performs the following operations:</p><ol><li>Uses the <code>fcntl</code> system call to get the <code>OFlags</code> (the parameter used by the <code>open</code> system call, such as <code>O_WRONLY</code>) of <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code>.</li><li>Uses the <code>Iseek</code> system call to get the current location of <code>seek</code>.</li><li>Uses the <code>open</code> system call to open <code>/var/run/test/a</code> using the same <code>OFlags</code>. Assume that the FD is <code>2</code>.</li><li>Uses <code>Iseek</code> to change the <code>seek</code> location of the newly opened FD <code>2</code>.</li><li>Uses <code>dup2(2, 1)</code> to replace the FD <code>1</code> of <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code> with the newly opened FD <code>2</code>.</li><li>Closes FD <code>2</code>.</li></ol><p>After the process is finished, FD <code>1</code> of the current process points to <code>/var/run/test/a</code>. So that we can inject faults, any subsequent operations on the target file go through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filesystem in Userspace</a> (FUSE). FUSE is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code.</p><h4>Write a program to make the target process replace its own file descriptor<a href="#write-a-program-to-make-the-target-process-replace-its-own-file-descriptor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The combined functionality of ptrace and dup2 makes it possible for the tracer to make the tracee replace the opened FD by itself. Now, we need to write a binary program and make the target process run it:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>In the implementation above, we assume that:</p><ul><li>The threads of the target process are POSIX threads and share the opened files.</li><li>When the target process creates threads using the <code>clone</code> function, the <code>CLONE_FILES</code> parameter is passed.</li></ul><p>Therefore, Chaos Mesh only replaces the FD of the first thread in the thread group.</p></blockquote><ol><li>Write a piece of assembly code according to the two sections above and the usage of syscall directives. <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/toda/blob/1d73871d8ab72b8d1eace55f5222b01957193531/src/replacer/fd_replacer.rs#L133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is an example of the assembly code.</li><li>Use an assembler to translate the code into a binary program. We use <a href="https://github.com/CensoredUsername/dynasm-rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dynasm-rs</a> as the assembler.</li><li>Use ptrace to make the target process run this program.
When the program runs, the FD is replaced at runtime.</li></ol><h3>Overall fault injection process<a href="#overall-fault-injection-process" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The following diagram illustrates the overall I/O fault injection process:</p><p><img alt="Fault injection process" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/fault-injection-process-581a3b4c6954f9ccb3fc9eb17f45f937.jpg"></p><p> Fault injection process </p><p>In this diagram, each horizontal line corresponds to a thread that runs in the direction of the arrows. The <strong>Mount/Umount Filesystem</strong> and <strong>Replace FD</strong> tasks are carefully arranged in sequence. Given the process above, this arrangement makes a lot of sense.</p><h2>What's next<a href="#whats-next" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I've discussed how we implement fault injection to simulate I/O faults at runtime (see <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/toda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaos-mesh/toda</a>).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">

<p>Welcome to Ripen, a stack-based scripting engine with highly readable syntax, that can be implemented with little code and effort in a language like C++ or D. It's informed by RetroForth and PostScript, but diverges from either in important ways, not least due to its string-threaded nature. Surprisingly, Ripen only seems to be about 6 times slower than the host language on a quick test — much better than for other language families.

</p><p>Ripen is based on the principles explained in this <a href="https://notimetoplay.org/cgi-bin/wiki/More_about_tiny_scripting_engines"> interpreter construction tutorial</a>. The point is having a tiny engine, easily copy-pasted into any application, even hidden inside a bigger module. For this reason, the default vocabulary is kept small.

</p><h2>Download</h2>

<p>As of 6 December 2019, there are three implementations:

</p><ul>
 <li>the <a href="https://felix.plesoianu.ro/languages/forth/ripen/ripen.js">browser-based version</a> (embedded above);
 </li><li>the <a href="https://felix.plesoianu.ro/languages/forth/ripen/ripen.py">original Python prototype</a>;
 </li><li>a <a href="https://felix.plesoianu.ro/languages/forth/ripen/ripen-linux-x86_64.zip">native code edition</a> (395K) for 64-bit Linux PCs; includes D source code.
</li></ul>

<p>Ripen is free and open source software under the <a href="https://felix.plesoianu.ro/languages/forth/ripen/LICENSE.txt">Artistic License 2.0</a>.

</p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>At a basic level, Ripen works like most similar languages:

</p><pre><code>
	? 3 2 + . cr
	5
	 
	ok
	? :squared dup * ;
	ok
	? 3 2 + squared . cr
	25
	 
	ok
</code></pre>

<p>Note the lack of a space after the colon: Ripen doesn't use parsing words, instead relying on sigils to achieve similar functionality. E.g. variables work like this:

</p><pre><code>
	? 3 2 - &gt;a
	ok
	? $a . cr
	1
	 
	ok
</code></pre>

<p>On the minus side, there are no proper quoted strings; words in parentheses are simply joined by a space. Note that the closing paren is a word too, so it <em>must</em> be space-separated itself, on both sides:

</p><pre><code>
	? (  Hello,  world!  ) .
	Hello, world!
	ok
</code></pre>

<p>Speaking of which, comments are C-style instead. They're also executable, so you'll want to leave them on the outside of word definitions:

</p><pre><code>
	? /* s -- */ :say . cr ;
	ok
	? ( Hello, world! ) say
	Hello, world!
	 
	ok
</code></pre>

<p>Last but not least, control structures are inspired by Logo, to make them a lot more readable than in other stack-based languages:

</p><pre><code>
	? 3 2 + 3 2 * &lt; [ ( Yes! ) . ] iftrue
	Yes!
	ok
	? [ $i . cr ] 3 times
	0
	 
	1
	 
	2
	 
	ok
</code></pre>

<p>In the above, square brackets delimit lists of words, that control structures treat as blocks of code. Curly braces are synonymous:

</p><pre><code>
	? { dup * } /squared
	ok
	? 5 squared . cr
	25
	 
	ok
</code></pre>

<p>The reason both are provided is that lists of the same kind can't nest. And yes, that's another way to define words; beware that an older definition by the same name will be overwritten, and the entire script will see the new one right away.

</p><p>Otherwise, Ripen only provides a minimum of vocabulary:

</p><ul>
 <li>arithmetic: +, -, *, /, mod, /mod, negate, abs, min, max, 1+, 1-;
 </li><li>comparisons and logic =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, and, or, not, true, false;
 </li><li>stack manipulation: drop, dup, over, 2dup, swap, rot, -rot, clear;
</li></ul>

<p>and a few more conveniences. Enter <code>words</code> for a complete list.

</p><p>This page demonstrates how to embed and extend the JS version.

February 14, 2021 | https://mojolicious.io/blog/2021/02/14/announcing-mojolicious-9-0/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mojolicious.io/blog/2021/02/14/announcing-mojolicious-9-0/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

              <section id="section-1">
                  <p>The Mojolicious Core Team is delighted to announce the release and immediate availability of version 9.0 of the <a href="https://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious</a> real-time web framework.
Every Mojolicious major release has a <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojolicious#CODE-NAMES">code name</a> based on a unicode character and this one is lovingly named "Waffle" 🧇!</p>

<p>Every major release I think that there can't be much more to add or change in Mojolicious and then when the next one arrives I reflect on how much has changed since I last thought that.
In <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/SRI/Mojolicious-9.0">9.0</a> there's far too much to discuss each at length, so I'm going to highlight some of my favorites and then include a distilled list of changes since 8.0.</p>

<h2>Perl 5.16 and beyond</h2>

<p>Mojolicious now requires Perl version 5.16. This change gives us useful tools to build Mojolicious including the <code>__SUB__</code> token for building self-referential callbacks without leaking.
We were pleased that the community response since the change a few months ago has been ... well crickets.
This is great news since we do hope to move to Perl 5.20 in the not so distant future so that we can use Perl's native signatures once that is a sound option for us.
We are already encouraging the use of signatures both in the documentation and in our code generation commands.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous Functionality</h2>

<p>Clearly the highlight of the pre-9.0 development cycle has been the integration of Async/Await.
Thanks to Paul Evans (LeoNerd)'s efforts, when you have <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Future::AsyncAwait">Future::AsyncAwait</a> installed Mojolicious can use its new keywords <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> to provide the most seamless asynchronous development possible, something that is becoming more and more the standard for asynchronous code in other languages.
Writing a non-blocking endpoint is now as simple as</p>

<pre><code>use Mojolicious::Lite -signatures, -async_await;

# Request HTML titles from two sites non-blocking
get '/' =&gt; async sub ($c) {
  my $mojo_tx    = await $c-&gt;ua-&gt;get_p('https://mojolicious.org');
  my $mojo_title = $mojo_tx-&gt;result-&gt;dom-&gt;at('title')-&gt;text;
  my $cpan_tx    = await $c-&gt;ua-&gt;get_p('https://metacpan.org');
  my $cpan_title = $cpan_tx-&gt;result-&gt;dom-&gt;at('title')-&gt;text;

  $c-&gt;render(json =&gt; {mojo =&gt; $mojo_title, cpan =&gt; $cpan_title});
};

app-&gt;start;
</code></pre>

<p>When I teach non-blocking to people I can now tell them to follow a trivial recipe for most non-blocking tasks.
Simply <code>await</code> any function that returns a promise and mark any function that uses <code>await</code> with the <code>async</code> keyword.
Note also that all <code>async</code> functions return promises so <code>await</code> any calls to them.
There are some optimizations you can make at times and top-level <code>await</code> (if you aren't in a Mojolicious webapp) can be a little strange but to a first approximation that's all you need to write a non-blocking webapp today!</p>

<p>Speaking of promises (which are at the heart of Async/Await), Mojo::Promise has grown a lot this cycle too, adding <code>all_settled</code>, <code>any</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>timer</code>, and <code>timeout</code> class methods, changing its constructor to be more like the one in JavaScript and to warn when an unhandled rejected promise is destroyed.
The latter can help in development where such cases used to hide errors, now, much like the browser, you can at least find where things are going wrong even if you didn't wire all your promises to a catch callback like you should.</p>

                  <h2>Focus on Containerization and Cloud Deployments</h2>

<p>The Mojolicious Core Team is aware that more and more deployments are in containers and cloud services these days and we've been thinking of ways to make that easier.
With 9.0 we've added two new features specifically designed to help with these types of deployments.</p>

<p>Most existing applications assume a standard deployment by an unprivileged user behind a reverse proxy, but with new deployment strategies the number of configurations an application might expect are too numerous to expect each application to support.
To address this we've added support for <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojolicious/Guides/Cookbook#Deployment-specific-plugins">deployment specific plugins</a> that help you add deployment-level functionality to existing applications.
Now the deployer is in control of these features, rather than needing to ask the application author to add support.</p>

<p>We've also extended the existing <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojolicious/Guides/Cookbook#Reverse-proxy">reverse proxy</a> support to allow for multiple trusted proxies, specifically when you know what the expected IP address or CIDR network you're expecting proxy requests from.
This can be useful both when deploying from say Kubernetes where it is likely you'll have several layers of local proxies, or when you're behind a third-party proxy like CloudFlare, who publish a list of their proxy networks.
This is an important safety feature in these situations, blindly trusting forwarding headers can lead to <a href="https://twitter.com/logicbomb_1/status/1354452751619559428">big problems</a>.</p>

<p>Also, we've noticed that many cloud deployment tools are based on YAML, so we've added a YAML configuration file loader to our existing Perl and JSON configuration loaders.
Because YAML is a tricky target and because ours is technically not-quite-YAML, we've called ours cheekily <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojolicious/Plugin/NotYAMLConfig">NotYAMLConfig</a>.
In the unlikely event that that distinction should matter for your needs, you can load a specific YAML module from CPAN.</p>

<p>But it isn't just functionality, we've added a Dockerfile generation (<code>myapp generate dockerfile</code>) and added a Container <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojolicious/Guides/Cookbook#Containers">Cookbook recipe</a> to the documentation.
We've also added a <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojolicious/Guides/Cookbook#Envoy">Cookbook recipe</a> for the popular cloud-native proxy <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a>.
If you have other common container or cloud recipes that you think should be added, please let us know!</p>

<h2>Documentation Improvements</h2>

<p>Speaking of documentation, you might have noticed that both our <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/">documentation site</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/perlmojo/status/1343932370106392577/photo/1">built-in templates</a> for 404 and 500 pages have gotten a face lift.</p>

<blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Mojolicious 8.69 release brings redesigned exception and not_found pages with a fresh new look, enjoy. <a href="https://t.co/MHzvYnBJJw">pic.twitter.com/MHzvYnBJJw</a></p>— Mojolicious (@perlmojo) <a href="https://twitter.com/perlmojo/status/1343932370106392577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2020</a></blockquote>



<p>They're even prettier and easier to read than before, they're responsive, and they have a newer code library (highlight.js) to better render our code.
Further the documentation site is now redeployed immediately on any push to master of the website or the main Mojolicious projects, <code>mojolicious</code>, <code>mojo-pg</code>, and <code>minion</code>, so that you always have the most up-to-date docs at your fingertips.</p>

<p>Along with the container and cloud-native changes I've already highlighted, we have updated our documentation to use of upcoming Perl native signatures throughout and paired it with updating our <code>app</code> and <code>lite-app</code> generators to generate applications with signatures too.</p>

<h2>Routing (and Rendering)</h2>

<p>The routing engine is an often overlooked part of a web framework but it really is at the heart of everything that it does.
It can also be a source of confusion or frustration, especially when it doesn't do what you expect.
For 9.0 we've made the router both safer and more closely aligned to user expectations.</p>

<p>The biggest change is that Mojolicious now prevents applications from using reserved placeholders in routes.
This was originally considered a "feature" because it allowed very terse route definitions for quick apps, but in practice most people that understood how that worked just used the long form while unsuspecting newcomers would trip on it from time to time.
We've also made several cases throw exceptions when routing would fail that used to fail silently or unexpectedly.
When a route points to a missing controller, a namespace without a controller or a controller without an action, you now get an exception rather than a 404, which would often confuse people.
Additionally, you get an exception when when auto-rendering fails or a call to render cannot render a response, which would appear to hang (while it actually was trying to wait for a delayed response that was never going to happen).</p>

<p>We've even simplified some of the routing method names themselves.
We've removed the lesser-used <code>detour</code> and <code>route</code> methods in favor of the more generic <code>any</code> method.
We've renamed method that designates which HTTP methods to respond to (usually when picking several but not all of them, e.g. <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> but not <code>any</code>) from <code>via</code> to <code>methods</code>.
We've also renamed the method that designates conditional routing from <code>over</code> to <code>requires</code>.
I'm especially excited about this one since <code>over</code> implied a contrast with the commonly used <code>under</code> method, where no such contrast is meant to be implied; they do very different things.</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>

<p>The big one for me is that Mojolicious now is capable of sanely using a contextual logger!
Mojolicious applications have a <code>log</code> attribute that holds a <code>Mojo::Log</code> instance, however that logger is global to the application and any context you'd want to add is only for a given request/response cycle.
Unlike blocking frameworks, a Mojolicious app might switch between several requests before any are rendered, meaning manually keeping context attached to that global logger was nearly impossible.
With 9.0 we now have the ability to use a per-controller "child" logger which descends from the global logger and still logs via it, but can keep its own context information.
It feeds that information to its parent when you log from it.</p>

<p>By default, these child loggers now have a random request id attached to it, however you can put whatever context you'd like to add there.
You can also pass these loggers (themselves an instance of <code>Mojo::Log</code>) to models or other code that might want to log with that context attached.</p>

<p>We've also improved logging performance in cases where generating the log message is expensive and useless if the log level means that the log message is not emitted.
If you pass a closure (code reference) to the logger's <code>debug</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>warn</code>, <code>error</code>, and <code>fatal</code> methods and the logger will only invoke that closure if the log level check is met.
In fact this improved Mojolicious' own performance metrics by 10%!</p>

<pre><code>$c-&gt;log-&gt;debug(sub{ 'Thought you might want to know: ' . generate_expensive_log_output() });
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that we have changed the log format slightly so be aware if you care about such things.</p>

<p>And to simplify things, we've removed the confusing behavior of logging to a …</p></section></div></div>
