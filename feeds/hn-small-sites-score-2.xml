January 6, 2021 | https://khashtamov.com/en/sql-window-functions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://khashtamov.com/en/sql-window-functions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    
                        <p>It is interesting that many people working with data have no clue about window functions in SQL. During the long period of time instead of using window functions I prefered coding on Python and <a href="https://khashtamov.com/en/pandas-data-analysis/">pandas</a>. Today I would like to introduce you to the concept of "window" and how it is related to data extraction from a SQL database.</p>

<p><strong>Window functions</strong> are applied to a subset/window of rows related to one another. In comparison to <code>GROUP BY</code> operation, window functions do not decrease the number of rows. Aggregate functions like <code>AVG</code>, <code>SUM</code>, <code>COUNT</code> could be used as window functions as well. Usually window functions are used to do analytical tasks. The following examples of queries will be performed on PostgreSQL database.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre><code>&lt;function&gt;(&lt;expression&gt;) OVER (
  &lt;window&gt;
  &lt;sorting&gt;
  &lt;window range&gt; -- optional
)</code></pre>
<p>Looks creepy 😲 We need more practice. Let's assume that we have a salary table:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/salary_table_1.png" width="80%" data-image="atvi5p4igh4g"></figure>
<p><!--more-->One day your boss approaches you, he wants to know who is the highest paid employee by department. We can use the <code>MAX</code> function to select the highest salary by each department.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    department,
    MAX(gross_salary) as max_salary
FROM Salary
GROUP BY 1;
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>

<ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3273608550190378" data-ad-slot="9434009847"></ins>


<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/department_max_salary.png" width="80%" data-image="department_max_salary.png"></figure>
<p>In order to select the person with the highest salary by department we can use a subquery and <code>JOIN</code>:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    t.gross_salary
FROM Salary
JOIN (
    SELECT
        department,
        MAX(gross_salary) as gross_salary
    FROM Salary
    GROUP BY 1
) t USING(gross_salary, department);
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/highest_paid_employees.png" width="80%" data-image="highest_paid_employees.png"></figure>
<p>But the query looks verbose and dirty, maybe we can do the same with window functions? Sure. All you need to do is to set up a window for <code>MAX</code> aggregate function: </p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    MAX(gross_salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as max_gross_salary
FROM Salary;
</code></pre>
<p>The column <code>department</code> is a window. It means that employees from the same department is a subset or window of related rows. The result of the query:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/window_functions_highest_salary.png" width="80%" data-image="window_functions_highest_salary.png"></figure>
<p>As you can see we have the new column called <code>max_gross_salary</code> which shows the highest salary in each department. In order to retrieve the list of most paid employees we do the following:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM (
         SELECT id,
                first_name,
                department,
                gross_salary,
                MAX(gross_salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as max_gross_salary
         FROM Salary
     ) t
WHERE max_gross_salary = gross_salary
ORDER BY id;
</code></pre>
<p>Now your boss asks you to prepare the report which shows the ratio of salaries by department and by the total wage fund because some departments have relatively low-income employees in comparison with other departments. You can solve it using subqueries:</p>
<pre><code>WITH gross_by_departments AS (
    SELECT
        department,
        SUM(gross_salary) as dep_gross_salary
    FROM Salary
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9, 2)) / dep_gross_salary * 100, 2) as dep_ratio,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9, 2)) / (SELECT SUM(gross_salary) FROM Salary) * 100, 2) as total_ratio
FROM Salary
JOIN gross_by_departments USING(department)
ORDER BY department, dep_ratio DESC
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/subqueries_salary_ratios.png" width="80%" data-image="subqueries_salary_ratios.png"></figure>
<p>As you can see Нина earns 71.4% out of HR department, but it is only 10.7% out of total wage fund. Аркадий on the other hand has 21.4% out of total wage fund and 41% out of IT department. Can we refactor the query to make it smaller and more readable? Yes! <strong>Window functions</strong>!</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9,2)) / SUM(gross_salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) * 100, 2) as dep_ratio,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9,2)) / SUM(gross_salary) OVER () * 100, 2) as total_ratio
FROM Salary
ORDER BY department, dep_ratio DESC; 
</code></pre>
<p>The expression <code>OVER()</code> means that the "window" is all rows.</p>
<h2>Window functions only</h2>
<p>We used the aggregate functions <code>MAX</code> &amp; <code>SUM</code> as window functions above. But SQL standard consists of functions which cannot be used as aggregates hence no way to apply them during grouping. Here is the list of them:

</p>
<ul>
<li>first_value</li>
<li>last_value</li>
<li>lead</li>
<li>lag</li>
<li>rank</li>
<li>dense_rank</li>
<li>row_number</li>
</ul>
<p>The comprehensive list of all window functions supported in PostgreSQL you can find <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Using window functions</h3>
<p>Let's use the <code>first_value</code> function in order to solve the very first problem where we were asked to get the name of the highest paid employee by each department. The function returns the very first values according to the provided window.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    first_value(first_name) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY gross_salary DESC ) as highest_paid_employee
FROM Salary
</code></pre>
<p>We are sorting the rows in our window by salary in a descending order, it means that the very first row will be a person with the highest salary.</p>
<p>Now let's use <code>last_value</code>. It does the opposite of what <code>first_value</code> does.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT id,
       first_name,
       department,
       gross_salary,
       last_value(first_name)
       OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY gross_salary DESC) AS lowest_paid_employee
FROM Salary
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/lowest_paid_employees_last_value_window_function.png" width="80%" data-image="lowest_paid_employees_last_value_window_function.png"></figure>
<p>If you look at the table you will see that the result is wrong. Why? Because of window ranges. By default if you provide the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause the window range is all preceding rows and current row, in SQL terms it is <code>ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW</code>. It means that the <code>last_value</code> for a particular column in a particular row is a column in the same row. In order to fix this problem we need to change the range to <code>ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</code>:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT id,
       first_name,
       department,
       gross_salary,
       last_value(first_name)
       OVER (
           PARTITION BY department
           ORDER BY gross_salary DESC
           ROWS BETWEEN
               UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
               AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
           ) as lowest_paid_employee
FROM Salary
</code></pre>
<p>This is how it looks visually:</p>
<figure><span id="selection-marker-start">﻿</span><span id="selection-marker-end">﻿</span><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/unbounded_preceding_current_row_unbounded_following.png" data-image="r9u3sqk8i9v7"><span id="selection-marker-start">﻿</span><span id="selection-marker-end">﻿</span></figure>
<p>The possible values:</p>
<ul>
<li>N PRECEDING, N number of rows until current row</li>
<li>CURRENT ROW</li>
<li>UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</li>
<li>UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</li>
<li>N FOLLOWING**, N number of rows following current row</li>

</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-12-23">December 23, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>A few weeks ago, we wrote a massively successful <a href="#">IMGZ systems architecture article</a> that ended up going viral (note to editor: are we still allowed to say "viral" in 2020?) and upending the world of image hosting.
Here we were, a small newcomer, poised to take on the giants of the multi-billion-dollar image hosting industry with our new, innovative and daring business model of charging people for services.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, all the media attention caused our user count to skyrocket, and our subscription graph started exhibiting the familiar "hockey stick" pattern that every VC in Silicon Valley wants to be hit with:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/iQYRKWrE.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Rather unsurprisingly, such an influx of new users caused a deluge of new content being uploaded to the platform. We estimate that, with our current level of usage, up to a thousand images could be getting uploaded to the service every year.</p>
<p>Naturally, we immediately sprang into action to preserve the reliability of our infrastructure, and quickly drew up a scaling plan that would enable the service to withstand its newfound popularity. This is where our foresight when designing the service paid off, as the hosting provider we use let us quickly perform the necessary changes and provision an extra gigabyte of disk space.</p>
<h2>One thing becomes clear</h2>
<p>However, one thing became clear: We could not sustain this breakneck pace for long by ourselves. This was never more obvious than a few days ago, when we realized we were close to failing to meet our uptime guarantee for 2020, and had to take the service offline for a few days to bring our uptime down to what we promised.</p>
<p>This event highlighted that there is just too much to do in a fledgling startup that aims to become the next MySpace, and even more to do in one that specifically wants to <em>avoid</em> becoming the next MySpace. If we were ever to realize the IMGZ vision and change the world, we needed more people.</p>
<h2>We're hiring!</h2>
<p>If you're young, passionate about creating software that changes the world and don't know what "3x investor preference" means, you're exactly who we're looking for! You have the opportunity to join an innovative, fast-growing company with a modern technology stack.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we don't just want to serve images, no. The values of IMGZ are far loftier than that. At IMGZ we live and breathe images to the point where our values can only be communicated <strong>with</strong> an image:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/i9xyk2H2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In talking with various prospective hires, one thing became abundantly clear: Nobody joins a startup for the money, they do it to get rich. With this in mind, we found the perfect balance of the "early startup employee" compensation package: 50% stock, 50% equity, 0% salary.</p>
<p>That's right! We can maximize the potential of your stock by doing away with a significant company expense: Employee salaries. This way, your stock is much more likely to be worth a lot more (and you have a lot of it, since our packages start at three trillion shares per employee! That's a big number).</p>
<p>Everyone we discussed this with loved the approach, and it makes intuitive sense: Name one Google employee who became a millionaire from their salary. We bet you can't, yet all of us know the name of that cleaning lady who was given Google stock and now she has "VC" on her CV, you know the one we're talking about.</p>
<h2>Interview process</h2>
<p>Like any self-respecting Silicon Valley startup, we can't just settle for any old 10x rockstar developer who wants to join. Firing people is expensive, you know? That is why we have prepared a thorough, six-stage interview process.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being a pragmatic, practice-driven development team, and we want to see how you perfom in real-world scenarios, so you will be given a feature from our product roadmap and will be asked to develop it to your satisfaction. Afterwards, we will use this feature in our product and see how users like it. If they do, that will be a point in your favor.</p>
<p>Of course, we can't really know if you developed the feature yourself or paid someone on Fiverr to do it for you, so for the next stage of the interview we will ask you to invert a data structure on a whiteboard. None of us knows how or cares enough about what you're doing, so we'll pretend to not like random things about your solution until you're on the verge of tears, to evaluate how you fare against the ever-changing requirements that come with bad leadership.</p>
<p>If you pass the whiteboard interviews without cracking, we'll introduce you to everyone on the team, making sure you have at least eight hours of one-on-one time with various staff members, often more than once. This is just so we get to know you better and see what you're like in social situations.</p>
<p>After wasting a few days of your time and ours, we'll finally adjourn and haphazardly email each other about you, mostly trying to remember which applicant you were from flaws in your appearance. We'll then round up all the notes and observations from your technical interviews and summarize everything we know about you into one list.</p>
<p>For the final decision, we'll look at the list and evaluate you purely on your technical merits, trying to confirm the judgment that we've already subconsciously formed based on how much you are like us. If you are too different, we're sorry, no matter how good you are technically, we'll pass. In this company, we value one thing above all others: Diversity.</p>
<h2>Apply today!</h2>
<p>If the above sounds appealing, excellent! Reach out to us at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><span data-cfemail="f29a9b809b9c95b29b9f9588dc919d9f">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> to get the ball rolling, and you might soon be "working" for the best image host in the world, IMGZ!</p>

  <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>One of the less known Vim features is “abbreviations”. It’s something similar to mapping, but it has a different purpose.</p>
<p>Abbreviations are a very flexible and really powerful tool.</p>
<p>For simplicity, this post will cover only the Insert mode abbreviations.
This is Part 1 of the post. Part 2 will be published soon.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="basic-use-of-abbreviations">Basic use of abbreviations</h2>
<p><strong>The command</strong><br>
The command for Insert mode abbreviations looks like this:</p>
<p><code>:iabbrev [&lt;expr&gt;] [&lt;buffer&gt;] {abbreviation} {expansion}</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> -  stands for Vimscript expression to create the expansion.</li>
<li><code>&lt;buffer&gt;</code> -  means that it only applies to the current buffer.</li>
<li><code>{abbreviation}</code> -  is the thing you type, or your “trigger”</li>
<li><code>{expansion}</code> - is your final outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything that’s inside a [] is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Correcting typos</strong><br>
Let’s start with the simple commands first.</p>
<p>Run this command in your Vim: <code>:iabbrev teh the</code>. Now enter the Insert mode and type <code>teh end</code>.
As soon as you hit <kbd>Space</kbd> after typing the <code>teh</code>, Vim will replace it with <code>the</code>.</p>
<p>You probably have a few or more words which you misspell quite often. This is a good way to solve that problem.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding commonly used phrases</strong><br>
Of course, you can store all of your abbreviations in your <code>.vimrc</code> file. For example:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev @@ hi@jovica.org
iabbrev ccc Copyright 2020 Jovica Ilic, all rights reserved.
</code></pre><p>You’re coding in C? How about:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev #i #include
iabbrev #d #define
</code></pre><p>Now, let’s create one abbreviation with a Vimscript expression. We can use <code>strftime()</code> function.
If you run this command in Vim: <code>:put =strftime('%c')</code>, you’ll insert the current date and time in your current buffer.</p>
<p>So, we can do something like this with an abbreviation:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev &lt;expr&gt; ddd strftime('%c')
</code></pre><p>Save your <code>.vimrc</code>, open Vim and try them out. Cool, ha? :)</p>
<p>Basic text expanding and correcting spelling mistakes are just the tip of the iceberg. You can use abbreviations to generate entire code snippets.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="advanced-use-of-abbreviations">Advanced use of abbreviations</h2>
<p>Let’s create an abbreviation for generating a C style comment:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev cc /*&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;/&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>Basically, after you type <code>cc</code> in Insert mode and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, a code snippet like this is generated:</p>
<p>In the expression above, we basically told Vim to type <code>/*</code> then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice(<code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>), type <code>/</code> and hit the <kbd>↑</kbd> key.</p>
<p>If you have to write Java code for a living, you could add something like this to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>So every time you type <code>psvm</code> and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, you get a snippet like:</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args){

}
</code></pre><p><strong>File-type specific abbreviations</strong><br>
What if you want to use the same abbreviation for multiple programming languages? This is possible, as you can use abbreviations in auto commands. This way, you can create file-type specific abbreviations.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to make one abbreviation for printing a string in Python and Java.</p>
<pre><code>"python
autocmd Filetype python :iabbrev ppp print("");&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;
"java
autocmd FileType java :iabbrev ppp System.out.println("");&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;
</code></pre><p>With these lines in your <code>.vimrc</code>, you can now hit <code>ppp</code> and <kbd>Space</kbd>, and depending on the file type, you’ll insert an appropriate snippet for printing a string!</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at another, more complex example:</p>
<pre><code>autocmd FileType c iabbrev start #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \int main() {
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \  printf("hello\n");
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \  return 0;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \}
</code></pre><p>So if you open a <code>.c</code> file, type <code>start</code> and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, you’ll get the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;

int main() {
      printf("hello\n");
        return 0;

}
</code></pre><p>This is pretty cool. But all these “Enters” and other keys we need to simulate make these expressions a bit overwhelming. There’s a better way!</p>
<p><strong>Vim commands in abbreviations</strong><br>
Let’s get back to the previous abbreviation we defined for Java:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>We can achieve the same result with the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;esc&gt;O
</code></pre><p>What happens here? Let’s see:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>psvm</code> - our “trigger” expression</li>
<li><code>public static void main(String[] args){</code> - first part of the string to insert</li>
<li><code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> - hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> once</li>
<li><code>}</code> - second part of the string to insert</li>
<li><code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> - hitting <kbd>Esc</kbd> once and entering the Normal mode</li>
<li><code>O</code> - Normal mode command, which puts you in Insert mode, one line above your current line</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of simulating every single keystroke, we can “hit” <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go to Normal mode. From there, we can run any command we want :)</p>
<p>How about creating a <em>for loop</em>, and placing our cursor in Insert mode, exactly where the cursor should be?</p>
<p>Here’s a simple C-style loop sample:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>&lt;=</span><span>NUM</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We could create an abbreviation like this:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev forl for (i=1; i&lt;=NUM; i++) {&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;Esc&gt;?NUM&lt;CR&gt;cw
</code></pre><p>What happens here:</p>
<ul>
<li>At first, we insert the first part of the string</li>
<li>Then we hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice, and insert the second part of the string (<code>}</code>)</li>
<li>After that, we hit <kbd>Esc</kbd></li>
<li>Then we perform a search backwards for string <code>NUM</code>, by “hitting” <code>?NUM</code> and <kbd>Enter</kbd></li>
<li>Lastly, we run the <code>cw</code> command which stands for “change word”. This way we delete the string <code>NUM</code> and stay in the Insert mode, ready to type a desired value.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 id="theres-more">There’s more</h2>
<p>There’s much more to be said about abbreviations.</p>
<p>Here are just a few interesting bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just like mappings, abbreviations can be local to a buffer.</li>
<li>Abbreviations are never recursive.</li>
<li>Abbreviations can be mapped.</li>
<li>To avoid the abbreviation in Insert mode, you can hit Ctrl-v before the character that would trigger the abbreviation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll cover things like these in the upcoming, Part 2, of this post.<br>
Also, abbreviations are something I’ll definitely cover in the new edition of <a href="https://jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/">Mastering Vim Quickly: From WTF to OMG in no time</a>.</p>

<span>Knead</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.csv"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.json"</span><span>)</span>

<p><code><span>dataknead</span></code> has inbuilt loaders for CSV, Excel, JSON, TOML and XML and you can easily write your own.</p>
<div id="philosophy">
<h2>Philosophy<a href="#philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><code><span>dataknead</span></code> is intended for easy conversion between common data formats and basic manipulation. It’s not a replacement for more complex libraries like <code><span>pandas</span></code> or <code><span>numpy</span></code>, but instead can be a useful addition to those libraries.</p>
<p>The API is as minimal as possible and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">fluent</a>.</p>
<p>The loaders for the different file formats are built upon existing and well-tested libraries like <a href="https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict">xmltodict</a> and <a href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">openpyxl</a>.</p>

<p>Install <code><span>dataknead</span></code> from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dataknead">PyPi</a>.</p>

<p>Then import</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>dataknead</span> <span>import</span> <span>Knead</span>

<div id="basic-example-tutorial">
<h2>Basic example &amp; tutorial<a href="#basic-example-tutorial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let’s say you have a small CSV file with cities and their population called <code><span>cities.csv</span></code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>city</span><span>,</span><span>country</span><span>,</span><span>population</span>
<span>Amsterdam</span><span>,</span><span>nl</span><span>,</span><span>850000</span>

<span>Venice</span><span>,</span><span>it</span><span>,</span><span>265000</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And you want to load this csv file and transform it to a json file.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>dataknead</span> <span>import</span> <span>Knead</span>

<span>Knead</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.csv"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.json"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You’ll now have a json file called <code><span>cities.json</span></code> that looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>"city"</span> <span>:</span> <span>"Amsterdam"</span><span>,</span>

    <span>},</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Maybe you just want the city names and write them to a CSV filed called <code><span>city-names.csv</span></code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>dataknead</span> <span>import</span> <span>Knead</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That will give you this list</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>Amsterdam</span>
<span>Rotterdam</span>
<span>Venice</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now you want to extract only the cities that are located in Italy, and write that back to a new csv file called <code><span>cities-italy.csv</span></code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>dataknead</span> <span>import</span> <span>Knead</span>

<span>Knead</span><span>(</span><span>"cities.csv"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>r</span><span>:</span><span>r</span><span>[</span><span>"country"</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>"it"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"cities-italy.csv"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This gives you this:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>city</span><span>,</span><span>country</span><span>,</span><span>population</span>

        <section>
            <div><p>I'm <em>still in the game</em>, so join me as I explore the highlights of a second year of independent business and creating Open Source software. I'll share my top blog posts by views, top interviews, books that have influenced me and a little about each project I maintain. At the end of the post I'll talk about what 2021 has in store.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a lot of help this year, so I want to thank all my company's customers, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/alexellis">my GitHub Sponsors</a>, and everyone who contributed or helped to share.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mostpopularblogpostsof2020">Most popular blog posts of 2020</h2>
<p>Over the past year, I've focused on developing the OpenFaaS and inlets brands, and I've also experimented with Medium's Partner Program. These are the four blogs where you would have seen me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openfaas.com/blog">openfaas.com/blog</a> - OpenFaaS tutorials and news</li>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/blog">inlets.dev/blog</a> - case-studies, tutorials and news on inlets</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/">blog.alexellis.io</a> - my original blog for experiments, technical writing, tutorials that don't fit with one of the other brands.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@alexellisuk">medium.com/@alexellisuk</a> - blog posts that I think can be monetized</li>
</ul>
<p>It's been encouraging to see my posts trending on Hacker News, Reddit and Twitter, along with being included in newsletters like <a href="https://kubeweekly.io/">KubeWeekly</a> and <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/cronweekly/">cron.weekly</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the most popular blog posts from the year ranked by views:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>I now have hundreds of blog posts going back several years, so it's difficult to read too much into the numbers, as it depends on how much traffic the site gets and where it has trended. A post on Hacker News could get 15k views overnight, and another more impactful post could get a steady stream of 3k per day from organic searches.</p>
<p>This year I've mainly focused on use-cases, and on capturing the imagination. In 2021, you'll see more of the same along with more guest posts on the blogs.</p>
<h2 id="bestinterviewsfeatures">Best interviews / features</h2>
<p>As part of <a href="https://github.com/readme">GitHub's readme program</a>, I was invited to write a feature-length piece on independent business and Open Source development</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readme/alex-ellis">Balancing open source sacrifice and success</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this gives you a deeper perspective on what it's like to be on the hook for a large OSS project.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/craigbox?lang=en">Craig Box</a> from Google reached out to me and asked me: "Why aren't you working for a FAANG company for 350K USD / year"?</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Craig had sketched out a brief history of my career in a Google Doc, and we were recording a podcast with his co-host</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/116-independent-open-source/">Kubernetes Podcast #116 - Independent Open Source</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Learn how a developer at a payroll company became a Docker Captain, caused a stir with a prototype, and quit his job to create an independent software business.</p>
<h2 id="influentialreads">Influential reads</h2>
<p>I've read a number of books this year that have had an influence on me. I can't say that I finished them all, but I did get something from each that has helped me with my journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://neildavidson.com/downloads/dont-just-roll-the-dice-2.0.0.pdf">Don't just roll the dice</a> - a short guide to software pricing by Neil Davidson - this book taught me about the "pricing curve" - and how once a price rises above 0USD (think open source), you lose part of your potential market. There is a sweet spot on the curve. It also taught me about "price anchoring" - where a similar product becomes the way people expect your offering to be priced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3hoCFpb">Before The Exit: Thought Experiments For Entrepreneurs by Dan Andrews</a> - this book showed me that a product or project gives a platform and outlet, that once taken away can leave a void. It also challenged the idea that selling a business is the only successful outcome. And that receiving a windfall of cash, isn't necessarily as fulfilling as we would hope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/38H5okY">The Irresistible Consultant's Guide to Winning Clients by David A. Fields</a> - the main learning in this book is that success is found not in selling what you think you are able to, but in finding what pain a customer might have, and offering a solution that could help. Likewise, they need to sense urgency and enough pain to buy the solution. It also has to be simple enough to make sense to them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A good example of this would be Tailwind UI - a series of HTML and CSS snippets built by a designer and marketed to developers. Most backend developers are hopeless at making things look nice on a webpage.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3oaFQU5">The Visual MBA by Jason Barron</a> - having spent so much of my life giving all of the value I was creating away for free, this book helped me understand a framework for testing business ideas and iterating on them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, from a business and sustainability perspective, Open Source software fails its creators and only benefits its users.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3hoG0Vd">Start with Why by Simon Sinek</a> - the premise of this book was enough for me to stop and question things. When you're responsible for picking what you're working on, then asking Why? becomes even more important. Why did I start OpenFaaS? Why am I still working on it?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a why and challenging it over time could save us all a lot of wasted time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common theme in all of these books was that customers buy ways to reduce and remove pain. It needn't be a 10x improvement, but it should be an obvious solution, and they need to have a sense urgency about fixing the problem.</p>
<p>I would also say that I've become more aware of "Indie Hackers" - these are solo developers who come up with what's usually a very trivial idea, but execute on it hard. One example that caught my attention was a service that just <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/">makes banner images for blog posts</a>. That was it. That was the product. From the outside, it looks like a simple idea that is easily copied, but by pressing in, he is now earning 8k USD per month from a platform, which I imagine costs very little to run.</p>
<p>When I compare this to my journey with OpenFaaS, and consider that its <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">recurring revenue on GitHub Sponsors</a> is only around 500 USD / mo, from one end-user company, it makes me question the ideology of Open Source Software.</p>
<h2 id="projecthighlights">Project highlights</h2>
<h3 id="inletscloudnativetunnels">inlets - Cloud Native tunnels</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>inlets was created to make tunnels something we could self-host, to get away from the limitations of SaaS products, and to integrate deeply with VMs, containers and Kubernetes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year I launched a landing page and blog for <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO</a>. To begin with it was just a few pieces of Tailwind UI tied together that showed pricing and features. It was a starting-point, but then over time it's evolved and now even has its own blog with guest posts.</p>
<p>Highlights for inlets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>inlets blog launched - the first post was about my inlets presentation on <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/10/08/advanced-cloud-patterns.html">"Advanced cloud patterns" at cert-manager's community day</a>. Since then I've seen several guest posts and an uptick in visits to the domain because of SEO and social sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business customers - inlets PRO has seen lots of customer interest over the year, and had its first business customers. I've got used to qualifying leads, following-up on free trials and more used to rejection.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Any compiler or transpiler is doing some form of program synthesis. But “proper” program synthesis usually means generation of high level programs from scratch, given only high level problem descriptions.</p>
<p>This post is about one of the most simple and straightforward methods of automatic program synthesis: inductive synthesis based on <strong>input-output examples</strong> specification and <strong>brute-force enumerative</strong> search.</p>
<h3>Synthesis task specification</h3>
<p>Let's start with a simple example. Suppose that we want to automatically generate a program that reverses an array.</p>
<p>How to formulate this task for the automatic program generator? One option is to just describe it in natural language. But it would be quite hard to automatically parse and understand. A simpler way is to provide examples of inputs and expected outputs:</p>
<p>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] → [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]</p>
<p>[5, 2, 7, 6] → [6, 7, 2, 5]</p>
<p>It's similar to a programmer working on a task using test-driven development, with a set of self-explanatory tescases.</p>
<h3>Brute-force search</h3>
<p>How to find a program that satisfies some input-output examples? There are several possible search strategies, but the simplest one is just with a brute force enumeration.</p>
<p>The idea is to generate all programs (within some size liimts and a limited language subset), and pick the first one that works correctly for all specified examples.</p>
<p>This is probably the least efficient approach of all, but with some additional optimizations and heuristics for reducing the search space it can actually be practical.</p>
<p>For example, an algorithm that won last year's synthesis competition <a href="https://sygus.org/comp/2019/">SyGuS-Comp 2019</a> in programming-by-examples track, is based on brute-force enumerative search strategy. As well as some previous years winners (<a href="#examples" id="ref1">EUSOLVER, Enumerative CEGIS Solver</a>). There are even some practical applications, for example brute-force search can be used for <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2462174">synthesising distributed systems protocols</a>.</p>
<h3>Generating Javascript</h3>
<p>For generating and manipulating programs, code has to be represented as a data structure. This is not a problem in homoiconic languages like Lisp, but in Javascript it’s harder.</p>
<p>One simple idea (used, for example in miniMAL project <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL">https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL</a>), is to use JSON for representing programs. In this case, JSON arrays are serving as an analog of Lisp s-expressions.</p>
<p>Similar to an s-expression, each JavaScript expression is represented as a JSON array. First element is a function name, and the rest of elements are for function arguments.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong></td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong></td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>Math.pow(x, 2)</td>
   <td>["Math.pow", "x", 2]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Math.pow(Math.sin(x), 2)</td>
   <td>[“Math.pow”, [“Math.sin”,  “x”], 2]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For operators, can use prefix notation:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>x = 2 + 2</td>
   <td>["=", x, ["+", 2, 2]]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>There are some special expressions formats: control flow, variables declaration.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let x = 1
   </td>
   <td> ["let", "x", 1]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i += 1) { console.log(i) }
   </td>
   <td>["for”, ”i”, ”0”, ”10”, ”1”,["block", [“console.log”, “i”]]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>if (i &gt; 1) { i = 1; }
   </td>
   <td>["if", [“&gt;“, “i”, 1], ["block", [“=“, “i”, 1]]]
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Also need syntax conventions for calling methods, accessing properties, and indexing arrays:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>let a = new Array(0, 1, 2)
   </td>
   <td>["let", "a", ["new Array", 0, 1, 2]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>a.shift()
   </td>
   <td>[".shift", "a"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let n1 = a.length
   </td>
   <td>["let",  "n1", [".length_", "a"]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let n2 = a[1]
   </td>
   <td>["let",  "n2", ["get_index", a, 1]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>a[1] = 2
   </td>
   <td>["set_index", a, 0, 0]
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This allows to represent a wide range of possible JavaScript expressions, and covers all language features needed for a simple demo.</p>
<p>Code for transforming from JSON representation to Javascript is fairly simple. It just has to traverse arrays, print out expressions elements in correct order, and deal with code formatting.</p>
<h3>Simple DSL</h3>
<p>For brute-force search to be feasible, search space has to be limited to some restricted domain-specific language subset, which depends on the kind of the target problem.</p>
<p>For example, can design a simple DSL targeted for simple array processing. It should have functions for array access and manipulation, simple arithmetics, and control flow functions.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td><strong>function</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>subtract
   </td>
   <td>number = number?? - number??
   </td>
   <td>["-", "number??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>add
   </td>
   <td>number = number?? + number??
   </td>
   <td>["+", "number??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>greater than
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? &gt; number??
   </td>
   <td>["&gt;", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>less than
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? &lt; number??
   </td>
   <td>["&lt;", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>equal
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? == number??
   </td>
   <td>["==", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>array length
   </td>
   <td>number = array??.length
   </td>
   <td>[".length_", "array??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>get array element at index
   </td>
   <td>number = array??[number??]
   </td>
   <td>["get_index", "array??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>set array element at index
   </td>
   <td>array??[number??] = number
   </td>
   <td>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>for loop
   </td>
   <td>for (let i in array??) { ?? }
   </td>
   <td>["for", "i", ["block", "??"], "in", "array??", ""]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>If condition
   </td>
   <td>if (boolean??) { ?? }
   </td>
   <td>["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""],
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In the DSL description, "??" stands for an undefined value, that can be replaced with an expression or a variable. This notation is taken from <a href="#sketch" id="ref2">SKETCH language</a>, where "??" represents a <em>hole,</em> a placeholder that the synthesizer can replace with an integer constant.</p>
<p>Some undefined values have annotated types. For example "number??" means that the argument should be replaced with an expression that has "number" return value. This allows for additional limitations on the search space.</p>
<h3>Algorithm for program generation</h3>
<p>How to generate all programs that can be represented with the DSL? The algorithm is fairly simple: start with some undefined values, and iteratively replace them with all possible options picked from the list of DSL expressions. Selected and pasted expressions would contain some undefined values of their own, so the process is repeated until all the options are used, or until expressions tree depth reaches some limit.</p>
<p>It’s like iterative template rewriting, and it’s easier to demonstrate with an example:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
	<td>1. Start with an empty/undefined program </td>
	<td>["??", "??", "??", "??"] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>2. Traverse the expressions tree, and pick the first occurring undefined value </td>
	<td>[<span>"??"</span>, "??", "??", "??"] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>3. List all options for replacing this value (expressions that have an empty return type) </td>
	<td><span>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]</span><br>
		["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""]<br>
		["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""]
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>4. Repace undefined value with the first option </td>
	<td>[<span>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]</span>, "??", "??" ,"??"] </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Steps 2-4 are repeated iteratively. Expressions tree is traversed depth-first, and each found leaf corresponds to a unique program. Press “next” button in the demo below, to see next iterations.</p>


<div id="demo2">

		Demo: iterative program generation
	</p>

	<p>step</p>
	<p>reset</p>

	
</div>

<p>Generated programs are verified with the given input-output examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translate from JSON represenation to Javascript</li>
<li>Fill pre-defined input array variable with an example</li>
<li>Evaluate the program with eval()</li>
<li>Check if contents of the pre-defined output variable correspond to the output example.</li>
</ol>
<p>The demo below shows program generation for "array reversal" problem. Press “generate” button to see continuous generation, or use “next” to see generation steps. It generates and checks around a million of short programs per minute, and is able so solve the problem in ~10-20s. I tweaked the DSL to have a bare minimum of available expressions, for search to be faster. Size of the program is also limited by number of used varialbes (limited to 4). It would still work with larger more generic DSL, just would take more time.</p>

    <p>This story starts with me having to simulate a faulty disk device for testing.
The Linux Kernel Device mapper is a good solution for this, so i created a
faulty device with a simple file backend:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>truncate</span> <span>-s</span> 1G /tmp/baddisk
 losetup /dev/loop2 /tmp/baddisk
 dmsetup create baddisk <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>EOF</span><span> 
    0 6050 linear /dev/loop2 0
    6050 155 error
    6205 2090947 linear /dev/loop2 6205 
 EOF</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These commands setup a new device on <em>/dev/mapper/baddisk</em> with <em>1GB</em> of size.
Starting from sector <em>6050</em>, there are <em>155</em> faulty sectors, where any write and
read operation should cause I/O errors.</p>

<p>I went on and used <em>dd</em> to write to the device, as the first faulty block
should start around <em>3MB</em>, i used the following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>To my surprise, the command succeeded. I assumed some error in my setup and
after re-creating the device mapper target, i tried again. This time with the
following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk
 <span>dd</span>: writing to <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error
 3096576 bytes <span>(</span>3.1 MB, 3.0 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0238947 s, 130 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>Nice, the device behaves as expected! While taking notes in another terminal
and switching back and forth workspaces, i issued the following command again:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>What? It succeeded writing <em>4.1MB</em> of data to a faulty segment of the disk
which should clearly fail! This was strange, but still, after many attempts
with this command writing to the complete device until it got end of space, no
I/O errors were reported by <em>dd</em>.</p>

<p>Looking at the <em>dmesg</em> output, the kernel correctly reported errors with the
underlying device:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> Buffer I/O error on dev dm-3, logical block 757, lost async page write
 <span>[</span>..]</code></pre></figure>

<p>And running <em>badblocks</em> on the device also correctly reported them.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> does dd not report this error?</p>

<p>The difference between the commands is the used block size, so i assumed some
caching beeing the cause for this situation, or maybe dd opening the file with
different flags like O_DIRECT or O_SYNC if smaller block sizes are used?</p>

<p>I straced the <em>dd</em> command and the openat/write and close functions behaved
exacly the same, this time i used a <em>5MB</em> block size for simpler debugging:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> openat<span>(</span>AT_FDCWD, <span>"/dev/mapper/baddisk"</span>, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 3
 write<span>(</span>1, <span>"</span><span>\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0</span><span>"</span>..., 5242880<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 5242880
 close<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>                                <span>=</span> 0</code></pre></figure>

<p>The strace output shows that the succeeding command opens the file without any
notable difference to the command writing with 512 bytes block size.  The write
and close functions return with no error whatsoever. <em>dd</em> simply does not
notice the data loss while writing to the storage!</p>

<p>Making <em>dd</em> use the <em>O_DIRECT</em> flag during file open, or the <em>O_SYNC</em> option
catches the error:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>5M <span>oflag</span><span>=</span>direct
 <span>dd</span>: error writing <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

<p>What is the reason for this? I assume dd, with its standard block size of 512
bytes does not the hit the linux kernels buffered I/O. And with bigger block
sizes, the I/O becomes buffered, async, and as it stands, dd as user space
application does not validate the write operation (using fsync) to notice
errors during buffered I/O operations by default.</p>

<p>This leads us to my next finding: “the linux fsync() gate” that dates back to
2018, starting with the following question on stackoverflow:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42434872/writing-programs-to-cope-with-i-o-errors-causing-lost-writes-on-linux">Writing programs to cope with I/O errors causing lost writes on Linux
</a></p>

<p>And resulting LWN articles:</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/724307/">Improved block-layer error handling</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752063/">PostgreSQL’s fsync() surprise</a></p>

<p>which provide great insight into the linux kernels error handling and how these
errors are upstreamed to user space applications while writing data to faulty
devices.</p>

<p>Long story short: If one uses <em>dd</em> with a bigger block size <em>(&gt;= 4096)</em>, be
sure to use either the <em>oflag=direct</em> or <em>conv=fsync</em> option to have proper
error reporting while writing data to a device. I would prefer <em>conv=fsync</em>, dd
will then <em>fsync()</em> the file handle once and report the error, without having
the performance impact which <em>oflag=direct</em> has.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1500 <span>conv</span><span>=</span>fsync
<span>dd</span>: fsync failed <span>for</span> <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- links --><section><article><a href="https://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/617189040564928512/how-unix-won"></a><p>Unix has won in every conceivable way. And in true mythic style, it contains the seeds of its own eclipse. This is my <em>subjective</em> historical narrative of how that happened.</p><p>I’m using the name “Unix” to include the entire family of operating systems descended from it, or that have been heavily influenced by it. That includes Linux, SunOS, Solaris, BSD, Mac OS X, and many, many others.</p><p>Both major mobile OSs, Android and iOS, have Unix roots. Their billions of users dwarf those using clunky things like laptops and desktops, but even there, Windows is only the non-Unix viable OS. Almost everything running server-side in giant datacenters is Linux.</p><p>How did Unix win?</p><ul><li><p>It was built by programmers, for programmers. If you read the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FP01T4G5I2lk&amp;t=ZjZjYTEyYmY5ODdjNmNlMjJjNWI4YzQ0MjFkY2U0NmI4ZGM5MGM4YixXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610096005">early papers describing Unix</a>, you will see how the key abstractions (hierarchical filesystems, permissions, processes, interactive shells, pipes) have lasted conceptually unsullied for decades. That could only have happened if it exerted such a force field over geek minds that they propagated it.</p></li><li><p>The majority of it was written not in assembly language, but in C, a higher-level language, hence making it portable. This enabled relatively easy ports to a wide variety of hardware.</p></li><li><p>A freak historical accident. AT&amp;T Labs, where it was developed, was forbidden under its anti-trust settlement from commercializing products unrelated to its core telecom business. Hence, Unix was licensed very cheaply to universities, including UC Berkeley, which subsequently built one of the more influential branches of the Unix family tree—BSD. Apparently, AT&amp;T classified Unix as <a href="https://twitter.com/nuthaven/status/1254897999290892289?s=09">industrial waste</a> for tax purposes when licensing it!</p></li><li><p>Unix spread through academia, and those students spread it through corporations after they graduated. It’s a strategy that has been used by every major tech company, only in this case it was organic.</p></li><li><p>And then came the Internet, and the whole universe of daemons, tools, protocols, and utilities that undergirded it was built natively on Unix. That wasn’t a huge surprise because a lot of the people that built the Net were Unix natives. BSD open-sourced its TCP/IP stack, kicking off its wide adoption outside the military.</p></li><li><p>By the late 90s and early 2000s, Linux started taking over the server-side. It has become the ultimate virtuous cycle in open source. When picking a new kernel one is virtually forced to go with Linux because of the huge community and massive engineering that has gone into solidifying it. That’s probably why Android picked Linux even though it was running on the other end of the hardware spectrum.</p></li></ul><p>So how and why would we move past Unix?</p><ul><li><p>Unix, which got standardized into the POSIX spec, has accreted a tremendous amount of complexity over the decades. The <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.open-std.org%2Fjtc1%2Fsc22%2Fopen%2Fn4217.pdf&amp;t=MDdhMDQ4Y2Q1YTQ0NjI2Y2I2NzY4NGRjY2JkODdmNDZmZDc2YjMxOSxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610096005">POSIX spec</a> is <em>3000 pages</em> long. Linux now has nearly 400 system calls. What started as a clean, pure, minimal and elegant set of system abstractions has become a complex beast.</p></li><li><p>The very idea of the OS providing general-purpose abstractions with wide applicability is being challenged. When Unix was created, IO was orders of magnitude slower than CPU. There were enough CPU cycles to burn to provide these high-level abstractions, like a complex hierarchical filesystem. <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FSM3PhGGllL0&amp;t=ZjRjMTIzOGU5NjhlNjY4NjY1ZDRhYzA2NGY0ZTlhNjQyN2JlZmVjMCxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610096005">Now IO can easily saturate CPU</a>. At least on the server side, folks just want to get the fastest performance out of their hardware. That’s leading to the rise of frameworks like <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fspdk.io&amp;t=Njc0ODFjZTZmOTMyMDJkNTFjZThjZmIxYWZlYjFiYmU1ZDBhMjU3NixXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610096005">SPDK</a> and <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdpdk.org&amp;t=NTQ4MjI4ZDg4YjZiZjViNTQ3NWZhYzNhNGZjZDRjOTFiZDQ1NDUxNSxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610096005">DPDK</a> that bypass heavy OS abstractions for storage and networking in favor of applications directly accessing the raw hardware, and rolling whatever abstraction they do need on their own.</p></li><li><p>The entire ecosystem in which an OS exists is changing. Application-level experiences are hermetic and make the underlying OS more or less irrelevant. Just look at Android or iOS or ChromeOS. Programming to a virtual machine (like the Java VM) makes programmers much more invested in their PL/runtime than the OS.</p></li><li><p>The above two points raise an interesting question: what does a modern operating system want? Look, for example, at <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ffuchsia.dev%2Ffuchsia-src%2Freference%2Fkernel_objects%2Fobjects&amp;t=ZTg3M2Y2ZTVkNWRkYmZjYWY4ZmI3NzA3MWI4NjRjYWI3ZGM2MzRmZSxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610096005">Fuchsia</a>, which is going in the direction of a microkernel with capabilities, that pushes most drivers and OS services out to userspace. These are ideas that have been floating in academic OS research for decades, but could never gain real mainstream acceptance because of the high barrier to making a viable real-world OS. This is the effect Rob Pike was talking about in his <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdoc.cat-v.org%2Fbell_labs%2Futah2000%2F&amp;t=Yjc3MmRkYjA4ZGM5YmQxNmFmZjRjMWMxYTJkNDIwNzk3MTYxMmM3OCxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610096005">“Systems Research is Irrelevant”</a> talk. But the prior two trends are finally dislodging the iron grip of Unix, and OSs are becoming interesting again!</p></li></ul></article> <!-- /post -->

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I made a goal for myself in January 2020 to stop using Google products by the end of the year. That might sound like way too generous a timeline, but Google owned pretty much all of my data at that point, so it was a fairly large project. Plus I'm a slow and steady kind of person. I know if I give myself a generous enough timeline I can accomplish even things that seem too hard for me at first.</p>
<h2>First, Why</h2>
<p>Since I got into programming about 5 years ago, I kept hearing all these bad things about Google and how horrible of a company it is from other tech people. It always seemed a bit exaggerated to me, but the evidence has been piling up over the years. Learning about <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-the-pentagon-build-ai-for-drones-1823464533">their involvement</a> with the US military's <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Project%20Maven%20DSD%20Memo%2020170425.pdf">Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team (Project Maven)</a> was the last straw for me <sup id="footnote-1"><a href="https://kiramclean.com/blog/what-i-use-now-instead-of-google/#footnote-1-text">1</a></sup>, but even before I learned about that I was pretty uncomfortable with a lot of what I heard. In Google's defence they eventually did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210101083904/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html">pull out of the project</a> after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231204850/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html">massive backlash by thousands of employees</a>.</p>
<p>Still, I'm pretty convinced now that their continued existence is a catastrophe not only for public safety, but also for <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/3/21030688/google-amazon-ai-oil-gas">the environment</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html">gender equity</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/9739039/Googles-tax-avoidance-is-called-capitalism-says-chairman-Eric-Schmidt.html">the economy</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgexe8/google-fired-an-engineer-who-wrote-code-telling-googlers-they-had-a-right-to-organize">fair labour practices</a>, <a href="https://www.stallman.org/google.html#surveillance">privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00954-0">journalism</a>, <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/epstein-testimony">democracy</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/3/17168256/google-racism-algorithms-technology">race relations</a>, and the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/big-tech-out-of-control-capitalism-and-the-end-of-civilization/">project of civilization itself</a>. But anyway, the point of this post isn't to motivate you to also quit Google. I'll tell you how I really feel some other time.</p>
<p>The rest of this post is about the tools and services I replaced all the Google things with. I did mostly accomplish my goal, with a few caveats which I describe in the relevant sections.</p>
<h2>Replacements</h2>
<p>Here's the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>GMail → <a href="https://protonmail.com/signup">ProtonMail</a></li>
<li>Chrome → <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox developer edition</a></li>
<li>Google search → <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></li>
<li>Google Drive → <a href="https://www.sync.com/">Sync</a> and <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a></li>
<li>Google DNS → <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/">Cloudflare DNS</a></li>
<li>Maps → Apple maps</li>
<li>YouTube → Netflix, <a href="https://www.ted.com/">TED talks</a>, conference archives, and still a little YouTube (anonymously in a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox container</a>)</li>
<li>Google Analytics → <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a></li>
<li>Everything else (calendar, reminders, photos, docs, video chat, news feeds) → <a href="https://nextcloud.com/signup/">Nextcloud</a>, running <a href="https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/">on my own instance</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the long version:</p>
<h3>GMail → <a href="https://protonmail.com/signup">ProtonMail</a></h3>
<p>ProtonMail has free accounts, but I pay for the lowest level that allows use of a custom domain with it (€48/year) so I don't have to change my email address ever again if I want to switch providers. It was quite a pain to change my email address all over the place, but I started in May and just did it slowly over time. I highly recommend decoupling your email address from your email provider if you're considering switching. First of all an email from a custom domain seems more, not less, serious than a gmail address to most people. But the main reason is just so you don't have to change your email address ever again if (when) you want to switch to some newer, better email provider.</p>
<p>I set up forwarding from my old GMail account to my new email address then filtered my mail for anything sent to the old address. If it was someone or some place I wanted to continue hearing from, I updated my email address with them. If not I unsubscribed. This turned out to be a wonderful opportunity to purge my newsletter and other email subscriptions. Also I'm happy to report most companies are now (finally) respecting unsubscribe requests. Two (looking at you Geektastic and Rakuten) continued to spam me after I requested they stop, so now I filter out all their mail as spam.</p>
<h3>Chrome → Firefox developer edition</h3>
<p>I primarily use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox developer edition</a> now for my browser, including for work. The developer tools are just as good as Chrome's for the kind of work I do.</p>
<p>There are some web apps that literally or effectively only work in Chrome, which ironically perfectly illustrates the impetus for this whole undertaking. For those I use this <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium#downloads">ungoogled Chromium</a> browser, installed via homebrew.</p>
<p>I still have Chrome installed on my computer because I need it for some work things. We use chromedriver for some integration tests and it wasn't trivially easy to trick it into using my Chromium installation instead of looking for Chrome. Replacing chromedriver is a headache, and also not my call to make at work. But it's also not really the point for me. If Google was reduced to a browser that developers can easily launch and control programmatically, I'd be satisfied. I don't use it for anything other than running automated tests at work now.</p>
<h3>Google search → <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></h3>
<p>I mostly love DuckDuckGo, but there are certain categories of searches where Google returns better results. DuckDuckGo doesn't seem to return many results from forums (like stack overflow or other stack exchange sites), which is where there the answers to a lot of my questions are, unfortunately. So I still use Google Search sometimes, but I do it in a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox container</a> without being logged in to a Google account, which at least helps to avoid some of Google's incessant stalking.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo does seem to return better results when the answer is an image, video, or regular web page, which is cool, and I suspect means it would be a perfectly fine replacement for most people. For example this blog is easier to find via DuckDuckGo than Google, which is impressive because I share a name with a small-time TV celebrity who typically dominates search results. We even look sort of similar, it's wild.</p>
<h3>Google Drive → <a href="https://www.sync.com/">Sync</a> and <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a></h3>
<p>I use Sync to make my most used files available anywhere, and I've started moving a huge backlog of documents and notes I don't need to access often but don't want to throw away to Backblaze for longer term storage, just because it's cheaper. So far I just use their web UI to upload things in bulk and browse my files, but I'm looking into ways to do that more efficiently. I really need to de-clutter my digital life. I'm a major hoarder when it comes to digital files. I have scarcely deleted a document in the last 10 years, it's getting a bit ridiculous. But that's a goal for another year 🙂. For now I'm just putting all those files I don't really need to access but don't want to throw away in Backblaze to deal with later.</p>
<p>Between Sync and Backblaze I got 15GB of free storage, which is plenty for now, though as I move more and more or my scattered files over I'll have to start paying. Backblaze offers some of the cheapest object storage there is, at least.</p>
<h3>DNS → Cloudflare DNS</h3>
<p>I used to use Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4), now I use <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/">Cloudflare's</a> (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1).</p>
<h3>Maps, YouTube</h3>
<p>These ones are harder to replace. I use Apple maps now most of the time, but I still use Waze (which was acquired by Google) for directions sometimes if I'm driving somewhere. For media I mostly watch Netflix, but I also watch a lot of <a href="https://www.ted.com/">TED talks</a>. I used to also watch conference videos on YouTube. Now I check conference websites for those, and a lot of them have the recordings, although they're often hosted on YouTube anyway. And I also do still use YouTube sometimes, mostly for home workout videos, but also anonymously in an isolated container.</p>
<h3>Analytics → <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a></h3>
<p>It's been a while since I used Google Analytics, but I wanted to set up a basic hit counter for this blog and found Fathom. They provide simple privacy-focused analytics that work well enough for me. One really useful feature they have that I consider necessary now is being able to log analytics with a custom domain. Without this, visitors using ad-blockers don't get counted, which most estimates figure is now something like 40% of people, and probably more among tech-type people, like the ones most likely to find this blog.</p>
<p>I tried Cloudflare's new server-side analytics for a month, but the data didn't make as much sense (it showed the overwhelming number of visits to my homepage, even though the other analytics I had set up showed them going to one post that did well on Hacker News, which makes way more sense). Anyway, the numbers didn't seem to add up. I guess to be fair I <a href="https://twitter.com/kiraemclean/status/1340530206516387840">don't quite understand</a> how Fathom's numbers add up yet either, but their support has been helpful checking it out with me to try to help me reach some interpretation that makes sense. Fathom's dashboard is really simple, at least, which I like because it's easy to understand.</p>
<h3>Calendar, reminders, photos, docs, video chat, news feeds → <a href="https://nextcloud.com/signup/">Nextcloud</a></h3>
<p>For everything else I use Nextcloud now. I <a href="https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/">run my own instance</a> of it, but there are lots of providers where you can just sign up for a simple account like anything else if you're not an insufferable nerd who enjoys maintaining servers, like me.</p>
<p>This is where I have another caveat to mention. I haven't migrated all of my photos off of Google Photos yet because I have about 50,000 of them and it's just a really slow process. I estimated it would take me something like 70 hours to move them all manually, so I'm looking into better ways to do it. I'm confident I can find or maybe build something easier than manually downloading and uploading 50k files in less than 70 hours.</p>
<p>Nextcloud does the job of automatically syncing photos from my phone, though, which is all I needed to be able to delete Google Photos from my devices. I'm not sure I'll actually stick with Nextcloud for photos in the long run. The gallery is a bit lacking. It looks like <a href="https://piwigo.org/get-piwigo">Piwigo</a> might be a good alternative. Either way, I'm actually storing my photos in Backblaze, so I'll continue looking around for a different client for a bucket full of photos next year as I work on slowly culling my photos collection and migrating it to a new home.</p>
<h2>Total Cost</h2>
<p>I feel like I've won a lot by doing all this. I own my data now, so Google can't <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-users-locked-out-after-years-2020-10">arbitrarily take it away from me</a>, which gives me peace of mind. I'm no longer part of their ad ecosystem, being tracked all around the internet and having my attention sold to the highest bidder. And I also feel good about "voting with my feet", so to speak. The fewer people use Google's free products, the lower their ability to sustain their unethical business model based on selling mass surveillance data.</p>
<p>But I also lost some. Specifically a few …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="http://www.ajasinger.com/"><i><span>Aja Singer</span></i></a><i><span> is the former founding Creative Director at </span></i><a href="https://www.ofmercer.com/"><i><span>Of Mercer</span></i></a><i><span>, where she </span></i><i><span>helped grow the brand from its initial concept into a multi-million dollar company. Prior to that, she </span></i><i><span>was a cofounder of womenswear brand Alex &amp; Eli, responsible for brand strategy and visual identity. She currently runs a branding-focused newsletter, </span></i><a href="https://ajasinger.substack.com/people/6528929-aja-singer"><i><span>For the Love</span></i></a><i><span>, and helps companies with creative and brand strategy. To chat with Aja about your branding needs, </span></i><a href="https://calendly.com/ajasinger/30min"><i><span>book time with her here</span></i></a><i><span>.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p><b>You’ve been the creative force behind two early-stage womenswear brands - what did you get right and wrong with each?</b></p>
<p><span>With my first brand, Alex &amp; Eli, I really pushed myself from a creative and business perspective -- trying out new things and experimenting to see what worked and what didn’t. I’ve tried to carry that attitude through to all of my startups. The mistake I made was listening to advice from too many people.</span><span> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Just because someone has extensive industry experience does not mean they know what’s right for your business.&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>With Of Mercer, I really prioritized getting to know our customers and having an ongoing dialogue with them through emails, surveys, phone calls, and even in-person consultations. This gave me huge insights into their lifestyles so I could better serve their needs. I’d recommend this to every founder, even before they have a product to sell.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What does a good startup branding plan look like?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Branding encompasses so much more than just a font or color; it’s the soul of a brand. First, you need to understand what the brand stands for, it’s value proposition, who it’s serving, and how you want your customers to feel when interacting with it. The visuals and messaging are a reflection of those ideas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To get started, I recommend going through a few branding exercises with the whole team. A brand expert can take you through them, but if you’re looking to nail down your brand before you’re able to partner with one, it’s ok to work through them on your own. Start by defining your perception of your brand, your customer, and what your brand stands for.&nbsp; A great way to do this is to give everyone post-it notes (which you can also do virtually with a tool like Figma) and have them write down words they associate with each category. This allows you to quickly see where thinking is aligned and where you need more clarification. By narrowing these words down to three per category, as a group, you’ll have a good initial understanding of your brand and customer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I work with clients, I’ll walk them through this series of exercises. Once the core identity of the brand is defined, I take a similarly collaborative approach to developing the visuals. We’ll discuss what colors, fonts, and aesthetics team members are drawn to, other brands they like, and brands they don’t, and talk through a number of other visual cues until we’ve all agreed what form the brand should take. I’ll then create a few options to discuss, experiment with (to make sure they fulfil all the needs of that particular brand), and fine-tune, until we’ve defined the visual identity.</span></p>

<p><b>When should startups decide on their branding?</b></p>
<p><span>All the branding elements should be fleshed out very early in a startup’s lifecycle -- a thorough understanding of them will inform every aspect of your business. As for the brand’s visual identity and voice, having this clearly defined and articulated shows potential customers what you offer and what you stand for, which is especially beneficial for direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands. As a DTC startup, branding is the only way to convey your message and value proposition to customers, so it’s crucial to have that fully realized from launch.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What should go into that decision process?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>I usually start with the series of exercises mentioned above. From there, it’s an ongoing dialogue and refinement process, getting to the core of what a brand looks and sounds like based on those defined core tenets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>For an early-stage startup, when things are changing quickly, it’s best to revisit your brand identity (especially the voice and messaging) every six months or so to make sure it’s aligned with your business goals and trajectory. As for an entire re-brand, you should consider it when hitting other milestones, such as a high-impact sales target, or a new round of funding. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>This generally means your business has had meaningful growth, and your brand identity should evolve along with it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What tools do you use with or recommend for your clients?</b></p>
<p><span>If you’re just starting out, a shared Pinterest board is honestly a great tool for collecting inspiration. Once you’ve honed in on a few themes, you can collect them in </span><a href="https://www.figma.com/"><span>Figma</span></a><span> (which is fantastic because it’s collaborative) to further define the vision. And if you’re looking to translate your ideas into a logo, Upwork has some cost-effective graphic designers. However, if you aren’t working with a branding expert yet, make sure you’ve clearly defined your brand so that any freelancer you work with thoroughly understands your brand’s identity.</span></p>

<p><b>Has your creative process changed now that meetings are mostly remote?</b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My workflow has not changed that much (although I do miss in-person meetings). What </span><i><span>has</span></i><span> changed is that I used to gather inspiration from all the cultural activities available in NY, so I spend a lot more time exploring online now. I miss the serendipity of wandering around New York -- seeing new things and meeting new people with new ideas, but there is still so much available online. Social media is a fantastic resource (I check both Instagram and Twitter regularly), and I subscribe to a number of mailing lists and newsletters for the purpose of discovery. I love </span><a href="https://www.sightunseen.com/subscribe/"><span>Sight Unseen</span></a><span> (for all things design), </span><a href="https://thingtesting.com/"><span>Thingtesting</span></a><span> (for new brands), </span><a href="https://www.typewolf.com/"><span>Typewolf</span></a><span> (for font inspiration), to name a few.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What inspired you to start </b><a href="https://ajasinger.substack.com/people/6528929-aja-singer"><b>your newsletter</b></a><b> and how did you get your first subscribers?</b></p>
<p><span>Truthfully, I wanted to get some practice writing regularly! Also, during my time as a founder and while in the e-commerce space, I had thought a lot about startups, branding, and consumer trends but hadn’t had the opportunity to share that knowledge. A newsletter seemed like a great way to do that. The first few issues went out to around 100 subscribers. I told everyone I knew that I was starting a newsletter and it just grew organically from there, with people sharing with friends and on social media. Writing the articles is definitely a lot of work, but I really enjoy diving into topics that I’ve either thought a lot about, or am curious about. Knowing that founders and marketing and brand professionals find it helpful makes it all the more rewarding.</span></p>

<p><b>Which companies do you think are getting branding and messaging right?</b></p>
<p><span>Apple and Nike are incredible examples of brands that have a clear, concise brand vision that’s consistent, yet effectively adapted to every brand touchpoint. As for startups, I think </span><a href="https://patternbrands.com/"><span>Pattern Brands</span></a><span> has done a fantastic job at taking a belief system (enjoying daily life) and building a family of brands around it. And I love </span><a href="https://starface.world/"><span>Starface’s</span></a><span> brand and incorporation of their mascot, Big Yellow -- it’s bringing a fun, welcoming and judgment-free attitude to the skincare space.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What have you been reading lately?</b></p>
<p><span>I read the New York Times and New York Magazine religiously, and I just started reading two books — </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536299"><span>The Vanishing Half</span></a><span> by Brit Bennett and </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299"><span>Atomic Habits</span></a><span> by James Clear.</span></p>

<p><b>What’s a great piece of advice you've received?</b></p>
<p><span>Don’t overthink it. (Although I usually still do!)</span></p>

<p><b>How do you unwind these days?</b></p>
<p><span>Yoga (especially </span><a href="https://www.skyting.com/"><span>Sky Ting</span></a><span>!), going for walks with my husband, and reading. Hopefully I’ll be adding travel back to that list sometime in the future!</span></p>

<p>The goal for this project is to design, 3D-print and assemble the enclosures for several small desktop computers. This series was created during the covid19 pandemic, to get familiar with modern parametric 3D design tools, the limits of 3D printing and fabrication. </p>



<p>A screen size is chosen first, together with the desired components, and then an enclosure is designed around all the constrains (including FDM 3D printing limitations). </p>



<p>All of these have been designed in Autodesk Fusion360 and printed at home on an inexpensive Creality Ender 3.</p>







<h2>4:3 10″ LCD Terminal</h2>



<p>Designed around a 10″ 1024 x 768 IPS LCD. Raspberry PI 4, Ducky One SF Keyboard, black PLA.</p>















<h2>16:9 5″ LCD Terminal</h2>



<p>Designed around a 5″ 800 x 480 LCD. Raspberry Pi 3, Official Raspberry Pi keyboard, black PLA. </p>















<h2>16:9 5″ LCD Terminal v2</h2>



<p>Revised for a more modern look and a smaller footprint. It runs a Raspberry Pi 4, printed on orange PLA. Wireless USB keyboard from ali-express.</p>















<h2>UltraWide 4:1 8″ LCD Terminal</h2>



<p>Designed around an 8″ 1920 x 480 LCD, with a rather exotic 4:1 aspect ratio. As this exceeds my 3D printer bed size, I had to figure out a way to split the design in two parts, and how to assemble them effectively. This one is powered by an Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB, allowing it to run OpenGL natively. Ducky One2 SF keyboard. Printed on “copper” PLA.</p>















<h2>Minimal 4:3 8″ Terminal</h2>



<p>1024 x 768 8″ IPS LCD. Designed with the goal of the smallest possible footprint, leaving components out in plain sight. Raspberry pi 4, official Raspberry Pi Keyboard. Printed on neon yellow transparent PLA.</p>















<h2>Other Concepts</h2>



<p>Some rejects I produced along the way…</p>







<p>Retro TV</p>







<p> Macintosh Classic inspired design</p>

                    <p>Lets get one thing out of the way, declaring dependencies like this:</p><pre><code>implementation 'org.apache.tapestry:commons:5.5.0'
</code></pre><p>is waaaaay better than declaring them like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tapestry&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;commons&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;5.5.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre><p>This is where the positives for Gradle end.</p><p>First off, you cannot <em>not</em> learn Maven. The entire Java world is built using Maven conventions. Every artifact published on Maven Central has a maven <code>pom.xml</code> file. So using Gradle means you learn both Maven and Gradle.</p><p>Learning Gradle also means that you have to understand Groovy at some level, to understand how your build script is being composed. But Gradle adds it own DSL to the mix making it impossible to decipher what Groovy language constructs are being used for a particular line in a Gradle script. &nbsp;For example, one can't just define a global variable and use it in the script. Instead it has to be in an <code>ext</code> block.</p><h3 id="we-don-t-need-the-advanced-features">We don't need the advanced features</h3><p>Astradot's Java projects are small microservices. All we need from a build tool is to download dependencies, compile, jar and run a few basic tests. All the advanced, mindbending, quantum-entangling caching features that Gradle has are simply not needed.</p><p>Maven is old and robust. All editors understand it. Intellij's support for it is flawless. The XML while verbose is easily understood.</p><h3 id="there-is-an-exception-though-">There is an exception though...</h3><p>Wait, there actually <em>is</em> a place we use Gradle. That is for our Java Tracing Agent. The requirements for putting together the agent are not like your typical Java jar. Neither Maven nor Gradle could build it out of the box. Our initial thinking was to write a custom build tool for it. However, this is where we found that Gradle absolutely shines. Doing a completely custom build, where you are taking full advantage of the dynamism of having groovy as a full-fledged programming language as opposed to just a declaration format made Gradle the perfect tool for the job.</p><h3 id="that-said">That said</h3><p>For everything else, we saw no reason to choose Gradle over Maven. We do miss those single-line dependency declarations though.</p>

<p>MMM is a generative music generation system based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformer </a>architecture, that is capable of generating multi-track music, developed by Jeff Enns and Philippe Pasquier. </p>



<p>Based on an auto-regressive model, the system is capable of generating music from scratch using a wide range of preset instruments. Inputs from one track can condition the generation of new tracks, resampling MIDI input from the user or the system into further layers of music. </p>



<p>MMM allows for the note density (i.e. the number of note onsets) to be specified for each track, which can generate varying results in resampling. The system also allows for a set of bars to be edited, selected, and resampled, affording the user a fine-degree of control.</p>

<h3>Abstract </h3>



<p>In contrast to previous work, which represents musical material as a single time-ordered sequence, where the musical events corresponding to different tracks are interleaved, we create a time-ordered sequence of musical events for each track and concatenate several tracks into a single sequence. This takes advantage of the attention-mechanism, which can adeptly handle long-term dependencies. We explore how various representations can offer the user a high degree of control at generation time, providing an interactive demo that accommodates track-level and bar-level inpainting, and offers control over track instrumentation and note density.</p>

Muddled metrics and numbed feedback convolute a clear view for managers on what is going on day-to-day.

The source of this blindness is two-fold: insufficient data and analytics, not manager incompetence.</p><p>‍</p><p>This is why we created Staat. We built the windshield defogger. We've developed a more contextual and intentional product on top of a more useful framework to give engineering managers the visibility they need to drive their teams more effectively. Staat centralizes disparate data found on separate project management and development tools and presents them in a balanced view providing the middle ground visibility necessary for engineering managers.

Middle Metrics showcase in-sprint progress to help engineering managers make real-time decisions and ultimately improve long-term performance. Engineering managers need to clearly see what's happening without the blinders of irrelevant details in order to improve upcoming, higher-level evaluations, and overall progress.

Just as the car's defogger, GPS, and steering work best together, Staat, Middle Metrics, and other tools and rituals work best as a unit.</p><p>‍</p><p>In addition to a lack of middle-ground tooling and access to Middle Metrics, engineering managers are often gauging progress based on frameworks and metrics that aren't compatible with the kind of work that happens in the day-to-day.

<p>Why should one learn Prolog in 2021? I should better have an answer to this question, because I will soon offer supervisions for a Prolog course. While I’m a personal admirer of this unusual programming language, students might rightfully demand a justification that goes beyond my preferences. Prolog certainly isn’t the most glamorous programming language to learn in 2021. Despite its lack of popularity, there are good reasons to learn Prolog and in the following, I’ll explore three of them.</p>

<h2 id="the-sheer-intellectual-beauty">The Sheer Intellectual Beauty</h2>

<p>Perhaps my background in philosophy helps explain my fondness for Prolog. Not only is first-order predicate logic taught to virtually all philosophy students as a tool for thought, but it also forms the foundation of Prolog’s logic-programming paradigm. Philosophers aim for a logical description of the world and Prolog goes beyond this ambition by allowing us to manipulate reality via a logical description. We solve problems by writing Horn clauses, and a Horn-clause is a logical formula that simplifies resolution. Logical formulas are the tool of problem solving. Once grasped, the idea of logically describing a problem and the having the computer solve it is almost irresistible.</p>

<p>Of course, occasionally Prolog falls short of the programming-by-description-paradigm. There are cases where Prolog mixes logic and control instead of keeping them apart.[0] Nonetheless, logic programming, the paradigm of which Prolog is the primary example, comes with its own intellectual appeal. From the perspective of intellectual aesthetics, good Prolog code is a sublime experience (<em>erhabene Erfahrung</em>).[1] Such Prolog code reveals the overwhelming power of logical description and the force of a capacity – the capacity to describe the world in logical terms and thereby solve problems – that resides in all of us.</p>

<p>In sum, Prolog code has a timeless beauty to it – a claim that I believe is more commonly associated with the S-expressions of LISP – and is therefore worth learning. I am aware that an appeal to beauty has its limits, but the aesthetic properties of a programming language should not be entirely discounted. Our sense for intellectual beauty is an important tool for creation and it needs to be trained. If one understands what makes an approach beautiful, it becomes easier to create beautiful code and to resist the lure of beauty when it distracts from practical concerns. Learning Prolog is a way to tame the power of beautiful code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>?- beautiful(prolog).
true
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="a-different-perspective-on-classical-issues">A Different Perspective on Classical Issues</h2>

<p>Recursion, list manipulations, and graph-hopping are standard topics of foundational computer science and Prolog addresses them with a twist.[2] Prolog offers a different perspective on classical issues of computer science, usually right away from the first lessons. As a result, Prolog has a relatively steep learning curve, but the different perspective can also be revelatory. One learns to describe classical problems in the format of Prolog Horn-clauses and thereby solve them, which can lead to a unique way of understanding them – especially, once one has learned to write <em>idiomatic</em> Prolog.</p>

<p>Prolog is not only beautiful, but it also reveals another aspect of the core issues of computer science to which it is applied. Occasionally, the aspect Prolog reveals is also the aspect that needs to be seen for solving a problem. Some problems call for Prolog. Having learned Prolog will allow one to address them beautifully and efficiently. To be honest, at the moment such problems are too rare to justify learning Prolog. But I don’t believe that this has to remain so. As my last argument in favour of learning Prolog, I will suggest that it has unfulfilled potential.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>?- unique_perspective(prolog).
true
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="unfulfilled-potential">Unfulfilled Potential</h2>

<p>As a student of computer science, one can make a decent career by always following the hype, but to stand out one has to diverge from the well-trodden paths. Those willing to explore unpopular territory have a chance of being ahead of the crowd. In 2021, Prolog is such unpopular territory. In my field of NLP, one might instead opt to learn more about neural networks and especially the Transformer architectures such as BERT. Learning about these topics is certainly advisable for a career in NLP, but it won’t make one stand out.</p>

<p>Prolog is unpopular and, more importantly, I believe that it has not fulfilled its potential so far. The logic-programming paradigm with its separation between logic and control is powerful. Yet it does not find much use in current applications. This unpopularity despite power might deter a student from learning Prolog – perhaps logic-programming has faults which keep its from being successful – but it is also an opportunity. One can make the bet that more will come of Prolog or a language similar to it.[3] If the bet is successful, one will be ahead of the hype.</p>

<p>Such bets on unpopular options are risky. It is a high-reward bet because of the limited chances of success. That being said, I would advise making a few such bets in the course of one’s life. Even if nothing comes of them, they render life more interesting and help to show individual character. Perhaps one shouldn’t go all in on such a bet, but this consideration should justify the few hours of a Prolog course, when one gets academic credits in addition to being able to assess the unfulfilled potential of Prolog better.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>?- potential(prolog,Y), unfulfilled(Y).
true
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Currently, Prolog does not belong to the most popular programming languages. Its logic programming paradigm makes it an outsider. Nonetheless, I’ve argued that there are good reasons to learn Prolog. The language is beautiful, it offers a different perspective on classic computer science issues, and it has unfulfilled potential. Whether you are motivated by aesthetic, academic, or career considerations, you have a reason to learn Prolog in 2021.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>learn(X) :- beautiful(X), unique_perspective(X), potential(X,Y), unfulfilled(Y).

?- learn(prolog).
true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>UPDATE</em> This blog post made its way to the frontpage of Hacker News where it received a sizeable number of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25652369">comments</a>. In response, I wrote a <a href="http://dstrohmaier.com/follow-up-why-learn-prolog-in-2021/">follow-up post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="footnote">Footnote</h3>

<p>[0] I’m referencing here Robert Kowalski’s formulation of Algorithm = Logic + Control.</p>

<p>[1] I hope Kantians can forgive me for treating the sublime (<em>das Erhabene</em>) as a type of beauty, neglecting Kant’s distinction.</p>

<p>[2] For an example, have a look at the quicksort implementation on <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/sorting">The Power of Prolog</a>.</p>

<p>[3] I’m not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGQNeeRp4sM">the only one who has hopes for Prolog’s future</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early days of my business, I was a happy Baremetrics user. I was new to running a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business, I only had a handful of Stripe plans, and all I really wanted to know was my monthly recurring revenue (MRR). But fast-forward to 2020 and I was starting to transition into running Keygen full-time, and my needs as a solo-founder had changed quite a bit.</p>
<p>It wasn't too far into 2020 when I realized I wasn't getting the insights I needed from Baremetrics. I eventually tried switching to ChartMogul, both to see if I could get better visibility into my business, but also to save a few bucks, since I was also in the process of cutting out unneccesary costs after going full-time.</p>
<p>Instead of simply peeking MRR every single day, sometimes obsessively, I also wanted to get a better pulse on my conversion rate, and most of all, I wanted to get visibility into how long it actually takes customers to convert, and what types of customers convert. I figured, since I was already unhappy with Baremetrics and ChartMogul, I'd try my hand at calculating the metrics myself using a Rake task. I had just wrapped up the launch of a few new features, so I was looking for a change of pace anyways.</p>
<p>Scripting in Ruby is always a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>I'll walk you through the basics of using Rake to calculate some common business metrics. (Most of Keygen is a typical Ruby on Rails app, so this post will assume a Rails folder structure.)</p>
<p>Let's begin by creating a file for our Rake task,</p>
<pre><code>$ touch lib/tasks/money.rake
</code></pre>
<p>The Rake task we'll be working on makes a few assumptions, for the sake of brevity, such as assuming all subscriptions are billed monthly, as well as a lack of discounts (which I'd personally avoid anyways for B2B, but that's a blog post for another day.)</p>
<p>Feel free to adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Next, let's add the Rake task boilerplate,</p>
<pre><code>require 'stripe'

desc 'get revenue report'
task money: :environment do
  puts 'Hello, world!'
end
</code></pre>
<p>And we can run it by using this command,</p>
<pre><code>$ rake money
&gt; Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Har har. (Credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/geetfun/status/1337220581087981568">@geetfun</a> for that one.)</p>
<h2 id="retrieving-subscription-data">Retrieving subscription data</h2>
<p>So first thing's first — we'll need to get an array of all of our Stripe subscriptions. This is the main dataset that we'll be using for our calculations.</p>
<pre><code>Stripe.api_key = ENV.fetch('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')

subscriptions =
  Stripe::Subscription.list(status: 'all', limit: 100, expand: ['data.customer'])
    # Retrieve all subscriptions, following pagination until complete.
    .auto_paging_each
    .to_a
    # Filter out deleted customers.
    .filter { |s| !s.customer.deleted? }
    # Remove duplicate subscriptions per-customer. Keep the latest.
    .sort_by { |s| [s.customer.id, -s.created] }
    .uniq { |s| s.customer.id }
</code></pre>
<p>(You may want to cache the data if you're planning on running this task a few times during development, or multiple times a day, as it can be a bit long running if you have a large number of subscriptions.)</p>
<h2 id="calculating-mrr">Calculating MRR</h2>
<p>And now for the big show! Let's calculate that ubiquitous SaaS metric: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). To start, we'll get an array of our paid subscriptions,</p>
<pre><code>paid_subscriptions = subscriptions.filter { |s| s.status == 'active' }
</code></pre>
<p>(One quirk here is that we're not including subscriptions with an <code>over_due</code> status. This status is used when a subscription is still "active", but has 1 or more invoice that hasn't been paid and is overdue. We may still want to consider these users a "paid user" until their subscription is fully canceled, given they also have at least 1 paid invoice. More on invoices later, though.)</p>
<p>Next, we'll need to create an array of our monthly revenue per-user,</p>
<pre><code>revenue_per_user = paid_subscriptions.map { |s| s.plan.amount.to_f * s.quantity / 100 }
</code></pre>
<p>(If you have annual plans, you'll need to adjust <code>revenue_per_user</code> to account for that. This is also where you'd want to apply any discounts.)</p>
<p>Finally, we can sum that up to get our MRR,</p>
<pre><code>monthly_recurring_revenue = revenue_per_user.sum(0.0)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="calculating-arr">Calculating ARR</h2>
<p>Now that we have our MRR, it's super simple to calculate our Annual Run Rate (ARR),</p>
<pre><code>annual_run_rate = monthly_recurring_revenue * 12
</code></pre>
<h2 id="calculating-arpu">Calculating ARPU</h2>
<p>Our MRR calculation used our <code>revenue_per_user</code> variable, which is also useful to calculate Average Revenue Per-User (ARPU),</p>
<pre><code>average_revenue_per_user =
  revenue_per_user.sum(0.0) / revenue_per_user.size
</code></pre>
<h2 id="calculating-conversion-rate">Calculating conversion rate</h2>
<p>One of the most important metrics for my business is conversion rate. This tells me how many of the new sign ups coming in actually turn into paying customers ("new" sign ups, meaning those within the last 30 days). If I was going to optimize anything, it would be this metric right here. You can stuff more leads into the funnel, but if they aren't converting in the first place, it's all for naught.</p>
<p>Calculating our conversion rate is relatively simple,</p>
<pre><code>new_paid_subscriptions = paid_subscriptions.filter { |s| s.created &gt;= 1.month.ago.to_i }
new_subscriptions = subscriptions.filter { |s| s.created &gt;= 1.month.ago.to_i }
</code></pre>
<p>We get an array of our new paid customers and an array of all new subscriptions, for the past 30 days, then we divide the size of <code>new_paid_subscriptions</code> by the size of <code>new_subscriptions</code>,</p>
<pre><code>conversion_rate = new_paid_subscriptions.size.to_f / new_subscriptions.size * 100
</code></pre>
<p>This gives us the percentage of new sign ups that convert. (More on this later.)</p>
<h2 id="calculating-churn-rate">Calculating churn rate</h2>
<p>Another very useful metric is churn rate. This tells us how many of our customers cancel their subscription in a given time period.</p>
<p>Calculating our churn rate require a few things up front,</p>
<pre><code>canceled_subscriptions = subscriptions.filter { |s| s.status == 'canceled' }
churned_subscriptions =
  canceled_subscriptions
    # Select only recent cancelations.
    .filter { |s| s.canceled_at &gt;= 1.month.ago.to_i || s.ended_at &gt;= 1.month.ago.to_i }
    # Filter out customers who never added a payment method, i.e. an unconverted trial.
    .filter { |s| s.customer.default_source.present? }
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we get an array of all canceled subscriptions, and then filter that down into our final churned subscriptions array, containing canceled subscriptions in the past month that have a payment method added. (We could improve this by scanning for paid invoices instead of looking at whether or not the customer has a payment method, but once again, we'll dive more into invoices later.)</p>
<p>Next, we'll need to get a count of our subscribers at the start of the month,</p>
<pre><code>paid_subscriptions_count_at_period_start =
  (paid_subscriptions.size - new_paid_subscriptions.size) + churned_subscriptions.size
</code></pre>
<p>Getting that number, even though we aren't storing historical data to look back in time 30 days, actually isn't as hard as you'd think.</p>
<p>We can subtract our <code>new_paid_subscriptions</code> count from our current <code>paid_subscriptions</code> count, and then add our <code>churned_subscriptions</code> count to that (since they were paying subscribers in the previous period). That should get us the number we're looking for, given you don't do anything weird with your customer/subscription objects, e.g. delete them.</p>
<p>Finally, we can calculate our churn rate,</p>
<pre><code>churn_rate =
  churned_subscriptions.size.to_f / paid_subscriptions_count_at_period_start * 100
</code></pre>
<h2 id="calculating-ltv">Calculating LTV</h2>
<p>Another useful metric is a user's life-time value, or rather, the average of all users' life-time values, also referred to as LTV.</p>
<p>To calculate our LTV, we'll need to retrieve an array of all of our "converted" subscribers,</p>
<pre><code>converted_subscriptions =
  (paid_subscriptions + canceled_subscriptions)
    # Filter out canceled customers who never added a payment method.
    .filter { |s| s.customer.default_source.present? }
</code></pre>
<p>We may only want to pay attention to subscriptions within a certain timeframe, e.g. 1 year, but I'll leave that as-is for now, which will give us our overall LTV.</p>
<p>Next, we'll get the subscription duration, in months, of all converted subscribers,</p>
<pre><code>subscription_durations =
  converted_subscriptions
    .map { |s| ((s.ended_at || Time.now) - s.created) / 1.month }
</code></pre>
<p>Then we'll get the average subscription duration,</p>
<pre><code>average_subscription_duration =
  subscription_durations.sum(0.0) / subscription_durations.size
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we'll multiply our ARPU by our average subscription duration,</p>
<pre><code>life_time_value =
  average_revenue_per_user * average_subscription_duration
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting number is our LTV.</p>
<h2 id="calculating-revenue-growth-rate">Calculating revenue growth rate</h2>
<p>The last metric we'll calculate is our Revenue Growth Rate. This will give us a percent change for our MRR, compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>First, we'll want to get our current MRR, which we already have from our previous calculations. Then, we'll want to get our previous month's MRR.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>We'll do a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>We'll need to take our current MRR, <code>monthly_recurring_revenue</code>.</li>
<li>Subtract our "new" revenue from it (think: <code>new_paid_subscriptions</code>).</li>
<li>Add our "lost" revenue back in (think: <code>churned_subscriptions</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>This total should give us our MRR for the previous period, i.e. 30 days ago.</p>
<p>Where's the code? Well, I'll leave this one up to the reader.</p>
<p>But here's the gist of it,</p>
<pre><code>next_mrr = monthly_recurring_revenue
prev_mrr = (next_mrr - new_revenue) + lost_revenue
revenue_growth_rate =
  (next_mrr - prev_mrr) / prev_mrr * 100
</code></pre>
<h2 id="improving-our-dataset">Improving our dataset</h2>
<p>Our base subscription dataset is relatively simple, being an array of subscription objects, and we could actually improve it a bit to garner more insights. One way to do that would be to scan a subscription's (or customer's) invoices to determine if they've "converted" vs. simply looking at the subscription's <code>status</code> attribute.</p>
<p>You can retrieve a subscription's invoices like so,</p>
<pre><code>invoices =
  Stripe::Invoice.list(subscription: subscription.id, limit: 100)
    .auto_paging_each
    .to_a
</code></pre>
<p>But do keep in mind that this type of operation is very expensive — retreiving all invoices for all subscriptions is going to result in an N+1 query, meaning lot of Stripe API requests, and a long time spent staring at a seemingly frozen terminal. When I request invoices for a set of subscriptions, I …</p></div></div></div>

              </p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>n December 1972, Indira Gandhi, fresh from victory in the 1971 war for Bangladesh’s liberation, summoned Rameshwar Nath Kao to her office. In 1968, she had handpicked this tall Kashmiri with a formidable intellect to set up the R&amp;AW. In three years’ time, Kao had delivered the agency’s first significant success, providing critical support for the covert training of the guerrilla army Mukti Bahini in what was then East Pakistan. </p><p>“Can you do something about Sikkim?” she asked him. </p></div></div><p>Relations between the Indian state and the kingdom had reached a stalemate. India wanted to create a treaty of Permanent Association, even dangling the carrot of sponsoring Sikkim’s membership to UN organisations in return. But over the 1960s, the Chogyal had been demanding full independence with increasing vigour.&nbsp; </p><p>In the Chogyal’s backyard, the demand for merger with India had originated from the first leader of the Sikkim State Congress,

            </a>
           Tashi Tshering, who had even gone to Delhi in 1948 to negotiate it. Patel, the man in charge of India’s integration, was keen on bringing Sikkim into the fold. Nehru chose to overrule him and sent Tshering back.

            </a>
          </p><p>But Nehru’s India kept more than a watchful eye over Sikkim, much like the British had. “The Sikkimese kingdom became highly dependent on the political officers from the time that the British established direct control of Sikkim,” Saul Mullard, a researcher at  Oxford University and author of a book of Sikkimese history, explained. “Indians took over the role of political officers in Sikkim. They inherited the authority of the British and it weakened the ability of the king to set his own agenda.”</p><p>After Indira Gandhi asked him to “do something” about Sikkim, Kao concocted a plan with PN Banerjee, the joint secretary of the R&amp;AW’s eastern division and a fellow mastermind of the Bangladesh operation. He assured the prime minister that the R&amp;AW could handle Sikkim’s merger.

            </a>
           A three-member special ops team was dispatched to Gangtok.</p><p>One of these men was GBS Sidhu, who maintained a meticulous diary of his time in Gangtok. He wrote his book at the prodding of his former boss, who had always been keen for the story of the R&amp;AW’s role in Sikkim to be made public someday. On his passing in 2002, Kao’s own notes on the operations in Sikkim and Bangladesh were handed over to the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library. These will be made public in 2027, according to his will.</p><p>To preserve its reputation as a country that respected the sovereignty of its smaller neighbours, India was keen to legitimize its takeover of Sikkim. It made common cause with the political movement started by Tashi Tshering. India would maintain that the merger was a natural consequence of the peoples’ desire for a democratic form of government. The denouement that came with the coup took more than two years of meticulous planning on the part of the Indian state. </p><p>Like its neighbours Tibet and Bhutan, Sikkim was a conservative Buddhist theocracy. The ruling elite came from two communities: the Bhutia, who migrated from Tibet in the thirteenth century, and the Lepcha, indigenous to Sikkim. The royal family of Namgyals were Bhutia who’d come from Tibet in the sixteenth century. The demographic dynamic of Sikkim started shifting in the late nineteenth century, when Jean Claude White, the first British political officer of Sikkim, began to bring in labour from Nepal to build roads and cultivate land.</p><p>There was another reason why the British encouraged Nepali immigration—to counteract Tibetan influence in Sikkim. There were close religious, cultural and political ties between the two kingdoms. White’s successors tried to undo the policy, but by the early twentieth century, the native population of Bhutia and Lepcha people was already a minority.</p><p>From the 1940s onwards, this, then, was the defining divide in Sikkim’s politics: the tension between its powerful minority and the landless and disenfranchised Nepalis, who had grown to 75 percent of the population by the 1970s. The Chogyal’s inability to provide political representation for the majority of his subjects became his Achilles heel. The R&amp;AW recognized this and surreptitiously worked to exploit it. </p><p>The Sikkim operation helped Kao cement his legacy and strengthen India’s position in relation to China. “It is a fantastic piece of work, handled in a way that it took place under the cover of democracy in process,” the former R&amp;AW officer Rana Banerji, who’s studied the Sikkim papers in the archives of the R&amp;AW’s Kolkata office, told me in a phone interview. “It showed a lot of derring-do and vision, and gave tremendous impetus to the newly-formed agency.” </p><p>Sidhu drove the operation for 26 months from February 1973 to April 1975. He was flattered to be a ‘Kaoboy’, the moniker given to the spies who were personally mentored by Kao. His book is littered with references to clandestine meetings, secured phone calls and secret memos. But Sikkim was not a regular intelligence operation. Sidhu called it a “collaborative effort” between the R&amp;AW and the political parties. “While merger was the ultimate goal, this had to be achieved in stages and through constitutional means,” he wrote. </p><p>First, Sidhu had to reassure pro-democracy leaders that India was changing its policy towards the Chogyal—it was now inclined to support their agitation with logistical and financial assistance. On the ground, the R&amp;AW worked to encourage popular support and escalate protests against the monarchy. All anti-Chogyal political parties were merged under the leadership of Kazi Lhendup Dorji’s Sikkim National Congress. The aim was to compel the Chogyal to seek India’s assistance in restoring law and order. </p><p>On 4 April 1973, the Chogyal's birthday, thousands of protestors gathered outside the palace in Gangtok. It was the culmination of weeks of planning. The protests turned violent and raged for days. On 6 April, when Indira Gandhi’s principal secretary PN Dhar and foreign secretary Kewal Singh met her to apprise her of the situation in Gangtok, they found that she was in the know and was waiting for the Chogyal’s request for help. Dhar guessed that she had already been briefed by the R&amp;AW.

            </a>
          </p><p>Two days later, India took administrative control of Sikkim. It was the beginning of the end. In May 1973, a tripartite agreement was signed between the government of India, the Chogyal and the political parties representing the people of Sikkim. Elections were held in 1974, and Kazi Lhendup Dorji became the kingdom’s first chief minister. A cable from the US Consulate in Delhi noted, “Prospects for the long-term survival of the Royal House do not look good.”

          </p><p>However, at the beginning of 1975, the Chogyal remained to be toppled—and in him, Gandhi unexpectedly had a worthy opponent. </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Global Unique Identifiers</a> (GUIDs), also known as Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) can be used as practically unique identifiers in systems.</p><p>GUIDs have many advantages. You can safely generate identifiers in a distributed setting, compared to a central identifier registrar. Many systems are vulnerable to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor">Insecure Direct Object Reference</a> attacks, and even though permissions should always be checked for any access, it’s much easier to exploit these with sequential IDs compared to GUIDs (<a href="http://debarghyadas.com/writes/hacking-into-the-indian-education-system/">a high profile example</a>). Sequential IDs can leak <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14524061">important information</a>. Modern databases have custom <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-uuid.html">in-built</a> UUID types which have <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29882952/3399432">less storage overhead</a> and perform better than using a text type. There’s tons of <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/engineering/2015/05/20/why-auto-increment-is-a-terrible-idea/">blogs</a> extolling the benefits of GUIDs.</p><p>But anecdotally, there’s too many cases where raw GUIDs are used as identifiers, even though they might not be the appropriate choice.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>By their nature, GUIDs are opaque values that don’t lend too much information about what they’re identifying. They’re also generally unergonomic due to their length and structure. It’s almost trivially obvious that GUIDs shouldn't be in URLs due to their <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DontPutGuidsInUrls">poor aesthetics</a>. To steal an example from <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/primary-keys-ids-versus-guids/">Coding Horror</a>, database queries at the REPL can become frustrating.</p><pre><code>$ select * where userid='{BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10}'</code></pre><p>Poorly formatted log statements/errors can become harder to debug, since the identifiers don’t tell us what they’re identifying: </p><pre><code><code>error processing BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10: nil</code></code></pre><p>This can be mitigated by having libraries that report stack traces/line numbers and help identify the exact line of code with the error, so in general, UUIDs often need context to aid debugging.</p><p>Moreover, the lack of type safety of using raw integers and raw UUIDs can cause <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/04/27/uid/">horrifying problems</a> and is emblematic of lack of type safety with identifiers. With poor naming in code, it’s very easy to cause problems. Consider a variation of the example from the linked blog:</p><pre><code>def get_team_and_user_ids() -&gt; List[Tuple[UUID, UUID]]:
  """Returns a tuple of (team_id, user_id) tuples"""
  ...

def ban(user_id: UUID) -&gt; None: ...

for (user, team) in get_team_and_user_ids():
    ban(user)</code></pre><p>The script might just error out since UUIDs between users and teams aren’t shared, but the consequences might have been worse with integer IDs.</p><h2>Designing your Identifiers</h2><p>Identifiers should be designed for the properties of object they’re going to be identifying. We can mix and match components based on the importance of mutability, debuggability, performance and privacy for the object. For example, identifiers for permanent or external objects like customers should be treated differently to ephemeral or internal objects like tasks/jobs.</p><p><strong>Structure identifiers with prefixes and hierarchies</strong></p><p>Often for internal objects, debuggability is key, and prefixes can help with debugging. For example, all task identifiers could have the prefix “task-”. This automatically makes context free debugging easier, and makes it easy to grep for all messages that have IDs:</p><pre><code>error processing task-2: nil</code></pre><p>Hierarchies help even more with debuggability. Let’s say that every “Job” spawns N “Tasks”. Tasks IDs might want to contain their job IDs, so that it becomes trivially simple to grep for tasks of a particular job. For example, a task ID would look like: `job-123-task-1`. This also helps in ad-hoc database queries to find relevant rows without complex JOINs. We have examples of this in real life, like area codes in phone numbers.</p><p>We can add constant prefixes/hierarchies to any existing ID type. Critics might point out that storing a prefix with a UUID is wasteful since we’d lose the benefits of database optimized UUID types. This can easily be mitigated by storing un-prefixed UUID in the database, and application code automatically prepends a prefix for client code to use, but this might add some complexity.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content Addressability</a></strong></p><p>Sometimes, we want a zero inconsistency approach to storing objects, so it might make sense to make the identifier (or part of it) the checksum of the content that is to be stored. This guarantees that the underlying content has not been modified. Git does this with SHA1 commit hashes (<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/hash-function-transition/">even though this is being migrated to SHA256 as of December 2020</a>). <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> (build system) uses a Content Addressable Store for <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html">remote caching</a>.</p><p><strong>Semi sortability</strong></p><p>If you need basic sortability and don’t mind the privacy concerns, consider using a scheme like Segment’s <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid">KSUID</a>. This side-steps use of sequential IDs which will be painful to migrate away from. <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid#2-collision-free-coordination-free-dependency-free">UUID1 has some known issues</a>.</p><h2>Type Safety</h2><p>At the very least, identifiers should not be allowed to float freely as strings or integers in order to prevent a class of inconsistency bugs. SQLAlchemy, a database manipulation library in Python, lets user implement a custom <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/custom_types.html#sqlalchemy.types.TypeDecorator">TypeDecorator</a> (and has native support for Postgres UUIDs). Let’s reproduce an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49398042/3399432">example</a> with some tweaks:</p><pre><code>from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import uuid
from typing import NewType

db = SQLAlchemy()

FooId = NewType("FooId", bound=UUID)

class Foo(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(FooId(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, 
                   default=uuid.uuid4, unique=True)</code></pre><p>With a custom type “FooId” being marked as the column type, <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">type checking</a> will prevent other ID types or raw UUID types there.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We’ve seen that there’s a fair amount of complexity involved in id management and decision making. Some high scale applications end up deploying <a href="https://code.flickr.net/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-unique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/">custom ID generation</a> services. Identifiers are an early, hard to reverse decision that affect even schemaless datastores, so they’re worth thinking about in advance, and the right decision can compound developer productivity and prevent painful infrastructure migrations down the road.</p></div></div>]]>

Slack, Zoom and Notion were likely among the affected businesses.<br>On the 25th of November, AWS had another major outage. Widely utilized services like Amazon API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, CloudFormation, Autoscaling, Athena and others were affected.</p>
<p>"So many services being impacted simultaneously may be indicative of a large software rollout, or potentially localized underlying hardware or network issues,” said Leon Kuperman, CTO and Co-Founder at CAST AI. “If it’s a software issue, it’s unusual that AWS would have chosen US-East as a canary region. US-East (Virginia) represents the largest AWS region and largest customer footprint, which would put it near last, if not last on the rollout schedule."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public-clouds are a godsend for tech companies. Migration to cloud allows startups and enterprises to skip over unnecessary investments in on-premise data centers and focus on what matters the most: develop products that people love, scale fast, and always be accessible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, public cloud providers like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform are eager to lock in companies to use their services exclusively. When you rely on one vendor, you go down when that vendor fails.</p>
<p>Today, AWS showed the true cost of putting all your eggs in one basket. It amplified the need for companies to have a multi-cloud disaster recovery and fail-over strategy. This strategy would still allow for a possibility of some cloud providers to go down, but it would also ensure that a cloud going down would not mean downtime for your users.</p>
<p>“A cloud failure should not become a disaster. Never again.” said Laurent Gil, CPO and Co-Founder at CAST AI. “You can rest easy knowing that your infrastructure is never down.”</p>

January 5, 2021 | https://alex.studer.dev/2021/01/04/mw41-1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alex.studer.dev/2021/01/04/mw41-1">archive.org</a>

	<p><i></i> January 4, 2021
	</p>
	<p>I have an <a href="https://www.alcatelmobile.com/product/mobile-broadband/mobile-wifi/linkzone-cat4-mobile-wi-fi/">Alcatel MW41</a> mobile hotspot. It works fine, but it seems to have some firmware running on it (more specifically, it’s running a web server to give you an interface to change different options), which raises two questions: 1) does it run Linux? and 2) can we get root on it?</p>

<p>Some research led me to find that it did, in fact, run Linux. Not only that, but there was a tool that would just give me root access to the hotspot, by the name of TCL-SWITCH-TOOL! <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Apparently, this tool relied on the fact that the hotspot showed up as an external disk when you connect it to a computer. It did <em>something</em> that switched the hotspot into a debug mode, giving you a root shell.</p>

<p>The tool is Windows-only, but it’ll probably just work under <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>, right? I downloaded the tool, ran it, hit the “switch to debug mode” button, and….</p>

<!--more-->

<figure>
	<a href="https://alex.studer.dev/assets/mw41-1/tcl-switch.png">

	<figcaption><p>“50”.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“50”. Hmm. Closing that message gave another error:</p>

<figure>

		<img src="https://alex.studer.dev/assets/mw41-1/tcl-switch-2.png" title="(it didn’t work)" alt="(it didn’t work)">
	</a>
	<figcaption><p>(it didn’t work)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And, in the terminal I used to run the program, I saw a warning message: <code>0009:fixme:ntdll:server_ioctl_file Unsupported ioctl 4d014 (device=4 access=3 func=405 method=0)</code>. This seems to suggest that the program relies on some feature that Wine doesn’t support fully.</p>

<p>At this point, I could probably find an actual Windows computer and just use that. But that’s no fun! Can we figure out how this program works, and replicate it ourselves?</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-even-do">What does it even do?</h2>
<p>I decided to open the program in <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a>, a reverse engineering tool. Searching for the error message from before, “switch device error”, I found that there were multiple references to the string, and they all seemed to be part of relatively complex functions. It would definitely be possible to analyze what the program is doing this way, but is there an easier method?</p>

<figure>
	<a href="https://alex.studer.dev/assets/mw41-1/switch-device-error.png">
		<img src="https://alex.studer.dev/assets/mw41-1/switch-device-error.png" title="As shown in the XREF list, there are four different functions that refer to this string." alt="As shown in the XREF list, there are four different functions that refer to this string.">
	</a>
	<figcaption><p>As shown in the XREF list, there are four different functions that refer to this string.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, given that the program asks for the drive letter corresponding to the hotspot, it seems reasonable to assume that it’s somehow sending some special command to the drive over that existing connection (as opposed to, say, some weird custom USB protocol). This seems to be confirmed by the presence of the string <code>\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE%c</code>, which presumably is some way to directly access the drive?</p>

<figure>
	<a href="https://alex.studer.dev/assets/mw41-1/physical-drive.png">
		<img src="https://alex.studer.dev/assets/mw41-1/physical-drive.png" title="The mysterious `\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE%c` string." alt="The mysterious `\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE%c` string.">
	</a>
	<figcaption><p>The mysterious <code>\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE%c</code> string.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let’s assume that the program somehow opens the drive and then does some magic incantation to switch the hotspot into a debug mode. No matter how complicated TCL-SWITCH-TOOL is, at the end of the day, both of those operations will eventually need to go through the Windows API, which is external to this program.</p>

<p>We can monitor those API calls by using <a href="https://wiki.winehq.org/Wine_User%27s_Guide#WINEDEBUG.3Dchannels">Wine’s debug options</a> to enable the <a href="https://wiki.winehq.org/Debug_Channels#Useful_Channels"><code>relay</code> debug channel</a>. This logs every time TCL-SWITCH-TOOL makes a function call to an external library (what Windows calls a DLL). The hope is that we’ll see the function calls to whatever Windows DLL is responsible for opening the drive and sending those commands. That should then give us a better idea of what the program is actually doing. <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So, I ran <code>WINEDEBUG=relay wine TCL-SWITCH-TOOL.exe &amp;&gt; tcllog.log</code>, typed in the drive letter, and hit the button to switch the hotspot into debug mode. This resulted in a rather large log file. <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> I searched for the <code>PHYSICALDRIVE</code> string from before, and…nothing. Since that didn’t work, I decided to look for the drive letter I used (<code>F</code>), figuring that the tool probably had to somehow communicate the selected drive letter to Windows.</p>

<figure>
	<a href="https://alex.studer.dev/assets/mw41-1/relay-log.png">
		<img src="https://alex.studer.dev/assets/mw41-1/relay-log.png" title="The various function calls logged by Wine." alt="The various function calls logged by Wine.">
	</a>
	<figcaption><p>The various function calls logged by Wine.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>That actually seemed to work! In this log, each line corresponds to either a function call (labeled as <code>Call</code>) or a function returning (labeled as <code>Ret</code>). At the top, you can see that TCL-SWITCH-TOOL calls <code>CreateFileA</code>, part of <code>KERNEL32</code>, on <code>\\.\\F:</code>. <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Then, Wine’s implementation of <code>KERNEL32</code> makes some function calls of its own and finally decides to return a value. (that’s the <code>009:Ret KERNEL32.CreateFileA()</code> line at the bottom) After that, TCL-SWITCH-TOOL decides to make another call, this time to <code>KERNEL32</code>’s <code>DeviceIoControl</code> function, which seems like what we’re looking for. And, this function call has one parameter equal to <code>4d014</code>, which matches the error message we got from Wine all the way at the beginning! <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>So, what is <code>DeviceIoControl</code>? Looking at the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol">official Microsoft documentation</a>, it seems to be a fairly generic function that does something based on the <code>dwIoControlCode</code> parameter. <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> In our case, <code>dwIoControlCode</code> is <code>0x4d014</code>, corresponding to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_scsi_pass_through_direct">IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</a>, which, according to that page, “allows an application to send almost any SCSI command to a target device.”</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-command">Finding the command</h2>
<p>By this point, it seems likely that this is the magic debug mode incantation. But what’s the actual SCSI command? Going back to Ghidra, we can pull up DeviceIoControl, and see where it’s called from. <sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>

<figure>

	</a>
	<figcaption><p>The reference to KERNEL32.dll’s DeviceIoControl.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The thing that says <code>XREF</code>, on the right, tells us that this function has one reference in the entire program. (that is, it’s only used once) Double-clicking on that gives us the code that makes the DeviceIoControl call:</p>

<p>At this point, we could go through the assembly in Ghidra and determine how the various arguments to DeviceIoControl are constructed. However, there’s an easier way. We know now that the function call is at address <code>0x4031d4</code>. So, we can use <a href="https://wiki.winehq.org/Wine_Developer%27s_Guide/Debugging_Wine">Wine’s debugger</a> to set a breakpoint at that address, run the program, and then, once it hits our breakpoint, print out the various arguments. <sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>So, I ran <code>winedbg --gdb TCL-SWITCH-TOOL.exe</code>, used the <code>b *0x4031d4</code> command to set the breakpoint, and tried the program again.</p>

<p>It hit the breakpoint! Now, how do we know what the arguments are?</p>

<p>On Windows x86 systems, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl"><em>cdecl</em> calling convention</a> is used. <sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> That means our arguments should have been pushed to the stack. Using GDB, we can take a look at the stack’s current contents: <sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup></p>

<p>We can match these values to the arguments of <code>DeviceIoControl</code> (which, again, you can find <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol">on this page</a>). The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_scsi_pass_through_direct">IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT page</a> tells us that it takes the command to send from the input buffer, which should correspond to <code>DeviceIoControl</code>’s third argument, <code>lpInBuffer</code>. In our case, the third argument is <code>0x32ed90</code>. The fourth argument, <code>nInBufferSize</code>, tells us how large that input buffer is, which in our case is <code>0x50</code> bytes. So, let’s look at <code>0x50</code> bytes from <code>0x32ed90</code>:</p>

	<figcaption><p>The contents of <code>lpInBuffer</code>.</p>

</figure>

<p>So is this the magic command? Well, the IOCTL page from before tells us that this should actually be a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ns-ntddscsi-_scsi_pass_through_direct">SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</a> struct.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can match the fields of the struct with the data we dumped out from GDB. <sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <th>Data</th>

    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DataTransferLength</td>
      <td><code>0xc0	0x00	0x00	0x00</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>TimeOutValue</td>
      <td><code>0x64	0x00	0x00	0x00</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DataBuffer</td>
      <td><code>0x2c	0xee	0x32	0x00</code></td>

    <tr>
      <td>Cdb</td>
      <td><code>0x16	0xf9	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that we have to include three bytes of padding (labeled <code>PADDING</code>) because <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/padding-and-alignment-of-structure-members?view=msvc-160">Microsoft’s C compiler</a> has to align <code>DataTransferLength</code> to be on a four-byte boundary.</p>

<h2 id="replicating-the-command">Replicating the command</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve deciphered the struct, what is this struct telling Windows to do? Most of the fields aren’t relevant, but what’s important here is <code>Cdb</code>, which, according to the documentation, “specifies the SCSI command descriptor block to be sent to the target device.” In other words, this should be the command that switches the hotspot into debug mode! Then, after sending that command, since the <code>DataIn</code> flag is <code>0x01</code> (equivalent to <code>SCSI_IOCTL_DATA_IN</code>), Windows will read <code>0xc0</code>, or 192, bytes (the value of <code>DataTransferLength</code>) from the device. <sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12">12</a></sup></p>

<p>Some research pointed me to the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/sg_raw">sg_raw</a> command, which is how you can send arbitrary SCSI commands on Linux. <sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13">13</a></sup> Using the value from <code>Cdb</code>, the command to use should be <code>sudo sg_raw /dev/sgX 16 f9 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 -v</code>, where <code>X</code> is the number corresponding to the hotspot’s disk. <sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> I tried it, and:</p>

<figure>
	<a href="https://alex.studer.dev/assets/mw41-1/success.png">

	</a>
	<figcaption><p>Success!</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It worked! After all this, we finally have the magic command. At this point, you have full root access to the hotspot, and can do basically anything you want.</p>

<p>If you were paying close attention, you might have noticed that the first two bytes (<code>0x16 0xf9</code>) of the command match what the debug mode button says in the first place! (as can be seen at the screenshots at the beginning of the article) Despite that, this effort was still useful to figure out <em>how</em> the bytes are actually sent. It also means that you can probably figure out how to switch it into “diag mode” instead of debug mode, since that button also has its command printed on it. <sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15">15</a></sup></p>

<p>Also, this only works because the debug protocol was fairly simple. Once we found the magic command, we could just repeat it ourselves. If the debug protocol were more complicated (for example, if the command varied based on some parameter, such as the current time), then we would need to perform a more in-depth analysis of the program.</p>

<p>One final note: you use <code>adb</code>—as in, the Android Debug Bridge—to access the shell. The hotspot doesn’t run Android, but it seems to still use <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/modular-system/adbd">adbd</a>, along with a few other components from Android. Investigating everything that’s running on the hotspot, though, is probably a subject for a future blog post.</p>

January 5, 2021 | https://senryu.pub/afternoonrobot/articles/automatically-fixing-packet-loss-on-my-connection | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://senryu.pub/afternoonrobot/articles/automatically-fixing-packet-loss-on-my-connection">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Sometimes my internet connection starts to experience packet loss, which is a common issue for many people. Unlike most ISPs, <a href="https://www.aa.net.uk/">Andrews &amp; Arnold</a> actually provide a way to monitor packet loss statistics on your line. Physically restarting the modem is the most reliable way I've found to resolve packet loss issues.</p>

<p>Up until now I had to walk upstairs like some sort of muppet and manually toggle the modem (well, it's a <a href="https://www.draytek.co.uk/products/business/vigor-130">DrayTek Vigor 130</a> which is sort-of a modem but more a PPPoA to PPPoE converter but whatever).</p>

<p>No longer! I have solved the issue with copious complexity.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Write a Prometheus exporter for A&amp;A line stats</h2>

<p>I don't really enjoy writing Go, which a lot of exporters seem to be written in, so instead I've started writing my own small custom exporters in Ruby. This has overall made Prometheus significantly less frustrating to customise for my use-case.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/robotmay/prometheus-aanet-exporter/-/blob/master/prometheus-aanet-exporter">https://gitlab.com/robotmay/prometheus-aanet-exporter/-/blob/master/prometheus-aanet-exporter</a></p>

<p>To use it you need to have Ruby set up, install the required gems at the top (or use the Gemfile), then move it to somewhere executable and run it using <code>systemd</code> or whatever. I'll update the instructions in the README at some point.</p>

<p>It works by fetching your personal stats data from an XML feed A&amp;A provide. If you're a customer you can fetch it from inside your control panel under the line stats graph:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.senryumedia.net/d9e630d50b97661fc026507d2f49144f.png"></p>

<h2>Step 2: Graph it in Grafana</h2>

<p>I then set up a graph showing the line stats, with an axis specifically for packet loss:</p>

<p><img title="Shiny line graph" alt="Shiny line graph" src="https://img.senryumedia.net/92c755483fb8d376a58e71c13493ea27.png"></p>

<p>This then has an alert configured which both alerts me directly when it starts firing, and also hits a <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> webhook URL:</p>

<p><img title="Configure the alert based on the packet loss axis" alt="Configure the alert based on the packet loss axis" src="https://img.senryumedia.net/db01edb7169de838a53e23dba9d519d2.png"></p>

<h2>Step 3: Set up the network</h2>

<p>Houses in the UK are typically not well set up for people who like to mess around with networking. Our walls are thick and made of brick, and the copper/fibre entry point is typically somewhere really stupid. In the case of our house, this is the front upstairs bedroom, and my networking equipment is in the nice and cold kitchen area, with its stone (fire-resistant) floor, downstairs at the back of the house. When we moved in I ran <em>some</em> metres of Cat-6a cable through walls and stairwells to join the two ends.</p>

<p>I have a couple of Z-Wave plugs sat around from some previous experiments, so at first I tried just sticking the Vigor 130 on one of those in the bedroom, but unfortunately the signal doesn't penetrate that far and would require a bunch of repeaters. But then I ordered an Uninterruptible Power Supply and figured that I might as well power the Vigor 130 from that along with the rest of my equipment so that my connection stays up in power outages. The setup is now:</p>

<ol>
<li>4-way plug adapter into the UPS</li>
<li>Z-Wave plug into the 4-way</li>
<li>48v PoE injector into the Z-Wave plug. Non-PoE output into my EdgeRouter, PoE output runs to the wall socket and then up through the house</li>
<li>48v PoE to RJ45/12v 2.1mm barrel-jack splitter</li>
<li>Cat 6a cable from the adapter into the Vigor 130 network port</li>
<li>2.1mm barrel-jack with 2.5mm adapter into the Vigor's power input</li>
</ol>

<p><img title="High-tech fucking-bright-LEDs avoidance system on the front of the DrayTek" alt="High-tech fucking-bright-LEDs avoidance system on the front of the DrayTek" src="https://img.senryumedia.net/0795741f564304d4cf684bf9bff4092f.jpg"></p>

<h2>Step 4: Configuring <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a></h2>

<p>This is handled via an <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/">automation</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.senryumedia.net/355c993421d713dcafdcdf028b372a7b.png"></p>

<p>The <code>webhook</code> trigger type has to have a unique name, which requires a new notification channel in Grafana for each trigger, which is a bit of a pain but not the end of the world.</p>

<p>The next step is to come up with a process by which the modem can be restarted. I've displayed these as YAML because it's significantly more concise than screenshotting the GUI for it:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>alias</span><span>:</span> <span>ADSL Packet Loss</span>

  <span>-</span> <span>delay</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>1800'</span>
<span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>single</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Steps</h3>

<h4>Notify</h4>

<p>Firstly, we notify users that the internet will be disconnected briefly, then pause the automation for 1 minute. I'm using Telegram for this because I find it flexible and reliable:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>-</span> <span>service</span><span>:</span> <span>notify.telegram</span>
    <span>data</span><span>:</span>
      <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>&gt;-</span>
        <span>Packet loss detected, restarting ADSL modem in 1 minute. The internet</span>
        <span>will disconnect whilst the modem restarts.</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>delay</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>60'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I'd like to improve upon this by allowing the users to block the restart from happening by clicking a button in Telegram. Next iteration!</p>

<h4>Repeat the next set of instructions</h4>

<p>Next we start a repeating loop using <code>repeat</code>, which will keep trying the restart steps until the internet connection reappears. </p>

<h4>Reset loop</h4>

<p>The switch is turned off, we wait for 10 seconds, then turn it back on:</p>
<div><pre><code>        <span>-</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>turn_off</span>
          <span>device_id</span><span>:</span> <span>012345</span>
          <span>entity_id</span><span>:</span> <span>switch.vigor_130_switch_2</span>
          <span>domain</span><span>:</span> <span>switch</span>
        <span>-</span> <span>delay</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>10'</span>
        <span>-</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>turn_on</span>
          <span>device_id</span><span>:</span> <span>012345</span>
          <span>entity_id</span><span>:</span> <span>switch.vigor_130_switch_2</span>
          <span>domain</span><span>:</span> <span>switch</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then we wait for up to 5 minutes (360 seconds) for the internet to come back up. <code>binary_sensor.internet</code> is numerous <code>ping</code> binary sensors to different websites, where any of them responding within the last minute will cause the sensor to report as <code>on</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code>        <span>-</span> <span>wait_template</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>{{</span><span> </span><span>is_state("binary_sensor.internet",</span><span> </span><span>"on")</span><span> </span><span>}}'</span>
          <span>continue_on_timeout</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
          <span>timeout</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>360'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will time out after 5 minutes and continue to the next steps, but the sensor changing to <code>on</code> before that will exit it early. This means we allow up to 5 minutes for the connection to reappear before seeing whether we should notify the user that it's back:</p>
<div><pre><code>          <span>-</span> <span>choose</span><span>:</span>
            <span>-</span> <span>conditions</span><span>:</span>
                <span>-</span> <span>condition</span><span>:</span> <span>state</span>
                  <span>entity_id</span><span>:</span> <span>binary_sensor.internet</span>
                  <span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>on'</span>
              <span>sequence</span><span>:</span>
                <span>-</span> <span>service</span><span>:</span> <span>notify.telegram</span>
                  <span>data</span><span>:</span>
                    <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>&gt;-</span>
                      <span>I have finished toggling the modem off and on and the</span>
                      <span>internet is back up.</span>
          <span>default</span><span>:</span> <span>[]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Pause for a bit</h4>

<p>In case Grafana chooses to wing multiple alerts to the webhook, we should pause at the end of this automation. This will work with the <code>single</code> mode described in the next step to effectively rate limit how often this can happen; currently 30 minutes:</p>

<h4>Super duper important</h4>

<p>You almost certainly want this running in <code>single</code> mode:</p>

<p>This will ensure only one version of this automation can run at once.</p>

<h2>Potential issues</h2>

<p>I wish Home Assistant had an option for <code>until</code> loops with a maximum retry count. I can't seem to find it in the documentation, but it might be possible with some other combination of steps.</p>

<p>I've tweaked my Grafana alert a few times to try and ensure it doesn't fire again as soon as the internet returns after the automation fires. This was a problem.</p>

<p>I almost certainly want to alter how this works when people are in the house vs an empty house. With an empty house it shouldn't really matter if we restart quickly, but with people in the house we might want to be able to override it and prevent any restarts for a certain timeframe. Some traffic inherently has high packet loss, such as (for me), downloads from Microsoft servers in the Xbox app on Windows.</p>

<h2>Fin</h2>

<p><img src="https://img.senryumedia.net/9bb3413de5c9e13d8886e5c44d7a6b3b.png"></p>

<p>It works! I could potentially drop one aspect of complexity and gather the packet loss stats directly in Home Assistant, but I already had it set up in Grafana/Prometheus so it was actually less effort this time around.</p>

<p>This will save me many minutes of effort over my lifetime, and is therefore a resounding success.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tuesday, January 5, 2021</p><p>Since we released the alpha version of Pijul 1.0 two months ago, a lot of things have happened.
In this post, I want to share some of them, and give a roadmap for the next few weeks or months.</p><h2 id="achievements-of-the-last-two-months">Achievements of the last two months</h2><p>I’m happy to announce that we are now very close to a beta version of Pijul. A number of things needed to be fixed, and they have indeed been fixed. In particular:</p><ul><li><p>We had a number of issues with SSH keys and unintuitive error messages related to network errors. For example, a temporary connection drop used to be fatal for HTTP connections, whereas Pijul can easily recover from that now. These issues looked really bad, but were actually fairly easy to fix.</p></li><li><p>The core algorithms were “almost there” when I announced the initial alpha, but, as I explain below, weren’t totally ready. In particular, the patch format has needed to change once. I haven’t maintained a “Changelog” file since the beginning, but that is also because most entries in that log would have been of the form “correctness of apply” or “correctness of unrecord”.</p></li><li><p>Sanakirja (our database backend), now performs more checks to detect disk errors, either accidental (the user overwrites the file) or physical (disk failures). This obviously comes with a small performance hit, but there is probably still room for optimisation there.</p></li><li><p>On the “software engineering” side of things, I’ve recently simplified the design of the library. We used to have two giant traits to describe all the operations that could be done on a repository: for example <code>record</code> and <code>output</code> needs to look at the <em>pristine</em> and at the <em>current working copy</em>, but with different mutability, while <em>apply</em> only needs one channel of the <em>pristine</em>. There are many functions like that in Pijul, requiring overlapping subsets of the trait, which makes the boundaries somewhat unclear.</p><p>One of my recent patches simplifies that design by splitting these traits into smaller pieces, in order to make it easier to write alternative backends. The consequence is that many functions now require complicated trait bounds, such as <code>ChannelTxnT + TreeTxnT + ChannelIter</code>. Also, there is still a large number of macros, but this is also because Sanakirja still has an unsafe interface (in part due to the lack of generic associated types in Rust) and needs wrappers to be used safely.</p></li><li><p>We have a basic CI system on the Nest, but it is currently only enabled for a few projects, including <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/pijul/ci">Pijul itself</a>. It is based on <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>, which makes it really fast for building the same project over and over. The main reason for the restriction is that it only started to work reliably in the last few days, another reason is our limited computational resources. We plan to generalise it soon to more backends than Nix, and to open it to all public projects on the Nest. The ability to efficiently go back to arbitrary versions (work in progress) could make this quite useful.</p></li><li><p>Among the improvements to the Nest, the <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/explore">“Explore” page</a> is a first step towards making this more social. I hope to be able to expand the social features of the Nest very soon.</p></li></ul><h2 id="roadmap-and-current-projects">Roadmap and current projects</h2><ul><li><p>One crucial thing for the future of Pijul is its integration into existing workflows and tools. The top priorities in that direction are to get text editors to support Pijul. I did start <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pmeunier/vscode-pijul">a draft for a VSCode plugin</a> in November, but I’m happy to see that <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/GarettWithOneR/pijul-vscode">GarettWithOneR</a> is moving much faster, and making great progress in that direction.</p></li><li><p>We need to be more generic in our diff algorithm: at the moment, the diff is line-based, but all the algorithms in Pijul can already handle binary or word-based diff algorithms. This is probably a rather easy project, but might require some global changes in order to deal with conflicts. Once this is done, a <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> plugin could become possible and useful.</p></li><li><p>Another project I’ve started is a way to handle gigantic repositories, especially going back to tags arbitrarily far in the past. At the moment, going back in time means unapplying all the changes since the time one wants to go back to, which isn’t really acceptable for very large repositories. Once this is implemented, I’ll run a series of benchmarks on large projects and files, and report the results here.</p></li><li><p>We’re quite close to finally moving to the beta phase. The algorithms are starting to be well tested, and have solid mathematical proofs. The initial quirks are almost all gone. Before that, I want to solve (or at least close) all the currently open discussions in our main repository.</p></li><li><p>I want to finish the <code>rollback</code> command, which makes the “inverse” patch of another patch. This is currently implemented in libpijul, but still has one bug where inverting a conflict resolution doesn’t really work. Related to this, a more long-term goal is to handle code block movements: at the moment, Pijul’s behaviour is similar to other distributed version control systems, but there could be ways to do better.</p></li></ul><h2 id="only-one-major-catastrophe-leading-to-a-reset-of-history">Only one major catastrophe, leading to a reset of history</h2><p>This is the most crucial metric for this project: a history reset is needed when we need to change the on-disk representation for one reason or another.
It happened a few times in the past, and did happen again after the current alpha was published. This is, however, very unlikely to ever happen again.</p><p>What happened was, after only a few days of using Pijul for itself, I started noticing an issue with <code>pijul unrecord</code>, where patches were somehow “lossy”, in the sense that they didn’t contain enough information to unapply them (I now have a clear proof that the current patch format doesn’t lose anything).</p><p>Here is the specific issue: Pijul represents blocks of bytes in a graph, where edges are labelled with their status (deleted, alive, etc.). The recent improvements in the algorithm introduced the possibility to <em>split</em> vertices, which has made it necessary to add new statuses to detect when that happened.</p><p>Then, patches can add new vertices, or map the statuses of existing edges. I initially thought that the new statuses could be computed at apply time, but I was wrong, because I don’t know how to compute them when unrecording. Indeed, in order for the map of edge statuses to be invertible, it must be one-to-one, which wasn’t the case.</p><p>This has led me to reset the repository after just one week, changing the patch formats in the process. This was two months ago, and after that happened, I’ve started to work on a proof that the algorithms are correct, which I hope to publish soon.</p><h2 id="thank-you">Thank you!</h2><p>When I started implementing the new algorithms a few months ago, the community was rather small. However, the fragile, clunky, alpha version grew significantly beyond my expectations. In particular, a number of people have made great contributions to the code, ranging from fixing a minor compilation error, to new features, design discussions, etc.</p><p>It is very hard to make an exhaustive list of all the people who have made this project what it is today. <a href="https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Members/Florent.Becker/">Florent Becker</a> provided the initial impulse, as well as many insights, code contributions, and friendly support for years.
Also, the current state of things wouldn’t have been possible either without the enthusiasm of <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/lthms">lthms</a>, <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/tae">tae</a>, <a href="http://skade.me/profile.html">Florian Gilcher</a>, among others.</p><p>I want to thank <a href="https://octobus.net/#pyd">Pierre-Yves David</a>, <a href="http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~bulteau/">Laurent Bulteau</a> and <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~horn">Florian Horn</a>, with whom I’ve started a collaboration on research topics related to version control. Pierre-Yves is one of the main contributors to Mercurial, and the founder of <a href="https://octobus.net/">Octobus</a>, which looks like a really cool company if you’re interested in Rust, version control systems, or (and especially) both.</p><p>I would also like to thank all the new contributors of the last two months, <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/changes">listed here</a>. In particular, <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/cole-h">cole-h</a> and
<a href="https://nest.pijul.com/loewenheim">loewenheim</a> have contributed to many discussions and proposed many improvements, ranging from compilation errors to colours in the change visualisation, to the ergonomics of a number of commands (<code>pijul record --amend</code> or <code>pijul unrecord</code> are just examples). And <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/danieleades">danieleades</a> taught me about modern error management in Rust (I had not looked into that topic since the days of error-chain).</p><p>Pijul is based on a number of layers, and there have also been great contributions on them: <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/manual/changes">the manual</a> has seen many contributions. <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/jason-ni">Jason-ni</a> patiently tested asynchronous issues in <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/thrussh">Thrussh</a>.</p><p>I also want to give special thanks to <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/tankf33der">tankf33der</a>, who has patiently discovered a truly impressive number of bugs. Some of these bugs were easy to fix (such as making HTTPS more secure on this site and <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/">nest.pijul.com</a>), others required deep redesigns (such as introducing CRC checks in Sanakirja to detect disk errors). Many of them seem to have been inspired by a “what if?” testing methodology rather than actual usage, which led to small, reproducible test cases. The title of this post (“how to survive”) was inspired by a message from him after one of my patches once again broke his repository (sorry about that!).</p><p>Finally, I wanted to thank <a href="https://paulhammant.com/">Paul Hammant</a> for giving me really useful insights about his professional experience as a trunk-based development consultant, and the possible future of Pijul as a trunk-based development tool. If you’re interested in development methodology, you might enjoy reading about <a href="https://paulhammant.com/2020/01/19/vcs-nirvana/">his VCS Nirvana</a>, as well as other posts on his blog.</p><h2 id="advent-of-code-2020">Advent of Code 2020</h2><p>A number of adventurous people have used the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> puzzles to learn Pijul, which I find really cool.</p><p>I believe <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/emily">Emily</a> is the only one who completed <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/emily/advent-of-code">all 25 puzzles</a>.</p><p><a href="https://nest.pijul.com/CT075">CT075</a> came close with <del>22</del> <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/CT075/advent-of-code-2020">24 puzzles solved</a>.</p><p>The others I know of are (in alphabetical order) <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/henil/advent-of-code">henil</a>, <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/idmyn/advent-of-code">idmyn</a>, <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/jraregris/advent2020">jraregris</a>, <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/krixano/adventofcode">krixano</a>.</p><h2 id="chat">Chat</h2><p>We’ve had an IRC channel on Freenode for a long time, but neither Florent nor myself have been very active on it.
I’ve never been really good at IRC: I find simultaneous conversations hard to follow and history impossible to search. Many things require bots I don’t have the time to write, including mentions, direct messages, etc.</p><p>After reading <a href="http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2019/09/06/forward-motion/">how Mozilla replaced their IRC server</a>, taking opinions of the community, I decided to try out <a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a>.</p><p>The address is <a href="https://pijul.zulipchat.com/">https…</a></p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the beginning of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/">Terminator 2: Judgement Day</a>, John Connor uses a laptop to crack the PIN of a stolen debit card.</p>



<p>I don’t think I saw Terminator 2 in the theater. I probably watched it years later on LaserDisc but the scene left quite an impression on me. I had a similar reaction to the war dialer in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/">WarGames</a> and the black box in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/">Sneakers</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/wargames.jpg" alt="War Dialer in WarGames (1983)">

    <img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/sneakers.jpg" alt="Black Box in Sneakers (1992)">
    <figcaption>Black Box in Sneakers (1992)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Anyways, I was thinking about that scene from Terminator 2 recently which led me to googling, “What’s that laptop in Terminator 2?”</p>

<p>It’s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Portfolio">Atari Portfolio</a>, the world’s first palmtop computer. It was released in June 1989.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/portfolio.png" alt="Atari Portfolio"></p>

<p>It had a monochrome LCD with 240x64 pixels or 40 characters x 8 lines and ran off 3 AA batteries.</p>

<p>The next thing I wondered was, “How difficult would it be to write that program?” Not a program that actually cracks PIN numbers from debit cards, I don’t think you can actually do that with a serial cable and some aluminum foil wrapped around a debit card, but a program that can simulate the output of the palmtop in that scene.</p>

<p>Let’s gather some product requirements!</p>

<p>If we watch the video again, the first thing that happens is that it displays a banner for the program.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/pinip.jpg" alt="banner"></p>

<p>The image is clear enough that you can copy the banner easily.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PPPPP   IIIIIII   N    N
P   PP     I      NN   N IDENTIFICATION
P   PP     I      N N  N
PPPPP      I      N  N N   PROGRAM
P          I      N   NN
P       IIIIIII   N    N

Strike a key when ready ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, John hits Enter and the numbers start scrolling. If we look a few frames in:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/firstline.jpg" alt="first line"></p>

<p>We can see that the first line of numbers is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>12345678901234567890123457890123456780
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One might assume that this is just the digits 1 through 0 repeated four times, but upon closer look, it’s only 38 digits long. In the third set, the number 6 is omitted, and the last set, the number 9 is omitted.</p>

<p>The way the numbers decrease isn’t obvious either, but it seems like it prints about 5 lines at a certain length before decreasing the length by 1, but after the next set it decreases the length by 2 and then alternates back and forth until it identifies the 4-digit PIN code and dumps him back to a prompt.</p>

<p>Well, that seems pretty straightforward. I’ve been trying to get better at Python so here’s a script I wrote in Python 3:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env python3
</span><span>import</span> <span>time</span>

<p>The script runs really quickly so I added a delay between lines so that you can see the same progression as in the clip. I’m sure there are other optimizations that can be made, but if I were administering this as a bad coding challenge for a tech interview, I’d pass myself.</p>

<p>Using Google Image Search, I found a site selling OEM plastic bezels for the Atari Portfolio which had this nice graphic of the front of the screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/bezel.jpg" alt="screen bezel"></p>

<p>After playing around with <a href="https://github.com/nbedos/termtosvg">termtosvg</a> a bit, in particular the <a href="https://github.com/nbedos/termtosvg/blob/develop/man/termtosvg-templates.md">SVG templates</a> feature, I managed to produce this crazy SVG:</p>

<p>Despite running <a href="https://html5zombo.com/">html5zombo.com</a> for over 10 years now, I’m not sure I really appreciated what SVGs were capable of until I built this one. They can embed images? CSS? Javascript? Any site that allows users to upload arbitrary SVGs and <a href="https://github.com/bertrandom/pinid">renders them</a> now has my utmost respect.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed making my little self-contained SVG, it bugged me that my Python code could never actually run on an Atari Portfolio. The Atari Portfolio runs “DIP Operating System 2.11” (DIP DOS) which is “mostly compatible” with MS-DOS.</p>

<p>In junior high, before anybody paid me to write software professionally, I used to write BBS software, mods, and door games in my spare time in a mix of Turbo Pascal and a scripting language called PCBoard Programming Language which was similar to BASIC. Based on my minimal research, if I could write this in Turbo Pascal and compile it, it’d probably run on an Atari Portfolio.</p>

<p>I haven’t written Turbo Pascal in about 25 years, but do you ever really forget?</p>

<p>I like a fork of DOSBox called <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/">DOSBox-X</a>, so I downloaded and installed the most recent SDL2 variant for OS X. Then I found a copy of Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0, which I’ll put <a href="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/tp7.zip">here</a> because it was kind of a pain to find.</p>

<p>You’ll find 4 files in that ZIP which are images of floppy disks. If you put them in a directory like <code>~/tp</code>, after you start DOSBox-X and mount a C Drive, you can mount them to the A Drive like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>imgmount a ~/tp/Disk01.img ~/tp/Disk02.img ~/tp/Disk03.img ~/tp/Disk04.img -floppy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then switch over to the A: drive and run INSTALL:</p>



<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_000.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_001.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_002.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_003.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>At some point in the installation, you’ll have to change floppy disks, because it’s 1992.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_004.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>You can do this by selecting <strong>Drive</strong> -&gt; <strong>A</strong> -&gt; <strong>Swap disk</strong> in DOSBox-X. It’ll go from Disk 1 to Disk 2. Then just keep doing that and pressing enter until you’ve installed all four disks.</p>

<p>After the installation is done, it’ll ask you to configure your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> and <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> because again, 1992.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_005.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>Neither of these are strictly necessary. DOSBox-X already sets the FILES higher than the recommendation and adding it to the path only really lets you run TURBO from anywhere. When it’s done, you can run:</p>



<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/turbo_000.png" alt="turbo pascal"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/turbo_001.png" alt="turbo pascal"></p>

<p>I’d spent so much time looking at this IDE when I was a kid that it made me a bit nostalgic. But then I started porting my Python script to Pascal and that nostalgia faded quickly. I’d like to say that I wrote the whole thing in here but at a certain point I had to switch to VSCode and then copy the file back into the DOS directory. To the people that still run <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/">WordPerfect for DOS</a>, I get it, but I also don’t get it.</p>

<p>Here’s the script I landed on after spending a lot of time on this <a href="https://wiki.freepascal.org/Basic_Pascal_Tutorial">Pascal tutorial</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>program pinid;
uses crt;

var i: byte;
var pos: byte;
var lines: byte;
var length: byte;
var decrease: byte;
var delay_amount: integer;

begin
     randomize;

     delay_amount := 25;

     clrscr;

     writeln('PPPPP   IIIIIII   N    N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P   PP     I      NN   N IDENTIFICATION');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P   PP     I      N N  N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('PPPPP      I      N  N N   PROGRAM');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P          I      N   NN');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P       IIIIIII   N    N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('');

     write('Strike a key when ready ...');
     readln;

     writeln('');
     writeln('');
     writeln('12345678901234567890123457890123456780');

     pos := 0;
     lines := 1;

     length := 38;
     decrease := 1;

     while true do
     begin
          for i:= 1 to length do 
               write(random(9));
          writeln('');
          delay(delay_amount);
          lines := lines + 1;
          if (lines = 5) then
          begin
               lines := 0;
               length := length - decrease;
               if (decrease = 1) then
                   decrease := 2
               else
                   decrease := 1;
          end;
          if (length &lt;= 4) then
               break;
     end;

     for i:= 1 to 10 do
     begin
          writeln('9003');
          delay(delay_amount);
     end;

     writeln('');
     writeln('PIN IDENTIFICATION NUMBER: 9003');
     writeln('');

end.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some quick explanations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pascal has type declarations. A byte can be a number from 0-255.</li>
  <li>files start with <code>program</code> and the name of the program, presumably because all modules share the same namespace but the filename is irrelevant</li>
  <li>modules are imported with the word <code>uses</code>. <code>crt</code> is a module for manipulating the screen</li>
  <li>:= is the syntax for variable assignment, so you can compare with = and differentiate between the two.</li>
  <li>If blocks are longer than one line, you have to wrap them with <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> instead of brackets or relying upon whitespace.</li>
  <li>If you don’t run <code>randomize</code> at the beginning of your script, hilariously it always seeds random numbers with the same seed and the output is the same.</li>
  <li>WRITE writes a string, WRITELN writes a string with a newline. READLN accepts input until a newline is received.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it work? Here’s the program running in DOSBox-X:</p>



<p>In the spirit of owning less stuff, I’ve gone through the mental exercise of what it would take to make the rest of this a reality but will not follow through on any of it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Buy an Atari Portfolio on Ebay.</li>
  <li>Buy an <a href="http://www.best-electronics-ca.com/portfoli.htm">Atari Portfolio parallel interface and probably a new screen bezel</a> because it’s likely scratched.</li>
  <li>Find a parallel cable in my box of cables.</li>
  <li>Find a PC or laptop with a parallel port, install MS-DOS v6.22 on it.</li>
  <li>Download <a href="http://ftp.pigwa.net/stuff/mirror/www.umich.edu/%257Earchive/atari/Portfolio/Telecomm/index.html">FT.COM</a> and put it on the PC.</li>
  <li>Build the EXE in Dosbox-X and transfer it to the Atari Portfolio.</li>
  <li>Steal a debit card.</li>
  <li>Wrap part of the card in aluminum foil, buy an Atari Portfolio serial interface, run a cable to the card.</li>
  <li>Run the program.</li>
  <li>Easy money!</li>
</ol>

<p><b>The Lost Art Of BBSing By The Mob Boss </b><br>
     The 80's are forever remembered in our hacking and phreaking history as the good old days. Times of wide spread knowledge, great ezines, terrific research, and most importantly the time of BBSing. Bulletin Board Systems were the way most hackers and phreakers learned great things. Many started as newbies and by the end were experts assisting other newcomers. But those days are over, the great boards of yesteryear are nothing more but ANSI filled memories right? Wrong. Believe it or not, here in the year 2000 BBSing is not dead. </p><p>

Of course it's not what it used to be, but it's something for us who missed those days to look at and enjoy. In fact I maintain a growing list of BBSs around the world, telnet and dial up boards in fact. Some great discussions are held on these boards every day, from California to Germany, some people are still keeping the BBS scene alive. This article is meant as a guide for dialing/telneting to these boards, how to get around once you're on, and prop!<br>
er etiquette. This article is geared for those with Windows 95/98, sorry to you UNIX folks but I am not familiar with the terminal programs for it. </p><p>

    Let's get started. The terminal program we are going to use is hyperterminal because if you are running windows you already have it. To start it up go to Start -&gt; Program Files -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Communications -&gt; Hyperterminal. Run hypertrm.exe and it will bring up the program with a new connection window. Name it whatever you like, use whatever icon. Now the connect window will pop up. Now the question is, "What kind of board are you connecting to?". For now I will assume you are connecting using your modem, hence a dialup BBS. Now since whatever dialup BBS you are calling is most likely long distance, I am going to explain how to set this up so that you can do whatever you have to do to make the call and not connect until the number of the BBS is actually ringing. Since you'll be using the operator assisted dial feature it doesn't matter what area code and number you put in, but to keep things neat you might as well put in the number of the BBS. If you don't trust me or y!<br>
yourself and don't want to accidentally be calling Germany directly then just stick in your home phone number, so that if the operator assisted dial feature was forgotten to be checked it will simply get a busy signal. </p><p>

Also make sure you have selected your modem on the pull down menu "Connect Using:". Now you will have a connect window once you hit ok. Now let's go to modify. This will put you in the Properties window. Click configure which is located under the "Connect To" tab. Now first I suggest you turn up the modems speak volume if you usually don't. Like a mechanic with a car, listening to a modem can tell you a lot. Under the "Connection" tab, it should read Data Bits 8, Parity None, and Stop Bits 1. Now go to the "Options'' tab, check off Operator Assisted Dial. Hit Ok. Then hit Ok on the properties window. This will bring you to the "Connect To" window again. Now when you hit dial a new window will come up, "Manual Dial''. Now simply pick up the receiver, do whatever you pl!<br>
and on doing. Hopefully you'll be legally calling your legally bought prepaid calling card (hehe).</p><p>

Once the BBS number is ringing hit Connect on the manual dialing window and hang up the handset. You may hear another ring or two through the modem speaker but when it picks up your modem should connect to the BBS. This seems to be better than the instructions by MS to wait until the BBS picks up to hit connect and hang up. Now if all goes well then you should be greeted by an exciting ANSI opening screen with instructions for opening a new account. If not just put in the handle you want, when it then says that you are not from the board, it should prompt you to open up a new account. Now if you weren't able to connect, keep on trying. Many things can go wrong. You may have made a mistake in dialing, linenoise could have prevented the connection (that will happen a lot of transatlantic calls or ones that make a lot of hops through different systems), or possibly the BBS had a problem. </p><p>

    Now for those who rather not be calling Europe all the time the telnet-able BBSs may be a better choice. Some are text based, some are ANSI-based. So to connect to one of these babies, start up a new connection as we did earlier. This time though rather than selecting your modem, select TCP/IP (Winsock). I have heard conflicting stories of some versions not having this. If not then try upgrading. When you select TCP/IP you'll be presented with a box asking for the host and port. Enter those in and hit connect. Viola is connected. </p><p>

    Ok so now we are sitting at that ANSI screen. What do we do? Well we signed up for a new user account. Procedures vary. Boards like Sacrificial Lamb and L0pht will give you immediate access. Boards like this have several discussion boards, mail, and real-time chat. Boards like Subcultural Niche for instance in Denmark however are more old fashioned in their procedure. Once you fill out the new user information form you'll have to wait to be granted full access which includes, discussion boards, mail, files, chat, BBS Lists, etc. Usually access is granted within 24 hours. Now when filling out the form it asks for a lot of information. Name, address, voice number, data number, so on and so on. For your name put your handle, for address feel free to put your city and state, but don't feel obligated to put your street address. As for voice numbers there is no reason not to have a number to give them. With the abundance of free voicemail and fax numbers these days, I'm sure everyone has!</p><p>

 a number they can give. If you are giving a test on acronyms or they ask questions like "Why should we grant you access", just be sincere. Don't bug out if you don't know all the answers but make a habit of finding out what the answers were, that's what learning is all about. If you weren't granted access for some reason, feel free to find out why but don't dwell on it or get angry, probably wasn't worth being a part of anyways. Being turned down is pretty rare though so as long as you don't say, "i aM h3R3 f0r y0 wAr3Z f00l5'' then you should be fine. </p><p>

    Once you have access to a board, look around, read the help files so you learn how to move around the board with ease. Most boards have the same commands or similar ones so once you learn one or two you'll be all set. Set up your file transfer protocol the first time you upload/download something. Zmodem is probably what you wanna go with since it's pretty automatic. When you first get on the board with a file area it's polite to upload a few good texts that you have. Don't upload crap, upload things that you read and truly enjoyed or learned from. Some boards have ratios so uploading is not just courtesy but necessary if you want to download anything. </p><p>

For those who do not know how to send a file, simply go to the upload menu following the prompts. When it's ready for you to send the file just go to transfer, send file, and choose the file you want to send. Again reading the help files will help a great deal in maneuvering around the board. Once you uploaded a few files and !<br>
had a chance to look around, introduce yourself to the sysop or if he's not online post a message introducing yourself. Lurking around makes people suspicious and resenting you. If you can answer someone's question, go for it. Don't get involved in flame wars if you can withstand the urge. And always treat the BBS as you would your own system. Crashing BBSs or trying to break into them is very retarded, very few are around so breaking the few we have is not only wrong but retarded. </p><p>

    Again this is simply an introduction and wake up call to all those who thought BBSs were dead. They are alive and they are great. I have learned a great deal from boards like Sacrificial Lamb and Ripco. At the end of this file is a list of BBSs I currently know of that are alive. However for an up to date list check out <a href="http://come.to/mobdomain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://come.to/mobdomain</a>. Now once you get into BBSs a bit and see whether or not you enjoy them, consider opening one yourself. All that is required is a server with decent uptime or a spare phone line. If you can spare the time and resources go for it. It's a damn shame that there are no dialup BBSs in North America and few telnet boards. If you do decide to open one let me know and I'll assist in any way I can. Thanks to all those Sysops who helped me in my quest for BBSs and to all those who have taken the time to keep this great art going. </p><p>

            <p>Every day, many professionals post their thoughts on LinkedIn and generate loads of interactions. This implies that your target audience might be out there engaging with those LinkedIn posts.</p>

<p>With Amplemarket you can leverage the engagement with LinkedIn posts to build a personalized but scalable sales approach. This blog post walks you through the process - step by step.</p>

<p><strong>Give it a try - success guaranteed!</strong> </p>

<h3 id="step0settingthescene">Step 0: Setting the scene 🤓</h3>

<p>All over the globe, sales teams using Amplemarket generate millions of data points from their sales outbound campaigns every day. From that data, our research unit concluded that a successful sales outbound approach uses this recipe: </p>

<ul>
<li>Find a <strong>relevant audience</strong></li>
<li>Craft a <strong>relevant message</strong></li>
<li>Send at a <strong>relevant timing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The LinkedIn post approach described in this blog post is an excellent example of how to create an approach that respects these 3 variables and increases your sales performance. </p>

<p><strong>For the purpose of this exercise we’ll assume the following use case:</strong></p>

<p>A digital marketing agency is looking to launch a new TikTok strategy. The Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) includes companies that are looking to grow their market presence leveraging social media and common titles of decision-makers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Founders/CEOs for smaller companies</li>
<li>Marketing roles in larger companies</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step1findyourrelevantaudienceinlinkedinposts">Step 1: Find your relevant audience in LinkedIn posts 👥</h3>

<p>As mentioned - your target audience is engaging with posts on LinkedIn. Now let’s find them!</p>

<p>Search LinkedIn’s content for keywords that are relevant to your product and look into the engagement by clicking on the likes and browsing through the titles. Is your target audience there? These people are signaling that this content is relevant to them. </p>

<p>Hands-on - the TikTok use case - search for content containing the keyword “TikTok” and scroll through the posts to find posts that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can be linked to your product/value proposition  </li>
<li>Have a high number of engagement from our target audience (likes and comments)</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/L6VOtN2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here is a good example of a post that can be linked to the value proposition of the marketing agency and has a lot of engagement. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uQ14ktj.png" alt=""></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The post mentions “Tik Tok is the most democratized social media platform ever”. This statement is exactly what the agency is trying to sell - “we agree and think you should leverage TikTok in your marketing strategies. We can help!” </p></li>
<li><p>This post also has more than 500 interactions containing job titles relevant to the ICP of the marketing agency.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I78VyKY.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>With a dedicated tool, such as Amplemarket, you can enrich these contacts with the data you need to move to the next step. <strong><a href="https://amplemarket.com/demo?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=intext_link&amp;utm_campaign=leads_from_linkedin_content">Sign-up here</a> to learn more about how this can work for you.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fLnknLZ.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="step2craftamessagethatisrelevanttotheaudience">Step 2: Craft a message that is relevant to the audience ⚒</h3>

<p>Once you have the list of target contacts you need to craft a dedicated and relevant message. </p>

<p>Remember that the information that you have on the prospect is useful while creating your message:</p>

<ol>
<li>They liked or commented on a post - (this means it’s a relevant topic to them)  </li>
<li>Their job titles, industries, location, etc indicate different types of interests in the topic. </li>
</ol>

<p>You should leverage the information you have on these prospects in your message, always respecting the basic structure of a great outbound sales email (<a href="http://blog.amplemarket.com/outreach-cold-emailing/">more of this on this blog post</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Subject-line</strong>: A simple example that works - hi {{first<em>name}}, saw you {{interaction</em>type}} {{original_poster}}’s post.</p>

<p><strong>The introduction</strong>: Leverage the fact that you know they liked or commented on the post and add a reminder of what the post was about.</p>

<p><strong>The body of the email</strong>: You should add your value proposition related to their interest in the body of the email. As mentioned before, their job titles, industry, etc indicate different interests in the subject. With Amplemarket you can leverage that information with liquid syntax. </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.amplemarket.com/personalization-at-scale/">Check this blog post</a> to learn how you can design hyper-personalized email templates with Amplemarket’s liquid syntax. </p>

<p><strong>Call to action</strong>: Finalize the email by asking them one specific question.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Do not forget to add a couple of follow-up emails to make sure your prospects’ attention is attracted to your initial email. </p>

<h3 id="step3whatabouttiming">Step 3: What about timing? ⏰</h3>

<p>If you are able to find relevant posts that were posted yesterday or the day before, you are making your message extremely relevant timewise and prospects will be impressed. </p>

<p>They were interested in the topic just a couple of days before, so the likelihood of the prospects still being interested in talking about the subject is very high.</p>

<h3 id="letsrecap">Let’s recap!</h3>

<p>Focus your energy on outbound efforts that work such as the LinkedIn approach to leverage the 3 key variables for a successful outbound campaign:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find a <strong>relevant audience</strong> (in the engagement on LinkedIn posts)  </li>
<li>Craft a <strong>relevant message</strong> (leveraging the information you have)  </li>
<li>Send at a <strong>relevant timing</strong> (is peanuts if you target LinkedIn posts)</li>
</ol>

<p>Still not convinced? </p>

<p>This is the type of answers you’ll get:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Since posting, a number of peple have pointed out that "competence" probably isn't the right word here. "Morally focused", or "morally effective" might be better. This post isn't meant to be harsh, nor is it meant to propose an absolute binary. I hope you'll read it with the kinder tone that was intended.</em></p>
<p>Last year, we pivoted our YC startup from a socially-good mental health product <a href="https://github.com/Flaque/quirk">(Quirk)</a>, towards a socially-neutral software infrastructure product <a href="https://www.roomservice.dev/">(Room Service)</a>. I couldn't have imagined myself wanting to pivot when we started; our mental health company was deeply tied to my own experience and our genuine desire to help other folks. With the clarity of a year (and a global pandemic) in between the pivot, it's easier to see some of what went wrong.</p>
<p>What we were missing, and what many social-good founders are missing, is moral competence. <strong>If you want to do good, you actually have to help people.</strong> Merely attempting to help people is not enough. That doesn't mean that <em>trying</em> to help people is bad. It's not, but moral good comes from moral competence. And that was something we lacked.</p>
<p>The morally <em>incompetent</em> want purpose; they want to be on the front-lines of the helping. But for the morally incompetent, helping people is more important than the folks being helped. They don't offer service, they seek it. The service outranks the outcome. The signature move of the morally incompetent is to be told about existing solutions that they were previously unaware of and then soldier on without any critical examination of any added value they're providing. Others working on the problem are ignored entirely or seen as a threat to their own solution. The morally incompetent are passionate about working on the problem and potentially even solving the problem, so long as they were involved in the solution. For the morally incompetent, it's important that they're helping the right people with the right problem; it would be a failure to help on an entirely different problem. All problems are stack-ranked in the morally incompetent's mind and they need to be working on the one that's most critical to them in particular, regardless of their ability to offer help. For the morally incompetent, it's of <em>critical importance</em> that they work <em>directly</em> on the problem, rather than help indirectly. For the morally incompetent, large societal issues are best solved by direct intervention, rather than large societal solutions. Working on the problem indirectly, or from an angle that is not obvious to an outside observer is a failure. For the morally incompetent, large societal problems are unsolved only because they personally haven't purposed a solution.</p>
<p>It's easy to fall into the trap of moral incompetence, we did with our company. Moral competence and incompetence often looks the same to an outside observer. The world is really good at praising people who are <em>doing</em> good things well before those things are accomplished. You get hounded for interviews, you win awards, your family and friends congratulate you. And when things <em>aren't</em> going well, when you're <em>not</em> helping people, it feels like a betrayal to tell anyone. After all, that would mean no longer helping people with your chosen problem.</p>
<p>The morally <em>competent</em> differ in intent. It's more important to cure cancer than it is to be working on curing cancer, to stop climate change than to be working on stopping climate change, to improve mental health than to be working on improving mental health. The morally competent aren't hanging around the hoop, content to be playing the game. The point isn't to be working in the field, it's to solve the problem.</p>

    <p>Data-driven decision-making systems in production today exhibit serious conceptual flaws. Deployed as part of high-stakes applications, they not only risk to compromise individual safety and a company’s financial performance but threaten economic and political stability at scale.</p>
<p>To achieve reliable performance of AI in the real world, we need to shift the focus from the development of <em>ML models</em> towards a more systematic discipline to create fail-safe <em>systems</em> and <em>life cycles</em>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://david-haber.github.io/images/crashtest.jpg" alt="Cars go through rigorous stress testing as part of the normal development workflow. Fail-safe engineering is still underdeveloped in AI compared to more conventional technologies used in transportation, healthcare, finance, or other industries. - Photo: Mercedes-Benz"> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While many still argue that AI’s impact has been modest, the importance to address this now becomes clear if we look at the air balls that we already managed to throw.</p>
<p>In the midst of recent wildfires in the US, one of Google’s algorithms recommended outdoor exercise to people<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, exposing their respiratory systems to harmful amounts of smoke and putting their health at severe risk. While the company might have acted in good faith (exercise is good after all!), they didn’t take into account that a wildfire event would invalidate their data and an otherwise correct recommendation. The real world is always full of surprises.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that a group of researchers found racial bias in a hospital algorithm which meant that black patients were less likely to receive the medical help they needed than white patients<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The reasons, it was explained, included that the algorithm would rank patients according to healthcare costs and the fact that “health-care spending for black patients was less than for white patients with similar medical conditions”. With better transparency, this issue would have been found more quickly, likely before deployment.</p>
<p>During the current pandemic, headline news claim that AI imaging systems can detect COVID-19 from chest x-rays. While this is all early work, a team at the University of Washington showed that the methodology in building those systems was terribly flawed. The models–which had been reported to have astounding accuracies in the first place–seem to have learned “spurious shortcuts” and imaging artifacts rather than medical pathology<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. As one of the consequences, physically moving the patient up in the x-ray “increased the model’s predicted odds that the patient has COVID-19”. It’s a beautiful–and alarming–illustration of the gap between news headlines, early prototypes and the complexities of operating these in hospital rooms.</p>
<p>Clinical decision-making systems recommend procedures and drug treatments to doctors and patients every day. The cost of poor decision-making often only becomes apparent when we do the math at scale. While false predictions could pose small risks at an individual level, we forget that they needlessly harm a number of human beings every day when decision-making systems are deployed and used at scale - across offices, hospitals, and countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, academic AI papers claim to outperform humans in a fascinating race to beat state-of-the-art performances. Yet, it is clear to all that our machine learning (ML) models which work well in a Jupyter notebook<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, perform less impressively in the real world. A set of metrics, ground truth and predictions is all that is needed to arrive at the “my system works well on the test set” conclusion. While there is nothing wrong with that, the problem is that–despite being neither a complete nor a sound assessment–we erroneously extrapolate that performance to complex, dynamic and real-world environments all too often.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ML code is only a small part of the solution.
— <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Andrew Ng, Co-founder of Coursera and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth is that the development of <em>complete AI systems</em> is extremely challenging and the organizational effort required to drive such projects to completion is orders of magnitude higher than developing proof-of-concept or prototype <em>models</em>. Especially as the challenges of real-world AI transcend data science and code. Complete systems need to be analyzed in the context of the intended application, how they interact with and are influenced by their environment and any hardware that is used. Failure situations need to be examined through <em>failure mode and effects analyses</em><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and influence the design and procedures which are used during development and operation. Finally, these systems will be used by humans with different backgrounds, skills, and their own individual ways of interacting with technology. As a consequence, AI development requires great care in the design of human-computer interfaces and the consideration of human factors<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. It is a cross-disciplinary effort that needs to involve multiple stakeholders and domain expertise to truly understand the end user we want to serve.</p>
<p>What is the result of this? Businesses around the world struggle to realize a return on their AI investments - too many projects and even entire companies are stuck in the “pilot trap”.</p>
<p>Having gone through the development of complex, physical AI systems with strict safety guarantees ourselves, we understand the challenges and the need to rethink our strategies to develop real-world AI systems. This is particularly true in the context of evolving regulatory standards which will create additional pressure for AI developers and companies in all major industries over the next few years. But it is also relevant beyond regulations - for anyone looking to realize the impact that AI has long been promising.</p>
<p>So, what does it take? We need to better understand how to design, develop and operate AI from a system’s perspective. Reasoning about systems rather than models opens the toolboxes that safety and systems engineers have been using to build robust systems for decades. We have the tools. What’s missing is our own toolbox.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The building blocks are in place, the principles for putting these blocks together are not, and so the blocks are currently being put together in ad-hoc ways…What we’re missing is an engineering discipline with principles of analysis and design.
— <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Michael Jordan, Professor at the University of California, Berkeley<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more disciplined approach to AI development would not only create better products but also enable completely new applications. It would help us achieve the small failure probabilities that healthcare, transportation, finance, and other industries require.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it would help convert the AI term from an intellectual wildcard into something more fundamental, something that we can understand and reason about. Only then can we have meaningful discussions around safety, ethics, and regulations. Only then can we nudge AI projects out of the “pilot trap” and deploy them safely &amp; robustly in our complex world.</p>
<p>What does this all mean for startups and corporations? How can they establish development life cycles, create AI products and structure their organizations? What does it mean for you? Bear with us! We will present some thoughts around these questions in future articles.</p>

<p>Chong Kai Xiong is usually so conscious of his privacy that he refuses to use ride-hailing apps like Grab or Gojek. An IT professional who has done independent research on surveillance technologies, he says he knows how hard it is to make databases secure, and he worries about hacks and leaks.</p>



<p>But now that the novel coronavirus pandemic has made opting out of location tracking practically impossible in Singapore, he has been forced to compromise. The country’s approach to containing the virus has included the widespread use of digital check-ins via a system called <a href="https://safeentry.gov.sg/">SafeEntry</a>. Individuals must check in with their ID and phone number before they enter malls, shops, restaurants, workplaces, or schools. This information is fed back to a centralized database, which the government then uses for contact tracing.</p>



<p>Naturally, Chong isn’t happy about it. “Every time I have lunch or shop outside, I am forced to recognize the gaze of the state, surveilling my whereabouts,” he says.</p>



<p>The Singaporean government has leaned heavily on technology in its response to the pandemic. In March, the government launched its TraceTogether app, <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/20201015-before-tracetogether-you-have-to-testtogether">touting it</a> as the “world’s first national digital contact-tracing effort.” The system uses Bluetooth to track people as they move and interact with one another; if two users are within two meters of each other for thirty minutes or more, it records the contact. (The government provides people without smartphones with <a href="https://token.gowhere.gov.sg/faq">tokens</a>.) The code that the app runs on was <a href="https://github.com/opentrace-community">open source</a>, so other countries can adapt it for their own uses, as Australia did to develop its own contact-tracing system.</p>



<p>The authorities claim that such technologies have <a href="https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/360052744534-How-do-TraceTogether-and-SafeEntry-work-together-Is-SafeEntry-still-required-since-there-is-TraceTogether-">greatly strengthened their contact-tracing efforts</a>. In early November, the health minister <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tracetogether-app-tokens-close-contacts-cases-identified-covid19-13442296">said</a> that 25,000 close contacts of confirmed Covid-19 cases had been identified through TraceTogether, of which 160 eventually tested positive. The country reported zero cases of community transmission most days in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite these successes, the imposition of more intrusive data collection technology has unnerved privacy advocates, who worry that the pandemic will be used to justify the surveillance of citizens without consideration of the long-term consequences, and without sufficient checks and balances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those concerns look increasingly well-founded. When Parliament reopened in January 2021, Desmond Tan, the Minister of State at the Ministry of Home Affairs, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-police-force-can-obtain-tracetogether-data-covid-19-13889914">said that the police would also be able to access TraceTogether data for criminal investigations</a>. The privacy statement on the TraceTogether website, which had previously stated that collected data would “only be used solely for contact tracing of persons possibly exposed to COVID-19,” was amended shortly afterwards.</p>



<p>“It’s not that, in principle, I disagree with contact tracing. It’s something that society could decide to do because there’s a trade-off with giving up privacy to ensure better health. But we didn’t make that decision democratically,” says Tan Zhi-xuan, a Singaporean who researches artificial intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “I think society has given up a lot in the name of efficiency and convenience.”</p>

<p>The enthusiastic adoption of data-collection technology is entirely in keeping with Singapore’s model of governance and view of itself as a high-tech “<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/">Smart Nation</a>” at the forefront of global innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Singapore is a very techno-optimistic nation,” says Monamie Bhadra Haines, an assistant professor of global science and technology studies at Nanyang Technological University. “Technology and technological solutionism is seen to be the approach that they take to solve all sorts of deeply political problems.”</p>



<p>In 2018, Singapore announced a pilot project to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-surveillance-idUSKBN1HK0RV">install facial-recognition cameras on lampposts</a>, alongside other sensors&nbsp; it claimed would be beneficial for analysing the movement of crowds or investigations in the event of a terror attack. The country is also working on <a href="https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/satellite-based-erp-system-start-middle-2023-lta">a satellite-based road-toll system</a> that would charge drivers based on how far they travel, though they’ve temporarily put that plan on hold.</p>



<p>In September, the government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54266602">announced</a> that facial verification will be integrated into the existing digital identity system, which allows citizens to access government services online. A month later, the immigration authority <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/facial-and-iris-scans-have-replaced-fingerprint-scans-as-main-mode-for-identifying">said</a> it was replacing fingerprint scans with facial and iris scans as the main mode of identity verification at the border.</p>



<p>There is rarely much public opposition to these initiatives. Singaporeans routinely report a high level of trust in the government; the country’s politics is dominated by a single powerful political party that exerts significant influence over the media. New technologies and processes are presented to the public as faits accomplis, leaving little space for public discussion.</p>



<p>“It’s also framed in this very positive way, like, ‘This will speed us through the border faster,’” says Hallam Stevens, a historian of technology at Nanyang Technological University. “There’s a kind of lack of debate about this partly because it’s going through so fast.”</p>



<p>The government maintains it is not using the TraceTogether system to actively track its citizens and that the data will only be used for Covid-19 contact tracing—although as it stated in parliament, the police will be able to request data, and some academics and activists are concerned about the underlying trade-off — convenience in exchange for privacy and power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singapore’s government and public agencies are exempt from the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), which regulates the collection and use of data in the private sector. <a href="https://www.mci.gov.sg/pressroom/news-and-stories/pressroom/2019/2/mcis-response-to-pq-on-public-agencies-exemption-from-pdpa?page=28">Other laws</a> do govern data collection in the public sector, and the government says their standards are comparable to the PDPA’s. But privacy advocates say these laws don’t sufficiently empower individual users, and that citizens have no rights to redress or accountability if they aren’t followed.</p>



<p>“The individual has no remedy for misuse of data,” says Indulekshmi Rajeswari, a privacy lawyer who practiced in Singapore before relocating to Germany.</p>



<p>Others worry that relying heavily on technology could worsen structural inequities in Singaporean society. As Tan points out, facial-recognition systems have been shown to generate different results for different ethnic groups, which could, for example, lead to racial minorities’ being subjected to extra questioning and scrutiny during immigration checks.</p>



<p>TraceTogether will soon be mandatory for all of Singapore’s residents — but it already is for the country’s population of migrant workers. <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-450000-workers-to-get-contact-tracing-devices">More than 450,000 </a>have been given wearable contact-tracing tokens so that their movements and interactions can be logged even if they don’t have their phones on them while at work.</p>



<p>As Haines puts it, “If [the debate about technology is] only narrowly framed [in terms of] convenience and efficiency and speed, then what happens to problems like inequality, or power asymmetries, or any of the other kinds of deeply moral stuff that we care about?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are signs that Singaporeans are nervous about handing over their data. Two months after TraceTogether was launched, <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/given-low-adoption-rate-tracetogether-experts-suggest-merging-safeentry-or-other-apps">only 25% of the population</a> had voluntarily downloaded it. A local polling company, Blackbox Research, found that <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/people/article/3084903/coronavirus-why-arent-singapore-residents-using-tracetogether">45% of respondents</a> chose not to install TraceTogether because of concerns about “the government tracing their movements.” In October, the government had to <a href="https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/tracetogether-tokens-allegedly-modified-thick-headed-singaporeans">remind</a> people that tampering with TraceTogether tokens was illegal, after reports emerged of individuals trying to subvert or disable their tracking capabilities.</p>



<p>Chong, long used to being an outlier when it comes to apprehension over data collection in Singapore, says he has been encouraged by the recent increase in public awareness. But he’s still keeping his expectations low because he thinks the burgeoning resistance isn’t enough to put the brakes on it.</p>



<p>“Unless people start to band together and question these [Smart Nation] initiatives, I think [the government is] just going to push ahead. There are benefits to these technologies, but there needs to be some sort of debate about the trade-offs.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/@cyril0allen?source=post_page-----1be643ea121c--------------------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Tony Allen" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/2*lB9bR1EdvGCB4WQlaXom9A.png" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div><p id="1237">If you deal with networked systems you probably care a lot about latency. It’s also likely that you’ll be faced with a decision of which load balancing algorithm to use when fronting a fleet of servers. It can be extremely helpful when making these decisions to build an intuition for what behaviors to expect in different load balancer configurations, so that you can minimize latency in your environment without any surprising behaviors.</p><p id="f662">Hopefully we can all agree that a load balancer’s job is to distribute requests across some fleet of servers (occasionally referred to as <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" rel="noopener"><em>upstreams</em></a><em> </em>to Envoy folks). The goal is to maximize the efficiency of servicing those requests. Efficiency can mean optimal CPU utilization for the server or minimal wait time for the sender (latency). Typically, where you find latency, you will also find there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law" rel="noopener">queue forming somewhere</a>, so I’ll proceed with the goal of investigating load balancer schemes that minimize queueing on the upstreams.</p><p id="3b9a">I’ll present a (non-exhaustive) overview of the various load balancing algorithms found in <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/" rel="noopener">Envoy</a> with some simulations to showcase their behaviors. There’s a lot to go over, so I’ll be keeping this as simple and focused as I can. There will be no talk of <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/http/http_routing.html#arch-overview-http-routing-retry" rel="noopener">retry policies</a>, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/circuit_breaking#arch-overview-circuit-break" rel="noopener">circuit breaking</a>, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/panic_threshold.html" rel="noopener">panic routing</a>, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/priority.html" rel="noopener">load balancer priorities</a>, and the like or their (non-trivial) effects on load balancing. The effects of those features are non-trivial, so just know that they play a big part in real (not simulated) workloads!</p><p id="006e">Each simulation that follows will send HTTP requests with some fixed RPS through an Envoy process to a fleet of 10 HTTP servers. The servers simply accept a request, sleep for some amount of time (we’ll call this a “service time”), and reply with a 200 status.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/0*Yoa9pDy9-PoClpKr" width="624" height="124" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*Yoa9pDy9-PoClpKr 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*Yoa9pDy9-PoClpKr 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/0*Yoa9pDy9-PoClpKr 624w" sizes="624px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Yoa9pDy9-PoClpKr?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>General topology of the simulations.</figcaption></figure><p id="a94e">If a specific server is juggling multiple requests simultaneously, it will repeatedly choose one at random and sleep for 100us until the “service time” for that request is met as a hand-wavy approximation of the effects of request concurrency on latency. As a queue forms in each server and it services multiple requests, the latency of each response will increase. Keep in mind that if we did not have each request sleep for identical service times and had an actual distribution of latencies (as we would in real life) queueing on the servers would impact our tail latencies disproportionately.</p><p id="2b36">The specifics of latency and RPS numbers will be omitted, because we care about the queues that form and the relationship between the queues and the load balancing algorithms. Since I’m controlling the RPS <strong>and </strong>the request latency, only the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law" rel="noopener">relationship between the two</a> matters for the queuing behavior.</p><p id="b1db">Now let’s get to the good stuff- load balancers!</p><p id="4c44">The simplest load balancer supported by Envoy is the <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/load_balancers.html?highlight=ring%20hash#random" rel="noopener">random load balancer</a>, where node/endpoint is chosen via a uniform random selection.</p><p id="d078">Uniform random selection is the simplest way to distribute requests to a set of upstream nodes and also the easiest to implement. It’s fair to expect a pool of 10 nodes subjected to a uniform random selection algorithm to have a flat distribution at the end of 1 million selections:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*HbVkSzsyht1vW6eK" width="1600" height="917" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*HbVkSzsyht1vW6eK 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*HbVkSzsyht1vW6eK 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*HbVkSzsyht1vW6eK 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*HbVkSzsyht1vW6eK 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*HbVkSzsyht1vW6eK?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Histogram of node selections using uniform random selection. Looks pretty uniform!</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="0f1b"><em>An even distribution of requests! This is what we want… right?</em></p></blockquote><p id="bd2a">In practice, things are not this simple. Let’s take a look at a scenario where these 10 nodes are given requests distributed via random load balancing.</p><p id="c21e">Below, we have results where each line represents a different endpoint and the Y-axis is the number of requests outstanding for that endpoint at a particular point in time during the experiment:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2860/0*tmwuB4U9-03mVWCK" width="1430" height="800" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*tmwuB4U9-03mVWCK 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*tmwuB4U9-03mVWCK 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*tmwuB4U9-03mVWCK 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*tmwuB4U9-03mVWCK 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*tmwuB4U9-03mVWCK?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The number of active requests per-node for random LB.</figcaption></figure><p id="4393">The specific number of active requests for each endpoint is unimportant, but the distribution of requests among the endpoints is worth noting. Some nodes have an order of magnitude more outstanding requests than others at a particular point in time! It appears that even though the asymptotic behavior of uniform random selection yields a uniform distribution, at any point in time an endpoint could be overburdened by too many requests. This could result in increased latency, the formation of a request queue in the service, and eventually cascading failures.</p><p id="35b4">We can combat this behavior by ensuring each node receives a request in a predictable manner, so let’s introduce round-robin selection.</p><p id="23a7">Envoy’s round-robin (or “next-in-loop”) load balancing policy will sequentially rotate through each upstream node. This has the benefit of providing us with a predictable distribution of requests not only asymptotically, as in the case of uniform random selection, but also at any point in time. Running the same test, but using a round-robin load balancer policy in the config yields a much tighter distribution of active requests among the upstream nodes compared to the random selection experiment above:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2834/0*sB4bX_GJ636GlQz1" width="1417" height="824" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*sB4bX_GJ636GlQz1 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*sB4bX_GJ636GlQz1 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*sB4bX_GJ636GlQz1 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*sB4bX_GJ636GlQz1 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*sB4bX_GJ636GlQz1?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The number of active requests per-node for round-robin LB.</figcaption></figure><p id="2bb6">For the exact same test, let’s also compare the request counts on each node when using round-robin vs. random load balancing. We’ll define a metric called <em>request drift</em> by looking at the gap between the node that received the most requests and the node that received the least requests at each point in time:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2412/0*0K9-GCQTo61rNeBo" width="1206" height="913" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*0K9-GCQTo61rNeBo 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*0K9-GCQTo61rNeBo 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*0K9-GCQTo61rNeBo 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*0K9-GCQTo61rNeBo 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*0K9-GCQTo61rNeBo?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The difference between the node with the highest number of requests active and the node with the lowest number of requests active.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="2f67"><em>It’s settled! Use round-robin load balancing for an even distribution of requests with minimal active request drift! Simple! Elegant!</em></p></blockquote><p id="9dc7">Not quite!</p><p id="4e5e">Up to this point, all of the upstream nodes have been homogeneous, with the same latency profiles. What if some subset of the upstreams are extremely capable nodes and they go under-utilized or some of the upstreams are potato computers? Below, we have the same round-robin experiment/configuration, but now we have 3 lightning fast nodes completing requests virtually instantaneously and 3 potato nodes completing requests 25% slower than before. As you can see, there are 3 obvious groupings of active request counts:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*N5FiiK2j_KJKtq6r" width="1600" height="928" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*N5FiiK2j_KJKtq6r 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*N5FiiK2j_KJKtq6r 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*N5FiiK2j_KJKtq6r 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*N5FiiK2j_KJKtq6r 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*N5FiiK2j_KJKtq6r?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Active request counts for high-latency/weaker nodes (A), standard nodes we’re familiar with from previous simulations (B), and blazing-fast nodes (C).</figcaption></figure><p id="a05e">The issue we have now is that the slower (potato) nodes in group A that are juggling too many requests at a time and experiencing elevated latencies, while the fastest nodes in group C are being under-utilized. Notice that the request queue is growing for the slower nodes (a cascading failure waiting to happen) and there is essentially no queue for the fast nodes.</p><blockquote><p id="24cb">It would be nice if the load balancer could take into account the number of outstanding requests destined for each node and bias its forwarding decisions based on the information.</p></blockquote><p id="9cbb">Conveniently, Envoy has a load balancer that does this!</p><p id="9b18">Envoy’s least request load balancer takes into account the number of outstanding requests destined for each node and biases its forwarding decisions based on the active request count. Our problem of over/underutilized nodes is encountered when discussing the round-robin approach would be resolved by doing this, but the implementation details matter here- what exactly does it mean to “bias” node selections?</p><p id="7115">Consider some weight assigned to a node that is inversely proportional to the number of outstanding requests the node has. If we have 100 nodes with weights in the range [0,100), we have a few different options for biasing our selections based on the weights.</p><p id="f24b">The most obvious method of performing weighted selections is simply to have the selection probability of an object be proportional to the weight, similar to spinning a roulette wheel. This is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection" rel="noopener">fitness proportionate selection</a>. Simulating this, we can see that the proportions of the selection counts converge on the weights of each object in the selection pool (x-axis is the object’s weight):</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*wJ49nFz7CMvJoYi9" width="1600" height="647" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*wJ49nFz7CMvJoYi9 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*wJ49nFz7CMvJoYi9 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*wJ49nFz7CMvJoYi9 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*wJ49nFz7CMvJoYi9 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*wJ49nFz7CMvJoYi9?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Histogram of selection counts at different points in time for weight-proportional selection. Each object weight on the x-axis represents a separate object with that corresponding weight.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="94ee"><em>What’s wrong this time…</em></p></blockquote><p id="3784">Predictably, there’s a wrench in the gears. Selection probabilities that are proportional to the object weights can be a double-edged sword. This selection method is great because our load balancer will send more traffic to the nodes with less requests more aggressively and back off more aggressively. However, this can be the source of problems in a scenario where all nodes in the load balancing pool are redlining and we insert a new node into the pool (as you’d see in a scale-up event). It’s not quite the canonical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem" rel="noopener">thundering herd problem</a> some folks are familiar with, but it definitely falls into the same category.</p><p id="8a28">This behavior can be observed if we have 9 nodes with weights in the range [0,9) and a single node with a weight of ~1000:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*sLguir2l7wGCsRVQ" width="1600" height="663" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*sLguir2l7wGCsRVQ 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*sLguir2l7wGCsRVQ 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*sLguir2l7wGCsRVQ 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*sLguir2l7wGCsRVQ 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*sLguir2l7wGCsRVQ?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Histogram of selection counts at different points in time for weight-proportional selection.</figcaption></figure><p id="aa53">You’ll notice that the single host with a high weight is overwhelmingly preferred compared to the others. If you squint, you might even see the other 9 hosts! Some might think that this doesn’t matter, since it would result in an immediate queue on the 10th node and the weight would be adjusted accordingly- they would be correct. However, you should keep in mind that these decisions are made across many different load balancers, so the node would receive a flood of traffic from <em>everyone</em>.</p><p id="8b5c">We need a biased selection algorithm that’s resilient to this herding behavior, yet also gives priority to the higher weight hosts. Conveniently, Envoy has implemented one in the least request load balancer.</p><p id="fd8f">Suppose we just choose two nodes at random and select the one with a higher weight. This surprising, simple, and elegant method of biased selection is commonly referred to as the “power of two choices (P2C),” coined by <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/mythesis.pdf" rel="noopener">Michael Mitzenmacher’s 2001 dissertation</a>. However, contrary to much of the load balancing documentation that references this selection …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>In this episode let’s see how we can use a universally unique identifier or UUID as the primary key for a schema. To start we’ll need a schema to work with so let’s create a “user”.</p>
<p>We’ll go to the command line and use the Phoenix HTML generator with the context module of <code>Accounts</code> followed by the schema module <code>User</code> the table name <code>users</code> and let’s give it a single field of name, which will be a string.</p>
<pre><code>$ mix phx.gen.html Accounts User users name
  * creating lib/teacher_web/controllers/user_controller.ex
  * creating lib/teacher_web/templates/user/edit.html.eex
  * creating lib/teacher_web/templates/user/form.html.eex
  * creating lib/teacher_web/templates/user/index.html.eex
  * creating lib/teacher_web/templates/user/new.html.eex
  * creating lib/teacher_web/templates/user/show.html.eex
  * creating lib/teacher_web/views/user_view.ex
  * creating test/teacher_web/controllers/user_controller_test.exs
  * creating lib/teacher/accounts/user.ex
  * creating priv/repo/migrations/{timestamp}_create_users.exs
  * creating lib/teacher/accounts.ex
  * injecting lib/teacher/accounts.ex
  * creating test/teacher/accounts_test.exs
  * injecting test/teacher/accounts_test.exs</code></pre>
<p>This generates the controller, views, and templates for our HTML resource. Let’s open the generated <code>{timestamp}_create_users.exs</code> database migration. There we see the migration we would expect to create the <code>users</code> table.</p>
<p>Because we don’t want to use the typical primary key and instead a UUID, let’s include the <code>primary_key: false</code> option. Then we’ll want to add the field for our <code>uuid</code>. We’ll add a new field named <code>uuid</code> with the database type of <code>uuid</code> and let’s include the <code>primary_key: true</code> option since we want to use this as the primary key for our <code>users</code> table.</p>
<pre>priv/repo/migrations/{timestamp}_create_users.exs
<code>
defmodule Teacher.Repo.Migrations.CreateUsers do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:users, primary_key: false) do
      add :uuid, :uuid, primary_key: true
      add :name, :string

      timestamps()
    end
  end
end
</code>
</pre><p>Now before we run our migration let’s open the generated corresponding <code>user.ex</code> module. Since we want to use the <code>uuid</code> for our schema’s primary key, we need to configure that here. Ecto provides <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#module-schema-attributes">schema attributes</a> that help us do just that.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>@primary_key</code> attribute to tell Ecto to use the <code>uuid</code> field as the primary key. It expects a tuple with the field name <code>uuid</code>, the type <code>binary_id</code>, and any options. We want the <code>uuid</code> to be autogenerated too let’s include <code>autogenerate: true</code>.</p>
<pre>lib/teacher/accounts/user.ex
<code>
defmodule Teacher.Accounts.User do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  @primary_key {:uuid, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}

  schema "users" do
    field :name, :string

    timestamps()
  end

  @doc false
  def changeset(user, attrs) do
    user
    |&gt; cast(attrs, [:name])
    |&gt; validate_required([:name])
  end
end
</code>
</pre><p>Then let’s open our <code>router.ex</code> and add our “users” resource.</p>
<pre>lib/teacher_web/router.ex
<code>
...
scope "/", TeacherWeb do
  pipe_through :browser

  resources "/users", UserController

  live "/", PageLive, :index
end
...
</code>
</pre><p>Then we can go back to the command line and run our migration.</p>
<pre><code>$ mix ecto.migrate
...</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s try to create a user to test that our <code>uuid</code> is generated. We’ll go to the command line…and start an <code>IEx</code> session with our project. Once it starts up, we can call <code>Accounts.create_user</code> to create a user.</p>
<p>Great - it looks like a user was created and we can see the <code>uuid</code> was set. Now every time we create a user their <code>uuid</code> will be automatically generated for us.</p>
<pre><code>$ iex -S mix
&gt; Teacher.Accounts.create_user(%{"name" =&gt; "Bob Dylan"})
{:ok,
 %Teacher.Accounts.User{
   __meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata&lt;:loaded, "users"&gt;,
   inserted_at: ~N[2020-12-28 19:00:53],
   name: "Bob Dylan",
   updated_at: ~N[2020-12-28 19:00:53],
   uuid: "f3f9211f-0819-4147-973d-dacc06524553"
 }}</code></pre>
<p>This approach works well if we only wanted to use the <code>uuid</code> as the primary key for our user schema, but if we wanted to use this as an application wide default, the Ecto docs give us a simpler alternative. We can create a schema module to use as a base for our application. Let’s see how this would work in our application.</p>
<p>We’ll create a new module named <code>schema.ex</code> in “lib/teacher” and define our module. Then we’ll need to define the <code>__using__</code> macro. Then inside it we’ll call the <code>quote</code> macro and inside of that we’ll call <code>use Ecto.Schema</code> and the <code>@primary_key</code> schema attribute that we had in our <code>user.ex</code> module. Because our primary keys are <code>uuid</code>s, let’s inlcude <code>@foreign_key_type :binary_id</code> in case we need to use any <code>belongs_to</code> associations in the future.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with how macros work don’t worry - all you need to know here is that everything inside of the <code>quote</code> will be included in any module where we <code>use</code> this <code>Teacher.Schema</code> module. This will help us from having to repeat ourselves in every schema where we want to use the <code>uuid</code> as the primary key.</p>
<pre>lib/teacher/schema.ex
<code>
defmodule Teacher.Schema do
  defmacro __using__(_) do
    quote do
      use Ecto.Schema
      @primary_key {:uuid, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
      @foreign_key_type :binary_id
    end
  end
end
</code>
</pre><p>Then we can go back to our <code>user.ex</code> module and update it to use the new <code>Teacher.Schema</code>. With that added we can remove the <code>@primary_key</code> attribute since it will be included from <code>Teacher.Schema</code>.</p>
<pre>lib/teacher/accounts/user.ex
<code>
defmodule Teacher.Accounts.User do
  use Teacher.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  schema "users" do
    field :name, :string

    timestamps()
  end

  ...
end
</code>
</pre><p>Great, now whenever we create a new module that uses the <code>uuid</code> as the primary key we can just use our new <code>Schema</code> module.</p>
<p>Now let’s test one last thing. Let’s go to the command line and start our server.</p>
<pre><code>$ mix phx.server
...</code></pre>
<p>And if we try to open the “/users” route in the browser, we get an error: “structs expect an :id key when converting to_param or a custom implementation of the Phoenix.Param protocol”.</p>
<p>This is because we’re using the <code>uuid</code> as the field for our primary key and Phoenix doesn’t know how to convert that to a param for us. We’ll need to configure it to use the <code>uuid</code> field. Let’s go back to our <code>schema.ex</code> module. And because the <code>Phoenix.Param</code> protocol is derivable we can call <code>@derive</code> specifying <code>Phoenix.Param</code> and then the key we want to use. In this case the <code>uuid</code>.</p>
<pre>lib/teacher/schema.ex
<code>
defmodule Teacher.Schema do
  defmacro __using__(_) do
    quote do
      use Ecto.Schema
      @primary_key {:uuid, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
      @foreign_key_type :binary_id
      @derive {Phoenix.Param, key: :uuid}
    end
  end
end
</code>
</pre><p>With that let’s go back to the browser and if we refresh the page - it works! We can now view all our users in the UI and their UUIDs are being used.</p>

January 5, 2021 | https://logicboard.com/blog/code-replay | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://logicboard.com/blog/code-replay">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-code-replay" phx-hook="Highlight" phx-update="ignore">
<p>
<a href="https://logicboard.com/">Logicboard</a> is a collaborative code editor for conducting technical interviews. We believe the most important aspect of a technical interview is to understrand a candidate’s thought process. Having a working solution to a problem during an interview would be ideal, but there’s never really a single solution to any problem.</p>
<p>
At the end of an interview, what I usually take away is some code that a candidate wrote and a few key points that I remember. But it’s hard to convey a candidate’s thought process to the rest of the team based on a few lines of code.</p>
<p>
But what if I could replay the entire coding session to the rest of the team? We thought that would give everyone a better context and help understand the thought process behind a solution. This is in fact one of the top feedback we got from our customers.</p>
<p>
Today we’re rolling out <strong>Code-Replay</strong>, a feature that lets you replay the entire interview session line-by-line. It’s like having the ability to undo/redo even after the interview has ended.</p>
<p>
Here’s Code-Replay in action:</p>
<p>
  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/496816468?title=0&amp;byline=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>
You can also check out the live demo <em><a href="https://logicboard.com/demo/:replay">here</a></em></p>
<h2>
Let’s take look at how we built this</h2>
<p>
Logicboard uses <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>+<a href="https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/firepad">Firepad</a> to power the code editor. Firepad uses Firebase Realtime Database to keep a versioned history of a document.</p>
<h3>
Firebase</h3>
<p>
Let’s deep dive in to how this history is stored in Firebase. Here’s what gets stored in Firebase when I type <strong><em>The</em></strong>
  <img src="https://logicboard.com/blog/images/202010/firebase-struct-add.svg" alt="Elixir Phoenix Boot Up">
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
<strong>A0, A1 and A2</strong> are the reversions of document created each time I edit content.    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<strong>User ID</strong> is the ID of the user that created this revision. This is helpful when multiple users are collaborating.    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<strong>o</strong> is for operation, it contains the actual information about changes made in this version.    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<strong>Index</strong> is the position of the text added/deleted in the document.    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<strong>Content</strong> is the actual edited content. If it is an insert, it contains the inserted text and in case of deletion this will be a negative integer indicating the number of characters deleted.    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<strong>Timestamp</strong> is the timestamp for this revision.    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This structure is sequential and each revision stores just the delta. To restore a specific revision all you need to do is apply changes from A0 through An.
This is conceptually similar to git, you can think of each revision as a <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit">git commit</a>.</p>
<h3>
TextOperation</h3>
<p>
Each revision in Firebase is represented by a <a href="https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/firepad/blob/v1.5.11/lib/text-operation.js"><code>TextOperation</code></a> in Firepad.</p>
<p>
You can create a TextOperation from operation (<strong>o</strong>) of a Firebase revision:</p>
<pre><code>const operation = Firepad.TextOperation.fromJSON(history.A0.o)</code></pre>
<p>
TextOperation provides a handy <a href="https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/firepad/blob/v1.5.11/lib/text-operation.js#L296"><code>compose</code></a> function that combines the changes of two operations in to a new operation. This new operation can be further composed with another operation, so on and so forth. </p>
<pre><code> // "T"
const a0 = Firepad.TextOperation.fromJSON(history.A0.o)
 // "Th"
const a1 = a0.compose(Firepad.TextOperation.fromJSON(history.A1.o))
 // "The"
const final = a1.compose(Firepad.TextOperation.fromJSON(history.A2.o))</code></pre>
<p>
You can think of compose like <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick">cherry-pick</a> in git.</p>
<h3>
Putting it together</h3>
<p>
If we start with the operation for first revision and recursively compose subsequent operations, we’ll end up with an operation that contains the final state of the document.
So to restore a specific version <strong>An</strong> just compose operations <strong>A0…An</strong>.</p>
<p>
With this in mind we can break down the entire process in to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
Fetch revisions from Firebase.  </li>
  <li>
Create TextOperations for each revision.  </li>
  <li>
Recursively compose TextOperations from start to the specified revision to get the final TextOperation.  </li>
</ol>
<h3>
Fetching revisions from Firebase</h3>
<p>
Fetching history from firebase is pretty straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>  const fetchRevisions = async (firebaseRef, callback) =&gt; {
    firebaseRef.child('history').once("value", function (snapshot) {
      const revisions = snapshot.val()
  }</code></pre>
<h3>
3. Wrap each revision in to a TextOperation</h3>
<p>
Once we have revisions from Firebase, we create a TextOperation for each revision.</p>
<p>
Also to make it easy to restore revision for a given timestamp, we generate a dictionary of <code>{timestamp : TextOperation}</code>.</p>
<pre><code>const fetchRevisions = async (firebaseRef, callback) =&gt; {
  firebaseRef.child('history').once("value", function (snapshot) {
    const revisions = snapshot.val()
    var revisionsByTimestamp = {}
    const Firepad = require('firepad')

    for (key in revisions) {
      const revision = revisions[key]
      const operation = Firepad.TextOperation.fromJSON(revision.o)
      revisionsByTimestamp[`${revision.t}`] = operation
    }
    
    callback(revisionsByTimestamp)
  })
}</code></pre>
<h3>
4. Get text for a specified revision</h3>
<p>
Next, we want the text content of a TextOperation, to do this we just use TextOperation’s <a href="https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/firepad/blob/v1.5.11/lib/text-operation.js#L156">toJSON</a> function. This function returns an Array whose first element is the resulting text.</p>
<p>
So if we compose all the TextOperations from <strong>A0</strong> to <strong>An</strong> where <strong>An</strong> is the specified revision, we’ll end up with a TextOperation whose <strong>toJSON</strong> will give us the final state of the document up until <strong>An</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>const textForRevision = (revision, revisions) =&gt; {
  const Firepad = require('firepad')
  var document = new Firepad.TextOperation()
  const keys = Object.keys(revisions).sort()

  for (var key of keys) {
    const operation = revisions[key]
    document = document.compose(operation)
    if (key === revision) {
      break
    }
  }

  return document.ops.length ? document.toJSON().slice(-1).pop() : null
}</code></pre>
<h2>
TL;DR</h2>
<pre><code>const fetchRevisions = async (firebaseRef, callback) =&gt; {

  firebaseRef.child('history').once("value", function (snapshot) {
    const revisions = snapshot.val()
    // Map revisions by their timestamp to make it easy to restore
    var revisionsByTimestamp = {}
    const Firepad = require('firepad')
    for (key in revisions) {
      const revision = revisions[key]
      const operation = Firepad.TextOperation.fromJSON(revision.o)
      revisionsByTimestamp[`${revision.t}`] = operation
    }

    callback(revisionsByTimestamp)
  })
}

const textForRevision = (revision, revisions) =&gt; {
  const Firepad = require('firepad')
  var document = new Firepad.TextOperation()
  const keys = Object.keys(revisions).sort()
  for (var key of keys) {
    const operation = revisions[key]
    document = document.compose(operation)
    if (key === revision) {
      break
    }
  }

  return document.ops.length ? document.toJSON().slice(-1).pop() : null
}

module.exports = {
  fetchRevisions,
  textForRevision,
}</code></pre>
<h4>
Usage:</h4>
<pre><code>const Firepad = require('firepad')
const Firebase = require('firebase')
const firebaseRef = Firebase.database().ref().child('&lt;child location&gt;')

firepad.on('ready', function () {
  fetchRevisions(firebaseRef, revisionInfo =&gt; {
    const timestamp = // eg: "1601406184335"
    const text = textForRevision(timestamp, revisionInfo)

    codeMirror.setValue(text)
  })
})</code></pre>

<p>Assembly code can appear mysterious to the uninitiated. Aspects of the physical machine abstracted away in higher-level languages are referred to directly in its terse commands.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502958082" target="">This chapbook</a> of minimal assembly code poems (its author refers to them as "snippets") offers no solutions, context, or explanations to ease this gap, leaving the work of deciphering to the reader. For xorpd, its pseudonymous author, this is exactly the point: to immerse the reader in the machine level of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When working inside a computer, everything is eventually made of assembly, so this is where you go if you really want to understand how things work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no extraneous word of text in the book to break that context. The title, <code>xchg rax, rax</code>, is a NOP instruction (pronounced no-op, for no operation): xchg exchanges the data of two operands, in this case of rax with itself. The author's name, xorpd, is a bitwise logical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XOR (exclusive or)</a> of packed double-precision floating-point values. <span><br></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The xor logical operation is one of my favorites. It is the foundation for most of our modern cryptography.</p>
<p>The "xorpd" instruction allows xoring 128 bits at a time. It is really the kind of instruction you want to be when you grow up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full book can be found here</a> but is also available as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502958082" target="">lovely printed book</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initially I wanted to publish the book through a publisher, but no publisher wanted to go with the "minimalistic" design. One publisher said he could publish the book if I added explanations for every code snippet, but I wasn't willing to do so.</p>
<p>Another friend recommended adding QR codes to the pages, linking to explanations, but I wasn't willing to do this either. I remember trying to decipher each of those code snippets myself, and I felt that I could not let my readers down by handing them an easy solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/e6b10eed-c3cc-4f59-afb6-580c6508c5f7/xorpd3.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>That lack of explanation, along with the monospaced font, gives the book the feel of conceptual poetry, perhaps an early Vito Acconci piece.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father opened one of the books and looked at it in amazement. He said something like "There is nothing inside the book, it's all strange short English words, who would want to buy something like this?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, much of the joy of the book comes from discovering the nuances of these tiny programs; many rely on assembly-specific tricks that do not really translate "up" into the virtual machines defined by higher-level programming languages.</p>
<p>Those who have trouble deciphering can view xorpd's video series <a href="https://www.xorpd.net/pages/x86_adventures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assembly Language Adventures</a>, which teaches assembly programming beginning with the very basics, reaching a level of expertise through 29 hours of instruction. Xorpd created the book as a companion piece while working on the video, pulling his favorite assembly snippets together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorites is:</p>

<div>
<pre>cmp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;al,0x0a
sbb &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;al,0x69
das</pre>
<p>This snippet converts a nibble (4 bits) into a hex digit with only three instructions. It always takes me a few mintues to understand how it works. From what I know the <code>das</code>​ instruction doesn't work anymore on the x86_64 architecture, but it is a nice reminder of what life used to be.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>How is this accomplished in three assembly instructions? Where is the conversion happening, and how is the 0x0a value used? The author has provided a complete explanation of the code below. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code converts a hex number (0x0 ... 0xf) into a hex character<br>('0','1','2',...'9','a',...'f').</p>
<p>How it works<br>============</p>
<p>introduction:</p>
<p>This is the relevant part of the ASCII table:</p>
<pre>0x30 0
0x31 1
0x32 2
0x33 3
0x34 4
0x35 5
0x36 6
0x37 7
0x38 8
0x39 9
0x3a :
0x3b ;
0x3c &lt;
0x3d =
0x3e &gt;
0x3f ?
0x40 @
0x41 A
0x42 B
0x43 C
0x44 D ...</pre>
<p>There is an unfortunate gap between the numeric digits and the caps English<br>letters. The code above is meant to overcome that gap.</p>
<p>We want to map a number x to its relevant ASCII number, in the following<br>fashion: If 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 9, then map x to x + 0x30 If 0xa &lt;= x &lt;= 0xf, then map<br>x to x + 0x37</p>
<p>Note that the difference is 0x7. The idea for the code comes from the fact<br>that 7 = (16 - 10) + 1 We get the (16 - 10) difference from the DAS<br>instruction, and the 1 difference from the SBB and CMP instructions.</p>
<p>Intro to binary coded arithmetic<br>-------------------------------------</p>
<p>Most of the magic of this snippet comes from the `das` instruction, so we<br>better start by exploring what it does.</p>
<p>`das` means decimal adjust (al) after subtraction. Together with the rest of<br>the binary coded decimals instructions family, it allows us to perform binary<br>coded decimals arithemtic.</p>
<p>Binary coded decimals are decimal numbers represented in base 16. For<br>example, 0x16 would mean the decimal number 16.</p>
<p>Internally, the `das` instruction observes the flag register, and alters `al`<br>to represent the correct binary coded decimal.</p>
<p>Subtraction example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
sub al, 0x08
das</pre>
<p>Will result in al = 0x23. Interpreted in the world of decimals, 31 - 8 = 23.<br>Overflow will also happen in the world of decimals (Modulo 100).</p>
<p>Overflow example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x15
sub al, 0x16
das</pre>
<p>Will result in al = 0x99, because 15 - 16 = -1, which equals to 99 modulo<br>100.</p>
<p>And finally, an example equivalent to the first subtraction example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
add al, 0x92
daa</pre>
<p>Which will also result in al = 0x23. This time we add instead of subtract.<br>and we use the instruction `daa`, decimal adjust after addition, instead of<br>`das`.</p>
<p>There is one more delicate point about `das` and `daa` that we will need for<br>our solution. Take a look at this example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
add al, 0x0a
daa</pre>
<p>The result is al = 0x41. This means that from the point of view of `daa`,<br>0x0a and 0x10 are the same. It also means that 0x0f behaves just like 0x15.</p>
<p>Converting to hex<br>------------------------</p>
<p>We want to use the 16 - 10 difference to our advantage, somehow bridging the <br>gap between the '9' and 'A' characters.</p>
<p>Here is a first attempt that is close to what we want to achieve:</p>
<pre>add al, 0x30
daa</pre>
<p>For every digit between '0' and '9', we will get the correct result.<br>As an example, assigning al = 0x5 will give us the result of al = 0x35, which<br>is the digit '5'. Assigning al = 0x9 will give us the result of al = 0x39.</p>
<p>What about hex digits? When we try to assign al = 0xa, we will get al = 0x40,<br>which means that we missed our target by 1. The character 'A' has the ASCII<br>code 0x41. But we did achieve something interesting here. We managed to take<br>a jump from 0x9 -&gt; 0x39 to 0xa -&gt; 0x40. Our input increased by 1, but our<br>output increased by 7!</p>
<p>We need to somehow add 1 in the case hex digits 'a' - 'f', but not in the<br>case of '0' - '9'. A classic way to achieve this is using the carry flag.<br>Here is a fixed solution:</p>
<pre>cmp al, 0xa ; Check if al is an 'a' - 'f' digit
cmc ; Complement the carry
adc al, 0x30
daa</pre>
<p>So, if we have a numeric digit ('0' - '9') in al, the first two <br>instructions will have no effect. But if our digit is in the 'a' - 'f' range,<br>we will get a carry flag equals 1, and so `adc al, 0x30` is equivalent to<br>`add al, 0x31`. Hence for example, an input of al = 0xa will give an al =<br>0x41 output, as we wanted.</p>
<p>But we could make our code shorter if we could somehow avoid using `cmc`.<br>In order to do this, we could turn to the dual side, knowing that given<br>wraparound, subtraction is equivalent to addition. In other words, <br>`add al, 0x30 // daa` is equivalent to `sub al, 0x70 // das`.</p>
<p>Combining this with the carry flag trick, we finally get:</p>
<pre>cmp al, 0xa
sbb al, 0x69
das</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives an idea of how much is packed into these short programs, but don't count on explanations for the other pieces. While the code may have seemed daunting early on, it has been intriguing enough for the book to build an audience slowly over the years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When "xchg rax, rax" was released in 2014, there was no real interest in the book. I hate marketing work, so I never really did anything to attempt to market the book. It is only recently, 6 years later, that people started paying attention.</p>

<p>Excerpted from <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time/#now%2C-what-about-programs">Functional Programming and the Semantics of Change, State &amp; Time</a>.</p>
<p>Some real programs are designed to produce output based solely on input. Ideally, compilers output the same binaries provided the same input files, for example. More frequently, however, programs require state, and user input <em>together</em> with the current state of the program determine the next state or output of the program. Such is the case with our ATM example, where the current balance is crucial to calculating any subsequent balance post withdrawal. To be generally useful, either paradigm must include a model for state, and perhaps time, even if composed entirely of well-behaved state<em>less</em> mathematical functions.</p>
<h2 id="stateful-object-oriented-programs">Stateful Object-Oriented Programs <a href="#stateful-object-oriented-programs">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Modeling with objects is powerful and intuitive, largely because this matches the perception of interacting with a world of which we are part. — <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3.5.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating stateful object-oriented programs is straightforward. An ATM program, for example, that allows the user to set a “withdrawal amount” and effect a withdraw,</p>

<p>decomposes naturally into <code>withdrawalAmount</code> and and <code>bankAccount</code> objects, representing the chosen amount to be withdrawn and the user account underlying the session, respectively. The withdrawal amounts are incorporated by and read from <code>withdrawalAmount</code>. Withdrawals are incorporated by, and balance confirmations are read from, <code>bankAccount</code>. The current balance and the amount to potentially withdraw — the state of the program — are reflected directly by the state of <code>bankAccount</code> and <code>withdrawalAmount</code> — the state of its composite objects.</p>
<h3 id="time">Time <a href="#time">#</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If we wish to write programs that model this kind of natural decomposition in our world (as we see it from our viewpoint as a part of that world) with structures in our computer, we make computational objects that… must change with time. — <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3.5.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we model objects, we also model time. Objects change — as we discussed, the notion of an “object,” having parts that change without changing the identity of the whole, articulates this ability. The flip-side to changing objects is time. Since objects change, <em>when</em> an object is examined is vital to the examination, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>Look no further than the object representations of our computer programs. The “having parts that can change without changing the identity of the whole” quality of <code>bankAccount</code> in our ATM program, for example, is implemented by <code>withdraw</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BankAccount</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>...</span><br>  <span>public</span> <span>withdraw</span><span>(</span>amount<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>this</span><span>.</span>balance <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>balance <span>-</span> amount<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br>  <span>...</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Underlying <code>withdraw</code> lies a mutable <code>balance</code> binding that may be assigned new values. Calls to <code>withdraw</code> change the associated balance of <code>bankAccount</code> as a side-effect, without altering the identity of <code>bankAccount</code>, by design.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> bankAccount <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BankAccount</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>bankAccount<span>.</span><span>checkBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <br>bankAccount<span>.</span><span>withdraw</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>bankAccount<span>.</span><span>checkBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>
<p>The flip-side to changing objects is time. In addition to changing the associated balance, any call to <code>withdraw</code> also “delineates moments in time” <em>when</em> <code>balance</code> <em>may</em> change. Whether <code>bankAccount.checkBalance()</code> resolves to <code>100</code> or <code>80</code> “depends not only on the expression itself, but also on whether the evaluation occurs before or after these moments.” As a result, by modeling objects, “we are forced to admit time into our computational models.” (<a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3.4)</p>
<h3 id="stateful">Stateful <a href="#stateful">#</a></h3>
<p>Object-oriented programming reifies objects. Further, objects can be composed in other objects, received by object methods, and generally manipulated like numbers, strings and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen">first-class citizens</a> of the program. No such affordances are made for state, on the other hand. State is a quality (i.e. “stateful” or “statefulness”) adjacent to objects. Unlike the objects to which they belong, state can only be <em>observed</em> at runtime, rather than <em>expressed</em> through language.</p>
<p><code>bankAccount</code> and <code>withdrawalAmount</code> identify objects, for example. They can be composed in other objects, received by object methods and generally manipulated like other first-class citizens of the program. By reifying these objects, however, <code>balance</code> and <code>amount</code> state are relegated to object qualities, observable at runtime only through calls to <code>bankAccount.checkBalance</code> and <code>withdrawalAmount.get</code>.</p>
<p>That objects indeed lack any express notion of state is highlighted by object signatures with more than one getter, where any such notion may only exist through definition, signature by signature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can you perceive a mutable object that has more than one getter? … How do you it? … Who could say right now how to do this? No one can, right? You cannot do this, because you need this other thing. You need the recipe for doing this, and the recipe is something that everybody has to make up over and over and over again. … We cannot actually perceive the whole. Cannot do it without help. Without these recipes. — Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/ValueOfValuesLong.md">The Value of Values</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An object with a single read method (like <code>bankAccount</code>) in a sense defines <em>the</em> method for accessing the whole of an object’s state. However, each additional read method dilutes this claim, underscoring the need for a method specific to the task (e.g. <code>toJSON</code>, <code>serialize</code>, <code>inspect</code>, etc.). In stark contrast to numbers, string and objects themselves, state may be expressed only through programmer-defined constructs evaluated at runtime.</p>
<h2 id="stateful-functional-programs">Stateful Functional Programs <a href="#stateful-functional-programs">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there another approach? Can we avoid identifying time in the computer with time in the modeled world? Must we make the model change with time in order to model phenomena in a changing world? — <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building stateful functional programs is less straightforward. To start, notice that imperative iteration can be restructured into functional iteration by recursively calling an iterative function with the results of the previous call. An imperative implementation of factorial, for example,</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>factorial</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>let</span> total <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>while</span> <span>(</span>n <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    total <span>=</span> total <span>*</span> n<span>;</span><br>    n <span>=</span> n <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br>  <span>return</span> total<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span><p><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <br><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <br><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <br><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>
<p>maintains iteration and running total state through assignments to <code>n</code> and <code>total</code>, respectively, with every iteration. An alternative implementation avoids mutation by returning the iteration and running total state from an iteration function,</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>factorial</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> <span>iterate</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>total<span>,</span> i</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>i <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> total<span>;</span><br>    <span>return</span> <span>iterate</span><span>(</span>total <span>*</span> i<span>,</span> i <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>iterate</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> n<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span><p><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <br><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <br><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <br><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>
<p>which may be used by the same function to calculate the next values in the next iteration.</p>
<p>Stateful functional programs can be constructed in a similar fashion — state that is returned from the previous turn of some larger, iterative “program” function becomes the starter state for the next — with one caveat. With <em>synchronous</em> iteration, results of the previous run can simply be passed to the next. The <code>total</code> result from <code>factorial</code> iteration, for example, is passed directly to the next. In a JavaScript web application, however, events are initiated <em>asynchronously</em> as the user interacts with the page, calling callbacks bound to such events, which run pieces of the program so encoded.</p>
<pre><code>event → callback → javascript<br>event → callback → javascript<br>...</code></pre>
<p>Communication between <em>asynchronous</em> scripts is performed through shared references. One script updates (mutates!) a place in memory from which another script may later read. Look no further than the object-oriented ATM program above for a concrete example. A user may begin the program by first selecting a withdrawal amount, <em>then</em> clicking withdraw:</p>
<pre><code>select → onchange → "withdrawalAmount.set(value)"<br>click → onclick → "bankAccount.withdraw(withdrawalAmount.get())"<br>...</code></pre>
<p>The “click withdraw” script occurs asynchronously sometime after the “select withdrawal amount” script has completed. Communication between the two scripts occurs through shared reference to the <code>amount</code> variable underlying the <code>withdrawalAmount</code> object. Calls to <code>withdrawalAmount.get()</code> will return updates by <code>withdrawalAmount.set(value)</code>, notwithstanding the asynchrony of such reads and writes.</p>
<p>Synchronous functions can communicate by simply passing around results. The result from one function becomes the input of another. Asynchronous scripts, by contrast, share a mutable place in memory instead of the values themselves. Consequently, we must also share a mutable place in memory to communicate between asynchronous scripts in the functional program implementation. On the other hand, with a light amount of infrastructure, we can usher such imperative code to the application perimeter and carve out space for a functional core, creating a “<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell">functional core, imperative shell</a>.”</p>

<p>The program now consists of functions <code>parseInt</code> and <code>withdraw</code>, called against specific events <code>WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT</code> and <code>WITHDRAW</code>. The state of the program has not been reflected directly into distinct objects. Instead, a <code>program</code> <em>function</em> is called with the state resulting from the previous call, together with event data from any user interaction, in order to produce the starter state for the next. <code>program</code> resembles an iterative, recursive function. Yet, calls to <code>program</code> occur asynchronously. Just as with the object-oriented ATM program, a user may begin the functional ATM program by first selecting a withdrawal amount, <em>then</em> clicking withdraw:</p>
<pre><code>select → onchange → "store.publish('WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT', {amount:value})"<br>click → onclick → "store.publish('WITHDRAW')"<br>...</code></pre>
<p>The imperative shell (i.e the <code>store</code>) maintains a reference to the <code>state</code> resulting from the previous call to <code>program</code>, in order to pass such <code>state</code> to the next, orchestrating communication between asynchronous calls to <code>program</code>.</p>
<h3 id="time-as-a-series-of-states">Time as a Series of States <a href="#time-as-a-series-of-states">#</a></h3>
<p>Unlike object-oriented programming, functional programming provides no model for traditional time. Mathematical functions are time<em>less</em>. Computation of a function <code>f(x)</code> a “second time” with the same argument will produce the same result <em>whenever</em> computed; a mathematical statement …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-804565543489245500" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
Ten years ago I wrote an essay entitled "<a href="http://blog.rongarret.info/2009/04/on-shadow-photons-and-real-unicorns.html">The Trouble with Shadow Photons</a>" describing a problem with the dramatic narrative of what is commonly called the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">many-worlds</a>" interpretation of quantum mechanics (but which was originally and IMHO more appropriately called the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-everett/">"relative state" interpretation</a>) as presented by David Deutsch in his (otherwise excellent) book, "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Reality-Parallel-Universes-Implications/dp/014027541X">The Fabric of Reality</a>." &nbsp;At the end of that essay I noted in an update:</p><blockquote>
Deutsch just referred me to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0104033">this paper</a> which is the more formal formulation of his multiple-worlds theory. I must confess that on a cursory read it seems to be a compelling argument. So I may have to rethink this whole thing.</blockquote><p>
That paper is entitled "The Structure of the Multiverse" and its abstract is delightfully succinct. &nbsp;I quote it here in its entirety:</p><blockquote>
The structure of the multiverse is determined by information flow.</blockquote><p>
Those of you who have been following my quantum adventures know that I am a big fan of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605039">information theory</a>, so I was well primed to resonate with Deutsch's theory. &nbsp;And I did resonate with it (and still do). &nbsp;Deutsch's argument was compelling (and still is). &nbsp;Nonetheless, I never wrote a followup for two reasons. &nbsp;First, something was still bothering me about the argument, though I couldn't really put my finger on it. &nbsp;Yes, Deutsch's argument was compelling, but on the other hand, so was <i>my</i> argument (at least to me). &nbsp;The difference seemed to me (as many things in QM interpretations do) a matter of taste, so it seemed pointless to elaborate. &nbsp;And second, I didn't think anyone reading this blog would really care. &nbsp;So I tabled it.</p><p>

But last May the comment thread in the original post was <a href="http://blog.rongarret.info/2009/04/on-shadow-photons-and-real-unicorns.html?showComment=1557643236813#c2552691848293595110">awakened from its slumber</a> by a fellow named <a href="https://elliottemple.com/">Elliot Temple</a>. &nbsp;The subsequent exchange led me to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9906015">this paper</a>, of which I was previously unaware. &nbsp;Here's the abstract, again, in its entirety:</p><blockquote>
The probabilistic predictions of quantum theory are conventionally obtained from a special probabilistic axiom. &nbsp;But that is unnecessary because all the practical consequences of such predictions follow from the remaining, non-probabilistic, axioms of quantum theory, together with the non-probabilistic part of classical decision theory.</blockquote><p>
The "special probabilistic axiom" to which Deutsch refers is called the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule">Born rule</a> (named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born">Max Born</a>). &nbsp;The "remaining, non-probabilistic axioms of quantum theory" comprises mainly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Schrödinger equation</a>. &nbsp;(To condense things a bit I'll occsaionally refer to these as the BR and the SE.)</p><p>

The process of applying quantum mechanics to real-world situations consists of two steps: first you solve the SE. &nbsp;The result is something called a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function">wave function</a>". &nbsp;Then you apply the BR to the wave function and what pops out is a set of probabilities for various possible results of the experiment you're doing. &nbsp;Following this procedure yields astonishingly accurate results: no experiment has ever been done whose outcome is at odds with its predictions. &nbsp;The details don't matter. &nbsp;What matters is: there's this procedure. &nbsp;It yields incredibly accurate predictions. &nbsp;It consists of two parts. &nbsp;One part is deterministic, the other part isn't.</p><p>

This naturally raises the question of <i>why</i> this procedure works as well as it does. &nbsp;In particular, why does the procedure have two parts? &nbsp;And why does it only yield probabilities? &nbsp;Answering these questions is the business of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics">interpretations</a>" of quantum mechanics. &nbsp;Wikipedia lists almost twenty of these. &nbsp;The fact that after nearly 100 years no consensus has emerged as to which one is correct gives you some idea of the thorniness of this problem.</p><p>

So the paper that Elliot referred me to was potentially a Big Deal. &nbsp;It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the breakthrough this would be. &nbsp;It would show that there are not in fact two disparate parts to the theory, there is only one: the SE. &nbsp;Such a unification would be of the same order of magnitude as the discovery of relativity. &nbsp;It would be headline news. &nbsp;David Deutsch would be a Nobel Laureate, on a par with Newton and Einstein. &nbsp;But the fact that there is still an active debate over the issue shows that Deutsch's claim has not been universally accepted. &nbsp;So there would seem to be only two possibilities: either Deutsch is wrong, or he's right and the rest of the physics community has failed to recognize it.</p><p>

Normally when a claim of a major result like this fails to be recognized by the community it's because the claim is wrong. &nbsp;In fact, more than 99% of the time it's because the claimant is a crackpot. &nbsp;But Deutsch is no crackpot. &nbsp;He's a foundational figure in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing">quantum computing</a>. &nbsp;He discovered the first <a href="http://www.cs.xu.edu/~kinne/quantum/deutche.html">quantum algorithm</a>. &nbsp;Even if he got something wrong he very likely got it wrong in a very interesting way.</p><p>

So I decided to do a deep dive into this. &nbsp;It led me down quite the little rabbit hole. &nbsp;There are a number of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9907024">published</a> <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2716/">critiques</a> of Deutsch's work, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211104">counter-critiques</a> critiquing the critiques, and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nous.12072">counter-counter-critiques</a>. &nbsp;They're all quite technical. &nbsp;It took me a couple of months of steady effort to sort it all out, and that only with the kind of help of a couple of people who understand all this stuff much better than I do. &nbsp;(Many thanks to Tim Maudlin, David Wallace, and especially the patient, knowledgeable, and splendidly-pseudonymed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ididnoteatyourcat/">/u/ididnoteatyourcat</a> on Reddit.)</p><p>

In the rest of this post I'm going to try to describe the result of going down that rabbit hole in a way that is accessible to what I think is the majority of the audience of this blog. &nbsp;The TL;DR is that Deutsch's argument depends on at least one assumption that is open to legitimate doubt. &nbsp;Figuring out what that assumption is isn't easy, and whether or not the assumption is actually untrue is arguable. &nbsp;That's the reason that Deutsch hasn't won his Nobel yet.</p><p>

I have to start with a review of the rhetoric of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">many-worlds interpretation</a> of quantum mechanics (MWI). &nbsp;The rhetoric says that when you do a quantum measurement it is simply not the case that it has a single outcome. &nbsp;Instead, what happens is that the universe "splits" into multiple parts when a measurement is performed, and so <i>all</i> of the possible outcomes of an experiment actually happen as a matter of physical fact. &nbsp;The reason you only perceive a single outcome is that you yourself split into multiple copies. &nbsp;Each copy of you perceives a single outcome, but the sum total of all the "you's" that have been created collectively perceive all the possible outcomes.</p><p>

I used the word "rhetoric" above because, as we shall see, there is a disconnect between what I have just written and the math. &nbsp;To be fair to Deutsch, his rhetoric is different from what I have written above, and it more closely matches the math. &nbsp;Instead of "splitting", on Deutsch's view the universe "peels apart" (that's my terminology) in "waves of differentiation" (that is Deutsch's terminology) rather than "splitting" (that is everyone else's terminology) but this is a detail. &nbsp;The point is that at the end of a process that involves you doing a quantum measurement with N possible outcomes, there are, again in point of actual physical fact, N "copies" of you (Deutsch uses the word "doppelgänger").</p><p>

Again, to be fair to Deutsch, he acknowledges that this is not quite correct:</p><blockquote>
Universes, histories, particles and their instances <i>are not referred to by quantum theory at all</i> – any more than are planets, and human beings and their lives and loves. Those are all approximate, emergent phenomena in the multiverse. &nbsp;[The Beginning of Infinity, p292, emphasis added.]</blockquote><p>
All of the difficulty, it will turn out, hinges on the fidelity of the approximation. &nbsp;But let us ignore this for now and look at Deutsch's argument.</p><p>

Deutsch attempts to capture the idea of probability in a deterministic theory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a>, that is, by looking at how a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent">rational agent</a> should act, applying a few reasonable-looking assumptions about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">utility function</a>, and showing that a rational agent operating under the MWI would act <i>exactly as if </i>they were using the Born rule. &nbsp;The argument is long and technical, but it can be summarized very simply.</p><p>

[Note to nit-pickers: this simplified argument is in fact a straw man because it is based on the assumption that branch counting is a legitimate rational strategy, which is actually false on the Deutsch-Wallace view. &nbsp;But since the conclusion I am going to reach is the same as Deutsch's I consider this legitimate rhetorical and literary license because the target audience here is mainly non-technical.]</p><p>

For simplicity, let's consider only the case of doing an experiment with two possible outcomes (let's call them A and B). &nbsp;The game-theoretical setup is this: you are going to place a bet on either A or B and then do the experiment. &nbsp;If the outcome matches your choice, you win $1, otherwise you lose $1.</p><p>

If the experiment is set up in such a way that the quantum-mechanical odds of each outcome are the same (i.e. 50-50) then there is no conflict between the orthodox Born-rule-based approach and the MWI: in both cases, the agent has no reason to prefer betting on one outcome over the other. &nbsp;The only difference is the rationale that each agent would offer: one would say, "The Born rule says the odds are even so I don't care which I choose" and the other would say, "I am going to split into two and one of me is going to experience one outcome (and win $1) and the other of me is going to experience the other outcome (and lose $1), and that will be situation no matter whether I choose A or B, so I don't care which I choose."</p><p>

[Aside: Deutsch goes through a great deal more complicated argument to prove this result because it is based on an assumption that Deutsch rejects. &nbsp;In fact, he goes on from there to put in a great deal more effort to extend this result to an experiment with N possible outcomes, all of which have equal probabilities under the Born rule. &nbsp;He has to do this because my argument is based on a tacit assumption that Deutsch rejects. &nbsp;We'll get to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>It goes without saying that 2020 has been an unforgettable and challenging year for many. For Jina AI, 2020 has a different, more positive meaning: <strong>It is the year Jina was born and first introduced to the global open-source community</strong>.</p>

<p>In February, our founders came together with a vision of melding machine learning, search and open source, seeing the challenge and potential in <a href="https://hanxiao.io/2020/02/18/I-Quitted-Tencent-AI-and-Raised-M-to-Build-the-Next-Neural-Search-Company-in-Opensource/">building the definitive open-source neural search framework</a>.</p>

<p>From our first release in May 2020 through to December 2020, we have shipped <strong>over 100 releases</strong>, with our major release of 0.9.0 on the horizon. While Jina is still under heavy development and progressing steadily towards 1.0, weâ€™re constantly engaging with a broader audience from the open-source and machine-learning communities.</p>

<p>This engagement has been growing steadily over time:</p>

<h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>

<p>As of December, <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/jina">Jinaâ€™s Core repository</a> has <strong>over 22,000 lines of Python code</strong>. Itâ€™s an impressive feat, yet it doesnâ€™t tell the whole story. What really makes this number meaningful is how weâ€™ve worked together to achieve our product and community milestones:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jina.ai/assets/images/blog/2020review-milestones.png">
    <figcaption>Jina 2020 Milestones</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Over the past year, Jina has grown from an initial neural search structure to a powerful multi-modal and cross-modal foundation which lets businesses and developers build their own search systems and enjoy the advancement of neural-network enabled search capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="community-and-impact">Community and Impact</h3>

<p>Since day one, weâ€™ve been committed to the culture of open source software (OSS). Although Jina is maintained by a full-time engineering team, we believe <strong>community is the key to successful open-source software</strong>. We constantly seek out ways to work with other open-source projects and pull out all the stops to support our community members building their own Jina projects.</p>

<p>To date, weâ€™ve attracted close to <strong>100 contributors</strong>, and about <strong>20%</strong> of our pull requests come from our community. This is reflected in our community Slack channel, where we provide support to <strong>over 300 members</strong>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jina.ai/assets/images/blog/2020review-community-2.png">
    <figcaption>Jina Core Community Metrics</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Weâ€™ve also integrated with other open-source projects like <a href="https://chatbotslife.com/jina-ai-with-rasa-1e81a8b869cc">Rasa</a>, <a href="">Streamlit</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/jina-ai/terraform-jina-b9217b8b4552?source=friends_link&amp;sk=d4dd21938ecb1c9d2720c44569bf590e">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/examples/blob/master/jupyter-notebook-integration/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, and <a href="https://hanxiao.io/2020/10/28/Mindspore-powered-Neural-Search-in-Jina/">Mindspore</a>. In September, Artur Tanona built Jinaâ€™s first community project, <a href="https://github.com/ArturTan/transformers-for-lawyers">a neural search implementation for the legal sector</a>. And in November, we kicked-off our first Early Adopter Program and began discussions with over a dozen candidates from individuals to startups to established enterprises.</p>

<h3 id="company">Company</h3>

<p>Jina AI was founded in February 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic and economic slowdown. This couldnâ€™t stop the march of the Jina team however. As one of the fastest-growing COSS startups, we have successfully closed <strong>two rounds of funding totalling over $7 million in just 6 months</strong>. This has also hit the record for early-stage COSS companies fundraising in the enterprise technology sector.</p>

<p>To date, our team has grown from three founders to a distributed team of over 20, with <strong>60% of the team focused on product development and engineering</strong>. Our team is inclusive and diverse, with members from 7+ different countries and a modern structure that fits the culture of open-source and borderless development.</p>

<p>We have initiatives in place to improve our company culture, and weâ€™re always on the lookout for <a href="http://jobs.jina.ai/">new hires</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2021">2021</h3>

<p>As we look back on our achievements, we know that 2020 is just the beginning of our journey, with the new challenges and breakthroughs of 2021 just around the corner.</p>

<p>For our product and community, our 2021 focuses will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Major release of 1.0 in 2021 Q1</li>
  <li>Engaging with Jinaâ€™s early adopters</li>
  <li>Improving developer (learning) experience</li>
  <li>Extending cloud support</li>
  <li>Increasing visibility in the open-source community</li>
</ul>

<p>Weâ€™ll keep building our team and we welcome those who share our belief in open source to <a href="http://jobs.jina.ai/">join our journey</a> to build the next generation of search frameworks.</p>

<h3 id="thank-you">Thank You!</h3>

<p>Last but not least, weâ€™d like to give thanks to all of our contributors, our community members, our friends at Deepset.ai, Streamlit, Philipp Vollet, our investors (GGV Capital, Yunqi Partners, and SAP.iO), and of course, our amazing team members. Thank you all for your support! Without you, Jina wouldnâ€™t be what it is today.</p>

	<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>You might have come across <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/judea-pearl/the-book-of-why/9780465097609/">Judea Pearl's new book</a>, and a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-build-truly-intelligent-machines-teach-them-cause-and-effect-20180515/">related interview</a> which was widely shared in my social bubble. In the interview, Pearl dismisses most of what we do in ML as curve fitting. While I believe that's an overstatement (conveniently ignores RL for example), it's a nice reminder that most productive debates are often triggered by controversial or outright arrogant comments. Calling machine learning alchemy was a great recent example. After reading the article, I decided to look into his famous do-calculus and the topic causal inference once <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>Again, because this happened to me semi-periodically. I first learned do-calculus in a (very unpopular but advanced) undergraduate course Bayesian networks. Since then, I have re-encountered it every 2-3 years in various contexts, but somehow it never really struck a chord. I always just thought "this stuff is difficult and/or impractical" and eventually forgot about it and moved on. I never realized how fundamental this stuff was, until now.</p>
<p>This time around, I think I fully grasped the significance of causal reasoning and I turned into a full-on believer. I know I'm late to the game but I almost think it's basic hygiene for people working with data and conditional probabilities to understand the basics of this toolkit, and I feel embarrassed for completely ignoring this throughout my career.</p>
<p>In this post I'll try to explain the basics, and convince you why you should think about this, too. If you work on deep learning, that's an even better reason to understand this. Pearl's comments may be unhelpful if interpreted as contrasting deep learning with causal inference. Rather, you should interpret it as highlighting causal inference as a huge, relatively underexplored, application of deep learning. Don't get discouraged by causal diagrams looking a lot like Bayesian networks (not a coincidence seeing they were both pioneered by Pearl) they don't compete with, they complement deep learning.</p>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>First of all, causal calculus differentiates between two types of conditional distributions one might want to estimate. <strong>tldr</strong>: in ML we usually estimate only one of them, but in some applications we should actually try to or have to estimate the other one.</p>
<p>To set things up, let's say we have i.i.d. data sampled from some joint $p(x,y,z,\ldots)$. Let's assume we have lots of data and the best tools (say, deep networks) to fully estimate this joint distribution, or any property, conditional or marginal distribution thereof. In other words, let's assume $p$ is known and tractable. Say we are ultimately interested in how variable $y$ behaves given $x$. At a high level, one can ask this question in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>observational $p(y\vert x)$: What is the distribution of $Y$ given that I <strong>observe</strong> variable $X$ takes value $x$. This is what we usually estimate in supervised machine learning. It is a conditional distribution which can be calculated from $p(x,y,z,\ldots)$ as a ratio of two of its marginals. $p(y\vert x) = \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)}$. We're all very familiar with this object and also know how to estimate this from data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interventional $p(y\vert do(x))$: What is the distribution of $Y$ if I were to <strong>set</strong> the value of $X$ to $x$. This describes the distribution of $Y$ I would observe if I intervened in the data generating process by artificially forcing the variable $X$ to take value $x$, but otherwise simulating the rest of the variables according to the original process that generated the data. (note that the data generating procedure is NOT the same as the joint distribution $p(x,y,z,\ldots)$ and this is an important detail).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arenttheythesamething">Aren't they the same thing?</h2>
<p>No. $p(y\vert do(x))$ and $p(y\vert x)$ are not generally the same, and you can verify this with several simple thought experiments. Say, $Y$ is the pressure in my espresso machine's boiler which ranges roughly between $0$ and $1.1$ bar depending on how long it's been turned on. Let $X$ be the reading of the built-in barometer. Let's say we jointly observe X and Y at random times. Assuming the barometer functions properly $p(y|x)$ should be a unimodal distribution centered around $x$, with randomness due to measurement noise. However, $p(y|do(x))$ won't actually depend on the value of $x$ and is generally the same as $p(y)$, the marginal distribution of boiler pressure. This is because artificially setting my barometer to a value (say, by moving the needle) won't actually cause the pressure in the tank to go up or down.</p>
<p>In summary, $y$ and $x$ are correlated or statistically dependent and therefore seeing $x$ allows me to predict the value of $y$, but $y$ is not caused by $x$ so setting the value of $x$ won't effect the distribution of $y$. Hence, $p(y\vert x)$ and $p(y\vert do(x))$ behave very differently. This simple example is just the tip of the iceberg. The differences between interventional and observational conditionals can be a lot more nuanced and hard to characterize when there are lots of variables with complex interactions.</p>
<h2 id="whichonedoiwant">Which one do I want?</h2>
<p>Depending on the application you want to solve, you should seek to estimate one of these conditionals. If your ultimate goal is diagnosis or forecasting (i.e. observing a naturally occurring $x$ and inferring the probable values of $y$) you want the observational conditional $p(y\vert x)$. This is what we already do in supervised learning, this is what Judea Pearl called curve fitting. This is all good for a range of important applications such as classification, image segmentation, super-resolution, voice transcription, machine translation, and many more.</p>
<p>In applications where you ultimately want to control or choose $x$ based on the conditional you estimated, you should seek to estimate $p(y\vert do(x))$ instead. For example, if $x$ is a medical treatment and $y$ is the outcome, you are not merely interested in observing a naturally occurring treatment $x$ and predicting the outcome, we want to <em>proactively choose</em> the treatment $x$ given our understanding of how it effects the outcome $y$. Similar situations occur in system identification, control and online recommender systems.</p>
<h2 id="whatexactlyispyvertdox">What exactly is $p(y\vert do(x))$?</h2>
<p>This is perhaps the main concept I haven't grasped before. $p(y\vert do(x))$ is in fact a vanilla conditional distribution, but it's not computed based on $p(x,z,y,\ldots)$, but a different joint $p_{do(X=x)}(x,z,y,\ldots)$ instead. This $p_{do(X=x)}$ is the joint distribution of data which we would observe if we actually carried out the intervention in question.  $p(y\vert do(x))$ is the conditional distribution we would learn from data collected in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial">randomized controlled trials</a> or A/B tests where the experimenter controls $x$. Note that actually carrying out the intervention or randomized trials may be impossible or at least impractical or unethical in many situations. You can't do an A/B test forcing half your subjects to smoke weed and the other half to smoke placebo to understand the effect on marijuana on their health. Even if you can't directly estimate $p(y\vert do(x))$ from randomized experiments, the object still exists. The main point of causal inference and do-calculus is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I cannot measure $p(y\vert do(x))$ directly in a randomized controlled trial, can I estimate it based on data I observed outside of a controlled experiment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's start with a diagram that shows what's going on if we only care about $p(y\vert x)$, i.e. the simple supervised learning case:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inference.vc/content/images/2018/05/Causality-0_-just-observational.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let's say we observe 3 variables, $x, z, y$, in this order. Data is sampled i.i.d. from some observable joint distribution over 3 variables, denoted by the blue factor graph labelled 'observable joint'. If you don't know what a factor graph is, it's not important, the circles represent random variables, the little square represents a joint distribution of the variables it's connected to. We are interested in predicting $y$ from $x$, and say that $z$ is a third variable which we do not want to infer but we can also measure (I included this for completeness). The observational conditional $p(y\vert x)$ is calculated from this joint via simple conditioning. From the training data we can build a model $q(y\vert x;\theta)$ to approximate this conditional, for example using a deep net minimizing cross-entropy or whatever.</p>
<p>Now, what if we're actually interested in $p(y\vert do(x))$ rather than $p(y\vert x)$? This is what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inference.vc/content/images/2018/05/Causality-2_-two-distros.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, we still have the blue observed joint and data is still sampled from this joint. However, the object we wish to estimate is on the bottom right, the red intervention conditional $p(y\vert do(x))$. This is related to the intervention joint which is denoted by the red factor graph above it. It's a joint distribution over the same domain as $p$ but it's a different distribution. If we could sample from this red distribution (e.g. actually run a randomized controlled trial where we get to pick $x$), the problem would be solved by simple supervised learning. We could generate data from the red joint, and estimate a model directly from there. However, we assume this is not possible, and all we have is data sampled from the blue joint. We have to see if we can somehow estimate the red conditional $p(y\vert do(x))$ from the blue joint.</p>
<h3 id="causalmodels">Causal models</h3>
<p>If we want to establish a connection between the blue and the red joints, <em>we must</em> introduce additional assumptions about the causal structure of the data generating mechanism. The only way we can make predictions about how our distribution changes as a consequence of an interaction is if we know how the variables are causally related. This information about causal relationships is not captured in the joint distribution alone. We have to introduce something more expressive than that. Here is how what this looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inference.vc/content/images/2018/05/Causality_-building-a-bridge--1-.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition to the observable joint we now also have a causal model of the world (top left) This causal model contains more detail than the joint distribution: it knows not …</p></article></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he Karawari river valley in Papua New Guinea is not, from a business perspective, an obvious place to build a cell tower. The remote region is home to a fractured community of 16 villages and tribal groups that include approximately 15,000 people. It’s difficult to access, even harder to build in, and situated about a hundred miles from any kind of electrical grid. There is no modern sanitation. There are no health services to speak of, nor are there any banks. The majority of food and building materials are extracted from the land, and almost all hard cash is brought in by young men returning from work in downriver towns. Nevertheless, in 2014, Digicel, a maverick telecom company headquartered in Jamaica, decided to break ground on a tower in Karawari.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nobody had any illusions that the tower would generate much revenue, if any at all. Yet to Digicel, the project served a different purpose: It was part of a corporate mission to put some of the world’s last disconnected cultures on the digital map. Nearly a decade on, even as the company’s unorthodox strategy has led to its collapse in various international markets, Digicel is hanging on to Papua New Guinea as a rare instance of success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company arrived in Papua New Guinea in 2007, following a decision from the National Executive Committee (effectively the country’s cabinet) to open up the market in mobile phone services. By then, Digicel had over two million customers across 16 Caribbean countries and had started expanding into the Pacific islands. Papua New Guinea, meanwhile, had previously been covered only by the state-run networks Telikom PNG and its subsidiary Bmobile. “Covered,” however, is something of an overstatement. Before 2007, less than 3% of the island’s population of 6.6 million had access to a fixed network or mobile phones, and even then only in urban centers. This was partly because of corruption and mismanagement — at one point, Telikom PNG went through six managing directors in 11 months — but also because of logistical challenges. Papua New Guinea has an average annual income of less than $2,500 per person and a largely rural population, and its civil infrastructure currently ranks 155th on the Human Development Index.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then there’s its geography. Situated in the Western Pacific, just north of tropical Australia and south of thousands of miles of open ocean, Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern half of New Guinea, the world’s second-largest island, as well as a vast archipelago of more than 600 islets and islands. It encompasses a mind-boggling array of cultures and languages: around 1,000 different tongues — one-eighth of the world’s total — are spoken there. This is mostly the result of its gauntlet landscape: mountain valleys, sheer limestone cliffs, and endless rainforest swamp. “Think of building a network in a country the size of France with hundreds of islands, no roads, and cerebral malaria,” Digicel’s Irish CEO Denis O’Brien once told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/denis-obrien-irelands-version-of-mexicos-carlos-slim-sells-mobile-to-the-masses/2013/11/29/bee52bbc-56c9-11e3-ba82-16ed03681809_story.html"><em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em></a>. Or as Simon Lardner, chief technical officer of Challenge Networks, the firm Digicel contracted to build its towers in Papua New Guinea, explained in terms more pertinent to network engineers, “PNG is hilly and full of trees.”</p>



<p>Yet the challenges of working in the region were a good fit for the company’s high-risk, high-reward strategy. Whereas most providers long ago capitulated to the trend of offering mobile contract packages, locking customers into rates for months or years at a time, Digicel has taken a different approach since its founding in 2001, relying on the pay-as-you-go model. (These dynamics are described in detail in a 2018 book, <a href="https://press.anu.edu.au/publications/series/pacific/moral-economy-mobile-phones"><em>The Moral Economy of Mobile Phones</em></a><em>.</em>) This is especially well suited to countries without extensive banking systems, as customers can buy minutes when they have cash in hand. As of September 2009, more than 91% of Digicel subscribers used its service on a prepaid basis. This model also allows the company to set a per-minute rate that is far higher than it would be if folded into a rolling contract.</p>



<p>In rural Papua New Guinea, most users prefer to purchase small amounts over and over again rather than buying bigger bundles, even if the latter is better value. This is because if somebody has too much credit, friends and family will ask them to share (something that Digicel’s service allows customers to do easily). It’s comparable to how people in the Karawari never entirely fill the tanks of their motor canoes, but rather ask everyone they pick up to bring a little petrol with them on board.</p>



<p>According to experts who study Digicel, the wider thinking is that in developing countries, where interpersonal relationships are paramount, the company can win trust by positioning itself as a moral actor. Digicel representatives declined <em>Rest of World</em>’s repeated requests for an interview; current employees didn’t respond. In the South Pacific, Digicel rolled out a strategy that had served it well in the Caribbean: massive investment in public spending. When the company first showed up in Papua New Guinea, Deane Woruba, first secretary to the Governor of the country’s East Sepik province, where Karawari is located, recalls, “they painted the town red.” Digicel billboards went up everywhere, branded clothing was handed out, community organizations received grants from the Digicel Foundation. The company flooded the market with thousands of $6-a-pop mobile handsets and a seductive selection of prepaid packages, including hourly and nighttime contracts that incentivized after-hours use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within five months, the company had more than 350,000 customers, and by the end of the first year, it had built 130 towers in what rivals described as a land grab. By 2009, Digicel’s market share was above 80% — a bench mark it hasn’t dipped below since. “They had really good service,” Woruba explained. There was a lot of excitement that the rollout “was going to change how people lived, and it did!” That enthusiasm was widespread: a cell tower was printed on the country’s 100 Kina note, and in an impassioned speech the year Digicel arrived, the minister for public enterprise promised that telecommunications would transform society by “providing opportunities for businesses, opening access to the global marketplace, delivering a wealth of information, enhancing social interaction, [and] enabling greater community participation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point, it might have seemed as though Papua New Guinea’s future depended on Digicel. Ironically, the reverse would prove true.</p>

<p><strong>Almost from the</strong> beginning, expanded connectivity transformed Papua New Guinea society in a host of different ways — some anticipated, others not. Regina Lius, an accountant from the maritime province of Milne Bay now living in the capital of Port Moresby, explained how Digicel suddenly made it easy for her to communicate with family. “Even if they’re out in the open sea,” she said, “I can get in touch with them.” But Lius, like many others in Papua New Guinea, struggled to afford the rates. “It’s about $1.40 for one GB, which lasts three days,” she complained. In a country where the average income is less than $200 a month, that’s a significant cost. To make services more accessible, Digicel introduced a feature that enabled customers to send credit to other people’s phones so they could remain connected in lean months. This had the side effect of creating a secondary tier of economic exchange, with phone credit flowing into rural areas. As electronic banking in Papua New Guinea remains underdeveloped, it became a form of currency, a way of cementing old relationships and forging new ones.</p>



<p>Before long, it also became a common practice on a quiet night, when rates are lowest, to dial numbers at random and make friends with whoever picks up. Many of these “phone friendships” are based on embellishments and outright lies; after all, a phone call is an opportunity for people to escape not only their physical space but their real lives. Sometimes this leads to unfortunate outcomes. There are many stories of Papuans making perilous trips across the country to meet phone friends with whom they established a romantic connection. These frequently end in heartbreak when it turns out that one party has been spinning more elaborate falsehoods than the other. But not always: “My aunty met her partner over a random phone call,” Lius giggled, “and then they eloped. Quite funny.”</p>



<p>Assessing Digicel’s impact according to more concrete metrics, Papua New Guinea’s economy has expanded at a steady rate of around 4% per year since the mid-2000s. While it’s impossible to say how much of that is due to improved connectivity, according to the <a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/79060/43929-014-png-xarr.pdf">Asian Development Bank</a>, the company’s arrival did have a strong initial impact: the telecoms sector contributed to a spike in GDP growth of up to 21% in 2008 and 2009. Still, improved telecommunications have not been a magic bullet for persistent poverty and social problems. The country ranked 137th out of 180 countries in the 2019 <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2019">Corruption Perceptions Index</a>, and Port Moresby is often cited among the world’s most dangerous cities. As well as aiding the police and other government services, mobile phone networks have been used by gangs to orchestrate armed robberies and vandalism, and to spread low-level warfare across the island.</p>

<p>User personas are controversial.</p>

<p>They’re built with great intentions, and then break down. People aren’t sure how to create them. They sit in drawers and hang on the wall, forgotten or ignored.</p>

<p>But personas can be very beneficial <em>if</em> they’re created and used properly.</p>

<p>Here are a few reasons why your personas may be failing, and some fixes to turn them into a useful resource.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-problem-with-personas">What’s the problem with personas?</h2>

<p>The issue isn’t with the tool itself, it’s the fact that they have been misunderstood and misused over the years. Product teams have gotten tired of the bad experiences that come with this.</p>

<p>The main cause of the problems is that <em>design</em> personas get mixed up with <em>marketing</em> personas. Sales departments were using personas long before we were, and the two types got jumbled together.</p>

<p>But the two don’t mix<span>—</span>they serve different purposes. Marketing focuses on info that isn’t useful for designers or is downright distracting. Product people don’t just want to know the <strong>what</strong>, we want to know the <strong>why</strong>.</p>

<p>Take this example: “Jill is a Wisconsin soccer mom with three kids in an upper-middle-class income bracket who is the PTA president.” That persona might help the sales team know how to target Jill, but it doesn’t help the design team make a good product for her.</p>

<p>We need to untangle marketing persona practices from UX personas, and help product teams use them correctly.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices">Best practices</h2>

<p>Here are a few principles that will help you steer your personas in the right direction.</p>

<h3 id="discover-from-research">Discover from research</h3>

<p>Too often, personas are based on whims and guesses instead of <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/user-research-is-it-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> (I’m looking at you, proto-personas).</p>

<p>Actionable, accurate, useful personas are <em>discovered</em>, not <em>created</em>. They are a result of research. They’re a data visualization. You don’t begin with personas, you gather and analyze research to see where personas emerge.</p>

<p>If we don’t have the data, we don’t make a persona. We can use something else to capture assumptions, like an <a href="https://www.playbookux.com/validate-your-assumptions-with-an-assumptions-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assumption map</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-personas/discover-from-research.svg" alt="Discover from research">
</figure>

<h3 id="add-only-relevant-useful-information">Add only relevant, useful information</h3>

<p>Personas should be short, digestible, and focused.</p>

<p>Every piece of information should have a purpose for being included. Only add data that directly affects the design process.</p>

<p>Lots of persona templates or examples have things like personality spectrums, favorite music, hobbies, and so on. These charts might look nice, but they’re usually unclear or irrelevant. A designer can’t get anything actionable from knowing that a persona got a 4 out of 5 on “Open to new experiences.”</p>

<p>Condense things down to avoid clutter and noise, and focus on data that matters. And remember you don’t have to rely on knowing someone’s favorite food to empathize with them (more on that later).</p>



<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-personas/only-relevant-info.svg" alt="Add only relevant, useful information">
</figure>

<h3 id="involve-everyone-in-making-them">Involve everyone in making them</h3>

<p>You may run into problems if you create your personas in a silo and then unveil them like a piece of artwork to be imposed on everybody.</p>

<p>Instead, get others involved. Everyone who is going to <em>use</em> the personas should be involved in <em>making</em> them. This builds a feeling of ownership and approval.</p>

<p>Invite teammates to sit in on research sessions. Get help brainstorming persona names. Keep the team updated on how the research is going and explain decisions. Figure out ways to get others involved until everyone is happy with the final product.</p>

</blockquote>

</figure>

<h3 id="include-psychographics-not-demographics">Include psychographics, not demographics</h3>

<p>Demographics are a carryover from marketing personas. In UX, what we’re really after is psychographics: <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental models</a>, motivations, pain points, attitudes, behaviors. Statistics like age, gender, ethnicity, and location do not cause thinking or behavior, so they have no bearing on the design process.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://medium.com/inclusive-software/describing-personas-af992e3fc527" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising movement</a> in the UX field to completely leave out <em>all</em> demographics from personas (unless your particular product is demographic-specific).</p>



<p>Demographics cause problems. Attributes like gender, age, and race trigger our brain to think in stereotypes and assumptions. It can even lead us to favor one persona over another.</p>

<p>In the past, demographics have been used to make personas feel more relatable and help us empathize with them. But as <a href="https://indiyoung.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indi Young</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To actually bring a description to life, to actually develop empathy, you need the deeper, underlying reasoning behind the preferences and statements-of-fact.</p>
</blockquote>

</figure>

<h3 id="limit-how-many-you-own">Limit how many you own</h3>

<p>A product team should only have a handful of personas. Having too many takes away their ability to become memorable or useful. We can aim for a ballpark of 3 to 5.</p>

<p>Having this low number requires that we use the right <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persona-scope/">scope</a>. Remember it’s better to paint with a broad brush and meet the needs of larger groups of users than try to account for every edge case. The goal of personas is to focus on the major needs of the largest and most important users.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-personas/how-many.svg" alt="Limit how many you have">
</figure>

<h3 id="use-them-properly">Use them properly</h3>

<p>Most people aren’t well educated on what personas are or how to use them, especially if they aren’t UX designers. So our job is to <em>lead by example</em>, and <em>teach others</em>.</p>

<p>Get a core group of advocates to help lead the charge. Teach people how to write user stories with personas in mind. Put them out where people can see them. Bring them up in design meetings and keep them in the narrative of your product. You want to get them off the paper and into the minds of your team so they come up organically.</p>

<p>It’s also important to know the limits of personas and educate others on what those limits are. They’re useful, but they’re only <em>one tool</em> in your tool belt. They don’t have all the answers, and they aren’t the right approach for every decision.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-personas/use-them-properly.svg" alt="Use them properly">
</figure>

<h3 id="update-them-over-time">Update them over time</h3>

<p>Our personas should be living, breathing representations, not stagnant, stale PDFs. You don’t make it once and then lock it away forever behind a glass door.</p>

<p>This means they need to change over time and adapt to research we perform. When new data comes in, we should update our personas according to what we’ve learned.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to proactively revisit and reprocess them every once in a while. It’s an ongoing project.</p>

    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-personas/update-over-time.svg" alt="Update them over time">
</figure>

<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-correctly-built-personas">What are the benefits of correctly-built personas?</h2>

<p>When you get personas right, they offer lots of benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Communicate research findings clearly and succinctly</strong>, especially to others on the team who weren’t able to be part of the research process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Give your whole team a central point of reference</strong> and a shared understanding and vocabulary about who you work for. Stay focused and avoid getting stuck in the weeds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Help you relate to and remember your users better.</strong> Our brains are wired to empathize with <a href="https://youtu.be/XnG4c4gXaQY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">individuals, not groups</a>. So using a collective noun (like saying, “the user”) prevents us from empathizing with our userbase. We can’t wrap our heads around a big group of people, but we instantly connect with one individual. When groups of users are represented by a persona, imagining what they would do is a lot easier than pouring over cold, hard, abstract data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make better decisions.</strong> When people start giving their assumptions and making guesses, you can go back to your research-backed persona to point out what really matters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Augment other types of research</strong>, like empathy maps, user scenarios, journey maps, user interviews, and <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/the-how-and-why-of-user-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user flows</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>The Now Habit</em> by Neil Fiore is a self-help book about understanding
and overcoming procrastination.
</p>

<p>
Procrastination is a mechanism to cope with the fear that is linked to the beginning
or the end of a task. Nobody is “lazy” on all fields of endeavor. You might not be able
to start the next chapter of your novel, but still do the required reading for your
college course.
</p>

<p>
A good way to start on managing procrastination is having a procrastination log where you jot down
the time, the activity, your thoughts and feelings, your excuse, your attempt of a solution
and your resulting thoughts and feelings.
</p>

<p>
The usual cycle of procrastination looks like this:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
You let the task at hand influence your happiness and self-worth.
</li>

<li>
You want to execute the task very well, so that your perfectionism is satisfied.
Thereby you increase your chance of failure by setting the bar very high.
</li>

<li>
You fear that you cannot meet the expectations you have imposed on yourself. You cannot act.
</li>

<li>
You avoid the problem by procrastinating.
</li>

<li>
Shortly before the deadline you <em>have</em> to do something. You do it, but not as well
as you could have, given the time allotted.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first step towards keeping procrastination at bay is to create safety. Failure must not
be the end of the world. You need to remember that many very successful people had big failures.
Your value as a person does not depend on the task.
</p>

<p>
A way to reduce the pressure you feel is to be mindful of language. Avoid “I must” and “I should”.
Try to think in terms of “I want to”, “I choose” and “I decide”.
</p>

<p>
A “should” means not being happy with a situation and deciding to do something about it.
It does not mean “I dislike the way it is and I'm going to complain”.
</p>

<p>
“I must finish” is not a helpful way of thinking. The better way is “When can I start?”.
Try to get things done at least partially, long before a deadline looms.
</p>

<p>
Partial work is an important aspect: you don't have to complete a big project in one sitting.
Bite a small, manageable chunk off and get that done. The project may be big, but it can be tackled
in smaller parts. Do a first draft. Or one test chapter. Maybe it even helps to do a first draft
sloppily on purpose and edit it afterwards.
</p>

<p>
“I must be perfect” is inhumane. You are allowed to be human. Learn from mistakes, respect boundaries.
Don't criticise yourself harshly. Have some compassion for yourself.
</p>

<p>
Take time off. Friends, Leisure time, your partner. They are important and healthy for you. Incorporate
leisure time and sports in your schedule. Don't let it be a secondary concern for “when you find the time”.
</p>

<p>
Imagine the concrete goal and the rewards. Let it pull you towards it. Don't think about the long way
till the goal, think about the way you've already behind yourself.
</p>

<p>
Don't get overwhelmed. You don't have to know the perfect starting point. You may take time to learn
and feel secure in your task. Don't bad-mouth your achievements and progress.
</p>

<p>
Plan in reverse and invent lots of smaller deadlines. Start with the externally imposed deadline.
Plan backwards what needs to be done to complete the task by that time. Plan intermediate steps
with their own, much shorter deadlines.
</p>

<p>
Channel your energy into actions to remove the threats that you fear.
</p>

<p>
Play through the worst case. What's the worst thing that can happen to you? Imagine what you could
do in such a situation. Are their alternatives? Are there maybe even upsides? How can you reduce
the probability of that worst case happening?
</p>

<p>
Sometimes people work on tasks pretty well and productively, but they never seem to finish a task.
Prolonging the almost-finished task takes up energy, as well. Just put that energy into finishing
and reap the rewards.
</p>

<p>
Excessive preparation before beginning a task is also just procrastination. Limit it and then just start.
If you really need research or other preparation, you will find out later.
</p>

<p>
Don't be discouraged by the seeming lack of progress after starting. It's often the case that the beginning
is the hardest and slowest part. The time spent in the first phase isn't lost, you've got a better
understanding of the problem and your task.
</p>

<p>
The fear that the demands of you will rise after successfully finishing the current job is irrational.
You will still have some autonomy to make an informed decision later. Don't fret about it now.  
</p>

<p>
If you feel that you need more time: are you sure that it isn't just perfectionism? Not everything
needs to be polished. Weigh the cost and benefit of working on it some more versus finishing it.
</p>

<p>
Use the “Unschedule”. The Unschedule is like a schedule, but it starts with you entering blocks
of recreational activities and leisure time. Only then do you enter your tasks, after you've worked
at least half an hour without interruption on them. This gives you a realistic overview of how much work
you can possibly tackle. Tasks are never scheduled, only recorded after the fact.
</p>

<p>
Aim for thirty minutes of uninterrupted, quality work. Take a break after that block.
</p>

<p>
Setbacks are inevitable. Look out for them. Observe yourself. What were your thoughts and feelings?
Why did you revert to your old ways? Make plans how to counter that in the future.
</p>

<p>
Drop goals that can neither be achieved nor started upon in the near future. Change your plans and
re-schedule it for a later time. Don't let that goal linger without any action towards completion.
</p>

January 5, 2021 | https://juxt.pro/blog/learn-you-a-cljs | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://juxt.pro/blog/learn-you-a-cljs">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>Clojure(Script) is a delightful language and learning it will make you look at familiar concepts in a completely different way. Its emphasis on data transformations gives you immense clarity in understanding a problem: code syntax fades away when you think about how the data flows through the system.</p>
<p>I recently started working on vanilla React projects, and it surprised me that some hard-earned lessons in the cljs ecosystem that I take for granted have not reached the wider React community. ClojureScript and React have been working together really well since the beginning, and cljs devs have scaled very complex UIs thanks to some tricks that I think will benefit everyone growing a React application.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at an example shall we, it will be easier to explain the concepts with some code running in front of your eyes. You want to create a simple component that fetches the Github repos for a given username. You open up your editor and quickly come up with something like this (well, probably looking prettier than this)</p>

<p>What’s the problem with it? Well, nothing really. A strong selling point of React is how well it adapts to different styles, whether functional or more object oriented. Here we just want to throw something together and seeing that it works, and the problem is simple enough that we don’t need anything more complex that a few stateful components.
But let’s imagine for a moment that we’re working on a bigger app, and, while still using the same example for simplicity’s sake, we want to scale things up a bit. Let’s hear what advice we can take from cljs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_️_1_keep_the_state_all_in_one_place"><a href="#_️_1_keep_the_state_all_in_one_place"></a>🗃️ (1) Keep the state all in one&nbsp;place</h2>
<div>
<p>That is probably the first thing you’re going to hear from any Clojure developer. Stateful components are notoriously harder to understand, debug and scale, precisely because they hide complexity inside them.
Here’s David Nolen, author of the hugely influential library om.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMtwq3QtddY?start=693" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Imagining the application state as one big "memory database" is what allowed concepts like <strong>Pure Components</strong>, <strong>Global Undo</strong>, and <strong>Time Travel Debugging</strong> to become popular.&nbsp;
Centralising app states greatly simplifies things. Think about it: would  you prefer to connect to one database or a hundred different databases?
We also start to see the idea of your components being nothing more than a function that maps data to UI.</p>

<p>In many React circles this idea quickly became popular and that’s how Redux came to be (inspired by Flux and The Elm Architecture) and is now part of React itself with the <code>useReducer</code> hook.
We can rewrite our simple example like so:</p>

<p>This also has the benefit of making the UI more modular: we can extract a <code>Form</code> component from the previous example because it can just use and update the state independently of other components.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_2_make_your_app_hot_reloadable"><a href="#_2_make_your_app_hot_reloadable"></a>🌶 (2) Make your app Hot Reloadable</h2>
<div>
<p>Years ago I used to build Android Apps and the OS had this mechanism called <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)"><code>onSaveInstanceState()</code></a> where Android asks every little piece of stateful UI: "hey, what’s your current state?" so that it can save it temporarily when your app is killed by the system. It is quite an annoying thing to implement. I even <a href="https://github.com/frankiesardo/icepick">wrote a library for it</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine how easy it would be for Android if the state of your app was all in one place. Implementing save &amp; restore would be one line of code. And that’s why ClojureScript had the first and still the best experience of Hot Module Reload that anyone has ever seen.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-kj2qwJa_E?start=476" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Hot Module Reload is not just about updating a function or two: it’s about <strong>changing the UI behaviour but preserving its state</strong>. Watch the talk and see what happens when Bruce Hauman changes the game logic as he plays it: if it doesn’t blow your mind, nothing ever will. Oh, and once you recover from the shock go ahead and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII">Bret Victor’s Inventing on principle</a> for other inspiring ideas. You’ll never go back to the old ways of working.</p>
<p>If you want to tweak the <code>RepoItem</code> view that we have in our example, every time you make a change you’ll need to fetch the repositories again, and you’ll quickly hit Github rate limits. Why can’t the UI stay on the <code>RepoItem</code> page while you work on it?</p>
<p>There are some solutions in React that enable a similar experience, but they’re <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/what-is-react-fast-refresh-f3d1e8401333">not quite there yet</a>, and it’s definitely not beginner friendly. Instead, every cljs project has hot reload enabled from the start.</p>
<p>We can hack something together quite easily if we write to local storage every time the state changes, and then read it from the storage on reload.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever strategy you use, I strongly suggest you have something, anything, in place that enables HMR without losing state, so that you can experience the joy of live reloading.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_3_surgically_update_components"><a href="#_3_surgically_update_components"></a>🎯 (3) Surgically update components</h2>
<div>
<p>Some of you might complain that passing the entire state down to the exact component that needs it takes a lot of work. And you will be right. It also forces all the root components to re-render whenever a leaf changes its properties.
That’s why all cljs libraries tried to come up with a solution that makes this approach more efficient: om had cursors, reagent had reactive atoms.</p>

<p>You want your components to react only to specific changes of the "memory database". The concept is similar to Materialised Views: they represent a particular view of the underlying database and they update only when the data they’re interested in changes.&nbsp;
I can’t find a talk from Mike Thompson, author of re-frame, but he convinced all of us to watch this video, and you should probably watch it too.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fU9hR3kiOK0?start=1967" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Recently, Recoil introduced similar concepts to most React users and its design is heavily inspired by re-frame (a selector is a particular view on an atom and through hooks you subscribe to its updates).</p>
<p>Recoil is quite smart in its implementation, and nicely enough, you can use the <code>reducer</code> pattern inside of it: we can keep all the state inside an <code>appAtom</code> and <code>useRecoilSetState</code> to update it.</p>

<p>Here <code>appAtom</code> in our main db and the other selectors (<code>reposView</code>, <code>repoItemView</code> etc)  provide the materialised views. Recoil does the rest, triggering an update when needed. If you click a <code>RepoItem</code> and set its nested state to <code>isOpen:true</code>, only that element will rerender <a href="https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/749">(if you enable this flag)</a>.</p>
<p>Again, I’m over-engineering our example to illustrate how these concepts work, but creating a new selector for each component seems to be quite a common pattern. And I love how business logic (imagine a "is repo actively maintained?" concept) sits in the selector and the UI just consumes it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_4_side_effects_as_data"><a href="#_4_side_effects_as_data"></a>🎢 (4) Side effects as&nbsp;data</h2>
<div>
<p>Last point, I promise.</p>
<p>We seem to have it all now: centralised state, consistent hot reload, smart updating views. <em>What more</em>, I hear you say?</p>
<p>In all the examples above, when it’s time to perform a side effect we just go ahead and do it. On the click of a button, we go ahead and hit the network, or persist to local storage, or manipulate the url. Seems easy enough.</p>
<p>Except that performing the side effects straight away makes it harder to track down what’s happening at any given point in your application. Remember the official Architecture Diagram in the re-frame README?</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/day8/re-frame/131859d718524f766a60d267725509fca31a7dc5/images/the-water-cycle.png" alt="the water cycle">
</p>
</div>
<p>A side effect can trigger more side effects and/or state changes. It’s a first class citizen of our application. And I think we should create an <code>Effect</code> data structure to represent it, similarly to how we create a reducer <code>Action</code> to transition the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a concept strongly advocated by The Elm Architecture and the Command pattern, and many libraries, including re-frame, have it. There are a few ways to implement this "effects queue" but the simplest is to keep it in the app state, along the "memory db" that holds the data to be visualised by the components. So now we have two top level keys: <code>db</code> and <code>effects</code>.</p>

<p>Recoil, again, makes it pretty clean because your app can just subscribe to the <code>dbView</code> which holds the ui data as we now it, and a different part of your app can subscribe to the <code>effectsView</code> and perform the side effects.</p>
<p>Notice three things:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We don’t need to call useEffects everywhere in our application: there is just one at the root, and all effects are performed there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we execute a branch in the reducer, we no longer just specify how the app state changes, we also declare which side effects will triggered. This is an amazing way to understand the behaviour of your application: "When I click this button I display a loading indicator and start to fetch the data". This is how we humans talk about these concepts, and they’re nicely reflected in our code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Side effects execution is now explicit. You can inspect it, monitor it, pause it, replay it, persist it, rewind it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnWypQz6X2U">(play Daft Punk song here)</a> because <em>it’s just data™</em>. For example, when a button is clicked you can have a look at the effects queue and decide to remove any pending http side effects if the user is navigating to another screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>I know some of you might think: ugh, is it worth the effort? And the answer is yes, believe me. And if you don’t believe me, believe success of the tool you’re already using: isn’t React just a way to model DOM side effects through explicit data instead of executing them directly?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_conclusion_where_is_the_library"><a href="#_conclusion_where_is_the_library"></a>🕵 Conclusion: where is the&nbsp;library</h2>
<div>
<p>You might be thinking: ok, interesting ideas, but you talked about all of this because you have a library to pitch, don’t you? You don’t expect me to write this myself, do you, so where’s the download link and the Quick Start page?</p>
<p>Sorry, there’s no library. If there was it would be called <code>The Kappa Architecture for React</code>, or simply <code>reframejs</code>, but there’s no need for it. And this is not even a pitch to say: all these things you can have if you switch to ClojureScript. Because it’s not a particular framework or library: it’s a set of related concepts. Sure, they feel more at home in a cljs project but they work nicely in plain React too, and I used them to create <a href="https://github.com/frankiesardo/buzzer-multiplayer">this simple multiplayer buzzer app</a> if you want to see them in action.</p>
<p>Do you want to abstract them and package them in a library? Go ahead! The more people use them, the better. I’d like to see more …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've recently started work on a service where we're not yet happy with the response body for the endpoints, so we're using an interim solution instead of trying to get a "perfect" end state straight away.</p><p>At the point that we've decided on the end state for the contract, we'll be in an awkward position. By changing the contract of the endpoints, we'll introduce a breaking change for consumers, as we'll be restructuring the format that they're expecting.</p><p>If we don't have a way to manage this, it could mean we have several co-dependent deployments to ensure that we're all on the new version at the same time, and it's likely that we'll have a period of time where there are some errors while we're waiting for the consumer to update, which is really not great for anyone, not least because this is a problem that's already been solved!</p><p>This is handled through API versioning, and is something <span><a href="https://apisyouwonthate.com/">APIs You Won't Hate</a></span> has <a href="https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-versioning-has-no-right-way">written about before</a> and is a great read.</p><p>My preferred route of handling versioning is to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation#Server-driven_content_negotiation">Server-Driven Content Negotiation</a>, which allows a client to use the <code>Accept</code> header (among others) to request a type of content, meaning they can choose which version of the resource is presented to them.</p><p>Server-driven Content Negotiation allows a consumer to send the HTTP Header <code>Accept</code>, letting the consumer tell the server what format they want the resource to be presented as.</p><p>For instance, a straightforward request for a JSON API could be:</p><pre><code>GET /api
Accept: application/json
</code></pre><p>Which says to the service, "give me only JSON". If the server does not support JSON, it should return either an HTTP 406 Not Acceptable, or an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media-Type (if a POST request using <code>content-type</code> negotiation), depending on how it feels.</p><p>If an <code>Accept</code> header is not provided, the API can infer a default type, or could reject the request with a 406/415.</p><p>Now, the reason I wrote this article is that I'm a big fan of content negotiation for versioning. This means that we can request the exact version of an API using the following (example) vendor extension:</p><pre><code>GET /api
Accept: application/vnd.me.jvt.api.v1+json
</code></pre><p>By adding this versioning into our API's contracts, it allows us to ensure that everything is versioned, right at the start.</p><p>This is great as a producer, because we can know that consumers won't be pulling whatever is the newest version. And for a consumer, it's also great because you can say that as long as you're sending a specific version, you will only get that specific version. This allows producers to release new versions of the contract without breaking consumers, and allows consumers the opportunity to upgrade to the versions in their own time.</p><p>This also means that we wouldn't provide a "default" version, so anything that isn't strictly matching the versioning would be rejected. This has the added benefit of meaning that no one should be able to "accidentally" pick up a version of the API that they're not expecting by using no <code>Accept</code>, or sending a wildcard.</p><p>The best part about following something standardised is that web frameworks everywhere (should) support it, as well as Layer 7 routers (such as AWS' Application Load Balancer), at least at a minimal level.</p><p>Another great thing, is that by doing it based on these headers, we can route to different infrastructure, for instance if we wanted to have a Lambda function per version we supported.</p><p>However, Content Negotiation isn't just usable with versioning, as its initial raison d'etre was to allow a client to request different formats from a server, for instance:</p><pre><code>GET /page
Accept: audio/*; q=0.2, audio/basic
</code></pre><p>This allows the browser to tell the server that they prefer the use of <code>audio/basic</code>, but if that's not supported, they're willing to compromise and accept anything that's under the <code>audio</code> type.</p><p>It also allows requesting different representations of the same data, for instance you could request an XML format for an API, if the server supports it:</p><pre><code>GET /api
Accept: application/xml
</code></pre><p>This has also helped recently with my <a href="https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/">Micropub</a> server, which I used to manage content on my site. When creating/updating a piece of content on my site, the Micropub server responds with an HTTP 201 Created with a <code>Location</code> header pointing to the new entry.</p><p>This is great for when interacting via a server, but with <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/06/28/personal-micropub-client/">my personal editor</a> for the site, I perform all these interactions through the browser. In this case, the browser doesn't show the <code>Location</code> header, nor follow the URL like it would with a HTTP 302 Found.</p><p>However, I can take advantage of content negotiation and as detailed in <a href="https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/28#issuecomment-713132934">this proposal for the Micropub standard</a>, allows for negotiation based on whether the consumer is a browser or an API:</p><pre><code>% curl https://www-api.staging.jvt.me/micropub -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer ...' -d h=entry -d "content=It's been a great Sunday for #Morph"

                <p>Connections are the hidden mechanism using which computer systems talk to each other—and they've become so fundamental that we overlook how important they are, how they work, and when they fail. We're often ignorant of them until there's a problem, which usually shows up a massive failure when our systems are doing their most amount of work. But because they're present everywhere and are so important in pretty much every system, they're worth spending a little time understanding. </p><h2 id="what-are-connections">What are connections?</h2><p>Connections are a link between two systems that allows them to exchange information as a sequence of zeroes and ones—to send and receive bytes.</p><p>Depending on where the systems are running relative to each other, a combination of underlying software and hardware will work hard to handle the physical movement of information, which <em>abstracts </em>it away. For example, if the communicating systems are two Unix processes, the <a href="https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/wcbrown/courses/IC221/classes/L13/Class.html">IPC</a> system will handle allocating memory for the data exchanged and will handle pick-up and delivery of the bytes on both sides. If the systems are running on different computers, they will likely communicate over <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:the-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:transporting-packets/a/transmission-control-protocol--tcp">TCP</a>, which will handle moving the data over a wired or wireless system between the computers. The details of how computers work together to reliably handle, transmit and receive the data is more a standardization problem, and most systems use the building blocks provided by the UDP and TCP protocols. How these connections are handled at each end is a more relevant problem for application development, which is what we'll look at now.</p><h2 id="where-do-we-use-connections">Where do we use connections?</h2><p>You're using them right now. Your browser made a connection to the web server that's hosting this blog, using which it fetched the bytes that make up the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images that you're looking at. If you're using the HTTP/1.1 protocol, your browser made multiple connections to the server, one for each file. If you used HTTP/2, many of the files were likely served over the same connection, using <em>multiplexing</em>. In these cases your browser was the <em>client</em> and the blog server was... well, the <em>server</em>.</p><p>But the server also made connections of its own to give you this page. It used a connection to speak to a database, sending over the URL of this page inside a query and receiving the contents of the page in return. In this scenario, the application server was the <em>client</em> and the database server was the <em>server</em>. The application server might have also made connections to other third-party services, like a subscription or payment service, or a location service. </p><p>For static files, like the JS, CSS and images, there's a CDN system in between your browser and the blog server. A connection was made from your browser (client) to the CDN server (server) that's closest to you, and if the files weren't available in the cache near you there would have been another connection from the CDN server (client) to the blog server (server).</p><p>If you think carefully about all the systems you use or build, you'll see connections all over the place—but they're often hidden from view, and not understanding their invisible presence and limits will come back to bite you when (and where) you least expect it.</p><h2 id="why-is-connection-handling-important">Why is connection handling important?</h2><p>Understanding how connections are handled is important because the cost of connections is <em>asymmetric</em>—the cost is different on the client and server. In a peer to peer (P2P) system, like a torrent cloud, this is false, and connections have the same cost at both ends—but this is rarely the case. The common uses of connections have a client and a server, and the cost to the server is different from the cost to the client.</p><p>Before we look at how connections can be handled, we need to quickly review the different ways in which computers run programs and how programs do work in parallel. When you run a program, the operating system runs your code as one instance of a <em>process</em>. A <em>process</em> occupies one CPU core and some memory when it's running, and does not share its memory with any other processes. The process can start <em>threads</em>, which are like children of the process that can run concurrently<em>. Threads </em>share memory with the process that spawned them, and might allocate more memory for their use. Or the process might use an <em>event loop</em>, which is a single-processes system that keeps track of tasks it has to do and loops over all its tasks continuously and infinitely, each time doing the tasks that it can, or skipping them if they're blocked. Or the process might use internal constructs called <em>fibers, green-threads, coroutines, </em>or<em> actors—</em>each of these work a little differently and having varying costs—but they're all managed internally by the process and its threads.</p><p>Coming back to how connections are handled, let's look at database connections first—from your application server (the client in this case), you see a TCP connection paid for with a small memory buffer and one port allocation. On the server side, if you're using PostgreSQL, each connection is <a href="https://brandur.org/postgres-connections">handled</a> at the server by spawning a new process that handles all the queries being sent over that connection. This process occupies a CPU core, and about 10MB or more of memory in RAM. MySQL <a href="https://mysqlserverteam.com/mysql-connection-handling-and-scaling/">handles</a> each connection by spawning a thread inside of a process. The RAM/memory requirements are much lower in a threaded model, but it comes at the cost of context switching those threads. Redis <a href="https://redis.io/topics/clients">handles</a> each connection as an iteration in an event loop, which makes the resource costs low—but a price is paid in having to loop over every connection's queries and serving them strictly one at a time.</p><p>Consider a request to an application server. Your browser initiates a TCP connection as a client, which is cheap (small memory buffer and one port). On the server, the story is different. If the server is using Ruby on Rails, each connection is handled by one thread spawned inside a fixed number of running processes (the <a href="https://puma.io/">Puma</a> web server) or by one process (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt/unicorn">Unicorn</a>). If it's using PHP, the CGI systems start a new PHP process for each connection, and the more popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI">FastCGI</a> systems keep a few of the processes running to make handling the next connection faster. If you're using Go, one <em>goroutine </em>(a cheap and light thread-like structure, managed &amp; scheduled internally by the Go runtime) will be spawned to handle each connection. If you're using NodeJS/Deno, the incoming connections are handled in an event loop by iterating over them and responding to requests one at a time. In systems like Erlang/Elixir, each connection will be handled by an <em>actor</em>, which is another internally scheduled lightweight thread-like construct.</p><h2 id="connection-handling-architectures">Connection Handling Architectures</h2><p>The examples of how connections are handled have a few common strategies which we can identify:</p><p><strong>Processes:</strong> Each connection is handled by a separate process, either started exclusively for the connection (CGI, PostgreSQL), or maintained as part of a group of available processes (Unicorn, FastCGI).</p><p><strong>Threads:</strong> Each connection is handled by a separate thread, either spawned exclusively for the connection or held in reserve after spawning. The threads might be spread over multiple processes, but all threads are equivalent (Puma/Ruby, Tomcat/Java, MySQL).</p><p><strong>Event Loop:</strong> Each connection is an task in the event loop, and connections that have data to be read are processed by iterating over them (Node, Redis). These systems are normally single-process and single-threaded, but they may sometimes be multi-process, where each process acts as a semi-independent system with separate event loops.</p><p><strong>Coroutines / Green-Threads / Fibers / Actors:</strong> Each connection is handled by a lightweight construct whose scheduling is managed internally (Go, Erlang, Scala/Akka).</p><p>Knowing how your server is handling connections is crucial to understanding what its limits and scaling patterns are. Even basic usage or configuration requires knowledge of how the connection handling works: Redis and PostgreSQL, for example, offer different transaction &amp; locking semantics that are influenced by their respective connection handling mechanisms. Process &amp; thread based servers can crash because of resource exhaustion if their max counts are not set to a reasonable limit, and when limits are set they might be horribly under-utilized because the limits are too low. Event-loop based systems may not benefit at all from running on 64-core CPUs, unless 64 copies of them are configured to run simultaneously—which works great for web servers but not very often with databases.</p><p>Each of these ways of handling connections perform differently when used in application servers and databases, because of the distributed or centralized nature of each system. Application servers, for instance, tend to be horizontally scalable—they work correctly and in the same way whether you have 1 server or 10 or 10,000. In these cases, Moving away from the process / thread model tends to result in higher performance, because we want as much work to be done with minimal memory usage and CPU context switching. Event loops like Node work great on single core servers, but need to be clustered correctly to use multi-core severs. Coroutine / actor based systems like Go or Erlang will utilise every core of the CPU much easier because they're designed to work that way, with many thousands of goroutines or actors running simultaneously on a single machine.</p><p><em>Centralized databases</em>, on the other hand, benefit more from process / thread / event loop handling, because based on the transactional guarantees of the system we don't want multiple connections operating on the same data at the same time. The operations happening on multiple connections will have to lock during the transaction-sensitive parts of their work, or use other strategies like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc-intro.html">MVCC</a>, and the fewer possible connection handlers there are the better. These systems support a few connections on a single machine. On large server, PostgreSQL might manage …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<h2 id="why%20would%20you%20want%20to%20do%20this?">why would you want to do this?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Go ecosystem is much richer than Lua and other embeddable languages</li>
<li>More people are familiar with Go than with Lua</li>
<li>Less effort is required than integrating with a different language</li>
<li><code>&lt;everything go is good at&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We're going to be using <a href="https://github.com/traefik/yaegi">yaegi</a>, an embedded Go interpreter for this experiment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the code is <a href="https://github.com/skuzzymiglet/go-in-go">here</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="layout">layout</h2>

<p>Our trivial demo program will call scripts that change one <code>int</code>, and the change will be reflected in the runner's state. There are many possibilities but I'm keeping it simple here.</p>

<p>Since yaegi scripts can't change the runner's state directly, the scripts will change the integer by calling wrapper functions. Also, to affect the runner's state, the function will have to run inside the runner. Therefore, the script must return a <code>func()</code> (or <code>func() error</code> if you want to handle with errors) that we can execute.</p>

<h2 id="scripts">scripts</h2>

<p>Our script will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "lib"
    "math/rand"
)

func Func() func() {
    return func() {
        fmt.Println(lib.GetX()) // Print the integer
        lib.SetX(rand.Int()) // Set it to something random
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>lib</code> import here. This is a package we add to the interpreters set of symbols. It will contain wrapper functions around our integer. </p>

<p>The returned <code>func()</code> runs in the runner.</p>

<p>We'll store this script in <code>scripts/one.go</code></p>

<h2 id="runner">runner</h2>

<p>Our runner will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// imports omitted for brevity

func main() {
    x := 0 // the all-important integer

    // all Go files under scripts
    files, err := filepath.Glob("scripts/*.go")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    for _, filename := range files {
        // Clean interepreter for each script
        i := interp.New(interp.Options{})
        // standard library
        i.Use(stdlib.Symbols)
        // wrapper functions for the integer
        // You could put these somewhere more convenient but they're short enough to fit here
        i.Use(interp.Exports(map[string]map[string]reflect.Value{
            "lib": map[string]reflect.Value{
                "IncX": reflect.ValueOf(func() { x++ }), 
                "DecX": reflect.ValueOf(func() { x-- }),
                "SetX": reflect.ValueOf(func(n int) { x = n }),
                "GetX": reflect.ValueOf(func() int { return x }),
            },
        }))
        // run the script
        _, err := i.EvalPath(filename)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("error running %s: %s", filename, err)
        }
        // Extract main.Func(), check its type
        symbols := i.Symbols("")
        main, ok := symbols["main"]
        if !ok {
            panic("main not found")
        }
        runFuncValue, ok := main["Func"]
        if !ok {
            log.Fatalf("%s: Func not found", filename)
        }
        runFunc, ok := runFuncValue.Interface().(func() func())
        if !ok {
            log.Fatalf("%s: Run is not of type func() func()", filename)
        }

        // run the function it returns
        runFunc()()
        log.Printf("x is now %d", x)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>2021/01/04 18:20:26 running scripts/one.go
0
2021/01/04 18:20:26 x is now 5577006791947779410
</code></pre>

<p>We can see <code>one.go</code> printing <code>0</code> (the zero value for our integer) and after setting it to a random number, the change is reflected.</p>

<p>This has some potential - you could build an HTTP server with script-configurable routes, a text editor automated in Go, or even a window manager with layouts and a bar configured in Go without re-compiling.</p>

<h2 id="should%20you%20do%20this?">should you do this?</h2>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>yaegi has <a href="https://github.com/traefik/yaegi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug">quite</a> <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/traefik/yaegi/interp#pkg-note-bug">a few</a> bugs, and hasn't reached a stable version yet. Go modules are unsupported. </p>

<p>Packages must be wrapped to be used - I haven't investigated this yet. To use non-standard-library packages, they must be in the GOPATH/GOROOT (<code>go get</code> needs to be run) and symbols need to be extracted (every external package used by scripts would have to be configured in the runner)</p>

<p>The library isn't particularly friendly. <a href="https://github.com/traefik/yaegi/blob/master/interp/interp.go#L409">Extracting symbols</a> doesn't error when the package isn't found.</p>

<p>Completions won't be available for the <code>lib</code> package, and there will be a big error as you write your scripts because <code>lib</code> isn't a real package. Scripts will have to be 1 file (perhaps the interpreter could be improved to accomodate this)</p>

<p>Therefore, you should probably stick with compiling modules into the binary (<a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/extending-caddy">like Caddy</a>), <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/yuin/gopher-lua">Lua</a> or <a href="https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto">JavaScript</a>. Or shell integration. Or filesystems. Or HTTP.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>

</ul><p>In what could be a major data breach, information of over 100 million debit and credit card users from payments processor Juspay has leaked on the dark web. Juspay processes payments for companies like Amazon, Swiggy, MakeMyTrip among others.
</p><p>
The leaked data is in the form of a data dump and has been leaked through a compromised server of Juspay. Juspay has 
<a target="_blank" href="https://juspayproducts.medium.com/your-security-is-our-first-concern-8d98c96e5f17" rel="nofollow">confirmed</a> the data leak in its official blog post, outlining the details of the breach.
</p><p>
    “It pains us to inform you that a data breach did happen on 18th August 2020. Non-sensitive masked card information, mobile numbers and email ids of a subset of our users were compromised,” the company said.
</p><p>Cybersecurity researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia discovered the data breach. He found that the data dump was available for sale on the dark web.
</p><p>
    Speaking to Business Insider, Rajaharia noted that this data breach could be a lot more serious if the hackers figure out the encryption algorithm used to hash card numbers.
</p><p>

<strong>Here’s what was leaked in the <keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Juspay-Data-Breach" actualkeyword="Juspay data breach">Juspay data breach</keyword><br></strong>
<br>As per Juspay, the leaked information includes non-sensitive masked card information, mobile numbers and email IDs of a subset of users. The company has said that the leaked information does not include full card numbers, order information, card PIN or password.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr>
<p>The data on the dark web includes information such as the bank that has issued the card, card expiry date, the last four digits of the card, masked card number, card type and the user’s name, among other details.
</p><p>

<strong>Should you be worried?<br></strong>
<br>    Rajaharia pointed out that there could be a major risk to users if the algorithm used to hash card numbers is leaked or if the hackers figure it out on their own.
</p><p>A hash is a unique and fixed-length string that is mapped to a set of data. In this case, Juspay has hashed the 16-digit debit and credit card numbers in order to process transactions.
</p><p>
    If hackers can figure out the algorithm used to generate these hashes, they could use brute force and find out what the original card numbers are.
</p><p>
Juspay has masked only six digits out of sixteen-digit card numbers. Rajaharia says that while this is good, the safety of users rests primarily on the hashing algorithm.
</p>
<p><strong>Scammers could also exploit this data leak<br></strong>
<br>In addition to the risks mentioned above, Rajaharia also pointed out that scammers could exploit this data leak to dupe cardholders. Since the leak includes mobile numbers, they could call unsuspecting cardholders and trick them into revealing the full card numbers, PIN, CVV as well as one-time passwords.
</p><p>
Rajaharia also pointed out that since these users are paying customers, they are a lot more valuable than non-paying customers. This makes the </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Juspay-data-leak" keynameseo="juspay-data-leak" actualkeyword="juspay data leak">Juspay data leak</keyword><p> a lot more lucrative for hackers and scammers.
</p><p>    
According to him, the seller he is in touch with has demanded $8,000 in Bitcoin to purchase the data.

<p>I decided that I was spending too much time writing instructions in random Google docs, vi’ed files, and GitHub repos. I wanted to have a single location that I could use as a way to publicly document all the things that I tinker with:</p>



<ul><li>Kubernetes</li><li>Docker (who doesn’t?)</li><li>Splunk</li><li>Raspberry Pi</li><li>Random tech integrations (this list could go on forever)</li></ul>



<p>With all of that, I felt that it was time to put it all into a blog. As I travel through life building these random things, I intend to document them here and link to any files, repos, or websites that I have created myself or used along the way.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>How often do you check your phone? Every 30 minutes? Every 5 minutes? Every 30 seconds?</p><p>Smartphones can be incredibly addictive. Tap, tap, tap and you’re playing a game, tap tap and you’re replying to a friend.&nbsp;<em>Ping!</em>&nbsp;and woooooh, someone liked your photo!</p><p>And so it goes, minutes pass. Then hours. And then you look up, and you still haven’t studied for the exam or worked on that proposal. Time has passed and you have nothing to show for it.</p><p>We know this problem well. We’ve faced it and overcome it. Here are some practical suggestions that helped us cut down from an average of hours on the phone to about 30 minutes.</p><p>Let’s start with the most obvious.</p><h2>Step #1: Turn notifications off</h2><p>Notifications are fun. Did someone message me? How many people liked my post? Who mentioned me?...</p><p>Social media and other apps that rely on notifications want to draw us in. They feed on our insecurity and want us to return to their product and tap away. That’s the purpose of notifications.</p><p><strong>Turn them off.</strong></p><p>We used to have them on too. Those likes sure felt nice. Seeing them come in, one by one. But you know what didn’t feel nice? Lack of focus. Inability to work. Feeling bad at the end of the day, knowing you didn’t do your best.</p><p><strong>We recommend that you turn off all notifications with the possible exception of direct messages from friends (if you don’t get too many of those).</strong></p><h2>Step #2: Delete unnecessary apps</h2><p>You probably don’t need Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or YouTube on your phone. Seriously.</p><p>They make it too easy to waste your own time.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/remove_apps.png" alt="Remove unnecessary apps" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>I (co-founder Vita) used to have all of those apps on my phone. Every time I was bored, I reached for my phone and tap, Twitter, scroll and scroll and scroll…</p><p>It’s too easy. Too easy to waste hours every day, tens of hours every week, hundreds of hours every month. For what? Internet points?</p><p>Those hours could be better spent writing your thesis, working on your presentation, or building your business. Since I deleted the most distracting apps from my phone, I’ve used my time better and have been much happier with myself.</p><p>You can always check Twitter or Facebook on your computer, where you can better control the environment - use a site-blocker like ours to limit how much time you can waste.</p><p>With the possible exception of Instagram and Snapchat, you can get everything you need from the website version of the product, if you need to.</p><p>Remove games from your phone too. They eat up time faster than a sped-up Pacman and only leave you with guilt at the end of the day. They’re too much fun. You might install them thinking “I’ll play for 5-15 minutes at the end of the day,” but before you know it, you’re playing an addictive game at 10AM instead of doing what you need to do.</p><p><strong>Remove the most time-sucking apps from your phone.</strong></p><h2>Step #3: Make your phone less visually appealing</h2><p>We’re visual creatures. If you reach for your phone, unlock it, and see a familiar icon with a red dot in the corner, you’re going to tap it. It’s one of the easiest and worst habits to get into.</p><p>So, here are 3 tips to make your phone screen less enticing.</p><ul><li><p><strong>No non-productive apps on your first screen.</strong><br>Put every app that has the potential to distract you on your second screen. No social media, no video apps, no messaging apps. If you have them on the first screen you see, you will tap them and destroy your productivity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Group distracting apps in folders.</strong><br>You can also make distracting apps less appealing by putting them into folders. E.g. Messenger, Slack, and email into&nbsp;<em>Communication.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Grayscale your phone.</strong><br>Ever notice that games are super colorful and bright? It’s that way for a simple reason - we biologically wired to like bright and rich colors. It’s fun to look at and fun to interact with colorful and animated screens.</p><p>So, make it less fun by turning everything gray.&nbsp;For iPhones go to&nbsp;<em>Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display Accommodations &gt; Color Filters</em>&nbsp;and then tap on Grayscale.</p><p>For Android phones, google “How to enable grayscale mode on android” - the process is more complicated.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Make your phone less visually appealing and you’ll be less tempted to use it too often.</strong></p><p>That’s it for once-and-done steps, now time for habits.</p><h2>Habit #1: Use the Rule of 3 senses - keep your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing</h2><h3>Sight: Keep your phone out of sight</h3><p>Imagine your desk looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/table_phone.png" alt="Phone on the table is a distraction" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>Normal, no?</p><p>There’s a catch. Our brain sees this:</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/table_phone_brain_bg.png" alt="Our brain is wired to notice a phone on your desk" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>If you have your phone in your field of vision, it’s a constant reminder that you could be doing something fun (dopamine!) instead of doing something that feels like work (but is productive).</p><p><strong>When you want to work, hide your phone from sight.</strong></p><h3>Touch: Have your phone out of reach</h3><p>Even if you don’t see your phone, if you have it within easy reach, it’s easy to succumb. All you need to do is extend your hand and an hour is gone and you still haven’t done anything productive.</p><p>Put your phone out of your reach. Ideally, have it in a different room entirely.</p><p>If you’re not home or at work, you can put it in your backpack or purse and put it out of easy reach.</p><p>You can assign your phone a dedicated spot. A spot in your bookshelf, a cupboard, or a drawer. Anywhere far away from where you want to work is good.</p><p><strong>Have your phone out of reach.</strong></p><h3>Hearing: Put your phone on silent (Do Not Disturb on)</h3><p>A funny video, a question about your weekend, a photo from a trip… they aren’t that urgent. You’re much better off not seeing those notifications and definitely not hearing a loud&nbsp;<em>ping!</em>&nbsp;when you’re just starting to get focused.</p><p>You can check all the notifications and replies once you got a solid piece of your work done or wrote a page of a paper you have due.</p><p>You don’t need to see every like or post as they happen. That might make engineers at Twitter or Facebook happy, but definitely not you in the long-term.</p><p>You can check everything when you take a 5 min break&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;doing something productive.</p><p><strong>When you want to focus and be productive, put your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing (on silent).</strong></p><h2>Habit #2: No phone first thing in the morning</h2><p>If you use your phone as your alarm clock, you might want to consider buying an analog one.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Here’s frequent scenario for many:</p><p><em>Dingdingdingding!!!!</em><br><em>rolls over, grabs phone and presses Stop</em><br><em>Oh, look at these messages. And an email from a co-worker. And someone mentioned me in their Insta story….</em><br><em>an hour passes</em></p><p>This is hardly a good, positive, or active way to start the day.</p><p>Almost any kind of morning routine is better than getting snared in a time-sucking black hole of checking&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p><p><strong>Solution: buy an analog alarm clock.</strong></p><p>They don’t have notifications. You can then leave your phone in a different room.</p><p><strong>Alternative solution: put your phone in airplane mode when sleeping.</strong></p><p>This way, you wake up without a full screen of things to respond to.</p><h2>Habit #3: Embrace boredom (instead of checking the phone)</h2><p><em>Waiting in a line? Check phone.</em></p><p><em>Friend went to the bathroom? Check phone.</em></p><p><em>Want to focus? Check phone.</em></p><p>Wait, scratch the last one!</p><p>Every time you check your phone, you reinforce the habit. Since it’s often within reach, in your pocket or on the table, it’s easy to do again and again, looking for a bit of something&nbsp;<em>new.</em></p><p>This habit can quickly get out of control. You start opening the same apps, over and over again, even though there’s nothing new there. It becomes a behavior tic to escape any kind of boredom.</p><p>But boredom isn’t bad. In fact, it can be helpful. When you’re bored, your mind starts to wonder. Vast networks of neurons activate in your brain and that often leads to interesting insights and ideas. Those ideas can lead you to naturally make progress with whatever you were procrastinating on.</p><p>Many people become de facto zombies, only looking for&nbsp;<em>NEW!!!</em>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<em>brainzzz</em>.</p><p><strong>Embrace boredom. Let your mind wander.</strong></p><h2>Pick a step or a habit to apply to your life</h2><p><strong>3 steps to being less distracted by your phone:</strong></p><ul><li>Turn off notifications</li><li>Delete unnecessary apps (and games)</li><li>Make your phone less appealing</li><ul><li>Remove distracting apps from your first screen</li><li>Put distracting apps into folders</li><li>Grayscale your phone</li></ul></ul><p><strong>3 habits to become more focused:</strong></p><ul><li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Rule of 3 Senses</strong>:&nbsp;keep your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing</li><li>Use an analog alarm clock or put your phone into airplane mode.</li><li>Embrace boredom.</li></ul><p>If you do these things, you will start spending less and less time on your phone and become more and more productive.&nbsp;<em>If</em>&nbsp;you do them.</p><p><strong>Take action today. Pick 1 app to remove from your phone, turn off notifications for Instagram or Twitter, or buy an analog alarm clock. Reclaim your attention.</strong></p></article></div>]]>

<p><span>J</span>un Heo’s grandfather was a one-time bodyguard to North Korea’s founding leader, Kim Il Sung. Heo, who grew up in a middle-class family in the coastal province of Kyongsong, hoped to follow in his footsteps, but when his mother tried to defect to the south in 2004, the family fell out of favor. Four years later, he made the journey by himself, smuggled across the Tumen River into neighboring China, and eventually reached his extended family in Shanghai. It was there he used a computer for the first time.</p>



<p>“It was hard for me to get the hang of at first,” Heo says. However, he soon found himself homesick, using Baidu, the Chinese search engine, to look up images of his hometown. When, in 2011, he moved to Seoul to study, like many defectors, he found himself ostracized. His countryside twang gave away his origins to his classmates, and he soon realized that few people in the south knew what life was really like for refugees from the north. After a few lessons from his South Korean girlfriend, who taught him how to use a camera and upload his first videos, he created his first channel, JunStories.</p>



<p>“When I uploaded my first video, I thought you’d only be able to see it in South Korea,” he says. “I didn’t realize I’d be talking to the whole world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Heo has more than 20,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HumansofNorthKorea/featured" data-type="URL">Humans of North Korea</a>. He is one of a growing number of defectors from the north who have turned to vlogging as a way to assimilate into South Korean society. There are now dozens of North Korean YouTubers, whose videos cover North Korean cuisine, dating, and even <em>mukbang</em>, or the art of vlogging while eating.</p>



<p>The response they have received — at times supportive, at others aggressive or patronizing — has highlighted the difficulties of straddling two antagonistic identities, never fully able to inhabit either. Vlogging only goes so far toward resolving their homesickness and sense of otherness in their adopted country. But in sharing their experiences, they hope that they can change southerners’ perceptions of their relatives above the Military Demarcation Line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I first arrived, people used to wear colored glasses. They were prejudiced because they’d never met a North Korean,” Kim Hyeok, a defector who left the north in 2011, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “But I think these YouTubers are helping change this.”</p>

<p><strong>There are only</strong> around 30,000 North Korean defectors in South Korea, but the community plays an outsize role in its host country’s identity. At the height of the Cold War, North Korean soldiers and elites who had defected were paraded around Seoul in events, some attended by millions of people, where they testified to the brutal conditions of the north and the superiority of the south.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the late ’90s, public spectacle had given way to reality television. Defecting soldiers were replaced by refugees fleeing famine and economic devastation. Later, on well-known conservative TV channels, popular shows such as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGAkgie9u9I">Now on My Way to Meet You</a>” and “<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/01/31/464798910/south-koreas-newest-tv-stars-are-north-korean-defectors">Moranbong Club</a>” featured defectors, usually young, poor, and female, telling the stories of their harrowing escapes.</p>



<p>These caricatures of North Korea and its citizens continue to shape the popular view of defectors in the south. “For many South Koreans, the primary way we meet defectors is through the media,” says Sung Kyung Kim, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Korean Studies. “We are still living under Cold War ideology.”</p>



<p>It is this skewed perception that Heo is trying to change through his YouTube channel, which has evolved from a personal vlog to a series of vignettes of the lives of defectors modeled on Heo’s favorite Facebook page, the long-running portrait series Humans of New York. The defection videos on Humans of North Korea are different from those on mainstream TV. “They edit 99% of their story and show the 1% that makes people angry about North Korea,” he says. Heo prefers to tell a more nuanced narrative.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cghxV9HXUZc?feature=oembed" title="🇰🇷S. Koreans React to Meeting A North Korean for the First Time | Social Experiment" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>In a video that has received over 2.8 million views, Heo tells people he is North Korean to see how they react.</figcaption></figure>



<p>His success on YouTube has granted him opportunities out of reach for many North and South Koreans alike. Before the pandemic, he was invited to events sponsored by Google and the consumer electronics company LG. He was even offered opportunities to collaborate with one of South Korea’s premier talent agencies, though he eventually turned that down. Sponsors of his channel have financed trips to other countries, including Germany and France.</p>



<p>However, not all North Korean YouTubers have met with the same welcome online. Sunny Kim started her YouTube channel in 2016 with similar intentions to Heo’s, having experienced nearly a decade of bullying after her defection from the north.</p>



<p>“In middle school, they would tease me and say, ‘Are you a sleeper agent trying to kill the South Korean president?’” she recalls. Her channel amassed 70,000 subscribers in a year, but the real-life harassment followed her onto the platform, where trolls hurled the same slurs at her she had heard as a child in the schoolyard. By the end of the following year, Sunny had shut down her channel. Though she recently resumed vlogging, she no longer talks about North Korea. “Now I just want to document my youth,” she says.</p>

<p>YouTubing has also attracted unwanted attention for Heo. Last fall, late in the evening, he received a call from detectives in Seoul’s police department. They told him that a team from the email provider Naver had alerted them to a cyberattack by hackers that targeted prominent defectors. Heo’s account was among those that had been compromised. The police later identified the hackers as North Korean. After the police walked him through the steps necessary to secure his account, he decided to delete it entirely, losing about six years’ worth of emails.</p>



<p>Even supportive reactions to vloggers’ videos can underline their otherness and highlight how far there is to go for North Koreans to truly integrate.</p>



<p>“He looks just like someone who was born here, amazing!” one commenter wrote on Heo’s page. “I cannot tell whether you’re from the north or south,” another wrote. Heo has mixed feelings about comments like these. “In a way, it’s a compliment,” he says. “But being North Korean is not a curse.”</p>



<p>Heo says he has a responsibility to overcome the perception that it is. He has not shaken off his homesickness, and online, he still finds himself drawn to take trips back to the north. “I miss my hometown,” he says. “I use Google Earth to see if it’s changed, but it hasn’t changed. Not in 10 years.”&nbsp;He hopes that one day he will be able to go back for real, and that his YouTube channel could be a small part of that process — a mini-reunification between South and North Koreans. “I don’t think my channel will destroy these barriers completely, but I want to try,” he says. “Every morning, I wake up and think, Maybe this afternoon we’ll be united<em>.</em> My family still lives there. I miss them.”</p>

<p>Photo taken on July 17, 2020 shows an office of online marketplace Pinduoduo in east China's Shanghai. Photo: Xinhua</p><p>A 22-year-old employee who worked at Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo died suddenly after finishing work late at night and fainting on the way home. The news has caused a strong response on the internet. The exact cause of her sudden death requires authoritative medical conclusions, but public resistance and condemnation of excessive overtime has become the mainstream attitude on the internet.</p><p>Hopefully, all companies and institutions will attach great importance to this attitude of the public, take necessary measures to protect the employees' legitimate rights and interests and do not regard employees' excessive overtime as the basis of the companies' achievement. The Labour Law should also be more strictly enforced.</p><p>The excessive overtime of internet company employees is well known. Two years ago, there was a condemnation of the "996" culture - working from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm six days a week - but the problem has not really been alleviated because of the fierce competition among internet companies. People's competition in jobs is also fierce. The two kinds of competition have seriously squeezed the room for workers to defend their rights of not working overtime. Many public discussions have shifted to the so-called principle of fairness that employees who work overtime must be properly paid.</p><p>Objectively speaking, frequent overtime is not just a matter for internet companies. There are many other such industries in China. It is also very common for policemen to work overtime, as well as some other civil servants. They usually have no overtime pay, or only a very small amount of overtime pay. Some local and department leaders take this for granted and some managers even proudly tell others how their departments work seven days a week or work from day to night.&nbsp;</p><p>In Chinese society, there is a traditional value that regards working overtime as an honor. Many descriptions of good people will include the content of how he or she works overtime for a long time, or works late at night. From government departments to enterprises, leaders and managers often appreciate employees who take the initiative to work overtime. Such value is deeply rooted in Chinese society.</p><p>When China was backward and shaking off poverty was the No.1 task, the abovementioned values were naturally formed. But when a huge middle class has been formed in urban China, the choice is subtly changing. People are putting more emphasis on their right to time off. There is heavy criticism online against the "996" working model, which is a clear sign of such a change.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, people have diversified pursuits. There are still people willing to improve their lives by working exhaustively. But such a working style as a collective value has been shaken. More and more young people wish to strike a balance between working hard and playing hard. They want to keep moving ahead, but also take it easy.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a broad trend. The more China grows further, achieving higher GDP per capita, such a value choice will attract more people. In addition, international society is scrutinizing China on labor protection, which is a term often mentioned when China conducts deep economic cooperation with foreign countries. Chinese society needs to adjust the concept of working overtime.</p><p>China's economic and social development cannot rely too much on people's long-time work as a driving force. We should improve labor efficiency and reduce formalism and useless work. People hope for more rest hours, and from this we need to find positive elements that promote development. We should try our best to unify development and the protection of people's rights.</p><p>Chinese people who often travel abroad will find that in a developed society, it is very difficult to hire drivers and translators who are willing to work overtime, not even if they're paid more. This cannot be simply regarded as "lazy."</p><p>Our economic and social development needs to be explored toward the gradually reduced cost of all citizens. Of course, this cannot be achieved overnight. After all, China is still not a rich country, and the low-income group is still large. Overtime work in some positions is inevitable. The spirit of enduring hardship cannot be absent in our society. In particular, we must not give up the encouragement of dedication. In some key sectors, it is very important to let such spirit continue to flourish. We need to constantly adjust to the progress of society and achieve a new balance.</p><p>Chinese society needs to rethink the internet sentiment opposing the "996" work model and the strong reaction to the Pinduoduo employee's sudden death. We should let such thinking rationally penetrate into the rhythm of social progress.</p><p><em>The author is a commentator with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn</em></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="45d72c63-4641-3f9f-f271-8df897413c12"><p>Today the consumer market is moving towards Omni-channel experience, and the developer and UX designers need to focus more on web and mobile-friendly user experience than ever before. The developer and designer work more closely to provide a better user experience for the website or app they develop. Technical errors on the software are the critical reason for the app deletion.&nbsp;</p><p>Over 90% of the downloaded apps are erased after one use due to poor user experience. Similarly, according to expert's studies, 80% of users never return to a low user experience website. This is why UX design is a crucial factor in software or application development. The user expects extraordinary experience on apps, websites they use every day. They never provide 2nd change on the software. In this article, let's look in detail at why developers want to learn UI/UX design.</p><p>‍</p><p>The 15 reasons I've highlighted here for you:</p><p>‍</p><ol role="list"><li>Interface vs. Experience</li><li>How User Experience Shapes Software Development</li><li>Excellent Ux Design Encourages to Develop of a More User-Centric Product</li><li>Make the Product More Popular With Ux Design.&nbsp;</li><li>Reduce Flaws and Development Cost</li><li>Ux Plays a Vital Role in Software Architecture</li><li>Limited Resource</li><li>Designing in the Browser</li><li>Front End Development &amp; Ux Design</li><li>&nbsp;Ux Can Make You a Better Developer</li><li>Gets Higher Return on Investment (ROI)</li><li>&nbsp;Learn Skills That Complement Your Existing Talents</li><li>Gain Skills That Can’t Be Automated</li><li>Execute Your Code Towards the User Experience</li><li>User Empathy Will Help You Stand Out in the Business Market</li></ol><h2>1. Interface vs. Experience</h2><p>Before we get down to detail, let's understand the difference between the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>User Interface is anything that the user interacts with the website or app. In another term, UI is the point where the user interacts with the digital product or service. They come in three categories Graphical user interfaces( GUIs), Voice-controlled interface (VUIs), and Gesture-based interfaces.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Graphical user interfaces:</strong> Users interact with electronic devices through graphic icons. The best example is the computer's desktop.</p><p><strong>Voice-controlled interface: </strong>Users interact with the application through their voices. E.g., Siri, Alexa, etc.</p><p><strong>Gesture-based interface: </strong>Users engage with 3D design spaces through real movements, e.g., Virtual reality (VR) games.</p><p>In contrast, User Experience is the complete look and feel of the website or application. UX is the final impression of the user about the product or service.</p><h2>2. How User Experience Shapes Software Development</h2><p>UX and UI design are essential for any application development. Five significant reasons show you need to focus more on the design during product development. Research says that the product's experience influences 97% of customer decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Usability</strong></p><p>When software or application works great but is not user-friendly, people will not prefer to use it. The software has to attract and retain the user. User interface and experience are upfront on the development.</p><p><strong>2. Lower development costs</strong></p><p>Identifying the roadblocks and issues in the client experience before development with save you time on modifying code.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3</strong>. <strong>Faster development time</strong></p><p>Great UX and UI configuration save time in the development cycle.</p><p><strong>4. Increase revenue</strong></p><p>People prefer to download or ready to pay for the application that suits their needs and easy to use. If you develop a product with useful UI and UX will increase the app's purchase or downloading.</p><p><strong>5. Better Client retention</strong></p><p>User-friendly apps will keep people returning. The application will become an integral part of their everyday life. If developing a poor UX will leave a lasting impression. The developer has to identify the design problems before deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Excellent Ux Design Encourages to Develop of a More User-Centric Product</h2><p>UX design offers insights about what your users want from the product that you are developing. It is the core point for product design. User research and usability testing at each step of the development prove how the user-friendly product evolved.</p><div><p>Before product development, conduct user research and speak with the end-users and understand their needs. The study will help to develop the best user experience application or software.</p><p>In the end the builders (in this case developers) need to have an understanding of the outcome of what they’re building.</p></div><h2>4. Make the Product More Popular With Ux Design.&nbsp;</h2><p>According to statistics, nearly 67% of consumers are more likely to purchase the product if they are happy with their user experience.</p><p>Creating a straightforward user journey or planning the best end-user experience makes client retention and retains the existing customers. This boost in product purchase.</p><p><a href="https://bugreporting.co/">BugReporting</a> is a user feedback tool for websites and apps. It allows users to record full-length video feedback. The application also captures the data to replicate any errors that users face. A BugReporting software is an automatic tool that helps developers and designers view the exact bugs that are user-facing on the UI/UX.</p><h2>5. Reduce Flaws and Development Cost</h2><p>When you combine user's demands in your application's development process, it will considerably decrease UX problems in the later stage of the product journey.</p><p>A basic understanding of UX design will help understand which will not work for the user before product development. Mockups and prototypes will reduce user-related bugs' chances, and it will minimize the development cycle time. The developers can make a clear decision on software development with prototyping.</p><h2>6. Ux Plays a Vital Role in Software Architecture</h2><p>High performance and software stability can only be achieved by the developers. These two are the unsung heroes of user experience design.</p><p>For example, Website visitors will leave the page if they face low page loading. Unnecessary redirects, server delays, heavy images, heavy CSS, HTML, JavaScript files, fancy animated effects or page widgets, etc., may cause inadequate loading speed. The developer needs to fix these defects to improve the user experience. Suppose there is a lag in site loading due to server delay. In that case, the coder needs to find suitable hosting for their website. In this way, the developer will enhance the user experience, product accessibility, and usability.</p><h2>7. Limited Resource</h2><p>In many startups or small businesses, there won't be any dedicated resource for design. Developers out there want to tackle projects entirely on their own, who can't afford to hire a designer (or require to spend the money elsewhere). They will be able to learn to design for their products until they identify the valuable resource.</p><p>Another main reason developers need to learn design is to work more effectively with designers. If the developer understands the basic design, it will help create stunning UI and create a better user experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Learning about design improves the relationship between designer and developer. The developer can easily understand the user interface correction that is provided by the designer. Learning makes the developer view the design on the designer's view for the application development.&nbsp;</p><h2>8. Designing in the Browser</h2><p>Many designers hesitate to perform designing on the browser because they need to know the necessary CSS and HTML programming or codes to create on the browser. That is the specific reason behind why it's an excellent fit for engineers getting into designing.</p><p>There are many tools and browser plugins available today, which assist you in designing the browser. Which makes the developer and designer's life easy. Here are some useful tools for coder and UI/UX designers includes Sketch, Axure, InVision Studio, Craft, Proto.io, Adobe XD, Webflow, Figma, and more&nbsp;</p><h2>9. Front End Development &amp; Ux Design</h2><p>Not all designers need to know to write coding in contrast to the front-end developer, which doesn't mean it is necessary to know UX. But both the UX design and Front end development work more excellently together. If a front-end developer has both, the knowledge will help in creating significant and usable applications. Learning will bridge the gap between the designer and developer and can complete the quality-assured application.</p><h2>10.&nbsp;Ux Can Make You a Better Developer</h2><p>The demand for programming engineers is developing by 22% consistently until 2029. Among all the developers with a special in user experiences are ahead of the job compilation. Users are the priority of any app or web app development, so many recruits look for candidates who have sound knowledge of software development, and UX design is considered more. As a developer, expand your career horizons by continuous learning. A basic understanding of UX design will increase the chance of landing your dream job.</p><h2>11. Gets Higher Return on Investment (ROI)</h2><p>UX impacts client satisfaction; as a result, it will generate higher ROI for the longer term. It is essential to develop the best user experience at the first interaction with your product.&nbsp;</p><p>Best UX design will engage your user with your application and create customer loyalty for your brands. People will also recommend the product if they are satisfied. It will increase your inbound leads and revenue. If the coder doesn't understand, UX's fundamentals will create a negative impact on UI. Research says that companies that spend on UX design can increase a minimum of 30% sales.</p><h2>12.&nbsp;Learn Skills That Complement Your Existing Talents</h2><p>By learning new skills like UX, you will come out of your comfort zone. Many platforms provide free and paid online courses about user experience design. Here are some of the websites with lessons that help you to upgrade your expertise in designing.</p><p><strong>Coursera: </strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/user-experience-design">Introduction to User Experience Design </a>&amp; <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals">UX Design Fundamentals</a></p><p><strong>Learnux.io: </strong><a href="https://learnux.io/course/usability">Course on Usability</a></p><p><strong>UX Design Institute:</strong> <a href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/courses/ux-design?utm_source=uxstudio&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=top_10_courses">Professional Diploma in UX Design</a></p><p>You can find many similar online courses to grow your expertise in UI and UX design.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h2>13.

</a>

by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/index.html">Luke Smith</a>

<p>
<i>A parable on the Logical Postivist "interpretation" of scientific models.
<!-- Granted, I use the term "logical positivist" in a somewhat expanded but specific sense, -->
<!-- loosely the idea that "science is good models" or what was called in the past "instrumentalism." -->
</i>
</p>

<h2>The Parable</h2>

<p>
Suppose an alien race comes to Earth and wants to observe our games.
They are very interested in chess, despite the fact that they have eyes with properties that make it impossible to make out what actually happens on a chess board.
(The whites and blacks and squares all blur together.)
</p>

<p>
They can still learn about chess experimentally, they know they can sit two players (a so-called "white" and "black" player) down to play it, and they can tell behaviorally who at the end wins.
</p>

<p>
After extensive experimentation, they realize this: 50% of the time, the white player wins and 50% of the time, the black player wins (we'll ignore draws and any first-move advantage for the example).
</p>

<h3>The "best" model</h3>

<p>
A logical positivist alien thus creates the ultimate, long-term model of chess as an iterated game:
Chess amounts to just a drawn-out coin flip.
Half of the time white wins, half of the time black wins, just as if they were tossing a quarter.
</p>

<p>
The aliens then decide to model chess as a coin flip, as a 50-50 game with no underlying principles.
While this statistical technique might not be useful for predicting a single game, over the long run and over iterated games, <em>it is the most efficient and parsimonious possible model</em>.
</p>

<h3>"Inferior" models</h3>

<p>
Suppose, however that a "crank" scientist of the alien race posits that "God doesn't play dice" and that chess is a more complicated game, despite the fact that the aliens cannot observe it.
Suppose even he asks around and determines from humans that there are actually pieces on the board with functions, and he even devises a machine that allows his alien eyes to see the first move of the game of chess.
</p>

<p>
Seeing this move allows him to create a new theory and model of the game,
one that takes into account the first move made and he tries to generate a new set of probabilities of victory based on that move.
The model he makes, is of course highly arbitrary, stipulated and <em>ad hoc</em>.
In fact,
this model is inferior on many inevitable accounts.
For example:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>It is less predictive over iterated games than the coin flip model.</li>
    <li>It is not as parsimonious/minimal as the coin flip model.</li>
    <li>It adds new variables to the theory (pieces) that are suspect.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Which model is "right?"</h2>

<h3>Which model is closer to truth?</h3>

<p>
Since we, unlike the aliens, are not prevented by defect from observing chess, we know that the second, "inferior" theory of chess is truer.
Its theoretical categories, if apparently arbitrary in the eyes of the aliens, are getting at the actual underlying mechanics of chess.
Even if the model is less effective, it is certainly <em>righter</em>.
</p>

<h3>Which will cause fruitful scientific inquiry?</h3>

<p>
The coin flip model is a scientific dead-end.
Firstly, the coin flip model is constructed statistically, which presents the underlying mechanism to be randomness, and thus unworth of inquiry.
This isn't statistics hoisted above random variation we know to exist, instead, it's utterly blind statistics that covers over whatever principles underlie it.
</p>

<p>
Secondly and more importantly, in order to actually improve that model, it has to <em>lose</em> empirical solvency:
embracing the abstractions of pieces means introducing mess and
deviating in some way from the empircal generalization that half of all chess games are won by white and half by black.
</p>

<h3>This is not an abnormal circumstance.</h3>

<p>
The parable here, really an <em>example</em> is not abnormal.
In most affairs in science, whether that be physics or neuroscience or economics or chemistry, we are exactly like the partially-blind aliens.
</p>

<h3>"But science isn't about truth!"</h3>

<p>
Yeah, it is dude.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are pretending that science is about "models" or fitting equations and the like, again, the well-fit model is impossible to perfect, while the flawed, yet more true to reality model does have a potential over the long-term to be a superior one.
After exhaustive inquiry, an alien race might not only discover the pieces and the full set of rules behind chess, they might be able to predict what moves are good or bad and predict individual chess games.
Even on the standards of mere instrumentalism, the mindless positivistic theory is still actually inferior.
</p>

<h2>Local maxima</h2>

<img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/pix/maximum.gif" alt="Local maximum">

<h3>The plot</h3>

<p>
One of the ways I visualize science and models is that each model is really like an n-dimensional optimization plot.
"Truth," or if you deny truth as metaphysics, "accuracy in data" or "well-fit equations" are upwards and the goal of science is to get further that way.
</p>

<p>
At the point you're at, you can tell which direction you can go to move upward, or, which little changes you can make to improve your model.
That is what incremental science is, after all: don't change assumptions and just fine-tune your equations.
The endless fine-tuning is sometimes thought of as "progress."
Of course I don't think that this is <em>bad</em>, but it is a very minor and scientifically less important part of science as a whole.
</p>

<p>
The reality of incremental science is that once you're at a local maximum, once you've fine-tuned your equations about as perfectly as possible,
it's over.
Everything next to you <em>looks</em> like a disimprovement.
It <em>looks</em> just like those inferior theories of alien chess that posit the existence of pieces.
From that, you might erroneously conclude that you have found the <em>global</em> maximum, which
due to the nature of the complexity of the universe and the multiplicity of
possible answers and theories, you flatly haven't.
</p>

<p>
Logical positivism is kind of theoretical lobotomy that implicitly tells scientists that they should never, ever, ever change foundational assumptions:
tweaking equations like an oblivious autist is Science®️ and everything else is "philosophy" or "metaphysics" or "pseudoscience."
This amounts to keeping each scientific field on whatever local maximum is closest, utterly unable to extricate themselves from it even when they see on the horizon abberant data.
<strong>If you want to understand the stagnation of science or any other specific field, this is where it comes from.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Purposefully "bad" science</h3>

<p>
In <i><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/notrelated/S02E01_-_Against_Method_and_For_Pseudoscience.ogg">Against Method</a></i>, Paul Feyerabend, in what an unreflective mind might misinterpret as a "troll," says that it is important for science that people have biases, financial interests, interfering religious and political doctrines and the like in science.
Looking at the plot, you might now see why.
When we are stuck on a local maximum, every new data keeps our already-optimized model where it is no matter how low that maximum actually is.
What you need to shake it up is an external shock that totally moves our theoretical position somewhere new on the plot where we can try to optimize at another point, and then compare.
</p>

<h3>Basic assumptions</h3>

<p>
A prudent person should be able to question, "Am I even on the right track or am I playing with some model that has a fundamental flaw?"
I can guarantee you, optimizing for data and fitting math and equations is easy.
<strong>All theoretical programs are wrong because they make incorrect core assumptions.</strong>
This is very hard for the ego of scientists because it means:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Possibly illiterate dilettantes on the internet might see and bring to attention legitimate theoretical flaws.</li>
    <li>All the years you spend in graduate school counting angels on pinheads in your respective theoretical framework is mostly a waste of time.</li>
    <li>The borders of science are borders more of a sociological club than being the border of raw rigor.</li>
    <li>Most of the scientific work is not meaningful outside of the theoretical framework that gave rise to it.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I guess this is the first blog post of the new year, even though I’m not someone who is keen on celebrating a new year, I sincerely hope every one would have a very bright 2021.</em></p>
<p>Most of you are enjoying unlimited internet at your homes, but sadly <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/28/sri-lanka-need-unlimited-internet-connections/">I’m coming from a part of the world that charges according to the data I use. </a></p>
<p>I basically pay for my <strong>home broadband </strong>data and I have monthly cap, and if I exceed that data limit I will have to buy an expensive data add-on. So data is something precious to me.</p>
<p>In the month of December, may be due to a technical error by the ISP my data add-on finished and I made a tweet criticizing them.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Scammed again by <a href="https://twitter.com/SriLankaTelecom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SriLankaTelecom</a> you should be ashamed of your practices </p><p>Bought a zoom package and data add-on today because I need zoom to work</p><p>But then suddenly by noon the internet got slower.

<p>The ISP was kind enough to reach out to me and I received an email detailing the data use of my internet connection.</p>
<p>It is a table with the websites/protocols I used, the data transmitted to that website/protocol in bytes.</p>
<p>One thing that immediately caught my eye was what’s at number 2, it was <strong>Pinterest</strong>.</p>
<p>Before I get into more detail, I want to tell you that I’m not an active Pinterest user, I don’t use their app on my mobile device. The only way I land on Pinterest is when I go to their website from Google image search results.</p>

<p><strong>There has been 17 connections to Pinterest and Pinterest has sent me more than 1.2GB of data.</strong></p>
<p>Even the 2000+ requests to Facebook has only downloaded roughly 300MB of data.</p>
<p>Why Pinterest is sending so much data in just 17 requests? What do they contain?</p>
<p>Maybe they are preloading or caching images for better user experience. But still 1.28GB of images is likely to have more than 1000 images.</p>
<p>Another explanation can that the ISP is trying to give me an explanation why my data vanished. But both explanations doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>Since data is valuable to me I will try to block requests to Pinterest, and see if that will make a difference to my data usage.</p>
<p>I’ll request another report at the end of the month to see my data usage for the month of January to compare before and after blocking Pinterest.</p>
<p>Has anyone had a similar experience in Pinterest or is it just me?</p>

		<p>Splitting headache at 10am. Not a fine way to start the day.</p>
<p>For the last 10+ years, I’ve consumed 2-5 cups of coffee every day. I was hooked to coffee is an understatement. It had gotten so bad that if I didn’t get coffee by 9am, I’d get a debilitating migraine for the rest of the day. I also had restless sleep, bordering on insomnia, where I wouldn’t sleep at all for a couple nights a month.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2021.01.04/coffee.jpg" alt="Coffee"></p><figcaption>Sleep killer, headache giver, kick in the butt</figcaption>
</div>
<p>In February 2020, I got the worst flu in years (don’t think it was COVID). The first three days were extra painful with withdrawal headaches.
I decided a change was in order. My last coffee was January 31st, 2020.
The rest of the process was not predetermined. I tried to follow my body needs and didn’t push to quit with a definite date in mind.</p>
<p>After I recovered from the flu, I switched to black tea for the next several months.
I felt physically sluggish and mentally slower.</p>
<p>Black tea was followed by green tea for about two months. My sleep dramatically improved, however still felt lethargic. After green tea, I still didn’t feel ready to stop all together.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2021.01.04/tea.jpg" alt="Jasmine Pearl Tea"></p><figcaption>Savior, kinda</figcaption>
</div>
<p>Enter <u><a href="https://amzn.to/3pwj3Cc">jasmine pearl tea</a></u>. It’s rolled up into a ball and each ball has 1-3 tea leaves. I started using three tea balls for my morning tea. Over the course of three months, I’m down to <i>one tea ball every other day</i>. It’s been a useful tool for measuring caffeine intake. Final quitting day is February 1st, 2021.</p>
<p>The few things I’ve learned along the way:</p>
<h5 id="a-dont-plan-for-every-eventuality">A. Don’t plan for every eventuality</h5>
<p>It was tempting to outline every possible aspect of this challenge – what to drink, when to drink it, how often, when to decrease dosage, what to do in case of a backslide etc. I consciously avoided this for two reasons. One, making a full blown plan feels so satisfying that the actual challenge doesn’t feel compelling anymore, leading me to underperform or give up. And two, I might give up if I backslide so badly that my plan doesn’t account for it. That’s pretty demoralizing.</p>
<h5 id="b-celebrate-positive-consequences">B. Celebrate positive consequences</h5>
<p>I still have headaches if I miss my “caffeine window”. But they are far less painful and much more manageable. That’s a win! I sleep so much better now too.</p>
<h5 id="c-take-your-time">C. Take your time</h5>
<p>It took 10 years to get to this level of caffeine dependence. Spending one year to unwind this addiction is relatively fast! I felt a lot slower mentally in the first 6 months and still do as I continue to reduce my caffeine. I expect that once I no longer depend on caffeine, my body will pick up the slack.</p>
<p>All in all, This has been another step in discipline and a healthier me.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information). These prior data serves as the constrains to the probability distribution.</p>



<p>Given the second law of thermodynamics (principle of increase of entropy), isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy, maximum entropy distributions become the most natural distributions under certain constrains. In this blog post, I would like to discuss entropy maximization and a couple of maximum entropy distributions.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="gaussian-integral">Gaussian Integral</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>I will skip the proof here, since the proof from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral">Wikipedia</a> is not that difficult to understand.</p>

<h4 id="useful-integrals">Useful Integrals</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} d(-x^2) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x d (e^{-x^2}) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( x e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \Big) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( 0 - \sqrt{\pi} \Big) \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Notice that here we used integral by parts.</p>

<h3 id="entropy-maximization">Entropy Maximization</h3>

<h4 id="discrete-probability-distribution">Discrete Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Suppose $P$ is a discrete probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further have some constrains on $P$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two constrains are trivial given $P$ is a probability distribution. The third constrain is optional and it indicates a constrain on the entire system. Notice that there could be more than one constrain if $m &gt; 1$.</p>



<p>We would like to maximize the entropy.</p><p>

\[\max_{P} H(P) = \max_{P} \Big( - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \Big)\]

</p><p>Letâ€™s try to solve this optimization problem. We would use Lagrange multiplier for the constrains.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) + \lambda_0 \Big(\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \sum_{x \in X}^{} \Big(P(x) r_i(x) - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) &amp;= \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)}\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="continuous-probability-distribution">Continuous Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Similarly, suppose $P$ is a continuous probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With the following constrains</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) dx = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, to maximize the entropy, we maximize the Lagrangian for the continuous case.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx + \lambda_0 \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$. We will also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a> to compute the derivative, which is slightly more complicated. Without going into all the details, we have the following derivatives.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \int_{X}^{} \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \big( P(x) \log P(x) \big)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } dx \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="maximum-entropy-distribution-examples">Maximum Entropy Distribution Examples</h3>

<h4 id="roll-dice">Roll Dice</h4>

<p>A conventional dice has 6 faces. $X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So, the maximum entropy probability distribution of getting each face of the dice is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{0} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 6 } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="uniform-distribution">Uniform Distribution</h4>

<p>The only constrain we put on a distribution is $X = [a, b]$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So the maximum entropy probability distribution is actually uniform distribution.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \int_{a}^{b} e^{0} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ b - a } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="gaussian-distribution">Gaussian Distribution</h4>

<p>We could also derive Gaussian Distribution using entropy maximization. The constrains for the maximum entropy distribution are</p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\

&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \Big[ \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2^2} \Big] \bigg) dx  \\

&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\

\end{align}\]

</p><p>Here we assume $\lambda_2 &lt; 0$, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) d \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>To make it more clear, we set</p><p>

\[y = \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)\]

</p><p>So using Gaussian integral, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A few years ago, while using the Line app, I noticed a feature called "People nearby." The feature lets you connect with other Line users within the same area. The feature would give you the exact distance from you to the other users. If someone spoofs their latitude, longitude, they can triangulate a user and find their location. I reported an issue in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://line.me/en/" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Line app</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and They paid me $1000 for it. They fixed it by adding a random number to the user's destination. You can find my name&nbsp;</span><a href="https://bugbounty.linecorp.com/en/halloffame/2017/" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">here</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.&nbsp;</span></p><p>A few days ago, I installed Telegram, and I noticed that they have the same feature. I tried to see if I can unmask other users' locations, and I found they have the same issue I discovered in the Line app a few years ago. I reported the problem to Telegram security, and they said it's not an issue.&nbsp;<strong>If you enable the feature of making yourself visible on the map, you're publishing your home address online. </strong><span>Lot of users don't know this when they enable that feature. This is what they said when I emailed them:</span>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>From:<span>	</span>security@telegram.org</p><p>To: me</p><p>Hello,</p><p>Thanks for reaching us out. Users in the People Nearby section</p><p>intentionally share their location, and this feature is disabled by</p><p>default.

They’re structured as <strong>event-driven systems. </strong>That basically mean they react to “events” that can occur at any time.  That’s physical event sources like button presses, battery alerts, and sensors inputs, but also to incoming Bluetooth communications from an App. In our experience, even top-tier chip vendors like Nordic Semiconductors provide subpar guidance on how to best orchestrate this system of events and reactions. An unsuspecting developer may feel they’re using a lean approach, linking event sources in code to their corresponding reactions in a piecemeal fashion. The complexity of this patch network soon grows exponentially and starts feeling like a firmware savant is required just to make sense of it all.   As the project grows, the <strong>event-reaction mappings grow in quantity </strong>and<strong> </strong>likely require being dynamically re-mapped in different modes of operation. If left untreated, the affliction can get the best of you, spreading faster than you add features. If you’re anything like us, there’s an inevitable face-the-music moment where this event-driven <strong>spaghetti code </strong>can no longer be tolerated. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579741448937_7867"><div>

It’s the kind that<em> </em>compiles into bytes and bites to deal with. If you’re not aware of spaghetti code and its nauseating effects, then let’s briefly recap.  “Spaghetti code” is a slang term for code with convoluted structure, so much that it’s difficult to debug and and maintain it.</p><p><strong>What problems are caused by event-driven spaghetti code?</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Bugs: the worst kind of bugs.</strong> It’s the ugly should-have-been-avoidable bugs that crop up and continue to crop up when you lose a handle on the structure of your application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Code duplication.</strong> The completely unnecessary there-must-be-a-better-way kind of duplication. When the system for handling events is poorly structured, developers struggle to repurpose code across similar events and states of operation. For example, a “battery charging” and “charge complete” state should be able to elegantly share a lot of charging-related functionality. </p></li><li><p> <strong>Loneliness</strong>, also known as staffing problems due to your unmaintainable codebase.<strong> </strong> No one likes to work alone, so restructure your application in a way that your coworkers and future coworkers cherish. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579801278944_6416"><div><h2><strong>Fret Not</strong></h2><p>I want to recommend a system that’s worked for me — two steps for developers like us to immunize against the spaghetti affliction right from the start. </p><p><strong>Overview of the Steps to Avoid Spaghetti Code:</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Use an atomic <strong>event queue</strong>. Rather than reacting to events all over your different interrupt execution contexts, an event queue allows you to consolidate those portions of your code into one place. It’s your conduit for “deferring” the handling of events from many contexts (like interrupts) into one main context. It additionally solves the issue of thread/interrupt safety, by avoiding concurrent access of shared resources across different contexts..  For example, you don’t want a SPI peripheral used in two contexts that can interrupt one another. Instead, both contexts can queue events for the main function to perform the SPI operations sequentially. </p></li><li><p>Use a <strong>hierarchical state machine (HSM)</strong>, and a framework to implement one. An HSM is the  knockout punch for our spaghetti foe. It provides an intuitive and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton">deterministic</a> scheme to define how events should be handled throughout various modes of operation. HSMs are “hierarchical” in the sense that each state can be configured to inherit behaviors from a “superstate”, a more general state that encapsulates it and potentially other states. The hierarchical aspect of HSMs make them far more practical for real-world firmware applications than a textbook flat state machine.

    <p><strong>Monday, January  4, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>If you're building an application that needs to scale—and we all tell ourselves that we are—then at some point you have to figure out if it <em>does</em> or not. This is where load testing comes in: if you want to see whether or not your application can handle scale, just <em>generate</em> scale and see if it can handle it! It sounds straightforward enough.</p>
<p>Then you try to actually generate load. This is straightforward if your application is dead simple, because you can use something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_JMeter">Apache JMeter</a> to generate repeated requests. If you can do this, I envy you: every system I've worked on is more complicated and requires a more intricate testing plan.</p>
<p>Your application gets slightly more complicated, so you then turn to tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_(software)">Gatling</a>. These let you simulate virtual users going through scenarios, which is a lot more helpful than just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_(software)">besieging</a>&nbsp;one or a handful of URLs. Even this isn't sufficient if you're writing an application that uses both WebSockets <em>and</em> HTTP calls, over a long-lived session, and requires certain actions repeated on a timer. Unless I severely missed something in the documentation, I cannot see a way to, say, setup a heartbeat that runs ever 30 seconds, do certain actions upon response to a WebSocket message, and also do some other HTTP actions, all with the same HTTP session. I haven't found a way to do that in <em>any</em> load testing tool (which is why I wrote my own at work, which I hope to open source if I can make the time to clean it up and separate out proprietary bits).</p>
<p>But let's suppose you <em>do</em> have a tool that works, out of the box, like Gatling or Locust, and it fits your needs. Great! Now let's write that test. In my experience, this is the hardest bit yet, because you have to first figure out what realistic load looks like — welcome to a day or three of dredging through logs and taking notes while you peer at the network tools in your browser as you click around in your web application. And then after you know what realistic load looks like, you get to write what boils down to a subset of your application to pretend to be a user, hit the API, and do the things your user would do.</p>
<p>And we're not done yet! This is fine, we have our load test written and it's realistic. But this is a moving target, because updates keep going out. So now you have the maintenance problem, too: as your application changes, how do you keep your load test up to date? There isn't great tooling to do this, there is little out there to help you. You have to make this part of your process and hope you don't miss things. This is not a satisfying answer, and that's why this is also one of the hardest parts of load testing an application.</p>
<p>We'll just skip the whole "running it" part, because honestly, if you've gotten this far through a load test, then running it shouldn't be the hardest part.</p>

<p>So basically, here's where we are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most load testing tools support simplistic workloads, and even the complex ones don't let you do everything that's realistically needed to simulate <em>real</em> usage of a web application.</li>
<li>Writing the test with a simulation of real usage is the hardest part, even if the tools do support what you need.</li>
<li>Maintaining the test is the second hardest part, and the tooling here does not help you in the slightest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at these in detail and see how much complexity we can pare away.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-users-do-we-have-to">Simulating users. Do we have to?</h2>
<p>I'm a "yes" here, although it might depend on your application. And for these purposes, we're talking about the user <em>of a service</em>; if you have a monolith, this is your users as a whole, but if you have microservices the "user" might be another one of your services! For the applications I've worked on, I have had minor success with targeted tests of specific endpoints. But these end up requiring such complicated setup that you aren't better off than you were with the load test itself! And while it may yield some results and improvements, it doesn't get to everything (you may have endpoints that interact) and you don't get a realistic workload.</p>
<p>"When do you <em>not</em> need to simulate users?" is probably a better question. Seems to me like this is when you <em>know</em> that your endpoints are all independent in performance, you don't have any stateful requests, and the ordering of requests does not impact performance. These are big things to assume and it's hard to have confidence in them without testing their independence, at which point, we're back to writing that whole dang test.</p>
<p>The best you can do here is probably at the API and system design time, not at your test time. If you design a simpler API, you're going to have far less surface area to test. If you design a system with more certainly independent pieces (distinct databases per service, for example) then it's easier to test them in isolation than in a monolith. Doing this also lets you use a tool that is simpler, so you get two wins!</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-tests-is-hard-so-is-maintenance">Writing the tests is <em>hard.</em> So is maintenance.</h2>
<p>Creating a load test is hard because you have to do a few things: you have to understand what the flow through <em>usage</em> of your API is, and you have to write a simulation of that usage. Understanding that flow means understanding other systems than the one under test and since your system is presumably not the focus of their documentation, there is not going to be a super clear diagram of when and how it's called; this often looks like sifting logs until you figure out what the representative usage is. And then writing that simulation is certainly not trivial, because you need to manage the state for a large number of actors representing users of your API!</p>
<p>Oh, and you get to write integration tests for this now, too.</p>
<p>There's some research out there on how to make some of these tasks easier. You can figure out what you need for the initial test, and detect regressions (missing new workloads) from automated analysis of the logs, for example. But as far as I can tell, there is no software on GitHub, let alone a product I can buy, that's going to do that for me. So it doesn't seem like it has much of any traction in industry. It would be a big project to implement it on your own, which might be why it has languished (or is done at big companies, and is not spoken of).</p>

<p>There's a lot of complexity in load tests, and there is not a lot of tooling to help you with it. So maybe the answer is: write fewer of these types of tests, and don't expect them to give you all the answers to how your system performs.</p>
<p>You have a few options for getting a great picture of how your system performs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good old analysis.</strong> Sit down with a notebook, a pen, an understanding of your systems as a whole, and an afternoon to spare, and you can figure out with some napkin math what the general parameters and bounds of scaling on your system are. When you find the bottleneck, or you have some unknowns (how many transactions per second <em>can</em> our database support? how many do we generate?) then you can go test those specifically!</li>
<li><strong>Feature rollouts.</strong> If you can roll out features slowly across your users, then you don't necessarily have to do any load testing at all! You can measure performance experimentally and see if it's good enough. Good? Roll forward. Bad? Roll back.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic replay.</strong> This doesn't help at all with new features (see feature rollouts ten words ago for that) but it does help with understanding your system breaking points for existing features without as much development. You can take the traffic you saw before and replay it (multiple times over, even, by combining multiple different periods' traffic) and see how the system performs! (Side note: I would <em>love</em> tooling to help with this, and with amplifying traffic when doing this, so if anyone has a recommendation... hit me up.)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>If you have some silver bullet I've missed, or a fantastic research paper in this area you'd recommend reading, or a story of terrible times with scaling that you want to share with me, please email them to <a href="mailto:me@ntietz.com">me@ntietz.com</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>For the past while, I’ve had the goal of learning a functional programming language in the back of my mind but never acted on it for various reasons. However, during a recent weekend afternoon of winter COVID-lockdown web browsing, I stumbled across the terrific <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/" target="_blank">F# for fun and profit</a> which piqued my interest and convinced me to take the plunge and learn FP in 2021. I believe that learning different programming paradigms helps you become stronger in all languages, and with C# incorporating more and more features from F# (records among other things for example) learning functional programming would be a benefit in a few different ways.</p>

<p>In addition, as I’ve been spending quite a bit of time working with C# and .NET 5 recently, F# felt like a natural fit due to the interoperability with the rest of the .NET ecosystem. In addition, F# has support for OO and so you can use a hybrid model in situations where pure FP may not be possible.</p>

<h2 id="initial-thoughts">Initial Thoughts</h2>

<p>As a small learning project, I created a simple program which asks the user for a username and password and prints a message if the user enters the correct combination (if they get the combination wrong the function is called recursively and asks them for their credentials again). Figuring out the implementation details proved to be a bit more challenging than if I were to code the solution in C# as you don’t want to use statements such as if and while in functional programming which would normally be my go-tos in a case like this. After much trial and error, I found my solution to be quite elegant:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>type</span> <span>LoginModel</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span> <span>Password</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>}</span>

<span>// By making Admins a Set.OfList we can use .Contains later.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>Admins</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"MJ"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"M"</span><span>};</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"Joe"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"C"</span><span>}]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>.</span><span>ofList</span>

<span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>// The LoginRoutine() is a recursive function we call until the user enters the correct credentials.</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> 
        <span>printfn</span> <span>"Welcome to VMS Version V!"</span>
        <span>printf</span> <span>"Enter your username to continue: "</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>usernameAttempt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>()</span>
        <span>printf</span> <span>"Enter your password to continue: "</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>passwordAttempt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>()</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>usernameAttempt</span><span>;</span> <span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>passwordAttempt</span><span>}</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>Admins</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>with</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>true</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>printfn</span> <span>"You are logged in"</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>false</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>
    
    <span>let</span> <span>login</span> <span>=</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>

    <span>0</span> <span>// Terminate program</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In comparison to C#, we see several big differences in the code. Aside from the lack of brackets and semicolons, the program uses a match expression rather than an if statement to evaluate the user’s credentials. Pattern matches are powerful expressions and from what I’ve seen can allow for complex branching.</p>

<p>Also note the creation of the Admins list:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>Admins</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"MJ"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"M"</span><span>};</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"Joe"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"C"</span><span>}]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>.</span><span>ofList</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>During the binding, we never specifed the actual type! F#’s powerful type inference means that I can skip a lot of boilerplate that I would normally use in C# while still having all the benefits of a strongly typed language.</p>

<p>We also make use of the pipe forward operator |&gt; in order to take the admins list and turn it into a set. Converting the list to a set allows us to use .Contains on our admins list in the match expression later on in the code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        <span>match</span> <span>Admins</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>with</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>true</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>printfn</span> <span>"You are logged in"</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>false</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>

<p>Since the LoginRountine function has been marked with the rec (recursive) keyword, it will continue to call itself until the match returns true. This eliminates the need for using a while loop while keeping our method immutable.</p>

<p>In addition, its important to note that F# executes code from the top down which I find makes following program flow much easier. Despite this, I did run into a few compiler errors until I got the hang of the execution flow and making sure to put functions in the proper order.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>So far, my biggest issue hasn’t been with the language itself, but rather the lack of learning resources compared with other, more popular languages. <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp" target="_blank">Get Programming with F#</a> has been a terrific book for learning, but the paradigm shift that functional programming requires can be quite significant and I find myself constantly Googling certain issues and being able to count the number of (usually not very related) Stack Exchange topics on one hand. I did however find a great small but active <a href="https://discord.gg/vs4U6HQhAG" target="_blank">F# Discord community</a> which has been great at answering smaller one-off questions that I’ve had regarding the language.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>My next steps are to think about a project that I’d like to undertake in F# to help me continue my learning. I find I tend to learn best when I have a project and write a build log documenting the process, and I’m hoping that I’ll be able to combine an F# project with my <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-12-09-back-to-school/" target="_blank">cloud computing program</a> that I’ll be attending at the end of January. I also plan to write a few more articles exploring the language a bit more in-depth in the coming months, so stay tuned!</p>

  <div><p>In iOS 14.3, Apple added their new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/">app privacy details</a> to App Store listings. App privacy details, which are sometimes compared to the nutritional labels on foodstuff, are details about the data an app collects and the purposes and use of such data. What can we learn by analysing this data?</p>

<p>From the 14<sup>th</sup> of December 2020, all new apps and app updates have to provide information on the data the app collects. This is used to power the app privacy details labelling. On Twitter, videos scrolling through the privacy listing for Facebook circulated immediately after the 14.3 release.</p>

<p>This system is somewhat flawed, because app developers can, at least in theory, lie about the data they collect. Some apps that profess to collect no data, actually turn out to collect a bunch if you read their privacy policy. However, the punishment for being caught lying, removal from the App Store, is a strong deterrent and it’s safe to assume most developers will have been truthful in their accounts.</p>

<p>An interesting side-effect of this, is that Apple has now made available the same data that can be found in terse and hard to parse privacy policies as simple and structured data that can be parsed and analysed. In this post I will do just that i.e. collect and analyse the privacy details for thousands of the most popular apps on the App Store.</p>

<h2 id="collecting-the-data">Collecting the Data</h2>

<p>If you just want to read the juicy details feel free to skip to the <a href="#analysis">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Apple makes the privacy labelling data available for each app on the App Store via an API used by the App Store apps. By reverse engineering the App Store apps I’ve figured out how to make the API divulge this data on a per app basis.</p>

<p>This only gets me the privacy data for a single app, but I want to analyse popular apps. A good source of popular apps are the charts the App Store provides on a per app category basis. An example of this is “Top Free” apps in “Education”. These listings contain up to 200 apps per category and price point(i.e. free or paid).</p>

<p>On the UK store, which is the store I’ve used for all this analysis, there are 24 categories. Each of which have top charts with up to 200 paid and 200 free apps. This means the theoretical total number of apps is 9600. However, because some apps occupy chart positions in multiple categories and because the charts also contain app bundles the actual number is lower.</p>

<p>The full list of categories is:</p>

<h2 id="structure-of-the-data">Structure of the Data</h2>

<p>If you don’t care about the exact details and structure of the data feel free to skip to the <a href="#analysis">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>The structure of the data returned by the App Store API is</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&lt;number&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"apps"</span><span>,</span><span>

  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>&lt;privacy-details&gt;</code> section of this document is the important bit. It’s an array where each item has the following structure.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"privacyType"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&lt;human-readable-description&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>

  </span><span>"purposes"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&lt;data-purposes&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>&lt;string-identifier&gt;</code> is one of</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Identifier</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DATA_USED_TO_TRACK_YOU</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><code>DATA_NOT_COLLECTED</code> is used as a marker in which case <code>dataCategories</code> and <code>purposes</code> are both empty and this is the only element in the <code>privacyDetails</code> array.</p>

<p><code>DATA_USED_TO_TRACK_YOU</code> contains details on data used to track you across websites and apps owned by other companies, Apple’s description is <em>The following data may be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies:</em>. For this entry <code>purposes</code> will be empty and <code>dataCategories</code> contain the different data types that are tracked across apps and websites owned by other companies.</p>

<p><code>DATA_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> and <code>DATA_NOT_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> both contain data types with purposes specific granularity. This means that <code>dataCategories</code> will be empty and the different data types are in <code>purposes</code>. Apple’s description for <code>DATA_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> and <code>DATA_NOT_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> are <em>The following data, which may be collected and linked to your identity, may be used for the following purposes:</em> and <em>The following data, which may be collected but is not linked to your identity, may be used for the following purposes:</em> respectively.</p>

<p><code>&lt;data-purposes&gt;</code> is an array of purposes with the following structure:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"purpose"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&lt;human-readable-purpose&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>

  </span><span>"dataCategories"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&lt;data-categories&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The different values for <code>&lt;purpose-identifier&gt;</code> are:</p>

<p>Lastly <code>&lt;data-categories&gt;</code> is an array of objects with the following structure:</p>

<p>Let’s do some analysis of this data</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 7<sup>th</sup> of January 2020. Added data for Games, which was previously missing and extended analysis of all apps to larger data set.</p>

<p>The data set I’ve collected contains 9477 combinations of apps and a position in a given category chart. In total there are 9435 unique apps in this data set.</p>

<p>Most charts contain 200 or nearly 200 apps, however <strong>Graphics &amp; Design(Paid)</strong>, <strong>Developer Tools(Paid)</strong>, and <strong>Magazines &amp; Newspapers(Paid)</strong> all have fewer than 90 apps so I’m dropping them from further analysis.</p>

<p>Because the privacy details have only been required for new apps and updates since mid December, not all apps contain information about privacy details. After removing those apps 3370 apps remain in the data set. Breaking this down by chart, several charts have less than 25 apps so I am dropping them from further analysis too. This leaves 3233 apps in the data set.</p>

<p>In total the following charts have been dropped:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Education(Paid)</li>
  <li>Navigation(Paid)</li>
  <li>Sports(Paid)</li>
  <li>Business(Paid)</li>
  <li>Food &amp; Drink(Paid)</li>
  <li>Shopping(Paid)</li>
  <li>Medical(Paid)</li>
  <li>Magazines &amp; Newspapers(Paid)</li>
</ul>

<p>For the analysis there are a few different data points that are interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apps that collect data this is linked to the user and how many such data types they collect.<sup>*</sup></li>
  <li>Apps that collect no data.</li>
  <li>Third Party tracking, i.e. tracking users across apps and websites owned by other companies and how many(max 32) such data types they collect.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Data that is linked to the user for the purpose of supporting app functionality, that is the <code>APP_FUNCTIONALITY</code> purpose, is legitimate and will be exclude from the following analysis. This leaves 160 data types spread across 5 purposes.</p>

<p>I am excluding data that is collected but not linked to the user, in part to keep down the length of the analysis and in part because it’s the least interesting. I’ll probably do a follow up post on it later.</p>

<p>The questions I’ll be looking at for this analysis are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#free-vs-paid">Do free apps collect more data?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#worst-charts">Which are the worst charts?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#worst-apps">Which apps in the whole data set are the worst?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#oxymorons">Which apps lie subtly about the nature of data they collect?</a></li>
</ol>

<p>But first let’s have a quick look at the data set.</p>

<p><em>Note: The images in this post can be clicked to show larger versions</em></p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-plot.svg?1610051683" alt="Histogram plot of data types collected. The apps that collect zero such data types dominate"></a></p>

<p>As we can see here, most apps collect no data outside of that which supports the app’s functionality. To get a better view of the apps that do collect data, let’s remove the majority of apps that don’t.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg?1610051683" alt="Histogram plot of data types collected with zero values removed."></a></p>

<p>Still the amount of data collected is fairly low, but there’s a curious set of outliers somewhere around 120 data types collected. All of those outliers have something in common, see if you can figure it out before I reveal the answer later in the post.</p>

<p>How about third party tracking?</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-plot.svg?1610051683" alt="Histogram plot of third party tracking data types collected. The apps that collect zero such data types dominate"></a></p>

<p>Again most apps don’t collect any data types …</p></div></article></div></div>

The delivery driver who brought his groceries from Vons mentioned that drivers across the state are getting fired by Vons, Pavilions, and other California stores owned by Albertsons Companies in late February. Stores will instead turn to a third-party delivery service using independent contractors.</p><p id="d033">â€œI was disturbed and disappointed that Vons would eliminate these jobs. I felt like they were the only remaining company that treated delivery drivers ethically but no longer,â€� said Dylan.</p><p id="1f42">After publication, an Albertsons representative sent the following statement: â€œWe will transition that portion of our eCommerce operations to third-party logistics providers.â€� She added â€œWhile we know that this move will help us create a more efficient operation, it wasnâ€™t a decision we made lightly or without a great deal of consideration.â€�</p><p id="10d5">Drivers under the Albertsons Companies umbrella are employees, while Ralphs delivery is operated by Instacart and Target uses Shipt, a similar app. At Bay Area stores, drivers are unionized, and will not be affected by the layoffs. For southern California shoppers, this move leaves them without a grocery delivery option that treats drivers as employees.</p><p id="baaa">Unions are vowing to fight the change, says Jim Araby, Director of Strategic Campaigns at UCFW5. â€œThe only drivers that kept their jobs were the unionized drivers in the Bay Area. All the other drivers in California were laid off because they were non-union. We represent those drivers and they will keep their job.â€�</p><p id="4b12">These layoffs are unsurprising after the passage of Proposition 22, which gutted worker protections while making it easier for companies to shift financial burdens onto newly-designated â€œindependent contractors.â€� In a <a rel="noopener" href="https://knock-la.com/the-case-for-voting-no-on-ca-prop-22-a64d25b2828d">piece for KNOCK</a> last year, Keith F. Eberl predicted this exact outcome in the opening paragraph:</p><blockquote><p id="95b6">â€œContrary to the companiesâ€™ deceptive ad campaign and intimidating messages to their workers, Prop 22 does not preserve driver flexibility or save drivers from politicians. What Prop 22 does do is change current law so the companies can shift their costs to the driver and diminish or remove driversâ€™ rights, protections, and benefits. Prop 22 will also block driversâ€™ ability to organize so they canâ€™t collectively bargain a contract. In addition, this proposition will block local governments from writing or enforcing protections for drivers.â€�</p></blockquote><p id="a03f">The only surprise is the speed at which Albertsons reversed course on its commitments to workers. This move comes after nearly a year of celebrating grocery store workers for feeding communities. <a href="https://www.vons.com/steps-we-are-taking-at-your-grocery-store.html" rel="noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Albertsons Companies President &amp; CEO Vivek Sankaran said the company was â€œtaking care of our team.â€� Albertsons Companies â€œare workingâ€¦ to ensure that every member of our team who faces a crisis can have peace of mind that we will help them get through it.â€�</p><p id="c5d5">Albertsons was happy to reap public goodwill during the pandemic. But once Prop 22 gave the company the option of replacing workers with lower-paid contractors, they jumped at the opportunity. Employees received notice during the holidays that their employment would end one month into the new year.</p><p id="66cc">Early in the pandemic, union members demanded hazard pay, additional medical leave, and employee protections during the pandemic. In March, Safeway and Northern California grocery workers <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Coronavirus-Safeway-reaches-new-agreement-for-15150811.php" rel="noopener">reached an agreement</a> providing these additional benefits.</p><p id="452b">Labor and management were able to cooperate in April, requesting that grocery workers be designated as first responders. In an April j<a href="https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/helping-you-through-covid-19/albertsons-companies-ucfw-launch-joint-effort.html" rel="noopener">oint statement</a>, Sankaran and United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) President Marc Perrone wrote:</p><blockquote><p id="c86a">â€œThis joint action is an example of how all Americans must work together to protect everyone working on the frontlines. This includesâ€¦ associates at our nationâ€™s grocery stores who are providing communities with the essential food and supplies needed to weather this public health crisis.â€�</p></blockquote><p id="0a33">Negotiations in October <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/08/grocery-warehouse-workers-truck-drivers-give-notice-of-potential-strike/" rel="noopener">turned contentious</a>, as members of the Teamsters issued a notice of potential strike due to rising healthcare costs. Lou Villavazo, who chairs the bargaining effort, told the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/08/grocery-warehouse-workers-truck-drivers-give-notice-of-potential-strike/" rel="noopener">Orange County Register</a> that â€œemployers have been bargaining in bad faith. Weâ€™ve had over 18 bargaining sessions with them and we provided our economic proposal â€¦ but no response.â€�</p><p id="e2db">Organized labor made the difference for drivers in the Bay Area, who will remain as employees for now. But without the power of a union, southern California drivers lack an organizational structure through which to fight back.</p><p id="b343">Many, myself included, turned to Vons and Albertsons stores for their groceries, knowing that drivers were employed with benefits.

It's a total wipeout after two years of building a business that's also my full-time focus and my family's sole source of income. I'm heartbroken and confused.</p><h2><strong>The Cruelest Year</strong></h2><p>2020 has been awful, and despite this new challenge that I face, I still count myself blessed. A friend of mine has lived in a veritable shoebox for a decade, pumping every hour and cent he had into building two of the most beloved bars in New York City. He filed for bankruptcy last month. Another friend attended a family reunion in February; it was the last time that she'd see several of her relatives (who died from COVID-19 in the weeks that followed).</p><p>Again, no matter what happens to this site, I really do feel fortunate and blessed.</p><h2><strong>The Risk of Relying on Big Tech</strong></h2><p>As much as I've tried to diversify <em>Good, Cheap and Fast</em>'<em>s</em> revenue and traffic, I haven’t escaped the gravitational pull of Amazon and Google. This poses major risks and I advise caution to anyone considering a similar business model.</p><p>In April of this year, Amazon <a href="https://searchengineland.com/amazon-affiliate-commission-rates-cut-332966">reduced the affiliate commissions</a> that it pays to online publishers. My revenue fell by 41% as a result. It was a crushing blow that I attempted to mitigate by joining other affiliate programs, but they didn't pan out. The median conversion rate of the 70 other websites that I linked to was a meager 0.8%, which is approximately 1/10 of the conversion rate on Amazon.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607784280213_34634"><div>

I don't collect any personally identifiable information. I don't allow guest posts or third-party content. I'm completely transparent about how this website makes money as well as the methods and limitations of my product selection methodology. Every affiliate link on this site is properly disclosed and wrapped in a "rel sponsored" tag. I take the time to read scientific and medical research as it relates to the topics that I cover, and when I find a product that is potentially harmful (like weighted eye masks), I share my findings with every major publisher who has written positive things about that product. I use my expertise to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johndefeo_if-you-support-a-charity-via-amazonsmile-activity-6737737229449379840-vc6I/">support charity</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johndefeo_to-my-friends-in-journalism-be-cautious-activity-6733095426775404544-FbxR/">to teach colleagues about scams</a>.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607784280213_69057"><div><p>But, as much as I'd like this website to be a destination, it will never be one.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Good, Cheap and Fast</em> was profiled by big name websites like <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90274504/hate-browsing-amazon-this-is-the-ultimate-no-frills-shopping-site">Fast Company</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kottke/status/1067547920617086976">Kottke</a>. These media mentions drove hundreds of thousands of visits. Nevertheless, if someone who was referred to this website two years ago is looking for a cheap portable generator today, he or she is much more likely to Google "cheap portable generator" than to come to my homepage.</p><p>It's understandable. Alas, without search visibility, this site in invisible.</p><h2><strong>Can a Domain Be Cursed?</strong></h2><p>I did my due diligence before I registered goodcheapandfast.com. It had no backlink history and it had only existed previously as a parked domain in 2013. There are no obvious skeletons in this domain's closet, yet strange things have been afoot, almost since day one.</p><p>For example, Bing didn't even index this website's homepage a month after <em>Good, Cheap and Fast</em> was linked to from websites like Esquire and Slate. I contacted bingwb@microsoft.com with my concerns and received this response:</p><blockquote><p>Good day and thank you for your patience while we investigated the issue.</p><p>Firstly, I am happy to provide you information that our product review group succeeded in removing the block of the site. After submitting your site to be reviewed the team has decided to lift the  block. Please allow up to 2-3 weeks for your site to be crawled indexed and serving again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am unable to provide you the specifics of the block as our product review team does not share details of the block.</p></blockquote><p>The mystery didn't end there. Two years later, this website has received fewer than 100 total referrals from Bing. That's not normal and neither is this: Since 2019, pages on this website started dropping in-and-out of Google's results. An article that ranked #1 would disappear entirely, then reappear, then disappear, then reappear. These were like mini strokes. Sometimes the traffic bounced back in full; other times it gradually faded away.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607704925648_28921"><div>

    <div><p>A conversational technique I learned recently (not that I think about all the things I say with such intention) is to tell people something they don't already know. <br></p><p>We're much hungrier for new information (even mistruths) than we are for truths that we already understand. Take for example the fake news headlines that seem to circulate on social media; we'll often choose to read and share something we suspect is probably only partly true over something that we think is true but widely known.<br></p><p>I suppose telling your audience something new is just one tenet of good storytelling, which all humans are drawn to. The experience we have of reading an immersive novel or a fascinating biography for the first time we can never have again, even if we experience if differently on reads two and three.<br></p><p>When talking about oneself, it's also more <i>impressive</i> to tell others something new. For example, friends and family will be far more interested and impressed when you tell them about the skydive you <i>did</i>, rather than the one you're <i>thinking</i> about doing.</p></div>
