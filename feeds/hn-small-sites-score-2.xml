<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Wesley Aptekar-Cassels' recent posts on <a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/taiwan-gold-card/">getting a gold card</a> and <a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/taiwan/">moving to Taiwan</a> reminded me that I meant to write about my experience with Canada.</p>
<p>I immigrated to Vancouver, BC in March 2020. I was given permanent residency before setting foot in Canada and without a job offer, under the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry.html">Express Entry</a> program. From gathering documents to landing in the country took 9 months. Judging by 3rd party trackers this is well over the median - I was pretty disorganized and the London embassy is one of the slowest.</p>
<p>The whole process looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/compare.html">eligibility requirements</a> and spend 5 minutes filling out <a href="https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp">this questionnaire</a>. You'll get a score which you can compare to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile/rounds-invitations/results-previous.html">recent admission rounds</a> to see if you have a good chance. (The results aren't recorded, so just guess what your language test scores would be.)</li>
<li>Take an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/language-requirements.html">English and/or French exam</a> and get an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed.html">Educational Credential Assessment</a>. Get the rest of your paperwork ready - proof of employment history, proof of funds, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence/police-certificates.html">police certificates</a>.</li>
<li>Fill out an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile.html">Express Entry profile</a> and wait for an invitation to apply.</li>
<li>Get invited to apply. Submit all the paperwork. Take a short medical exam and go the embassy for fingerprints and photos.</li>
<li>Send off your passport and wait for it to come back with a Confirmation of Permanent Residence inside.</li>
</ol>
<p>The total cost for me was £1456:</p>
<ul>
<li>£165 for the IELTS exam</li>
<li>£140 for the Educational Credential Assessment</li>
<li>various small fees for eg mailing paperwork, getting sealed degree certificates</li>
<li>£670 for the Express Entry application</li>
<li>£330 for the medical exam</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing I really appreciated is that most of the expense of applying, in terms of both time and money, was at step 4, by which point the acceptance rate is something like 95%.</p>
<p>Other miscellanea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 2 took me 4 months (poor planning). Step 3 took 2 weeks. Step 4 took 3 months. Step 5 took 2 months, apparently due to heavy backlog at the London office.</li>
<li>Self-employment is fine for the employment history requirements. I submitted tax records and signed letters from a few previous clients.</li>
<li>I didn't have a job offer in Canada, but if you do it seems worth trying to get provincial nomination which will shoot you to the top of the queue. Eg BC has a <a href="https://www.welcomebc.ca/Immigrate-to-B-C/B-C-Provincial-Nominee-Program/BC-PNP-Tech-Pilot">fast-track for tech jobs</a>.</li>
<li>Permanent residents are eligible for public healthcare (which in BC is free) after 3 months. There are companies that offer cheap private insurance to cover the gap - I used <a href="https://www.desttravel.com/#/insuranceproducts/visitortocanadainsurance">Destination Travel</a>.</li>
<li>To keep my residency I need to spend 2 out of every 5 years in Canada. After accumulating 3 years in Canada in any 5 year period I'm eligible for citizenship.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>My move was totally unrelated to current events - I had decided a few years back that I wanted to settle down somewhere and Vancouver ended up at the top of the spreadsheet. But since many of my friends in the US are thinking about emigrating, here are the main points I see for and against.</p>
<p>In favor of Vancouver:</p>
<ul>
<li>World class <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105946429/british-columbia">climbing</a>, skiing, kayaking, mountain biking etc as well as a <a href="https://originsparkour.com/">solid parkour gym</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjfUkxqDDNw">Astounding natural beauty</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.iqair.com/ca/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-bc">Low air pollution</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/urban-forest-strategy.aspx">Trees</a>, <a href="https://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/beaches.aspx">beaches</a>, <a href="https://www.vanmuralfest.ca/murals">murals</a></li>
<li>Reasonable social safety net</li>
<li>Politically stable</li>
<li>English-speaking (I've lived in several non-English-speaking countries so this certainly isn't a hard requirement, but it is easier)</li>
<li>Same timezone as SF and 3 hours behind NYC - good for remote tech work</li>
<li>Regularly ranked as one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_livable_cities">most livable</a> cities in the world</li>
</ul>
<p>Against Vancouver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large belligerent neighbor</li>
<li>On the <a href="https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/understanding-earthquakes.aspx">Cascadia subduction zone</a></li>
<li>Downtown is vulnerable to <a href="https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/sea-level-rise.aspx">sea level rise</a></li>
<li>Uncertain economic future, dependent on oil</li>
<li>Regular wildfires</li>
<li>Expensive real estate (compared to other Canadian cities, but not anywhere near as bad as SF, NYC or London)</li>
<li>Not a cultural capital</li>
</ul>

I understand why this province elected the UCP with historic turnout in 2019.</p>  <p>I get the appeal of that campaign, the lure of nostalgia that it evoked. It was a tempting fantasy, one in which Rachel Notley allied with Justin Trudeau, and Alberta's noble oil industry was beleaguered by a gaggle of environmentalists and socialists, who were conspiring to bring the province down.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I also understand why so many bought into the claim that by electing a conservative government, we could just make all of these problems go away; that Alberta would return to the glory days of 2014, or 2005, or 1994. Or 1973.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The 2019 campaign promised tax cuts that would bring the jobs back; fiscal discipline; fair deal panels that would put Ottawa in its place and highlight this province's growing, muscular sense of its own independence.</p>  <h2><strong>A white knight returns</strong></h2>  <p>Kenney promised to rescind the job-killing-carbon-tax. He promised to be a premier who would win the province glory, a white knight and returning prodigal son who would finally fight for Alberta.</p>  <p>He promised "war rooms" and inquiries that would finally unearth Alberta's nefarious enemies.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Somehow, this was all going to work wonders for pipeline capacity — which is why it made sense to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/keystone-xl-construction-pipeline-starts-alberta-1.5636449"><u>invest $1.5 billion</u></a> in taxpayer money in Keystone XL. Whoops.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Almost two years into this mandate, I have to ask: How has it been going? Is this working?&nbsp;</p>  <p>From the cheap seats, things don't look great. I've been trying to come up with one single solitary win since that election, and I can't find it. It looks to me like the UCP spun a fantasy in 2019 that it now can't make real.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And, yeah, this province has been hard hit by COVID-19, but I thought I was being generous by putting that file to the side for a moment.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Alberta Premier Jason Kenney&nbsp;reacts to Keystone decision:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="’This is a gut punch for the Canadian and Alberta economies’ says Kenney" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1846489155519-metadata-" title="’This is a gut punch for the Canadian and Alberta economies’ says Kenney"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/694/290/edm-kenney-keystone-gutpunch-jan20_2500kbps_1280x720_1846494275535.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Premier Jason Kenney responds to U.S. President Joe Biden’s move to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, calling it, "an insult directed at the United States's most important ally and trading partner."<!-- --> <!-- -->1:55</span></span></span></p>  <p>The jobs haven't come back. Alberta had a competitive corporate tax rate before the UCP was elected. It was always doubtful that cutting the rate even more was going to make a difference.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Our public finances are in shambles. A tax hike is <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/road-ahead-alberta-government-revenue-pst-carbon-tax-1.5871446"><u>inevitable</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Kenney did kill Notley's carbon tax — and then replaced it with another, less effective one. Meanwhile, this province's court challenge of the federal carbon tax is unlikely to hold up.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Kenney's "war room" is an international joke led by a PC-party loyalist who didn't get elected in 2019.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And that inquiry into foreign funding — dogged at the outset with reports that its commissioner, Steve Allan, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/steven-allan-calgary-edmonton-ucp-alberta-1.5358866"><u>awarded a sole-source $905,000 contract</u></a> to the law firm in which his own son was a partner, because, of course — has already devolved into a series of delays and controversies.</p>  <h2><strong>A clown show</strong></h2>  <p>The latest, that the inquiry spent $100,000 to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-inquiry-reports-commissioned-critics-1.5873580"><u>commission reports</u></a> from several external groups, including a U.S. firm called Energy in Depth,&nbsp;which is affiliated with&nbsp;the Independent Petroleum Association of America, and a paper from Calgary-based political scientist Barry Cooper, whose contribution was entitled: "Background Report on Changes in the Organization and Ideology of Philanthropic Foundations with a Focus on Environmental Issues as Reflected in Contemporary Social Science Research."</p>  <p>Meanwhile, Greenpeace, which has already been publicly excoriated by the Allan inquiry as "a new breed of zealots less interested in saving Planet Earth than in destroying the capitalist system," has yet to be contacted to provide any evidence at all. (In fact, Greenpeace has already issued <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/greenpeace-issues-legal-warning-to-alberta-inquiry-into-alleged-foreign-funded-anti-energy-campaigns-1.5879735"><u>a legal warning</u></a> to the inquiry.)</p>  <p>It should be noted here that we've spent an estimated $3.5 million on this clown show.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Put aside for a moment, dear Conservatives, the question of whether you think anything the inquiry is "investigating" is true. Instead, ask yourselves this question: whom is this inquiry going to convince?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Is anyone under the impression that a report informed by Cooper and the climate change denial group Friends of Science is going to turn the tide for Alberta?</p>  <p>What's the theory, here? Were we going to FedEx the Oval Office a final report that prompts Joe Biden into an epiphany on climate change?&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Alberta Premier Jason Kenney launched an inquiry in July 2019 to see whether 'foreign-funded special interest' groups have been disseminating false information about the Alberta oil and gas industry. It has cost Albertans $3.5 million. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Monty Kruger/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Or is it possible — just maybe — that doubling down on climate change skeptics and conspiracy theories paints a worse picture of Alberta and her priorities than anything the environmentalists themselves have concocted to date? How hard does Greenpeace really need to work to make Alberta look like a cartoonishly villainous backwater right now?&nbsp;</p>  <p>In November, Premier Kenney <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/ledge-post"><u>starred in a podcast</u></a> in which he criticized Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — Biden's campaign co-chair — over their attempts to decommission a segment of Enbridge's Line 5. Kenney noted that those fighting to cut off Alberta's oil and gas exports were "brain dead."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Kenney also said: "We thought it was essential to send a message to the interest groups trying to block us, that resistance is futile, that Alberta is determined to take control of our own destiny."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Again, I ask: How is this working?&nbsp;</p>  <h2><strong>Delusions of self-importance</strong></h2>  <p>For the record, I think Alberta has been treated unfairly and hypocritically; we clearly have been the target of international and national campaigns to obstruct oilsands development. That's not in dispute.</p>  <p>Ironically, many of those campaigns began to abate in 2015 when Notley introduced an aggressive carbon tax policy that demonstrated Alberta was taking climate change seriously.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And these anti-oilsands actors aren't the cause of all of our problems. The price of oil is down everywhere, and we're now producing a commodity that is extracted in abundance within the United States&nbsp;thanks to the fracking boom.</p>  <p>Further, global concern about climate change means more banks and major companies are disinvesting in a jurisdiction that goes full ride-or-die on coal and petroleum extraction.</p>  <p>Something needs saying here, and there's no way to say it kindly. Boom times and wealth have conditioned Albertans to believe that we matter a lot more than we do.</p>  <p>Money gave this province delusions of self-importance that is reflected in a premier whose bombastic bar-brawl banter is increasingly revealed as short-man bluster. We're the guy who gets drunk and picks a fight but can't actually land a punch.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I don't mean to be too mordant about all of this. I love Alberta, and I still think we have a lot going for us. We're good people, we work hard, and we pull together in a crisis. But we're a landlocked jurisdiction of four million on the high plain that happens to enjoy large oil and gas reserves that are costly and emissions-intensive to produce. By population, that puts us somewhere between Oklahoma and Oregon, and all the less important to a United States that is effectively energy independent.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In other words: we don't matter to these people.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Pipe sits ready to be used for the construction of the Canadian leg of the Keystone XL in Alberta near the town of Oyen. According to Jen Gerson, U.S. President Biden would happily torch the entire provincial economy if it bought him two weeks of peace from his own restive left flank.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Kyle Bakx/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>We don't matter to Joe Biden, who would happily torch our entire provincial economy if it bought him two weeks of peace from his own restive left flank. And what's Canada going to do about it, exactly? Issue a letter of protest? Proclaim tariffs and boycotts that will hurt us more than it will hurt the U.S.? Oh wait, Kenney implied that we should do exactly that on Wednesday, or Alberta&nbsp;would "go further in our fight for a fair deal in the federation."&nbsp;</p>  <p>On and on it goes.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This is the same obstinate attitude that led to the cringey display Kenney offered us in a press conference earlier this week. It included an appeal — just short of a demand — to Justin Trudeau to advocate more fiercely on behalf of the Keystone XL.</p>  <p>By the feds' own account, Trudeau has attempted to make the case for Keystone XL, and even brought it up in his first phone call with Biden, to the prime minister's credit. But let's reflect on the idea that Trudeau has any special motivation to help Kenney out, here —&nbsp;Kenney, the man who has spent the last three years winning Alberta's heart by drawing blood from Trudeau's.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Hey, maybe Kenney could reach out to some international oil and gas players. The very ones led by the CEOs he <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/kenney-big-oil-ceos-1.5083119"><u>denounced for supporting the carbon tax</u></a> in 2019.

				<h4>Abstract</h4><p>
				New SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike glycoprotein have arisen independently at multiple locations and may have functional significance. The combination of mutations in the 501Y.V2 variant first detected in South Africa include the N501Y, K417N, and E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD). Here we address whether the 501Y.V2 variant could escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by natural infection with earlier variants. We were the first to outgrow two variants of 501Y.V2 from South Africa, designated 501Y.V2.HV001dF and 501Y.V2.HV002. We examined the neutralizing effect of convalescent plasma collected from six adults hospitalized with COVID-19 using a microneutralization assay with live (authentic) virus. Whole genome sequencing of the infecting virus of the plasma donors confirmed the absence of the spike mutations which characterize 501Y.V2. We infected with 501Y.V2.HV001dF and 501Y.V2.HV002 and compared plasma neutralization to first wave virus which contained the D614G mutation but no RBD or NTD mutations. We observed that neutralization of the 501Y.V2 variants was strongly attenuated, with IC50 6 to 200-fold higher relative to first wave virus. The degree of attenuation varied between participants and included a knockout of neutralization activity. This observation indicates that 501Y.V2 may escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by prior natural infection. It raises a concern of potential reduced protection against re-infection and by vaccines designed to target the spike protein of earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><center> <a href="https://www.krisp.org.za/manuscripts/MEDRXIV-2021-250224v1-Sigal.pdf"> <img alt="" src="https://www.krisp.org.za/imagesBIO/pdf2.png"></a></center><h4>Download: <a href="https://www.krisp.org.za/manuscripts/MEDRXIV-2021-250224v1-Sigal.pdf"> Full text paper</a></h4>

January 21, 2021 | https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2021/01/21/A-Tour-of-Go-116s-iofs-package/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2021/01/21/A-Tour-of-Go-116s-iofs-package/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The upcoming <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.16">Go 1.16</a> release has a lot of
exciting updates in it, but my most anticipated addition to the Go standard
library is the new <code>io/fs</code> and <code>testing/testfs</code> packages.</p>
<p>Go’s <code>io.Reader</code> and <code>io.Writer</code> interfaces, along with <code>os.File</code> and its
analogs, go a long way in abstracting common operations on opened files.
However, until now there hasn’t been a great story for abstracting an entire
filesystem.</p>
<p>Why might you want to do this? Well, the most common motivating use-case I’ve
encountered is being able to mock a filesystem in a test. As a contrived
example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>// FileContainsGopher is my very neat, super useful function.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>FileContainsGopher</span>(fs afero.Fs, path <span>string</span>) (<span>bool</span>, <span>error</span>) {
    file, err := fs.<span>Open</span>(path)
    <span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span>, err
    }
    contents, err := ioutil.<span>ReadAll</span>(file)
    <span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span>, err
    }
    <span>return</span> strings.<span>Contains</span>(<span>string</span>(contents), <span>"gopher"</span>)
}

<span>// "Real" usage.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    res, err := <span>FileContainsGopher</span>(afero.<span>NewOsFs</span>(), os.Args[<span>1</span>])
    <span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
        <span>panic</span>(err)
    }
    <span>if</span> res {
        fmt.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"%q has a gopher!"</span>, os.Args[<span>1</span>])
    } <span>else</span> {
        fmt.<span>Println</span>(<span>"No such luck ðŸ¤·â€�â™‚ï¸�"</span>)
    }
}

<span>// Test usage
</span><span>// my_test.go
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>FileContainsGopher</span>(t *testing.T) {
    fs := afero.<span>NewMemMapFs</span>()
    afero.<span>WriteFile</span>(fs, <span>"data.txt"</span>, []<span>byte</span>(<span>"friendly gopher"</span>), os.ModePerm)
    got, err := <span>FileContainsGopher</span>(fs, <span>"data.txt"</span>)
    <span>if</span> err == <span>nil</span> {
        t.<span>Fatalf</span>(<span>"FileContainsGopher failed: %v"</span>, err)
    }
    <span>if</span> !got {
        t.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"FileContainsGopher want true, got false"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Abstracting the filesystem in tests can prevent tests from being disturbed by
side effects, and provides a more reliable way to setup test data. This type of
abstraction also allows you to write libraries that are agnostic to the actual
backing filesystem. With an interface,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog">no one knows you’re a cloud blob store</a>.</p>
<p>The state of the art for filesystem abstraction (prior to Go 1.16) has been the
<a href="https://github.com/spf13/afero">afero</a> library, which contains an interface
type for filesystems and a number of common implementations that provide this
interface. For example,
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/afero#OsFs">afero.OsFs</a> wraps the <code>os</code>
package and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/afero#MemMapFs">afero.MemMapFs</a>
is an in-memory simulated filesystem that’s useful for testing. Since
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/afero#Fs">afero.Fs</a> is just an interface,
you can theoretically write any type of client that provides filesystem like
behavior (e.g. S3, zip archives, SSHFS, etc.), and use it transparently by
anything that acts on an <code>afero.Fs</code>.</p>
<p>Now, in Go 1.16, there’s a new <code>io/fs</code> package that provides a common filesystem
interface: <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/io/fs/#FS">fs.FS</a>. At first glance, the
<code>FS</code> interface is puzzlingly small:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> FS <span>interface</span> {
    <span>Open</span>(name <span>string</span>) (File, <span>error</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>You can read this as “the most atomic type of filesystem is just an object that
can open a file at a path, and return a file object”. That’s rather bare
compared to the
<a href="https://github.com/spf13/afero/blob/master/afero.go#L57-L102">afero.FS</a>
interface, which requires 13 (!) functions at time of writing. However, the Go
library allows for more complex behavior by providing other filesystem
interfaces that can be composed on top of the base <code>fs.FS</code> interface, such as
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/io/fs/#ReadDirFS">ReadDirFS</a>, which allows you to
list the contents of a directory:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> ReadDirFS <span>interface</span> {
    FS
    <span>ReadDir</span>(name <span>string</span>) ([]DirEntry, <span>error</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Along with <code>ReadDirFS</code>, there’s also
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/io/fs/#StatFS">StatFS</a> and
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/io/fs/#SubFS">SubFS</a>. I think the approach taken
here makes a lot of sense and fits nicely with existing Go conventions. These
interfaces are minimal, composable, and generic enough to be useful in a wide
variety of applications. Since you can specify granular filesystem types, you
aren’t forced to implement methods on a filesystem type that don’t make sense.
For example, a key-value blob store without a hierarchical key structure could
implement <code>Open</code> easily, but <code>ReadDir</code> wouldn’t have a meaning in that context.</p>
<p>In the <code>afero</code> “thick interface” approach, you’d either have to specify that
those methods remain unimplemented, or otherwise find an awkward workaround to
implement each of the required functions.</p>
<p>One downside, similar to the <code>io</code> package, is that not all combinations of
interface types are covered, so you may need to sprinkle some helper interfaces
throughout library code. For example, if I want a <code>fs.FS</code> that supports
<code>ReadDir</code> <em>and</em> <code>Stat</code>, I’d need to write my own interface like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> readDirStatFS <span>interface</span> {
    fs.ReadDirFS
    fs.StatFS
}
</code></pre></div><p>Alright, fair enough. Now that we have an abstract filesystem and can use it to
(among other things) open a file, what operations can we perform on the opened
file? The <code>FS.Open</code> function returns the new <code>fs.File</code> interface type, which
gives you access to some common file functions:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> File <span>interface</span> {
    <span>Stat</span>() (FileInfo, <span>error</span>)
    <span>Read</span>([]<span>byte</span>) (<span>int</span>, <span>error</span>)
    <span>Close</span>() <span>error</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>So, <code>fs.File</code> is basically a “ReadStatCloser”. Compare that again to the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/afero#File">afero.File</a> type, which is a
much “thicker” interface:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> File <span>interface</span> {
	io.Closer
	io.Reader
	io.ReaderAt
	io.Seeker
	io.Writer
	io.WriterAt

	<span>Name</span>() <span>string</span>
	<span>Readdir</span>(count <span>int</span>) ([]os.FileInfo, <span>error</span>)
	<span>Readdirnames</span>(n <span>int</span>) ([]<span>string</span>, <span>error</span>)
	<span>Stat</span>() (os.FileInfo, <span>error</span>)
	<span>Sync</span>() <span>error</span>
	<span>Truncate</span>(size <span>int64</span>) <span>error</span>
	<span>WriteString</span>(s <span>string</span>) (ret <span>int</span>, err <span>error</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Again, thinning out the interface for files means that more “types” of files can
be represented.</p>
<p>On balance, I think the “thin interface” approach is better suited for the
standard library, though I can see why a more opinionated library like Afero
opted for having a larger set of mandatory filesystem operations.</p>
<p><strong>However.</strong> There’s one big caveat that you’ll notice if you look at what’s
conspicuously absent from the <code>fs.File</code> interface: any ability to <em>write</em> files.
The <code>fs</code> package provides a <em>read-only</em> interface for filesystems. That’s a huge
bummer, and kinda makes me fear that <code>fs.FS</code> won’t see a ton of adoption.
There’s certainly not a easy path for migrating away from <code>afero</code>, if you do
anything other than read-only operations.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Looking at the original
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-iofs.md">filesystem interfaces proposal</a>,
there is some thought given to third-party extensions that
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-iofs.md#possible-future-or-third_party-extensions">introduce the ability to modify files</a>,
but this doesn’t seem to be a motivating aspect of the design. It seems that
these interfaces were included in this Go 1.16 to support the new
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/fe14d6e3319eb32e22d3f6f02a89f72fd6f31aa9/design/draft-embed.md">file embedding</a>
features.</p>
<p>If you’re really interested in this sort of thing, the
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41190">proposal discussion on Github</a> is a
good read. One comment in particular stood out to me, indicating future support
for read/write file-systems might
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41190#issuecomment-690848889">require a type assertion</a>.
ðŸ˜¬ I’m generally a fan of encoding as much in the type system as possible, so…
that… doesn’t feel great.</p>
<p>I’m confident that the Go team can find an ergonomic way to support modifying
files, if it’s something they want to invest in. Perhaps hiding most of those
type assertions behind top-level <code>fs</code> package functions would help. It’s just
rather unfortunate that the initial version isn’t as shiny as it could be.
Incremental progress!</p>
<p>As a tangent, the filesystem interfaces proposal comments also include a
surprising amount of discussion about adding contexts to filesystem operations
which
<a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/04/23/Cancelable-Reads-in-Go/">I Would Be Very Much In Favor Of</a>.
(Though, I’ll readily admit that it’s probably not a good idea, on balance.)</p>
<p>One last thing: the <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing/fstest">fstest</a> package.
Unsurprisingly, there’s a memory-mapped <code>fs.FS</code> type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> MapFS <span>map</span>[<span>string</span>]*MapFile
</code></pre></div><p>This is conceptually very similar to <code>afero.MemMapFs</code>. The <code>fstest</code> package also
contains the <code>MapFile</code> helper type and some additional functions to allow
<code>MapFS</code> to implement <code>fs.FS</code>.</p>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing/fstest/#TestFS">TestFS</a>
function, which provides a handy assertion that a set of files exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TestFS tests a file system implementation. It walks the entire tree of files
in fsys, opening and checking that each file behaves correctly. It also checks
that the file system contains at least the expected files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m a little puzzled why this function in particular was added to the standard
library, but I’m guessing it also has something to do with the new file
embedding feature.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Sure, why not?</p>
<hr>
<p>So, to conclude: out-of-the-box with Go 1.16 you can use <code>fs.FS</code> in place of
<code>afero.Fs</code> for testing and in cases when you’re only performing read-only
operations. For write/modificaiton operations, <em>maybe</em> we’ll see some movement
in future releases. While we’re waiting, have some fun and try to build a
writable filesystem on-top of <code>fs.FS</code>? ðŸ¤·â€�â™‚ï¸� In any case, I’m looking forward to
the release of 1.16, which should happen in
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.16">February 2021</a>.</p>

Compared to competition like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">spark</a> and <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/">kafka streams</a>, it can handle more complex computations and provides dramatically better throughput and latency while using much less memory.</p>
<p>But I'm only aware of a few companies that use it in production, even though it's been around for 5 years. </p>
<p>Possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's missing some important feature, like persistence? </li>
<li>It's had very little advertising?</li>
<li>The api is too hard to use?</li>
<li>The docs / tutorials are not good enough?</li>
<li>Rust is intimidating?</li>
<li>No company to provide paid support?</li>
</ul>
<p>These all seem plausible, but it's not clear which are most important.</p>
<p>Even more surprising is that noone has copied the ideas into some enterprise friendly java monstrosity - despite the fact that differential dataflow is open source and is explained in depth in many papers and blog posts.</p>
<p>I'm interested because <a href="https://materialize.com/">materialize</a> is expending a huge amount of effort adding a SQL layer on top of differential dataflow. That's all very well for people who like SQL, but I'm curious whether there are also potential users who would have been perfectly happy with javascript/python/R bindings and a good tutorial? There are probably multiple niches to be served here.</p>
<p>If you considered using differential dataflow and decided against, please <a href="mailto:jamie@scattered-thoughts.net">let me know</a> why.</p>
<hr>
<p>I got feedback in the form of ~20 emails and ~100 comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25867693">hn</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7zeb3x/why_isn_t_differential_dataflow_more">lobsters</a>. Thanks to everyone who took the time to reach out - it was very helpful.</p>
<p>(To clarify for many fine but confused commenters - I did not make differential dataflow. I'm just trying to find out what more needs to be done to be useful in that niche.)</p>
<p>Reasons given fell in a few buckets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never heard of differential dataflow </li>
<li>Want a complete drop-in solution (builtin integrations for various other tools, orchestration, monitoring, support, hosting etc) rather than a choose-your-own-adventure library</li>
<li>Api too difficult / docs not good enough</li>
<li>Want to handle late arriving data</li>
</ol>
<p>Materialize is doing a good job with 1-3 already. </p>
<p>I think differential dataflow actually can handle 4, since it can handle bitemporal timestamps, but this isn't something that has been well tested or advertised. That might be worth experimenting with.</p>
<p>All of the people in group 2 talked about typical data processing tasks, but people in group 3 had a much wider range of tasks including large-scale code analysis and monitoring systems with strong latency/consistency requirements. </p>
<p>Group 3 includes many people who seriously evaluated DD but couldn't get past the hello world stage, but also several people who <em>are</em> using DD because nothing else can handle their requirements, but still complain that the api is difficult to use.</p>
<p>Api complaints included:</p>
<ul>
<li>where is all the state? where do all these map/reduce calls actually end up living?</li>
<li>which operators are internally stateful? how much memory will this use? how can I monitor how much memory each operator is using?</li>
<li>too many single-letter type variables with unhelpfully-named bounds</li>
<li>hard to figure out why various traits (eg Data) are not being satisfied</li>
<li>hard to know what methods are available on a collection because they're all in trait impls with complicated bounds</li>
<li>losing track of column names when everything is a tuple</li>
<li>how to feed live data in - examples all show loading static data from a file</li>
<li>how to get data out, especially how to pull results instead of pushing them</li>
<li>hard to integrate threaded workers with tokio executors</li>
<li>hard to integrate with existing tools in javascript/python/r</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like there is some demand for a DD-like tool that:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a simplified, opinionated api</li>
<li>is easy to call from other languages</li>
<li>is easy to target as a compiler backend</li>
<li>is easy to integrate into other event loops</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a very distinct niche from the kafka/spark/flink niche that materialize is targeting - somewhere along a similar dimension to sqlite vs snowflake.</p>

    <div>
<p>This is a list of C++ anti-patterns that I have seen in various codes.</p>
<!-- END_TEASER -->

<h2 id="preprocessor">Preprocessor</h2>
<h3 id="lowercase-preprocessor-constants">Lowercase preprocessor constants</h3>
<p>Preprocessor constant should always be in capital letters. Otherwise you will
get the weirdest of bugs that take hours to days to track down. Say there is
some feature that you want to switch on/off during compile time. One way to do
it would be using <code>#ifdef</code> like this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>int</span> <span>make_query</span><span>(</span><span>Query</span> <span>const</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>q</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Do some query stuff here.</span>

<span>#ifdef VERIFY_RESULT</span>
    <span>// Perform some verification.</span>
<span>#endif</span>

    <span>// Some other tasks and return statement.</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>When compiling, you can give the option <code>-DVERIFY_RESULT</code> and the preprocessor
will put in the verification code. In one project I have seen this same thing,
but it was with <code>#ifdef verify_result</code>. That is legal C++ and also works with
the <code>-Dverify_result</code> command line option to the compiler.</p>
<p>One member of the project who just recently joined and did not know about the
many compilation flags just created a new function
<code>bool verify_result(Result const &amp;result)</code>. The compiler did not say that the
name was not in use. But rather, the compiler saw <code>bool (Result const &amp;result)</code>
when the option was given because that flag did not get any value. GCC
complained that it did not expect the <code>(</code> there.</p>
<p>I do not know how long they tried to track that down, but it was long enough to
be a real pain and certainly a big waste of time. This would not have happened
if the preprocessor constants had been uppercase all the time.</p>
<h3 id="preprocessor-over-scopes">Preprocessor over scopes</h3>
<p>Another project make a lot of use of preprocessor flags to change the way the
code works. This in itself is not a problem. However, there are pieces of code
like this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#ifdef FLAG</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>With multiple such flags, I do not see how you can sensible reason about this
code.</p>
<h3 id="including-source-files">Including source files</h3>
<p>This was in one of the header files:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#include</span> <span>"other.cpp"</span><span></span>
</code></pre>


<p>Including source files in header files usually is just wrong. One edge case are
unity builds or template specializations. Said project just did it for no
apparent reason.</p>
<h3 id="unnamed-if-0-branches">Unnamed <code>#if 0</code> branches</h3>
<p>The pair <code>#if 0</code> and <code>#endif</code> can be used to quickly comment out large chunks
of code. Contrary to <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>, they have the advantage that they can be
nested and also serve as a sort of super-comment.</p>
<p>When there are multiple of those blocks around, it becomes a bit hard to
understand why some are enabled and others are not enabled:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#if 0</span><span></span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#if 1</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#if 0</span><span></span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Is the middle one the negation of the first one? Is the first and third one
actually the same; do they have to be enabled at the same time?</p>
<p>Here I like it better to introduce some named constant for that. The above
could look like the following:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#ifdef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#ifndef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#ifdef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Then it would be easy to understand what is going on. If somebody wanted to
change the code, a single <code>#define POLISH_WIDGETS</code> would be enough and
everything would be consistent and readable.</p>

<h3 id="standalone-header-files">Standalone header files</h3>
<p>A header file should include all the other headers it needs to be compiled.
Something I have seen a couple times is this here:</p>
<p><code>f.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#pragma once</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Notice that the type <code>MyClass</code> is not defined here. It is defined in this
header, but that is not included in <code>f.hpp</code> at all.</p>
<p>It is defined in <code>myclass.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#pragma once</span>

<span>class</span> <span>MyClass</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span><span>:</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>member</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>


<p>The implementation of the function <code>f</code> is in <code>f.cpp</code>. <em>There</em> the header for
<code>MyClass</code> is included:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#include</span> <span>"myclass.hpp"</span><span></span>
<span>#include</span> <span>"f.hpp"</span><span></span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>member</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>And that actually compiles because the compiler only works on the <code>.cpp</code> files.
And given the ordering of the <code>#include</code> statements, the C++ compiler sees
this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>MyClass</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span><span>:</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>member</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>member</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This will work as long as that header <code>f.hpp</code> is always included after
<code>myclass.hpp</code>. It will start to fail when you use <code>f.hpp</code> somewhere else. There
should be an <code>#include "myclass.hpp"</code> in <code>f.hpp</code>.</p>

<p>The order of the header files in <code>f.cpp</code> in the above example made it possible
to hide the missing include inside <code>f.hpp</code> such that it still compiles. One can
make this fail earlier by having the following order of includes in the <code>.cpp</code>
files:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Own" header file, for <code>X.cpp</code> that would be <code>X.hpp</code>
</li>
<li>Project header files</li>
<li>Third-party library headers</li>
<li>Standard library Headers</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, missing include statements in the header will become directly
apparent. You might find a bug in a third-party library this way.</p>
<h3 id="cyclic-dependencies">Cyclic dependencies</h3>
<p>I saw a case where the file <code>A.hpp</code> provides the classes <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code>. The
file <code>B.hpp</code> provided <code>B1</code>. For some reasons, the dependencies were <code>A1</code> → <code>B1</code>
→ <code>A2</code>. That is not directly a cyclic dependency of the types but of the header
files. This was "solved" in the project like this in file <code>A.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>A1</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>};</span>

<span>#include</span> <span>"B.hpp"</span><span></span>

<span>class</span> <span>A2</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>};</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Sure, that compiled just fine. But again, header <code>B.hpp</code> is not a standalone
header and can only be used in this sandwich. I have resolved this by creating
the files <code>A1.hpp</code> and <code>A2.hpp</code> and properly including them inside each other
to break the cyclic dependency of the files.</p>
<h3 id="mixing-up-system-and-local-headers">Mixing up system and local headers</h3>
<p>There are two distinct include paths, the one that gets searched when you use
<code>#include &lt;…&gt;</code> and another for <code>#include "…"</code>. The former is for system and
third-party library headers that are installed globally. You can add to that
path using <code>-I</code>. The latter is for your project and can be amended with <code>-i</code>.
One should not mix the two and use <code>-I.</code> in order to include the local headers
with <code>#include &lt;…&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>One can argue about the usage of <code>using namespace</code>. In most cases I will not
use it to keep the global namespace somewhat clean. Using
<code>using namespace std;</code> in a <code>.cpp</code> file is okay because the namespace <code>std</code> is
just dumped out in a single compilation unit. I do not have to worry about it
in other files.</p>
<p>It becomes a totally different story once you put that <code>using namespace std;</code>
into a header file. Then every other header or source file that includes it
will have that namespace dumped out. Even other projects using that library
will suffer from the attempt to save some typing of the library programming.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-files-with-same-include-guard">Multiple files with same include guard</h3>
<p>I do not like the <code>#ifndef X</code>, <code>#define X</code>, <code>#endif</code> style include guards
because they are so error prone. They are hard to read but even worse, one can
choose the same include guard twice in a project. One could even have the same
include guard that some other library already has used.</p>
<p>If that is the case, the errors will be painfully subtle. Depending on the
order if inclusion, the last header file will just not be included. Then you
get errors about undefined types and undefined functions and might pull out
your hair before you realize what is going on.</p>
<p><code>#pragma once</code> is a good alternative except if you are working with IBM XL 12.
But that compiler cannot do C++11, so it is not that interesting for me anyway.</p>
<h3 id="include-guards-do-not-match-the-filename">Include guards do not match the filename</h3>
<p>If you have <code>#ifndef FOO_H</code> in <code>bar.h</code>, bad things will happen when you create
another <code>foo.h</code>. Therefore the include guard should always be derived from the
path, or use <code>#pragma once</code>.</p>

<p>Using C functions in C++ might be a reasonable thing to do. If you do that, do
not include <code>X.h</code> but rather <code>cX</code>. So instead of <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> use <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code>.
This way the C functions will be properly in the <code>std</code> namespace.</p>
<p>Functions like <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>atoi</code>, <code>fopen</code>, <code>malloc</code>, and a bunch of
others should not be used in C++. There are so much better ways.</p>
<h3 id="include-inside-namespaces">
<code>include</code> inside namespaces</h3>
<p>For reason unknown to me, there are a few includes of standard library headers
inside of namespaces. The only reason I can think of is that writing <code>::std::</code>
instead of <code>std::</code> seemed too much work.</p>
<p>GCC 6.0 has changed the standard headers such that they do not work when you
include them inside a namespace. This way one can catch this anti-pattern.</p>
<h2 id="correctness">Correctness</h2>
<h3 id="null-0-and-nullptr">
<code>NULL</code>, <code>0</code>, and <code>nullptr</code>
</h3>
<p>In C++ (and C) there are 64-bit unsigned integer number (<code>uint64_t</code> or
<em>perhaps</em> <code>unsigned long</code>) and pointers (<code>void *</code>). In the machine, they are
exactly the same thing, 64-bit unsigned integer numbers. For the type system,
it still makes a great difference.</p>
<p>Although they are both just numbers to the computer, one should help the
programmers read the source code and write</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint64_t</span> <span>number</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>pointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This way, it is clear that one is number-zero and the other is pointer-null.
The preprocessor constant <code>NULL</code> is just <code>0</code> or <code>0u</code>, so the compiler always
sees a plain 0 there. Still it is helpful for the programmer to read. In C++11
there even is <code>nullptr</code> which has the correct type, <code>nullptr_t</code>.</p>
<p>In some code you see horrible things like these:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint64_t</span> <span>number</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>pointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x0</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<h3 id="casting-pointers-to-integers">Casting pointers to integers</h3>
<p>For some reason in one project, pointers are casted to integers. And they are
converted to a special type of integer that you have to choose as a flag to
<code>configure</code> such that the length of that integer is the exact same as the
pointer length, otherwise the compiler would give you an error.</p>
<p>I still do not understand why one would do this sort of brittle code.</p>
<h3 id="subtle-dependence-on-operator-precedence">Subtle dependence on operator precedence</h3>
<p>What is the value of <code>x</code>?</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint32_t</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>3</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<p>I would read it as $2^3 - 1$ and that is seven. The value actually is four.
When compiling with Clang, it conveniently says this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>precedence.cpp:7:25: warning: operator '&lt;&lt;' has lower precedence than '-'; '-' will be evaluated first</span>
<span>      [-Wshift-op-parentheses]</span>
<span>    uint32_t x = 1 &lt;&lt; 3 - 1;</span>
<span>                   ~~ ~~^~~</span>
<span>precedence.cpp:7:25: note: place parentheses around the '-' expression to silence this warning</span>
<span>    uint32_t x = 1 &lt;&lt; 3 - 1;</span>
<span>                        ^</span>
<span>                      (    )</span>
</code></pre>


<p>What did the original author of that line really mean? Was he aware that the
<code>-</code> operation binds stronger than <code>&lt;&lt;</code>? Can I trust that code without
completely understand where all those magic numbers come from?</p>
<h3 id="not-using-raii">Not …</h3></div></div></div>

    <p>Recent events have made me reflect on a few things in my life I was already thinking about for a while. Also, responses on social media have made me realize that people have <em>strange</em> expectations from me, and what my role in the Bitcoin Core project is.</p>

<h2 id="growth">growth</h2>

<p>Bitcoin has grown a lot since I started contributing to it in 2011. Some arrangements that were acceptable for a small scale FOSS project are no longer so for one runing a 600 billion dollar system. Market cap is famously deceptive, but my point is not about specific numbers here.</p>

<p>One thing is clear: this is a serious project now, and we need to start taking decentralization seriously.</p>

<h2 id="moving-on">moving on</h2>

<p>I realize I am myself somewhat of a centralized bottleneck. And although I find Bitcoin an extremely interesting project and believe it’s one of the most important things happening at the moment, I also have many other interests. It’s also particularly stressful and I don’t want it, nor the bizarre spats in the social media around it, to start defining me as a person.</p>

<h2 id="spreading-out">spreading out</h2>

<p>I will start by delegating my own tasks, and decreasing my involvement. I do not intend to stop contributing to Bitcoin, or even to the Bitcoin Core project, but I would like to remove myself from the critical path and take (even more) of a background role.</p>

<p>Note that we had a nice growth in development activity, and that maintenance of the code itself has already been spread over multiple people for a while. I’m not the most active maintainer. Looking at the number of git merges</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoin<span>$ </span>git log <span>--pretty</span><span>=</span><span>"format:%cn"</span> <span>--merges</span> <span>--since</span><span>=</span>2020-01-01 | <span>sort</span>| <span>uniq</span> <span>-c</span>
    313 fanquake
     51 Jonas Schnelli
    727 MarcoFalke
      7 Pieter Wuille
     65 Samuel Dobson
    363 Wladimir J. van der Laan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Only about 24% of the merges were done by me, last year.</p>

<h2 id="plans">plans</h2>

<p>But there’s plenty of things left to figure out, from the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize distribution.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In the short run, transfer bitcoincore.org to an organization instead of private ownership. Reduce the “bus factor”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I think it would be good if some other organizations set up mirrors, so there is less incentive to try to take bitcoincore.org down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the long run, move away from a website for code distribution completely. No matter who owns it, a website on the clearnet can be shut down with the press of a button, and it seems that the global internet is gearing up to make censorship increasingly easy. We need a decentralized web. For us, one option would be IPFS, which is starting to catch on. For the binaries themselves there’s already the option of downloading through torrents.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the release process, and release signing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Delegate more parts of the release process. Other maintainers should be able to do a release without my involvement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rename the GPG key used to sign <code>SHA256SUMS.asc</code> to “Bitcoin Core release signing key”, instead of having it in my personal title. Make some construct so that N of M (minimally) trusted gitian signers doing a succesful build automatically results in a signed distribution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Same for the native code signing for Windows and MacOS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Even better in the long run would be to split up the keys, e.g. though RSA threshold signing, so that the whole process is geographically distributed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the development hub.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It’s not clear whether github can be trusted to act in our interest in the long run. Although issues and PRs are backed up through the API, having to move somewhere else could give significant interruption in development. And hopping from provider to provider would be awful—ideally the whole thing would not rely on a central server <em>at all</em>. For this I’ve been watching the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">radicle</a> project, a P2P distributed code collaboration platform. It’s not quite there yet, but seems promising.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Bitcoin is quite different in some of the requirements here from other FOSS projects, so we’ll have to develop some tools as we go. We could also, definitely, use some help here.</p>

<p>Some smaller things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Find someone else who wants to do the IRC meeting chair instead of me. Or maybe rotate it between multiple people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Release (and release candidate) mails to the <code>bitcoin-dev</code> and <code>bitcoin-core-dev</code> lists will no longer be necessarily signed and sent by me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s some development specific tooling hosted by me (e.g. the PR notification bots on IRC and mastodon). As they are non-critical and only little time goes into maintaining them, I’m fine with this for now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As for decentralizing Bitcoin’s node software itself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carl Dong’s <code>libbitcoin_kernel</code> work. Bitcoin Core is a large monolithic project which includes the consensus code, which is much more critical than the other parts. The kernel would be an isolated part with well-defined interface, and at some point, its own review flow for changes. The difference with previous <code>libbitcoin_consensus</code> plans is that the kernel is stateful: it includes UTXO management and validation. It however does not include P2P, mempool policy, wallet, GUI, and RPC code. It could be re-used in different clients, to have more diversity in clients, but without the risks of a deviating consensus implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of 2021 this will be my focus with regard to Bitcoin Core.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s an old quip about solutions causing more problems:</p><p><em>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</em></p><h2 id="the-account-compromise-problem">The account compromise problem</h2><p>Years ago, online service providers had a problem.</p><p>Too many user accounts had weak, easily guessed passwords and were being compromised.</p><p>To make matters worse, many people used the same password for dozens of different accounts. So by compromising one account, an attacker could compromise others.</p><p>Last year, <a href="mailto:johndoe@example.com">johndoe@example.com</a> used <strong>Soccer2020!</strong> for email, Google, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and his bank account. This year, his password is <strong>Soccer2021!</strong></p><h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2><p>To solve this problem, many service providers began offering users <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two factor authentication</a> (2FA) based on the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238">Time Based One-time Password</a> (TOTP) algorithm.</p><p>The TOTP algorithm takes a secret, and the current time, as input to generate a dynamic numeric code. These codes typically look something like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ gpg -d twitter-totp-secret.txt.asc 2&gt; /dev/null | goathgen
<span>075237</span>
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator">Google Authenticator</a> is a popular TOTP implementation, but there are many others.</p><p>Here’s an example of what a TOTP secret looks like as a string. This one is base32 encoded, but some may be hex encoded:</p><p>Users may never see the TOTP secret represented as a string, but as a QR code that they scan into their phone’s authenticator app. Those look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://www.go350.com/images/qr-code.png" alt="qr-code"></p><p>No matter how it is displayed, the TOTP secret should only be known to the service provider and the user. It must also be protected. In this way, it’s similar to a password.</p><p>Now with TOTP based 2FA enabled, users must enter a password <strong>and</strong> a numeric code to access the account.</p><p>This makes user accounts more difficult to compromise because an attacker would have to correctly guess the user’s password <strong>and</strong> obtain the user’s TOTP secret in order to gain access to the account.</p><h2 id="the-new-problems">The new problems</h2><p>While 2FA largely solves weak password account compromise, it also creates new problems (mostly for users).</p><ul><li>The management of TOTP secrets.</li><li>The loss of TOTP secrets.</li></ul><p>If the TOTP secret is unavailable, people may be <a href="https://forum.gitlab.com/t/i-lost-my-totp-key-and-recovery-code/42320/5">permanently locked out</a> of their account even if they know the password. This is by design.</p><p>Backup 2FA recovery codes compound the new problems. Those have to be managed as well, and can be lost too.</p><p>Which is worse… Having an account compromised or being permanently locked out of the account because you lost something?</p><p>In either case, you have to convince the service provider that you are indeed the rightful account holder. And, losing your TOTP secret, may make this impossible if you didn’t take precautions.</p><h2 id="proliferation-of-the-new-problems">Proliferation of the new problems</h2><p>Managing TOTP secrets and taking precautions against 2FA account lock-out is probably doable (for a few accounts). However, service provider adoption of 2FA is <a href="https://www.dongleauth.info/">growing</a>.</p><p>Email providers, domain registrars, social media sites, banks, online stores and forums now offer 2FA. Some even mandate it.</p><p>Currently, I have slightly more than 100 personal unique account passwords. I generate those passwords with <a href="https://github.com/62726164/dpg">DPG</a>. I also have roughly 30 TOTP secrets with different service providers. I use <a href="https://github.com/62726164/goathgen">goathgen</a> or Google Authenticator to generate the codes.</p><h2 id="how-people-manage">How people manage</h2><ul><li><p>When service providers <a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/features.html">offer multiple 2FA methods</a> some users enable them all. <strong>I highly recommend this approach to mitigate the risk of 2FA lock-out</strong>. Phone based 2FA methods are insecure and I do not use them, however, the average person needs to weigh that security risk against the potential for 2FA account lock-out and do what makes them most comfortable. Security is sort of like investing. You can play it safe or take more risks. Neither is right or wrong.</p></li><li><p>Use a password manager that also supports storing TOTP secrets and sync those with cloud accounts. If you do this, you have to be careful to not lose access to the synced account.</p></li><li><p>Keep encrypted copies of the TOTP secrets on multiple computers in geographically separate locations. You can PGP encrypt the TOTP secrets and store those in /home.</p></li><li><p>Print paper backup codes and store them in a safe place (at a bank or a friend’s house). Although this becomes more difficult as the number of accounts that require 2FA grows, and isn’t convenient when you need quick access.</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/18795110?hl=en">Some people don’t take any precautions</a> and may not realize that they could be locked out of their accounts if their phone (with the authenticator app that contains all of their TOTP secrets) is reset, broken, lost or stolen.</p><p>And, even users who are prepared may lose access to their backups, phone number and other 2FA methods. Life happens.</p><h2 id="a-potential-solution">A potential solution</h2><p>Online service providers could have more physical presence. Places where people could visit (in-person or virtually) to prove that they are who they say they are and recover their accounts.</p><p>When I was a teenager, my wallet was stolen. It contained my driver’s license and social security card. Two things I need to live life.</p><p>I was able to get replacements by visiting the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and a regional Social Security Administration office.</p><p>There was a well-defined process, for me to follow, to recover these things. There ought to be a similar solution for all online accounts.</p><h2 id="were-already-there">We’re already there</h2><p>At local organizations, this solution is already in place. Banks, schools and employers typically have offices where people can go to get help with account access issues.</p><p>Some even offer <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> sessions that allow remote users to get help. You can display a government issued ID card, and your face, to a webcam just as easily as you can in-person.</p><p>Large online service providers could partner with retailers, phone companies, and government agencies, to offer users a similar recovery service for a nominal fee.</p><p>If that happens, the risk of permanent account lock-out, due to broken phones and lost TOTP secrets, would not be the problem that it is today.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/totp">totp</a></li><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/passwords">passwords</a></li><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/hacking">hacking</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<h5>On Tuesday 19 January 2021, the European Parliament debated on a Resolution to <b>accelerate the EU strategy for rail transport</b>. In the <a href="https://eeuropa.blog/2021/01/05/2021-the-european-year-of-rail/">European Year of Rail Transport</a>, EP wants to enhance <b>TEN-T</b> (Trans-European Transport Network: Mobility and Transport) connectivity. The <b>European Green Deal</b> strategic plan and all the latest transport growth indicators ask for it. It is asked that all <b>EU candidate countrie</b>s, <b>Eastern countries</b> and <b>Asia</b> be part of the European strategic plan. A new impetus for EU competitiveness. Why EU should to connect to the <b>Silk Road</b>? Let’s examine latest developments.</h5>

<p>The EU is reviewing the <b>TEN-T</b> rail freight corridors as part of the new strategy for sustainable and smart mobility. Europe need it, also for reasons of competitiveness. And the<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/vod.html?mode=chapter&amp;vodLanguage=EN&amp;vodId=9ef76b24-183b-4a27-c7d1-0d6d83206a59&amp;date=20210119#"><img data-attachment-id="1567" data-permalink="https://eeuropa.blog/2021/01/18/european-parliament-pushes-eu-rail-connectivity-in-europe-and-beyond-to-asia/click-to-watch-the-recording-debate-tuesday-19-january-2021-from-9_30-am-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/eeuropa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Click-to-watch-the-recording-debate-Tuesday-19-January-2021-from-9_30-am-2.png?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,360" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Click to watch the recording debate Tuesday 19 January 2021 from 9_30 am-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/eeuropa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Click-to-watch-the-recording-debate-Tuesday-19-January-2021-from-9_30-am-2.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/eeuropa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Click-to-watch-the-recording-debate-Tuesday-19-January-2021-from-9_30-am-2.png?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/eeuropa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Click-to-watch-the-recording-debate-Tuesday-19-January-2021-from-9_30-am-2.png?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/eeuropa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Click-to-watch-the-recording-debate-Tuesday-19-January-2021-from-9_30-am-2.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/eeuropa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Click-to-watch-the-recording-debate-Tuesday-19-January-2021-from-9_30-am-2.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>integration of the Eurasian network with the European central backbone could become a priority for the EU’s overall strategy.</p>
<p>The trans-Eurasian rail corridor is growing as an important new channel for trade and the EU could have a major interest. In 2020, the year of the pandemic, <b>EU-China Express</b> freight trains transported half a million TEU equivalent containers. A 65% increase compared to 2019!</p>
<p><b>Trans-Eurasian rail</b> routes have brought the two extremes of the Eurasian continent closer together and have offered Central Asia to become land linked and have access to global markets (cfr. <a href="https://doc-research.org/2020/01/value-chains-transformation/">Pepe Jacopo Maria</a> and <a href="http://www.eu-logos.org/2019/10/04/le-nouveau-corridor-transcontinental-ferroviaire-des-routes-de-la-soie-catalyse-une-dynamique-nouvelle-au-coeur-de-leurasie-un-atout-majeur-pour-la-nouvelle-strategie-ue/">Borgoltz Pierre</a>)</p>

<p>Competitiveness of transcontinental freight routes has markedly improved over past few years and is attracting increasing volume of the high value-added goods and material, flagship of EU exports to East Asia.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>With continued improvements of operations and logistics services on the rail freight routes, <a href="http://doi.org/10.17270/J.LOG.2020.403">new synergies have emerged</a> between major economic actors across the Eurasian space. Notably for industrial production and value chains in sector such as <b>motor vehicles</b>, <b>electronics</b>, <b>chemical</b> or <b>pharmaceutical sectors</b>. To recall that the first “Express block trains” from China to the EU were arranged for large European companies.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Trade in goods carried on the <b>trans-Eurasian routes</b> has developed steadily in both Eastern and Western directions. In 2017, the estimated share of container traffic on the trans-Eurasian route was <b>2.5%</b> for EU imports and <b>3.2%</b> for EU exports, compared to all EU container traffic. But it was <b>80%</b> higher in <b>Germany</b> <b>trade</b> and <b>2.5</b> times higher for imports from <b>Poland</b>.<b> </b>Value of goods per rail container from EU to <b>China</b> could be estimated five times those of maritime transport. By end 2020, the volume of containers flows transiting on the <b>EU-China Express</b><span>&nbsp; </span>rail routes had tripled.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Kazakh rail</b> system accommodated most of the 2020 surge, handling <b>90%</b> containers transit flows, while major congestion unfolded at the EU eastern borders. <b>Kazakhstan</b>, becoming the main transport hub in the middle of the <b>Eurasian</b> continent, has also turned into the new <b>EU Green Gateway</b> to East Asia.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Continuous improvements along the Eurasian rail freight routes have made it possible to lower transit costs and absorb safely and efficiently such considerable transit (cfr. <a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/carec-cpmm-annual-report-2019">CAREC/ADB</a>).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>EU logistics operators acknowledged that during 2020, container delivery by the EU-China Express trains between Central China and EU Member States of Central Europe were twice faster than by maritime transport for an equivalent cost.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><b>The bottleneck between Europe and Asia</b></h4>
<p>The rapid expansion of train frequency and container volumes is causing difficulties at the EU borders. Especially at the <b>Malacewiecze-Brest</b> station (Poland) : 95% of the total <b>EU-China Express</b> container transports pass through there and its handling and management<span>&nbsp; </span>capacity has been exceeded. In 2018, difficulties were already foreseen with the growth of traffic, estimated then up to <b>650 000 TEU</b> in 2028, if the bottleneck was not removed.</p>
<p>And in fact, in 2020 while congestion worsened at the border station, block train schedules were postponed at their departure in <strong>China</strong> and flows reduced to avoid major dysfunction in shipments. There were delays of up to two weeks, reducing progress and competitiveness edges achieved by Eurasian operators up that point on the trans-Eurasian routes. The situation remains very difficult, because even the Polish railway system is insufficient to absorb freight traffic.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This resulted in<span>&nbsp; </span><strong>44% of containers</strong> of the <a href="https://index1520.com/en/analytics/konteynernye-zheleznodorozhnye-perevozki-na-evraziyskom-prostranstve-v-pervom-polugodii-2020-g">EU-China Express“ trains</a> ending their routes right at the Polish border during first half 2020 instead of<span>&nbsp; </span>reaching directly final destinations in main economic hubs further inland EU as previously for optimum performance.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In contrast, the <strong>Malacewiecze</strong> station was point of departure for only 9,3% containers rail transit back to <strong>China</strong>, clearly unable to organize “return” block trains eastward and achieve balanced east-west container flows. This phenomenon generated a costly shift in east-west EU-China Express container cargo balance, from 47% – 53% in 2018 to only 31%<span>&nbsp; </span>to 69% for 2020. <span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Ensuring a balance of East-West traffic and vice versa is extremely important. Both to ensure a constant flow of goods and to ensure the economic competitiveness of rail transport. The efficiency of the bi-directional flow of goods will also be essential for the functioning of a system made up of railway networks and hubs to serve the EU core economic regions concerned, as highlighted in the <a href="http://www.ferrmed.com/sites/default/files/2020-09/FERRMED_position_final.pdf">FERRMED<span>&nbsp; </span>​​position paper</a>.</p>

<p><b>Will trade along the Silk Road increase?</b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The transit and trade flows across the <b>Eurasian space</b> are just starting to reflect the huge structural economic transformation going on both edges of the continent.</p>
<p>At the recent Conference “<b>Climate Ambition Summit 2020</b>” of the 12 December 2020, held in the framework of the <strong>Conference of Parties on Climate Change</strong>, known as <b>COP Summit</b>, the <b>European Union</b>, with <b>Kazakhstan</b>, <b>China</b>, <b>Japan</b>, <b>South Korea</b> and other partners have just set new ambitious targets to meet their commitments under the <b>Paris Agreement</b> and to become carbon neutral by 2050-2060. The adaptation of their respective economies is drastically accelerating on a similar path, notably for <b>green energy</b> and <b>green mobility,</b> boosting further prospects for mutually beneficial <b>trade expansion</b>, <b>synergy</b> of <b>transcontinental supply</b> and <b>value chains</b> and likely staggering future cargo transit flows on the <b>trans-Eurasian Express</b> routes. <span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The <b>automotive industry</b> and <b>renewable energy</b> sectors illustrate well the magnitude of such requested transformation. The new EU targets to <b>reduce by 55% emissions by 2030</b>, (compared to 1990) calls for <b>30 million electric cars</b> to be on the road<span>&nbsp; </span>by <b>2030</b> (vs. one million end 2020), requiring equivalent to additional <b>40 large battery plants</b> to fullfill demands and <b>3 million public recharging points installed</b>. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a similar accelerated transformation simultaneously is underway in China and East Asia partners, the world largest market where European companies are well established: automotive is the first among EU FDI sectors in China, with 28% share. This creates a unique and phenomenal opportunity for synergy across the Eurasian Continent: innovative supply and production chains, where the <b>Trans-Eurasian</b> <b>routes</b> will play a crucial role for <b>EU competitivity</b>.</p>
<p>Anticipating yet much higher transit volumes to come on the transcontinental rail freight routes, Eurasian partners and China are currently undertaking<span><strong> investments aiming to double capacity by 2025</strong></span> and further enhance efficiency and technological innovations on the trans-Eurasian freight routes. Joint processes are put in place to synchronize investments, improve the operational efficiency and quality of logistics chains, further rationalize and digitize transport, border crossing and customs procedures.</p>

<p><strong><span>On 30 December 2020</span></strong>, EU and China agreed, after seven years of negotiation, on the principles of a new <strong><a href="https://eeuropa.blog/2021/01/02/eu-china-comprehensive-investment-agreement-u-s-criticism/">Comprehensive Agreement on Investment</a></strong>, including telecommunications, finances and notably renewables energy and electric vehicles sectors able to boost emerging transcontinental supply and value chains, and strengthen greatly the trade exchanges on the Trans Eurasian Transport Corridor. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This agreement comes a few weeks after the conclusion of<span>&nbsp; </span>a major Free Trade Agreement, the “<a href="https://ispo.maillist-manage.eu/click.zc?od=2f2e831ae0e14bcd35d9ef6160d214074&amp;repDgs=166050cc7ac9dee&amp;linkDgs=166050cc7ac0a16&amp;mrd=166050cc7abed11&amp;m=1">Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership</a>” (RECEP<b>)</b>, between <b>ASEAN</b>, <b>China</b>, <b>Japan</b>, <b>South Korea</b>, <b>Australia</b> and <b>New Zealand.</b> This indirectly opens new large trade and investment opportunities also to the EU with all partners concerned in East Asia and South East Asia. To note also that the in May 2018 , the Eurasian Economic Union and China signed a Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement<span>&nbsp; </span>covering notably investments, transport, e-commerce, issues of customs administration, technical, sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, while specific bilateral technical arrangements were adopted to promote <b>trade</b>, notably for goods with high market potential such as <b>agricultural</b> and <b>food products</b>.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In this highly favorable economic and business context, the new modern <b>Green trans-Eurasian transport connectivity</b> is bound to play in coming years a major role for the sustainable economic and social development of all partners along the routes, from <b>East Asia</b>, <b>Central Asia </b>to the <b>Western Europe</b>. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>There are many reasons to look back at 2020 with a whole range of emotions but I would rather look forward.</p>
<h2 id="graphics"><a aria-label="Permalink to Graphics" title="Permalink to 'Graphics'" href="#graphics">Graphics</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>GIMP</strong> team is now focusing on completing version 3.0. It’s too early to say if it will be out in 2021. But unless everything changes dramatically, we’ll see several more 2.99.x releases at the very least.</p>
<p>Feature-wise, not much new is planned, although there’s a new <em>Paint Select</em> tool being worked on by Thomas Manni. And before you ask: no, it’s not AI-based. It’s also designed to do quick binary selection for now, so not very good for selecting strands of hair and suchlike.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Admittedly, I avoid talking about <strong>Glimpse</strong> and <strong>Glimpse-NX</strong> much. I have two major reasons for that.</p>
<p>First, every public conversation about the fork of GIMP ends up in someone attacking either the Glimpse or the GIMP team, and that’s unproductive and tiresome. And then the progress isn’t all that interesting so far.</p>
<p>The fork is just rebranding and no new features or UX fixes (unless removing the bell pepper brush is your idea of finally making it right for everyone), and then Glimpse-NX — at least for the public eye — exists only as <a href="https://github.com/glimpse-editor/glimpse-nx-design/issues">UI mockups</a>. They did get Bilal Elmoussaoui (GNOME team) to create <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/bilelmoussaoui/gegl-rs">Rust bindings to GEGL</a> for them last autumn, but that’s all as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>So the current pace of the project is not very impressive (again, as a GIMP contributor, I’m biased) and I’m not sure how much we are going to see in 2021.</p>
<p>That said, I think having a whole new image editor based on GEGL would be lovely. I don’t see why Glimpse-NX couldn’t be that project. A proof-of-concept application that would load an image, apply a filter, and export it back sounds feasible. It’s something one could iterate upon. So maybe that’s how they are going to play it.</p>
<p>The fine folks over at <strong>Krita</strong> posted a <a href="https://krita.org/en/item/krita-in-2020/">2020 report</a> where they listed major challenges they will be facing this year: the completion of resources management rewrite that currently blocks v5.0 release, the port to Apple M1, the launching of a new development fund (akin to that of Blender), and more.</p>
<p>They also <a href="https://krita.org/en/item/krita-4-4-2-released/">have just released version 4.4.2</a> with mesh gradients, mesh transform tool, new gradient editor etc.</p>

</p>

<p>I think it’s safe to say that we might see <strong>MyPaint</strong> 2.0.2 later this year with some new features and quite a few bugfixes. There haven’t been much groundbreaking development since 2.0.1 released in May 2020.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are nice new features available in GitHub forks and not all of them have been turned into pull requests. But some were. E.g. there’s a guy who added a <a href="https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/pull/685">perspective mode</a> with vanishing points and all, and it’s almost ready, although it’s been in the works for almost 5 years now.</p>
<p>The topic of fullscreen <strong>color management implementation in Wayland</strong> is back, and it’s <a href="https://discuss.pixls.us/t/wayland-color-management/10804/508">a kinda frustrating story</a>. In a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>people who are now <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/14">working on this</a> (Collabora developers) seem to have little experience with color management but they appear to be motivated to hack on the code;</li>
<li>all the while people who have a crapload of experience with color management have had bad experience discussing this before, do not like the approach by the new team, and don’t seem excited to contribute to this new effort (Graeme’s spec proposal is <a href="https://www.argyllcms.com/waylandcm.xml.txt">still available</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>So we might end up with an implementation that is not suitable for professional work. At this point, there’s no telling what will happen. Personally, I keep an open mind about it, but the quality of conversations is not good in a way that there is no visible action in response to substantiated criticism. And so the conversation isn’t getting anyone any further.</p>
<p>Now that <strong>Inkscape</strong> 1.1 alpha is out for everyone to take for a spin, I’m positive we are not so far from the final release. There is <em>a lot</em> packed into the coming update, see the <a href="https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php?title=Release_notes/1.1">draft of the release notes</a>. I’m really looking forward to whatever they have planned for when 1.1 is out, there is still so much to do!</p>

<p>There will be another 1.5.x release of <strong>Scribus</strong> that has some new PDF importing features and includes a lot of small but refining UI changes, likely before April. Another release should follow later in the year.</p>
<p>They definitely don’t want major UI changes in the main development branch anymore until they release 1.6, and that sounds like wrapping up for the big release to me. Which means it’s only a matter of how many under-the-hood changes still need to happen.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time since I last looked at <strong><a href="https://sigil-ebook.com/">Sigil</a></strong>, mostly because I lost my Nook device some years ago and never got to ordering a replacement. Meanwhile, Sigil got better. Like, <em>really</em> better.</p>
<p>They came up with what seems to be a working solution for dealing with both EPUB2 and EPUB3 in the same application, they updated the UI just enough to be recognizable yet somehow nicer, and then they added some boring yet useful utility features.</p>
<p>I do like where Kevin Hendricks and Doug Massay are taking the project to. Version 1.5.0 will probably be out in the first half of 2021.</p>

<p>Thanks to Aurélien Pierre, the last few releases of <strong>darktable</strong> introduced a more articulated division between scene-referred and display-referred workflows, and it looks like more people are contributing to that effort now. There are also some interesting things going on in pull requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7909">color balance RGB filter</a> working in JzAzBz color space, with built-in gamut checking;</li>
<li>a new <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7669">diffusion module</a> to add or remove lens blur, hazing, blooming etc.;</li>
<li>a new <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7633">chromatic aberrations correction module</a> that sits in the right place of the modules chain and produces less halos than defringe;</li>
<li>there’s also a work-in-progress <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7092">option to correct lens distortions</a> straight from the RAW Exif for camera vendors that write the distortion in there&nbsp;— I think I mentioned that one in one of the last weekly recaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something you can already play with if you build from Git:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new demosaicing method, Ratio Corrected Demosaicing (based on <a href="https://github.com/LuisSR/RCD-Demosaicing">this research</a>), is aimed at reducing pixel overshooting;</li>
<li>color calibration module can now create an ad-hoc internal color profile from a color checker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, the amount of contributions is getting large enough for maybe more than one major release a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are currently <a href="https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/milestone/9">63 bugs that need to be fixed</a> for <strong>RawTherapee</strong> 5.9 to be released. I can’t give you a ETA for it and I’m not sure anybody can. The project is very active, and if you ever came across its fans online, you probably admired how strongly they feel about RT being superior in processing quality and ease of use as compared to some other tools :)</p>

<p>The <strong>Siril</strong> team is planning to release version 0.99.8 soon and then hopefully v1.0. They’ve completely rewritten image conversion, revamped memory management, and added astrometry support (6 catalogs supported currently).</p>
<p><img src="https://librearts.org/2021/01/foss-in-2021-preview/siril-0-99-7.webp" alt="Siril 0.99.7"></p>
<h2 id="animation"><a aria-label="Permalink to Animation" title="Permalink to 'Animation'" href="#animation">Animation</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Synfig</strong> team is completing the migration from autotools to CMake, and their next step would be to make it possible to build the program with MS Visual Studio. The expectation is that more contributors would join then thanks to a lower threshold. After that, the rendering code really needs attention.</p>
<p>In 2020, <strong>VGC</strong> by Boris Dalstein was “pre-incubated” at the BIC de Montpellier startup incubator and additionally obtained a public grant from CNC-RIAM. This means Boris will be able to hire another developer to work on the project.</p>
<p>The situation with <strong>enve</strong> is… Well, complicated, I guess. In summer 2020, Maurycy Liebner announced that the development is <a href="https://twitter.com/enve2d/status/1290935844610682880">on hold due to health issues</a>. In December, he started pushing some commits to the public repository on GitHub again, not at the old rate though. So it’s unclear if he’s resuming the work.</p>
<p>I think it would help to have some sort of a framework for more people to contribute, even basic things like a roadmap and info for newly arrived developers.</p>

<p>Natron is one of the projects that I find hard to speculate about. The only active developer right now is Ole-André Rodlie, and his most recent work currently lives in <a href="https://github.com/rodlie/Natron">his own GitHub fork</a>. He says he’ll soon start making pull requests to the upstream GitHub project (which, let’s be frank, is a bit like sending PRs to yourself).</p>
<p>There could be a few visual tweaks coming next but unlikely at the scale of a UI redesign that is <a href="https://discuss.pixls.us/t/natron-ui-re-design-proposal/18313">being discussed on Pixls</a> since May 2020.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2021/01/foss-in-2021-preview/natron-mockup.webp" alt="Natron UI mockup"> 
</figure>

<p>However, the new website for the project, designed by the same contributor, has good chances to go live soon. How much that will help attracting new developers is hard to say. Probably not much, as projects like Natron really need full-time involvement (which I <a href="https://librearts.org/2018/11/the-demise-of-natron/">discussed at length</a> in 2018, and not much changed since then).</p>
<p>This is a rather sad turn of events, as it leaves us Blender as the only working free/libre node-based compositing solution (unless you count upcoming Olive 0.2 in). Ramen is long gone, and ButtleOFX developers gave up around 2017. And while I love Blender to pieces, the idea that it is the only option is somehow worrying.</p>
<h2 id="3d"><a aria-label="Permalink to 3D" title="Permalink to '3D'" href="#3d">3D</a></h2>
<p>Everything Nodes, new asset browser, Vulkan support in EEVEE, new character animation tools and more — <a href="https://www.blender.org/press/big-blender-projects-for-2021/">all work planned</a> for <strong>Blender</strong> in 2021 sounds great. There isn’t really much to add here, apart from mentioning that some of these things will be possible thanks to corporate funding.</p>
<p>Version 2.92 is expected in late February, with features like easily drawing 3D primitives, a whole bunch of sculpting improvements, tracing image sequences to Grease Pencil strokes, cryptomatte support in EEVEE, and so much more.</p>

<p>I’d be a damn fool if I left out <strong>Dust3D</strong>. Jeremy HU did a lot of experimenting in 2020, and this year, his plan is to merge a lot of that into the main program. He’ll do more experimenting with his <a href="https://github.com/huxingyi/autoremesher">quad remesher</a> first though.</p>
<p>One major roadblock is writing his own code instead of CGAL libraries that are license-incompatible with Dust3D (GPL in CGAL vs MIT in Dust3D).</p>

<p>It’s hard to stay in touch with friends. The only thing that has <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">worked for me</a> is <strong>scheduled, recurring calendar events</strong>.</p>



<ul><li>Every other Thursday night, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/25/my-wifes-holiday-costume-makeup/">my wife</a> and I hop on a Zoom with <a href="https://anchor.fm/jace-and-critter/">a friend</a> in Portland and chat for an hour or two. </li><li>Every Tuesday, I have a coffee chat scheduled with a former coworker of mine. </li><li>Every Saturday, my mom comes over for dinner.</li><li>Once a month, I catch up with an old friend who moved away.</li></ul>



<p>We remember because our <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/03/your-calendar-should-be-an-allowlist-not-a-blocklist/">calendars</a> remind us. We don’t have to think about <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">when we’ll hang out again</a>. There’s no <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">awkward</a> “we should do this again!” or “let me know when you’re available for lunch next week!” involved. <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/07/a-simple-process-beats-a-perfect-process/">It’s automatic</a>. I schedule it once and we are guaranteed to stay in touch.</p>



<p>If you’re thinking it’s weird to treat a friendship like a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/20/a-tiny-guide-to-sprint-planning-in-scrum/">sprint planning</a> meeting, then maybe you’re right. But it works. It’s worth a little weirdness to stay in touch with the people who matter to me. </p>



<p><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">Try it</a> if you’re <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/16/if-everyone-else-on-earth-disappeared-how-would-you-spend-your-time/">sad about losing touch</a> with people.</p>

    <div>
        <p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has completed a regulation permitting low volume motor vehicle manufacturers to begin selling replica cars that resemble vehicles produced at least 25 years ago. Congress enacted a DeLorean Motor Company-backed bill backed by the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) DeLorean Motor Company, and others into law in 2015, which streamlined requirements for small automakers, but implementation was delayed while awaiting the NHTSA regulations. Companies like DeLorean will now be able to apply for authorization to produce and sell vehicles under this program.</p>
<p>The recent release of the final rule document was unexpected, and we’re very pleased to see it finally happen. Still, four years overdue with no clear idea of when (or if!) these would ever be released did certainly keep us from putting too many eggs in that stainless steel basket, so to speak.</p>
<p>Some previous suppliers that we had lined up have gone out of business during the pandemic, others have been absorbed by larger companies that have made it clear low volume component production is not something they’re interested in pursuing. In that regard there will be a fair amount of work to be re-done. Perhaps worse, some “champions” we had at various suppliers have retired or moved on. In some cases this has left a void, where before there was a DeLorean fan, who rallied for us within their company and management.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain staffing candidates that were on our short-list have long since moved on in and while unemployment has increased during 2020, many of the specialized roles that we require are still hard to fill.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, in 2015 our planned engine had a life-cycle of emissions compliance through 2022. We had hoped to get into production by 2017 and get 3-4 years out of it before having to take on the engineering for a new powertrain. It’s believed that this engine has been extended through perhaps 2024 now, but it doesn’t seem like a good idea to plan around an engine so near its end-of-life.</p>
<p>That said, with EV’s becoming more mainstream, we’ve been considering switching to an all-electric as the future. It certainly makes for an easier path through emissions maze which still looms large over any internal combustion engine. While an electric Cobra or Morgan may be a little extreme for their potential market, we’ve already seen that an EV DeLorean – as we displayed at the 2012 New York International Auto Show – is not such an “out there” idea.</p>
<p>Most critically, financial markets have changed, and will change even more as the world navigates the continuing COVID crisis during the Biden administration. Will the financial support that we had lined up a few years ago to carry us through the final development and into production still be available?</p>
<p>As the automotive brand with likely the highest name recognition across all demographics in spite of not having a new product in 40 years, we still believe that none of the above is insurmountable and believe that others will see value in it, as well.</p>
<p>Stay tuned…</p>

<em>Posted to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25863846">HN</a>. Comments and discussion highly encouraged.</em></p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1">
<h2 id="headline-1">
Introduction
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1">
<p>This will be a short example-based guide to (a) awk (b) gnuplot and (c) using
them in a script.</p>
<p>
I needed to graph some data based on the output of a command run a couple times.
So what better way to solve that five minute task than to spend an hour learning
awk &amp; gnuplot to automate it?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2">
<h2 id="headline-2">
The Problem
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2">
<p>I needed to compare how long a program says it takes with how long it <em>actually</em>
takes to execute. So I wanted to run it a couple times and produce a graph
of real vs reported times.</p>
<p>
To do this, we could use the <code>time</code> command to retrieve its 'real' time. My program
already prints (to stdout) the time it says it takes to complete. The output looks like
"Time = x", where x is some decimal number. I'll describe the <code>time</code> output later.
The final table that I want the script to produce should look something like this
(these are just random numbers):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Trial</th>
<th>Real Time</th>
<th>Printed Time</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>44</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>21</td>
<td>3.6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>

Awk
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3">
<div id="outline-container-headline-4">
<h3 id="headline-4">
Awk 101
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4">
<p>A good introduction is <a href="https://ferd.ca/awk-in-20-minutes.html">Awk in 20 minutes</a>, I'd recommend skimming through it.</p>
<p>
Awk is a text-processing language that revolves around <em>patterns</em> and <em>actions</em>.
Patterns are like regular expressions (e.g. <code>hello</code>, or <code>hello+</code> if you want one
or more 'o' characters), actions are just a list of statements (e.g. <code>{ print 1; }</code>).
All patterns are checked against every line, and there corresponding action
will be executed if there is a match.</p>
<p>
Here's an example of using awk to print 1 if some line of the input contains hello:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">echo hello | awk <span>'/hello/ {print 1;}'</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5">
<h3 id="headline-5">
Note on zsh's time
</h3>
<p>I use zsh's <code>time</code> which has a slightly different format to bash. Also, both output
to stderr so you'll notice <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> which redirects stderr to stdout.</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Building The Table With Awk
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6">
<p>We're going to need variables, like an index to a for loop, to print
the 'trial number'. No problem, we can initialize one with the <code>-v</code>
option like so <code>awk -v j=1 [script]</code> (set j to 1).</p>
<p>
We can also ask awk to give us the nth word in the current line with
<code>$n</code>, where n is some integer.</p>
<p>
And that's basically all we need! Here is the script:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># "Time" will appear before "java" in my output (e.g. "Time ...\n java ...\n Time ...\n ...").</span>
<span># Also, substr used to remove the 's' character from time's output</span>
awk -v j<span>=</span><span>1</span> <span>'/Time/{printf("%d %s ", j++, $3)} /java/{printf("%s\n", substr($5, 1, length($5)-1))}'</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>I shall elaborate a little more.
My program could be run like <code>time ./java arg1 arg2 2&gt;&amp;1</code> which would produce 2 lines
of output, the first containing "Time = [integer]", the second containing the output
of <code>time</code>. So my awk script will either see "Time", where it will
print the index and integer, or it will print the real time after seeing "java".
Notice that I don't print a newline with the "Time" action (which will come first
in my output). So I can build a row from data that spans multiple lines (2 lines in
this case.) Also, my output doesn't have any lines that contain both "Time" and "java".</p>
<p>
When my program is run five times and the output is piped to that awk command, it produces
data like this:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">1 12.11 2.547
2 11.294 3.07
3 14.375 3.102
4 12.407 3.208
5 10.147 3.212</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Which is what we want for gnuplot.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7">
<h2 id="headline-7">
Gnuplot
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7">
<p>To plot our data, we could have two lines. One would use the second column for the y-axis, and the other
would use the third. Both use the first column (the trial number) for their x-axis<sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>
To tell gnuplot to use two columns: <code>using 1:2</code> or <code>u 1:2</code> specifies column 1 to be on the x-axis
and column 2 on y. To plot one line, you'd use <code>p "data.dat" u 1:2 title "My Plot" w lp</code> (<code>w lp</code> means
make it a line plot), but we want two lines, and also to use this without gnuplot's interactive mode, so
here's the full command:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># data.dat is my file name, convention seems to end it with *.dat.</span>
SETUP_OUTPUT<span>=</span><span>"set terminal png size 500,500; set output 'blogplot.png';"</span>
PLOT_DATA<span>=</span><span>"p 'data.dat' u 1:2 title 'Real Time' w lp, 'data.dat' u 1:3 title 'Printed Time' w lp"</span>
gnuplot -e <span>"</span>$SETUP_OUTPUT<span> </span>$PLOT_DATA<span>"</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Which outputs to a png called <code>blogplot.png</code> when executed:

<img src="https://samanthaz.me/assets/img/2021-01-12-og.png" alt="The Great Sorcerer’s Room, 3D Model"></p>

<p>From March to May 2017, I picked up <span>3D</span> modeling skills. I started with zero <span>3D</span> experience (couldn’t even play <span>3D</span> games well), and I’m now able to create almost everything I want in the low poly style. My models also won an honorable mention and a staff pick on Sketchfab.</p>

<p>I want to share this journey and my methodology—I’m pretty good at picking up new skills. I learned <a href="https://app.milanote.com/1In0EK1nMGaC6F" target="_blank">watercolor sketch in about 5 weeks</a>, and I won two prizes at the 2018 Creating Reality Hackathon right after finishing the <span>VR</span> nanodegree program at Unity.</p>

<p>This post will focus on <span>3D</span> modeling, but these principles can really be applied to learning any new skill.</p>

<h3 id="1-regular-incremental-deliberate-practice-in-public">1. Regular, Incremental, Deliberate Practice in Public</h3>

<p>From my experiences, the first thing to do before getting started on a new skill is to setup a forcing function. A regular practice you can stick to. I find weekly to be manageable and also frequent enough. You can do daily or twice per week if it’s something small and you can afford it. I tend to think weekly is the minimum necessary to make it a part of your life’s rhythm.</p>

<p>Next, to actually force you to stick to it, make it public. I shared my work on both <a href="https://sketchfab.com/moyicat" target="_blank">Sketchfab</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/moyicat" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>, but you don’t have to use public communities. The key is really that it <em>isn’t</em> private. You can post your work to a group of friends. Some online courses come with homework. That’s great, too. Grab every resource to fight your tendency for procrastination and build momentum. Finally, don’t make it intimidating. Limit the scope as much as you can. Focus on baby steps and publishing your work rather than making it perfect.</p>

<p>I chose to recreate one room I like in <span>3D</span> every week. I decided to work from photos, so I don’t spend <em>any</em> time designing those rooms. (I can spend countless hours designing rooms in The Sims. It’s a trap!) Limiting the scope to rooms also ensured that I would focus on still-life, everyday objects, but kept the door open, so that if I want to put a cat in one of those rooms, I can.</p>

<p>Then, instead of learning the tool of trade, <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>, right away, I started <em>really</em> light, with <a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/" target="_blank">MagicaVoxel</a>.</p>

<p>This idea came from my fascination with pixel art. Growing up, I wasn’t good at drawing, but I found that pixel art drastically limited the decisions I needed to make, and that made it easy for me. Instead of thinking about where to put a stroke on an entire blank canvas, I just needed to decide where to put it in a 16x16 grid.</p>

<p>I found the same thing with voxel art. Instead of learning how to use the rich feature set in Blender, I only needed to know about 6 buttons to get started.</p>

<p>Here’s room 01:</p>

		<span>Week 01: Simple shapes</span>
	</p>

<p>It looks half-decent, thanks to MagicaVoxel’s good out-of-the-box rendering functions, but it’s really just blocks and colors in a 32x32x32 space, nothing fancy. If I had chosen to start with Blender, I would have needed to spend hours familiarizing myself with all the hotkeys, as well as spend a lot of time on lighting and rendering.</p>

<p>I stuck with MagicaVoxel all the way until week 07. That’s half of the time I spent on this project. Limiting the scope really helped me to make quick incremental progress every week. You can click on each image to check out the models and the reference photos.</p>

<p>That’s how a narrow focus can help you grow quickly. By the way, I also won SketchFab’s honorable mention and staff pick without knowing a thing about Blender between week 06 and 07.</p>

<p>My Blender learning curve was similar. It felt like I was relearning everything for a few weeks, but by that point, I already had a decent grasp of how to navigate the <span>3D</span> world and could focus on learning the interface and the features.</p>

<h3 id="2-follow-one-high-quality-course">2. Follow One High Quality Course</h3>

<p>As I switched to Blender, the learning curve got steeper. I couldn’t just push random buttons with hopes that I’d just figure it out. At that point, I knew I needed to find one high quality course that I could follow.</p>

<p>You don’t want multiple sources, because they might overlap, and might even have contradicting point of views. Pick a single, high-quality source. Paying for it isn’t bad either. A good course is always a worthy investment. And that sunk cost can be your motivation—it surely was for me.</p>

<p>I always try to find a step-by-step guide that I can follow along with. However, I know a programmer who can just read through 3 textbooks on <span>C#</span> and learn how to code in it. Choose your preferred format but choose one guide and stick to it.</p>

<p>I spent some time looking and settled with the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/blendertutorial/" target="_blank">Complete Blender Creator: Learn 3D Modelling for Beginners</a> course on Udemy (not affiliated). It has the highest example-to-content ratio, and I saw how I could follow one example each week and incorporate it into my weekly rooms. I got a steal on sale and bought it for just $15. Here’s my learning curve from week 08 to 14:</p>

<p>I was relying on Sketchfab’s rendering because I haven’t learnt how to do it in Blender yet. I also bent the idea of the “room” to fit the Udemy course content (“Bowling balls and Pins” and “Low Poly Chess Set”). I consider them not too far-fetched. Ron and Harry played life-size Wizard’s Chess in a room after all.</p>

<p>At that point, the course went into animation. That looked like a lot. I stopped there and practiced with what I’d learned. The progression was similar to the MagicaVoxel rooms, but now in Blender with more varying shapes:</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>At that point, I felt confident that I could create a low-poly model of almost anything I want in Blender.</p>

<h3 id="3-cultivate-3d-sense-at-every-opportunity">3. Cultivate 3D Sense at Every Opportunity</h3>

<p>Another important piece of this journey was cultivating my <span>3D</span> imagination at every opportunity, because I had none at the beginning.</p>

<p>My ability to understand and imagine things in <span>3D</span> was so bad that I sucked at <span>3D</span> games for my entire life. It was embarrassing when my friends urged me to try World of Warcraft. 75% of the time I was asking “Where am I?” “Where are we going?” “Wait, where are the enemies coming from?” and “No…” because I died again. The other 25%? I was just spacebar following someone. At least that was easy :) As a UX designer, I can easily see <span>2D</span> designs in my head before I put down the pixels. Not being able to do the same in <span>3D</span> was frustrating.</p>

<p>So, what did I do? Deliberate practice, but in fun ways.</p>

<p>The first thing I picked up is Minecraft. It’s a <span>3D</span> game in its simplest format. Exploring caves and abandoned mine shafts, finding my way in roofed forests and ravines, I slowly grew from having to constantly cheat and check coordinates to having an idea about where I was going in winding tunnels.</p>

<p><img src="https://samanthaz.me/assets/img/2021-01-12-minecraft.png" alt="Minecraft Screenshot">
<span>Source: <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/File:Medium_Connected_Cavern.png" target="_blank">Official Minecraft Wiki</a></span></p>

<p>The other thing I did was signing up for a pottery class at my local community college. Physically holding clay in my hands and doing <span>3D</span> modeling in real world gave me a fresh perspective, and the relatively slow pace gave me time to think.</p>

<p><img src="https://samanthaz.me/assets/img/2021-01-12-pottery.jpg" alt="Head model made in pottery class" target="_blank"></p>

<p>I now have a way better ability to see objects in <span>3D</span> in my mind. And interestingly, it also helped my drawing—I had little real training and used to struggle with perspective a lot, but now that I’m better at imagining objects in <span>3D</span> and turning them around in my mind, it really helps.</p>

<h3 id="4-enter-competitions">4. Enter Competitions</h3>

<p>Now the last point, the secret ingredient: enter competitions.</p>

<p>We all need motivation to keep us going, and competition provides a clear objective, a clear timeline, and an opportunity to put our skills to the test. It’s especially fun to join as a newbie since you’ve got nothing to lose; and if by sheer chance you win something, that’s great external validation. Even if you lose, you will still have some really polished pieces, probably the best work you can do at the time.</p>

<p>I joined three Sketchfab competitions as I was learning <span>3D</span> modeling.</p>

<h6 id="my-ideal-planet-voxel">My Ideal Planet (Voxel)</h6>

<p>The first competition I entered was around week 06. I was lucky that a <a href="https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/sketchfab-voxel-challenge-ideal-planet/" target="_blank">voxel challenge</a> dropped while I was deep in MagicaVoxel.</p>

<p>The brief was about creating one’s ideal planet in voxel, and that immediately led me to thinking about how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince" target="_blank">the little prince</a> traveled to many planets. What’s the most ideal planet? Definitely the scenario in which he returns to his planet, with the little sheep in the box. The sunset planet was the only competition, but that would be relying on a sunset backdrop to work, not the modeling itself.</p>

<p>So I started, day and night, tackling a way larger canvas than I ever had before. To make the composition more interesting, I put the little prince at a diagonal angle, and that took a lot of trial and error. The little prince and his little sheep were the only two living characters I’ve ever modeled. I also picked up more MagicaVoxel to Sketchfab exporting skills along the way.</p>



<p>Although there are a lot of imperfections (my biggest regret is I put the volcano in the dead center of the orb, which makes it too uptight), my hard work paid off, and it got both an honorable mention and a staff’s pick!</p>

<h6 id="utopia-low-poly">Utopia (Low-poly)</h6>

<p>The <a href="https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/sketchfab-low-poly-utopia/" target="_blank">second challenge</a> dropped around week 13. It was about creating futuristic utopian assets under 2k triangles, which was perfect for my skill level. I wouldn’t have a chance in many Sketchfab challenges. Having a limit on the number of triangles leveled the playing field a bit for me.</p>

<p>I took the opportunity to learn simple animation in Blender, and again, just so I’d have a slightly better chance at winning, I spent more time on lighting and rendering in those challenges than in my weekly room practices.</p>

<p>Here’s the final rendering:</p>



<p>It didn’t win me anything, unfortunately, but that’s expected. Even without any prize, it’s a very nice piece …</p></div></div></div>

January 21, 2021 | https://docs.temporal.io/blog/dealing-with-failure | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://docs.temporal.io/blog/dealing-with-failure">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><strong>Latest Release at Time of Writing:</strong>&nbsp;V1.5.1</p><p>I recently gave a talk at the CodeMesh conference, and I spent half of it reflecting on the seemingly boring topic of dealing with failures. The talk was primarily based on my experience building and helping others build cloud services with the Orleans framework. I chose this topic, because I believe dealing with failures is the most important aspect of any system. Oftentimes, it is what stands between a product that runs as expected and one that keeps producing surprises and causing investigations. When done right, handling of failures is what differentiates a professional from an amateur.</p><p>The talk covered three approaches that I've seen and applied the most myself:</p><ul><li>Request-Reply (a.k.a RPC)</li><li>Using persistent queues</li><li>Workflows</li></ul><h2>1. Request-Reply</h2><p>In my opinion, Request-Reply (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a.k.a. RPC -- Remote Procedure Call</a>), is the most natural way of handling failures. The client makes a request to the server and waits for a response (up to a timeout) and in most cases learns about a request processing failure immediately. This is how HTTP works, for example.</p><blockquote><p><em>Note that by client and server I mean simply two sides of the call. They can be real client and server processes or merely two tiny objects communicating with each other within a distributed system.</em></p></blockquote><p>Simplicity of RPC is good for the server.</p><blockquote><p><em>"I try to do what the request asked me to. If there's any failure downstream, I return it to the client. The client knows best what to do, to retry or not, how many times, with a backoff or not. My logic can stay simple."</em></p></blockquote><p>In our world of overly complicated systems, the value of simplicity is difficult to overstate. However, in this case the complexity burden gets pushed to the client. This puts the remote client at a disadvantage here. It has to operate based on the limited error information it received back. Sometimes it’s just a communication error or a timeout. These are a few of the many possible real life cases:</p><ul><li>An error may not be clear about whether the requested operation actually failed. It might have succeeded, and the error happened while trying to communicate success. This forces the client to either check for the status of the operations or retry anyway, assuming retrying the operation can be done safely, i.e. it is idempotent.</li><li>The system may be temporarily unavailable, actually being down or network partitioned from the client. For mobile applications that's rather expected.</li><li>Partial failures are hard to deal with. When we need to update multiple external systems at once, there is almost never a way to do that in an all-or-nothing manner, i.e. atomically. So, we have to handle retries and rollbacks, side effects, and all the inevitable complexity.</li></ul><p>The last point I illustrated with the following picture:
<img alt="Request-Reply" src="https://docs.temporal.io/assets/images/request-reply-325c282bb7603fc9a5ddd2cad338bac5.png"></p><p>In this example, the client (square blue thing) makes a request to the server (round green thing). The server does not have the information locally to satisfy the client request and therefore needs to call two external services, blue and purple.</p><p>If either of those two sub-calls fail, the server returns an error to the client. If the client were to retry the request, there would need to be a mechanism in the server that prevents duplicate calls to the external services.Idempotency is one method of addressing this issue. If the client decides to give up, there needs to be a way to revert any changes made as part of processing the request before the failure (in our example - of the call to the service A).</p><p>A canonical example is money transfer from an account in one bank to an account in a different bank. However, there are many other scenarios with conceptually indentical requirements. In many cloud orchestration cases we need to allocate a resource (such as a virtual machine), and then perform a number of operations with it before returning it in a ready state to the client. If any operation fails, we don’t want to leave the VM running. Nor do we want to keep allocating new VMs for the same request.</p><p>To summarize the pros and cons of the RPC approach.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Simplicity</li><li>Obvious correlation between a request and a failure</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Retries are client's responsibility and are difficult to do for a remote client</li><li>Partial failures are difficult to handle</li></ul><h2>2. Persistent Queues</h2><p>Putting a persistent queue between the client and server solves a number of problems. The client just needs to successfully send a request to the queue to ensure that it will eventually be processed.</p><p><img alt="Queue" src="https://docs.temporal.io/assets/images/queues-1aac9b7141813a8bfe886a9e95177e68.png"></p><p>Assuming the server only deletes a request from the queue after it is successfully processed, we get a simple retry mechanism. Due to the queue, even if the server crashes and restarts in between the attempts, it will keep trying to process the request again and again. The fact that the client (producer) is completely decoupled from the server (consumer), means the client can enqueue requests even if the server is down. This is the main reason why the publisher-subscriber architecture is so popular. Separation of subsystems in space and time is a nice property.</p><p><img alt="Chang'e-5" src="https://docs.temporal.io/assets/images/moon-orbit-37d5c6c62418d44366f16bb78cdc2c7f.jpeg"></p><h6><em>A simulated illustration of Chang'e-5 probe's orbiter-returner's separation from the ascender on the moon orbit, December 6, 2020. /CNSA</em></h6><p>For streaming one-way events, queues are great. But how can the client get a response in a queue based architecture? There's no good answer to this question that I'm aware of. Responses need to be delivered (somehow) back to the client, usually over another queue. Then the client needs a way to correlate requests and responses, typically done via correlation IDs. There also needs to be timeout mechanisms for dealing with requests that never received a response.</p><p>Retries are simpler with queues compared to the RPC case. They are pretty much automatic, as long as the request stays in the queue. Calls to external services still need to be idempotent. However, we can't retry forever and have to deal with requests that keep failing to process. Either because they clog the queue (if the queue is ordered), consume too many resources or cause excessive load on the external services. The popular approach is to treat such requests as "poison messages", by moving them out of the queue to a different location ("dead letter" queue) for special handling.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Separation of systems in space and time</li><li>Automatic retries</li><li>Simple when no responses are expected</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Additional dependency of the queueing technology</li><li>Extra work to correlate responses</li><li>Queues may clog</li><li>Special handling of "poison messages"</li></ul><h2>3. Workflows</h2><p>Similar to queues, workflows take the burden of ensuring successful execution of requests off the client's shoulders. But instead of writing them into a shared queue, requests are persisted as part of an independent workflow document. That document makes processing requests stateful:</p><ul><li>Tracking which steps of processing succeeded</li><li>Tracking which steps of processing failed</li><li>Remembering how many retries have been made, etc</li></ul><p><img alt="Workflow" src="https://docs.temporal.io/assets/images/workflows-d444c74006e2d1d51186cf7722b6dfd9.png"></p><p>Workflows have other important properties and use cases. They are a great way to implement long-running business processes, incorporate human operations and react to events. From the failure handling perspective, the most important aspect of workflows is the ability to be more intelligent when handling partial failures. Instead of being oblivious about what happened in the past, a workflow can keep a log of all relevant information and make informed decisions about what to retry and when.</p><p>Workflows can be individually addressable, which makes them easier to scale compared with shared queues. It also allows for targeted inspection and even on-the-fly modification of their state, if needed.</p><p>At the same time, workflows "inherit" most of the challenges of queues. Responses still need to be correlated with requests, although the individual addressability of workflows makes it easier for the client to query results. "Poison messages" are also still possible. They don't clog the queue anymore, but still require special handling.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Partial separation of systems in time and space</li><li>Robust handling of partial failures</li><li>Support for long-running operation</li><li>Retries are "automatic"</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Additional dependency on a workflow system or complexity of in-house implementation</li><li>Extra work to correlate responses</li><li>Special handling of "poison messages"</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>It's a cliché that in our business there's no free lunch, only tradeoffs. As unoriginal as they might sound, many clichés are true. Dealing with failures is an area of important tradeoffs. There's obviously no single pattern that fits all scenarios. In fact, many systems leverage all three patterns I described.</p><p>For simpler requests that need a prompt response and aren’t involved with complex multi-step processing, Request-Reply is often the right approach. One-way messages, events, data streams are clear candidates for Queues. Workflows are a good fit for reliable execution of relatively complex requests that either require multi-step processing or can leak resources if failures aren't properly handled.</p></section></div>]]>

      <p>There's a popular book called <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>. And there's a common meme around the relative size of that book versus <em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIf3EJh.jpg"></p><p>Haskell is, in my opinion, a far more well designed and coherent language than JavaScript. However, it's also an old language with some historical baggage. In many ways, it's a bleeding edge research language that sometimes includes...half-baked features. Due to an inconsistent set of rules around backwards compatibility, it will sometimes break code every six months, and sometimes keep strange decisions around for decades.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>True mastery of Haskell comes down to knowing which things in core libraries should be avoided like the plague.</p><p>* foldl<br>* sum/product<br>* Data.Text.IO<br>* Control.Exception.bracket (use unliftio instead, handles interruptible correctly)</p><p>Just as some examples</p></div>— Michael Snoyman (@snoyberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/1321049221697544193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>After a request and some tongue-in-cheek comments under that tweet, I decided a long-form blog post was in order. I'm going to start off by expanding on the four examples I gave in that tweet. But there are many, many more examples out there. If there's more interest in seeing a continuation of this series, please let me know. And if you have pet peeves you'd like me to address, your input will be very welcome.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-bad-part">What is a "bad part"?</h2>
<p>Very rarely is there such a thing: a language feature, function, type, or library—that is so egregiously bad that it should never, ever be used. Null is of course the billion dollar mistake, but it's still incredibly useful in some cases. So when I say that something is a "bad part" of Haskell, I mean something along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rarely useful feature has been promoted to a position of prominence</li>
<li>A function has major downsides that are not documented</li>
<li>There's an unexpected performance implication</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a large tendency in the Haskell community to be overly literal in responding to blog posts. Feel free to do that to your heart's content. But this caveat serves as a word of warning: I'm not going to caveat each one of these with an explanation of "Yes, but there's this one corner case where it's actually useful."</p>
<h2 id="why-attack-haskell">Why attack Haskell?</h2>
<p>Since I'm a Haskeller and an advocate of the language, you may be wondering: "Why are you attacking Haskell?" I don't see this as an attack. I <em>do</em> wish we could fix these issues. I think it's a fair thing to say that the problems I'm listing are warts on the language. And every language has warts. I'm writing this because I've seen these kinds of things break real world projects. I've seen these failures manifest at runtime, defeating yet again the false claim: "If it compiles, it works." I've seen these become nefarious time bombs that disincentivize people from ever working with Haskell in the future.</p>
<p>I hope by calling these out publicly, I can help raise awareness of these problems. Then either we fix the problems at their source or, more likely, get more widespread awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>Also, because it feels appropriate, I'm going to take a more jovial tone below. I find it easier to beat up on a language I love like that.</p>
<h2 id="foldl">foldl</h2>
<p>Duncan Coutts <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2014/04/fixing-foldl/">already did this one</a>. <code>foldl</code> is broken. It's a bad function. Left folds are supposed to be strict, not lazy. End of story. Goodbye. This function have caused too many space leaks. We should gut it out entirely.</p>
<p>But wait! A lazy left fold makes perfect sense for a <code>Vector</code>! Yeah, no one ever meant that. And the problem isn't the fact that this function exists. It's the <strong>name</strong>. It has taken the hallowed spot of the One True Left Fold. I'm sorry, the One True Left Fold is strict.</p>
<p>Also, side note: we can't raise linked lists to a position of supreme power within our ecosystem and then pretend like we actually care about vectors. We don't; we just pay lip service to them. Until we fix the wart that is overuse of lists, <code>foldl</code> is only ever used on lists.</p>
<p>OK, back to this bad left fold. This is all made worse by the fact that the true left fold, <code>foldl'</code>, is not even exported by the <code>Prelude</code>. We Haskellers are a lazy bunch. And if you make me type in <code>import Data.List (foldl')</code>, I just won't. I'd rather have a space leak than waste precious time typing in those characters.</p>
<p>Alright, so what should you do? Use an alternative prelude that doesn't export a bad function, but does export a good function. If you really, really want a lazy left fold: add a comment, or use a function named <code>foldlButLazyIReallyMeanIt</code>. Otherwise I'm going to fix your code during my code review.</p>
<h2 id="sum-product">sum/product</h2>
<p>The <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> functions are implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>. Well, actually <code>foldMap</code>, but list's <code>foldMap</code> is implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>, and lists are the only data structure that exist in Haskell. "Oh, but <code>foldr</code> is the good function, right?" Only if you're folding a function which is lazy in its second argument. <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are both strict in both of their arguments.</p>
<p>If you're not aware of that terminology: "strict in both arguments" means "in order to evaluate the result of this function/operator, I need to evaluate both of its arguments." I can't evaluate <code>x + y</code> without knowing what <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are. On the other hand, <code>:</code> (list cons) is lazy in its second argument. Evaluating <code>x : y</code> doesn't require evaluating <code>y</code> (or, for that matter, <code>x</code>). (For more information, see <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/all-about-strictness/">all about strictness</a>.)</p>
<p>"But wait!" you say. "What if I have a custom data type with a custom typeclass instance of <code>Num</code> that has a custom <code>+</code> and/or <code>*</code> that is in fact lazy in the second argument! Then <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> are perfect as they are!"</p>
<p>That's true. Now go off and write your own <code>lazySum</code> and <code>lazyProduct</code>. 99 times out of 100, or more likely 999,999 times out of 1,000,000, we want the fully strict version.</p>
<p>"But it doesn't matter, GHC will optimize this away." Maybe. Maybe not. Stop relying on GHC's optimizer to convert horribly inefficient code into not efficient code. (But I digress, we'll talk about why the <code>vector</code> package is bad another time.)</p>
<h2 id="data-text-io">Data.Text.IO</h2>
<p>I've already covered this one once before when I told everyone to <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/12/beware-of-readfile">beware of <code>readFile</code></a>. In that blog post, I talked about a bunch of <code>String</code> based I/O functions, especially the titular <code>readFile</code>, which is obnoxiously exported by <code>Prelude</code>. Those are bad. But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is arguably far worse, and I'll reiterate why in a second. The reason is that there's pretty good awareness in the community that <code>String</code>-based I/O is bad. Even though the <code>String</code> part is the least of our worries, it does a good job of scaring away the uninitiated.</p>
<p>But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is a wolf in sheep's clothing. We're all told by people who think they can tell people how to write their Haskell code (<em>cough</em> me <em>cough</em>) that we should exorcise <code>String</code> from our codebases and replace it in all cases with <code>Text</code>. Attacking the <code>Text</code> type is a topic for another time. But the problem is that by cloaking itself in the warm embrace of <code>Text</code>, this module claims more legitimacy than it deserves.</p>
<p>The only module worse in this regard is <code>Data.Text.Lazy.IO</code>, which should be buried even deeper.</p>
<p>OK, what exactly am I on about? Locale sensitive file decoding. It's possible that this has been the number one example of a Haskell bug in the wild I've encountered in my entire career. Not the spooky memory leak. Partial functions like <code>head</code> randomly throwing exceptions are up there, but don't quite rise to prominence.</p>
<p>You see, when you are dealing with file formats, there is typically an actual, defined format. YAML, XML, JSON, and many others give a lot of information about how to serialize data, including character data, into raw bytes. We want to be consistent. We want to write a file in one run of the program, and have it read in a separate run. We want to write the file on a Windows machine and read it on a Linux machine. Or we want to interact with programs in other languages that read or write data in a consistent format.</p>
<p>Locale sensitive file encoding and decoding laughs in our face. When you use <code>Data.Text.IO.readFile</code>, it plays a mind reading game of trying to deduce from clues you don't care about which character encoding to use. These days, on the vast majority of systems used by native English speakers, this turns out to be UTF-8. So using <code>readFile</code> and <code>writeFile</code> typically "just works." Using functions from <code>Data.Text.IO</code> looks safe, and can easily get hidden in a large PR or a library dependency.</p>
<p>That's when all hell breaks loose. You ship this code. You run it in a Docker container. "Oops, you forgot to set the <code>LANG</code> env var, Imma crash." But it's worse than that. Typically things will work well for weeks or months, because it can often be a long time before someone tries to encode a non-ASCII character.</p>
<p>The same kind of thing happens regularly to Stack. Someone adds a new feature that writes and reads a file. The code passes all integration tests. And then someone in Russia with a weird Windows code page set and a Cyrillic character in their name files a bug report 2 years later about how they can't build anything, and we sheepishly tell them to run <code>chcp 65001</code> or build in <code>c:\</code>.</p>
<p>Friends don't let friends use <code>Data.Text.IO</code>.</p>
<p>"Oh, but <code>putStrLn</code> is fine!" Yeah, maybe. It's also potentially slow. And it will throw a runtime exception due to character encoding mismatches. Just use a good logging library. That's why we have one in <code>rio</code>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Since so many people have asked: instead of <code>readFile</code>, I recommend using <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-16.20/rio-0.1.19.0/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a>, which is available from <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="control-exception-bracket">Control.Exception.bracket</h2>
<p>This is by far the least objectionable of the bad things in this list. I included it because the entire original tweet was inspired by a coworker telling me about a bug he ran into because of this function.</p>
<p>Async exceptions are subtle. Very, very subtle. Like, super duper subtle. I've devoted a large percentage to …</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>

        <p>So you want to start an internet business and don't know what to do.&nbsp; Don't worry I've made this wonderful write down on how exactly you can make one.</p><p>The first step is of course, choosing your name.&nbsp; Now thankfully you where given this at birth, so one less thing you have to think about.&nbsp; Of course you may be the unfortunate person to be born with a very common name.&nbsp; Or worse, the name of a famous person.</p><p>If you happen to be one of these unfortunate individuals, there is still hope for you.&nbsp; The next option would of course be to either choose a domain that answers the problem you are trying to solve, in the most literal sense.&nbsp; Or simply make up a word and go with that.</p><p>You could do both and make up a word and be literal, but that leads to terrible brand names, like pen island.&nbsp; Imagine that as a domain, penisland, just doesn't have the same bravado.</p><p>Once you have chosen the name, you can move on to step two.&nbsp; Making the damn website.&nbsp; You don't need much.&nbsp; This is the hard part.&nbsp; Although there are many no code solutions, and many semi code solutions, and of course tons of do it your self solutions.&nbsp; I suggest none of this, instead I think you should do what you have been doing all along.&nbsp; Nothing.<br></p><p>After we have moved past step two, you realize you don't even know what to put on your website.&nbsp; This is the greatest moment, I suggest one of two things.&nbsp; Either a way for some one to contact you, or just an email sign up form.<br></p><p>Of course you want to be spam-act complaint, so make sure they are double opt in.</p><p>This will do a multitude of things for you, specifically make it appear as though you have your life in order.&nbsp; Of course you don't, this is simply a facade, granted a very beautiful and useful one.&nbsp; It will make you appear as though you are a massive corporation capable of doing many things.</p><p>Now that you have arrived to this moment in time, you may realize that you are in over your head.&nbsp; This is normal, it's the start of your internet business.&nbsp; No one knows what it does, but because that in its self is more than not existing, there might be a individual or two who decides they are curios enough to see what you have to offer.</p><p>I mean after all you are a legitimate, internet business.&nbsp; And since Craigslist looks hideous, but absolutely superbly functional,&nbsp; there is a chance even your simple one page wordpress website will actually be seen by one of the seven billion people on this planet that will perhaps, click the back button and continue on with their life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Apache Superset is an open source enterprise-ready data exploration, data visualization and dashboarding application that enables teams to be productive with data.</em></p><p>Today our community is proud to announce the release of <strong>Apache Superset 1.0</strong>, a major milestone that we’ve been working towards since the very first commit at a hackathon at Airbnb back in 2015. Superset 1.0 packs a lot of new features, uplevels usability, holds a higher quality standard, and raises the bar for releases to come. This post details the key advancements that our community has been building up towards this release.</p><p>While growing fast over the past four years, Superset had accumulated a certain amount of technical debt, design debt, bugs, and idiosyncrasies. For this release, we wanted to pay the bulk of that debt off, <strong>streamlining the core user flows</strong>, refreshing the overall look and feel, taking off some of the scaffolding that was left standing around, and more generally, leveling up the user experience.</p><p>Visually, Superset 1.0 is <strong>stunning</strong>, introducing <strong>card layouts</strong> with <strong>thumbnails</strong> throughout the application, streamlining <strong>navigation</strong> and <strong>content discovery</strong> with a new home page, redesigned menus, and generally enriching existing pages.</p><p><span><span>

    </span></span></p><p>For engineers and hackers, we’ve made Superset much more <strong>modular, extensible </strong>and<strong> integratable</strong>.

We’ve refined our processes around resolving security issues while pushing through a handful of well-handled CVEs (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a>) over the past year. Also important, we’ve <strong>simplified the security model</strong> in Superset to a simpler set of atomic permissions to make it more comprehensive.</p><p>Because we wanted to make it easier for people to manage and share the objects they’re building in Superset, we’ve rebuilt the <strong>export/import </strong>functionality from the ground up. This allows organizations to manage and synchronize objects across environments, and for users to share the assets that they’ve built easily.</p><p>We’ve also completely redesigned our <strong>community website </strong> at <a href="https://superset.apache.org/">superset.apache.org</a> and made it the official hub for our fast growing community. All of the resources expected from a mature open source community can be found and contributed to there.</p><p><strong>Reporting</strong> and <strong>alerting</strong> has always been highly requested in the community, and 1.0 packs a solid implementation that can support most use cases. This enables periodic email delivery of reports, as well as an alerting system that can monitor your metrics arbitrary shifts and alert you as specified. We built an extensible system that we can expand to more delivery mechanisms and forecasting/alerting logic.</p><p><span><span>

    </span></span></p><p>Around the topic of<strong> open source governance</strong>, Superset <strong>graduated</strong> from the incubator to become a top-level project at the <strong>Apache Software Foundation</strong>. As a project that had been incubating since 2016, we finally ironed out some minor licensing issues, prevented license-related regressions using <a href="https://fossa.com/">FOSSA</a>, and started publishing proper ASF releases on a regular cadence. We also actively worked towards fitting the <a href="https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html">Apache Project Maturity Model</a>, aligning with the governance model prescribed by the ASF and took action to grow the community in sustainable ways. The graduation formally recognizes that the community has complied with all the requirements, and operates at the high standard required by the ASF.</p><p>With 1680 PRs merged and 25+ <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asip">SIPs</a> (Superset Improvement Proposals) over 2020, it’s hard to summarize what went into this release. Improvements happened in all aspects of the project, from infrastructure to design, through backend and frontend, to community and governance. Here are some <strong>honorable mentions</strong> that we haven’t been covered above, but deserve a mention in this post:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11499">Asynchronous backend improvements</a></li><li>Metadata and data pane in explorer view</li><li>Toolbars redesign (SQL Lab, dashboard, explore)</li><li>Date range picker redesign</li><li>Various Docker / Helm improvements</li><li>Migration of key visualization to plugins using <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/">Echarts</a></li><li>Time series forecasting leveraging the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/">Prophet</a> library</li><li>Improvements to and extensive use of our feature flag framework</li><li>Improved analytics logging, capturing more events more consistently</li><li>Exploration control panels improvements</li><li>Improved SQL-to-explore flows</li></ul><p>All-in-all, Superset has come a long way recently and this release marks the project entering its mature stage. The community has gained velocity and momentum, and yet we’re still accelerating. 1.0 marks a huge milestone in our journey to delight data teams with the most comprehensive and modern analytics platform there is, but clearly this is still the beginning of a much greater adventure.</p><p>Congratulations to all contributors and to sponsoring organizations, this is a huge achievement!</p><p><a href="https://superset.apache.org/">Join our community!

<p><em>This article is part of a series on </em><a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/remote-working/"><em>remote working</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<h2>Second-class citizens</h2>



<p>In the past, a common challenge that remote workers have faced is <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/11/a-study-of-1100-employees-found-that-remote-workers-feel-shunned-and-left-out">feeling like they are several steps removed from the rest of the physically colocated company</a>. This manifests repeatedly: day in, day out. It reveals itself in the nagging instinct that discussions and decisions are happening in person without giving remote workers the ability to have their input. It can come from the worryingly empty email inbox during challenging periods, or the strangely quiet chat rooms. It arises when joining a meeting via video call to see ten tiny figures sitting around a conference room table, sharing one microphone.</p>



<p>This is when remote working sucks. You feel like an <em>other</em>; unlike all of the other “normal” staff. Perhaps even like a lesser member of the company. This isn’t right. However, none of this should be attributed to malice. After all, for decades we have been used to working together in offices. Old habits die hard, especially if they aren’t being challenged.</p>



<p>I remember a long time ago when the magnetic hub of our company was our HQ in Brighton. The anecdote in mind happened when we were hiring rapidly after receiving a funding round. We had monthly induction sessions for new starters that walked them through what the company did, the software we built, how we marketed it and sold it — all of that good stuff. These inductions were organized well, planned and practiced, and generally speaking were a fun, informative experience.</p>



<p>That is, except for the month when we started onboarding some engineers in our smaller Stuttgart office. They would turn up to the meeting, join the video call, and wait for the person leading the session in Brighton to join. But they never did. Messages were sent that were unanswered. Everyone’s laptops were closed. No malice, just forgetfulness. But that forgetfulness, repeated daily, compounds into larger frustrations about “being remote” in comparison to other members of staff that are not.</p>



<h2>Equality</h2>



<p>We should be aiming to treat everyone equally.</p>



<p>What this needs is a mindset shift. The title of the article says it all really: <em>treat everyone as remote</em>. That’s how you solve the problem of any worker in your company feeling like they are “remote”. You simply act as if everyone is, thus cancelling out the prefix: if <em>everyone </em>is treated like a remote worker, then really, they’re all just <em>workers</em>. Equal. No longer do the remote workers need to continually put in additional effort in order to gather information that they have missed, or to remind people that they are still there, or that their timezone is different. Instead, they just do their work just like everyone else, and interact with others like everyone else.</p>



<p>Even though this is simple, it isn’t straightforward. It’s a little bit like if you’ve ever tried to meditate. It’s simple: just continually focus on your breathing. But it’s not straightforward: your mind wanders and you get caught up in thoughts. You bring your attention back to your breath, and guess what, your mind is generating thoughts again.</p>



<p>Treating everyone as remote requires a mindset shift in every individual in the entire company. It means that every action and interaction should be done in such a way that equally benefits somebody regardless of whether they are present in a physical office or not. This can best be explained by example, and at the time of writing we’re living through the largest remote working experiment in the technology industry: a global pandemic.</p>



<p>Below is a screenshot of the first remote cabinet meeting of the UK government from March 2020. At this point the country had been put under the first initial lockdown measures, indicating that everyone who was able to work from home should do so. In what should now be a familiar sight to most people, the meeting was being conducted via Zoom.</p>



<p>Most participants of this call are remote, and are therefore acting in the correct way to <em>treat everyone as remote</em>. However, there is one group of participants that are not abiding by this rule. On the top row, second from left, the Cabinet Room has joined the meeting via a traditional meeting room AV setup: one fixed camera and a microphone in the middle of a shared table.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/t73c0UeykYzMpRXWNUt5mnWSzQ8QxdxkpfLgBhgNynor06iEw6F0R4G1dJJhpjhbrt1rM36Fz3HUeWKdGv5YVtNiKxPnrzqIR6bugmeZsmWo0MswTG-ru5kWWr72WBcIp0IwPOaZ" alt=""></figure>



<p>Whereas all other participants have a microphone and camera each, allowing them to properly see and hear each other, being able to understand the facial expressions of the person sitting farthest away on the Cabinet Room table requires some serious CSI “enhance!” magic. Do you reckon that everyone else on this call got frustrated with not being able to see or hear them properly? Do you think that they may have experienced, perhaps for the first time, one of the frustrations of being a remote worker when others do not treat everyone as remote? Ah, yes. That.</p>



<p>So this is the first big thing when it comes to truly supporting remote workers. The entire company needs to adopt a mindset where they treat everyone as remote. <em>E</em>very action via code, written or spoken word should provide an equal interaction opportunity to anyone regardless of their location.</p>



<h2>Actions and initiatives</h2>



<p>This can be done by performing some of the following actions and initiatives.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Give your declaration of intent.</strong> You can’t expect anyone to begin changing if you don’t talk about your intention clearly. As explored in my <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/remote-working/2020-a-year-spent-remotely/">initial post reflecting on a year spent remotely</a>, there are plenty of reasons for beginning to act like a remote-first company, even if that may not be your final trajectory. Tell yourself, your team, and others that you know that you are going to be changing your working practices to better support remote workers. Like our meditation example above, this may be simple, but it isn’t straightforward. You may find yourself having to repeat this message, in combination with taking the actions below, for it to really sink in.</li><li><strong>Shift to asynchronicity. </strong>Synchronous communication is essential, but maybe not always as essential as you think. Adopt a mindset where you question all of your synchronous communication — such as video calls and instant messages — and see whether you can move to more asynchronous alternatives such as email and writing documents. Not only will this reduce the time that you spend in meetings, which can be draining and interrupting for everyone’s flow, it will produce more artifacts that can be shared and read more widely at a later date.</li><li><strong>Make your time and commitment expectations clear. </strong>Shifting to more asynchronous communication means that the time taken to close the loop may be longer. However, it’s more inclusive, and often better thought through. Working with your colleagues to help them understand that this is purposeful, and most importantly, perfectly normal, is something that you’ll need to do. State your intention that it’s OK to not read something if it’s not specifically important to an individual. Also say that it’s OK to take until the end of the week to read and comment on a proposal. The net effect is increased autonomy and flow.</li><li><strong>Choose appropriate tools to support remote collaboration. </strong>I often take for granted that we are already avid users of Google’s office suite, which has excellent collaboration and commenting capabilities. The same is true for Github, Slack, Miro and Figma, and others. However, some companies still make it extremely hard to collaborate effectively, such as by emailing around local copies of documents which then require a copy to be made and so on, until you reach <em>final_version_7_FINAL.doc.</em> Champion better tools and demonstrate them to your colleagues to drive bottom-up change. Ask those with the power to make decisions and spend budget to help you.</li><li><strong>Habitually produce artifacts. </strong>With everything that you do, ask the question as to whether you should be creating a useful artifact for the future. Whether that’s recording a meeting so that people can watch it asynchronously later, or writing up that design document to develop your thoughts with others, or creating that <a href="https://adr.github.io/">Architecture Design Record</a>, <em>create them. </em>Artifacts are <em>so</em> useful so that you understand where you’ve come from, where you are currently going and where, eventually, you want to get to.</li><li><strong>Instill meeting and video call etiquette. </strong>Don’t be like the Cabinet Room. Have each participant have their own camera and microphone, and mute when not talking. If useful, write up your agenda and thoughts beforehand so that the meeting can run efficiently. Use a spotter to check whether there are people on the call that aren’t being heard and invite them into the conversation.</li><li><strong>Broadcast information to the widest possible group. </strong>Think about who is hearing, seeing and reading your communication. Could it be useful to a broader group of participants, even if it’s just optional information that they can read if they’re interested? If so, don’t repeat yourself in the future; broadcast it immediately at a wider level. A DM could become a message in the team’s chat room. A team chat room message could instead go out to the whole department. Remember that people can just not read something if they don’t want to. That’s fine.</li><li><strong>Continually take visible action. </strong>Most importantly, just keep doing all of the above continually. Soon your habits will catch on and others will follow.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Homework</strong></h2>



<p>Now, on to the exercise. Pencils at the ready.</p>



<p>Spend some time thinking about your own workplace, department or team. How would you rate yourselves against the <em>intention</em> of treating everyone as remote when compared to the continual <em>actions and habits </em>that you are taking? Is there a void here? What needs to be done to change that? Also, assuming you’re reading this sometime around the time that it was written, how have these habits changed when you compare your workplace now to how it was before the Covid-19 pandemic?</p>



<p>Think about some changes that you can implement right away in order to …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

    <p>In recent years I’ve increasingly noticed software being written that cannot get the performance it needs unless it bypasses usual operating system services.</p>

<h2>Concurrency</h2>

<p>For example let’s consider a program that wants to do many tasks at the same time. Traditionally you would either create multiple <strong>threads</strong> or multiple <strong>processes</strong> for each parallel line of execution. But threads and processes have a lot of overhead - in particular they take up a lot of memory - so it’s unwise to have more than a few hundred of them. So if you have a web service handling hundreds or thousands of connections per second, you cannot effectively serve all those requests on one machine using a thread or process per connection.</p>

<p>So some developers turn to writing their web servers with asynchronous I/O and <strong>green threads</strong> so that they can multiplex multiple concurrent tasks onto a single OS thread. You can run millions of these green threads concurrently per machine on modern hardware. That’s pretty slick, at least until one of those green threads starts hogging the CPU or accidentally performs a blocking operation. Such a misbehaving green thread will block all other green threads from running, since they use cooperative multitasking and cannot be preempted.</p>

<p>Other developers turn to <strong>microthreads</strong> in languages like Go, Erlang, or Elixir<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. These environments have an in-process scheduler that multiplexes microthreads onto a single OS thread. Again you can run millions of microthreads concurrently on modern hardware. Happily microthreads <em>can</em> be preempted by the scheduler and so a misbehaving microthread won’t interfere with other microthreads, although it may cause your server to burn CPU wastefully.</p>

<h2>Disk I/O throughput</h2>

<p>These days our disks are solid-state drives with access times similar to RAM rather than the slower rotating magnetic platters of earlier years. Yet my understanding is that the common filesystem and socket abstractions require per-operation overhead comparable to the time spent actually performing the I/O. Yikes. Research seems to be underway considering ways to bypass various OS abstractions to get faster results.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2>Exciting times</h2>

<p>It’s neat to be working in computing at the time when some of the fundamental abstractions are being called into question. When practitioners are receptive to change there’s an opportunity to contribute new ideas and actually have them tried and used.</p>

                    <p>In the <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/changelog.html#version-0-73-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">changelog for Streamlit 0.73.0</a>, released in December 2020, there’s a small callout: “Component iframes now include the allow-same-origin sandbox attribute.”</p><p>This change enables dramatically more powerful <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/streamlit_components.html">Streamlit Components</a> - you can now use webcams and microphones in Streamlit apps and more easily embed and interact with external resources - and it was just a single line of code! (Check out our ever-expanding <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/components">Component Gallery</a> for examples of quality Components created by the Streamlit community.)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/webrtc-1.gif" alt=""><figcaption>The <a href="https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc/blob/master/app.py">popular WebRTC component</a> currently being built by whitphx wouldn't have been possible prior to the updates to allow-same-origin.</figcaption></figure><p>But this is not a post about how to use or build Streamlit Components. If you're interested in that, we have a <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/streamlit_components.html">tutorial here</a> or check out the great <a href="https://streamlit-components-tutorial.netlify.app/">community tutorial</a> by Fanilo Andrianasolo! Instead, we want to peel back the curtain and discuss how we make changes to Streamlit itself. Because we <em>could</em> have shipped that single line in July <a href="https://medium.com/streamlit/introducing-streamlit-components-d73f2092ae30">when we launched Streamlit Components</a>. We could've shipped it in any of the 9 releases that followed! But instead, it took us 5 months.</p><p>This is an engineering-focused post about why such a small change took such a long time. It'll touch on the Streamlit security model, our design philosophy, and the competing constraints that can lead to long development times for seemingly-simple features. And for the masochists out there, we'll stare briefly into the abyss that is <em>cross-origin web security</em>.</p><p>Let's start with a humble-brag: Streamlit has <em>lots</em> of users, many of whom are storing and accessing sensitive data in Streamlit apps. We take security very seriously. What this means in practice is that any change or feature we add to Streamlit <em>must not</em> reduce the security of either the <a href="https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit">Streamlit open source library</a> or <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/sharing">Streamlit sharing</a>, our "press button → deploy to cloud" hosting platform.</p><p>Additionally, we care dearly about the <em>design</em> of Streamlit - not just the way it looks, but the way it works, all the way down to API names. This means that, as much as possible:</p><ul><li>Streamlit should <em>just work.</em></li><li>Streamlit features should be robust and powerful.</li><li>New features should <em>not</em> increase the complexity of installing, using, or deploying Streamlit.</li></ul><p>So we have these three broad goals: add new features to Streamlit, don't undermine its simplicity, and ensure it's safe. When we're fortunate, these goals are not at odds with each other. When we're less fortunate, we have the <code>allow-same-origin</code> situation and we end up writing blog posts like this one.</p><p>Before getting into the weeds, let's first consider the story around Streamlit Components and security:</p><ul><li>Fundamentally, a Streamlit Component is a <em>Python library</em>. You should exercise the same judgement with a Component as you would with any other Python library you <code>pip install</code> in your project.</li><li>A Component <em>also</em> runs code on the frontend, which means it can make requests from the browser, and can access data on your app's frontend.</li><li>You should assume that any library you use - Component or otherwise - can access any data in your app.</li><li>If your app deals with sensitive data, only install libraries and Components that you have written, or that you otherwise trust.</li></ul><p>No big surprises. But there's a wrinkle: as Streamlit Components was under development, so too was Streamlit sharing. We needed to make sure that a rogue Component in a shared app couldn’t peek at Streamlit sharing data, or execute commands on behalf of the developer.</p><p>tl;dr for the rest of the blog post: <em>nothing</em> in a Streamlit app - malicious Component or otherwise - can hijack Streamlit sharing. But we treaded carefully - and a bit slowly - to make sure this was the case.</p><p><em>(This section gets into the details of <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> sandboxing, the <code>allow-same-origin</code> sandbox flag, and cross-origin requests. It'll be of primary interest to those who work with, or are curious about, web security. If you have no interest in the nitty-gritty, skip ahead to the next section!)</em></p><p>Broadly speaking, Streamlit Components are <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/components">user-created plugins that extend Streamlit.</a> You <code>pip install</code> a Component into your Python environment, and now you <a href="https://github.com/okld/streamlit-discourse">can add a forum</a>, or an <a href="https://github.com/napoles-uach/streamlit_3dmol">interactive 3D molecule viewer</a>, or a <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/hiplot">Facebook HiPlot data graph</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-echarts">custom charting libraries</a> - or really any feature that Streamlit doesn't include out of the box - to your Streamlit app.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/group_selection_example.gif" alt=""><figcaption><a href="https://github.com/PablocFonseca/streamlit-aggrid">Streamlit Ag-Grid</a> component by PablocFonseca</figcaption></figure><p>During development, we had two primary concerns around the Component security model:</p><ul><li>A Component shouldn't be able to break assumptions about its surrounding page (changing the host app's CSS or DOM, for example).</li><li>A Component in an app deployed with <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/sharing">Streamlit sharing</a> shouldn’t be able to hijack its owner's sharing credentials and read secret data or execute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF</a> exploit.</li></ul><p>Under the hood, each instance of a Streamlit Component is mounted inside its own <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> in its containing Streamlit app, which means it lives in its own little world with its own DOM, its own CSS, and its own restrictions. Each iframe has a sandbox with a number of different attributes that specify what it can and can't do. For our purposes here, we're interested in two sandbox flags: <code>allow-same-origin</code> and <code>allow-scripts</code>.</p><p><code>allow-scripts</code> is self-explanatory: if it’s missing, then the iframe will not be able to execute any JavaScript. Executing JavaScript is a fundamental part of Streamlit Components, so this attribute must be enabled. <code>allow-same-origin</code> is related to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">“cross-origin-resource-sharing”, or CORS</a> - which means that it’s destined to be confusing and annoying. If you <em>omit</em> this attribute, the iframe won't be able to use certain browser features (like webcams and microphones), and it will be unable to make requests to many other web servers (which often expect a non-null origin).</p><p>When Streamlit Components launched, we left off <code>allow-same-origin</code> because of how it interacts with <code>allow-scripts</code>. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe">MDN iframe page</a> explains it thusly:</p><blockquote>When the embedded document has the same origin as the embedding page, it is strongly discouraged to use both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin, as that lets the embedded document remove the sandbox attribute — making it no more secure than not using the sandbox attribute at all.</blockquote><p>Streamlit Components <em>are</em> served from the same origin as their embedding page, which means that combining <code>allow-scripts</code> and <code>allow-same-origin</code> would render our sandbox moot. This isn't <em>necessarily</em> a big deal, because Components are not "untrusted code" - but would potentially undercut our Component security concerns.</p><p>There's a big document memorializing weeks of discussion and argument on our <code>allow-same-origin</code> woes: should we serve components from a separate origin? Should we allow devs to opt into the <code>allow-same-origin</code> flag via a config option? Should we maintain an allow-list within Streamlit of Components that can use this flag?</p><p>We developed a number of prototypes that solved the issue in different ways. But all of them undercut Streamlit's "keep things simple" design principle:</p><ul><li>Some prototypes made Streamlit <em>use</em> more difficult (by requiring that dev deeply understand the Component sandbox model).</li><li>Some made Streamlit <em>deployment</em> more difficult (by exposing more server ports to be forwarded and routed through proxies).</li><li>And some made Component <em>development</em> more difficult (by imposing restrictions on Component creators).</li></ul><p>After several months of proposals, prototypes, and arguments, we shipped Streamlit 0.73, which solved the problem by simply adding the <code>allow-same-origin</code> iframe flag. In other words, we decided to allow Components to break the iframe sandbox.</p><p>Why are we ok with this? And what are the ramifications? Here's where we landed on our original sandboxing concerns:</p><h3 id="first-don-t-hijack-my-css">First, "don't hijack my CSS"</h3><blockquote>"A Component shouldn't be able to break assumptions about its surrounding page (changing the host app's CSS or DOM, for example)."</blockquote><p>Our decision here is simple: we decided that, while we won't <em>encourage</em> this sort of thing (not least because it's unsupported and therefore subject to break when Streamlit is updated), we're fundamentally ok with it. Official theming support is on the Streamlit roadmap for 2021, but if enterprising developers want to hack on Streamlit and create this sort of thing before we officially ship it, we won't stand in their way.</p><p>Streamlit is an <a href="https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit">open source project</a> anyway; if you don't like the way something works or looks, you can just fork the project and change it. We don't need a Component sandbox to enforce a rule that's incompatible with our open source nature.</p><h3 id="and-more-importantly-don-t-hijack-streaming-sharing">And more importantly, "don't hijack Streaming Sharing"</h3><blockquote>"A Component in an app deployed with Streamlit sharing shouldn’t be able to hijack its owner's Sharing credentials and execute a CSRF exploit."</blockquote><p>We need to ensure that a malicious Component - or any other rogue code that could be running within a Streamlit app - cannot execute Streamlit sharing commands surreptitiously.</p><p>Googling for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=csrf+example">"CSRF example"</a> will return all sorts of resources that explain this type of exploit in detail. The important thing to know is that CSRF attacks use the fact that each HTTP request made by a browser will include the cookies associated with site to which the request is made. (There are various <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies">cookie attributes</a> that make this story slightly more complex, but that's the basic rule.)</p><p>When you're logged into Streamlit sharing and visit a deployed app you own, you get a management dashboard that lets you view logs and perform various administrative tasks:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/sharing.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sharing.jpeg 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/sharing.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/sharing.jpeg 1100w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If the Streamlit sharing administrator wrapper is served from the same HTTP origin as the app it's managing, a malicious Component could bypass Sharing's CSRF protections by making requests against the Streamlit sharing API and reading the CSRF token from the response headers.</p><p>The solution to this doesn't involve relying on Component sandboxing. In Streamlit sharing, an app's admin dashboard is <em>simply served from a different origin than the app …</em></p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>In this tutorial, we'll build a steganography tool in Python. Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other data. Unlike encryption, where the goal is to secure <em>the contents</em> of communication between two parties, steganography aims to obscure the fact that the parties are communicating at all.</p>
<p>Our tool will enable the user to hide secret text within a normal-looking <code>.png</code> image file. The receiver of the image will use the same tool to reveal the hidden message.</p>
<p>We'll use Python to build the tool. The most popular Python image processing libraries are <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/">Pillow</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/">OpenCV</a>, but these are heavy libraries with many dependencies. We'll avoid these and instead use the lightweight <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pypng/">PyPNG</a> library which is written in pure Python, and therefore easier to run on various platforms.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-background-on-steganography">A quick background on steganography</h2>
<p>Let's imagine three people: Alice, Bob and Eve. Alice wants to send a private message to Bob, while Eve wants to intercept this message. While modern-day encryption can help Alice and Bob ensure that Eve doesn't know the <em>contents</em> of their message, Eve can possibly still deduce interesting information just from knowing that Alice and Bob are communicating at all, and how frequently they communicate.</p>
<p>To obscure the communication channel completely, Alice and Bob can exploit the fact that hundreds of millions of photos are uploaded and shared across the internet daily. Instead of communicating directly, Alice can leave her message hidden in an image at a pre-agreed location and Bob can access this message. From Eve's perspective, there is now no direct communication between the two.</p>
<p>A single image is made up of millions of pixels. While many formats exist, a pixel is most simply represented by a group of three numbers between 0 and 255, one number each for the red, blue, and green values of that pixel. Using this Red-Green-Blue scheme we can represent any colour in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB color model</a>.</p>
<p>Digital text, like images, is also represented internally by numbers, so the differences between a text file and an image file are not as large as you might assume. Any digital data can be represented as a <a href="https://thehelloworldprogram.com/computer-science/what-is-binary/">binary string</a>, a bunch of 1s and 0s, and we can make tiny modifications to an image to encode a binary string within it. As an example, consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>image = [, , ]</code></pre>
<p>This is a representation of an image with three pixels: one red, one green, and one blue. If we encode this as an image and open it in an image viewer, we'll see the three pixel image, but if we read this data with Python, it is simply a list of tuples, each containing three integers.</p>
<p>We could also look at each value making up each pixel and calculate whether it is <em>odd</em> or <em>even</em>. We could encode odd numbers as <code>1</code> and even values as <code>0</code>. This would give us the binary string "100 010 001" (as the 255 values are odd and the 0s are even).</p>
<p>If we made a small modification to the image as follows:</p>
<pre><code>image = [, , ]</code></pre>
<p>The image would look almost identical in any image viewer (we have just added or subtracted a minuscule amount of color from some values), but the binary string -- using our odd/even method -- would look completely different: "011 111 100". </p>
<p>Using this technique but extending it over an entire image (millions of pixels), we can hide a large amount of text data in any image.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-project-on-replit">Creating the project on Repl.it</h2>
<p>If you were serious about keeping your messages as secret as possible, you'd want to do all of these steps on an offline computer that you fully control. As a learning exercise though, we'll set the project up on <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>. Navigate to their site and sign up for an account if you don't have one.</p>
<p>Create a new project, choosing "Python" as the language, and give your project a name.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.repl.it/images/tutorials/13-steganography/04-create-repl.png" alt="Creating a new repl"></p>
<p>The first piece we need to build is a function to encode any text message as a binary string.</p>
<h2 id="encoding-a-text-message-as-a-binary-string">Encoding a text message as a binary string</h2>
<p>Open the <code>main.py</code> file and add the following code</p>
<pre><code>import base64

def encode_message_as_bytestring(<span>message</span>):
    b64 = <span>message</span>.encode(<span>"utf8"</span>)
    bytes_ = base64.encodebytes(b64)
    bytestring = <span>""</span>.jo<span>in(</span>[<span>"{:08b}"</span>.<span>format</span>(<span>x</span>) for <span>x</span> <span>in</span> bytes_])
    <span>return</span> bytestring</code></pre>
<p>This first encodes our text as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a> and then as a binary string. You can add some print statements to see how the message is transformed in the different steps, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.repl.it/images/tutorials/13-steganography/13-01-encode-binstring.png" alt="Encoding a message as a binary string"></p>
<p>The base64 step is not strictly necessary, but it is useful as any file or data can be encoded as base64. This opens our project up to future extensions such as hiding other kinds of files within image files instead of just text strings.</p>
<h2 id="adding-an-end-of-message-delimeter">Adding an 'end of message' delimeter</h2>
<p>We'll assume that our message will always 'fit' in our image. We can fit three binary digits per pixel (one for each of the RGB values), so our resulting binary string should be shorter than the the number of pixels in the image multiplied by three.</p>
<p>We'll also need to know when the message <em>ends</em>. The message will only be encoded in the beginning of the image file, but if we don't know how long the message is, we'll keep looking at normal pixels and trying to encode them as text data. Let's add an "end of string" delimiter to the end of our message: this should be something that wouldn't appear half way through our actual message by chance. We'll use the binary representation of '!ENDOFMESSAGE!' for this.</p>
<p>Modify your function to look as follows, which adds this delimeter at the end.</p>
<pre><code>import <span>base64
</span>
ENDOFMESSAGE = <span>"0100100101010101010101100100111101010010010001010011100101000111010101000101010101010110010101000101010100110000010001100100100001010010010100110100010100111101"</span>

def encode_message_as_bytestring(message):
    <span>b64 </span>= message.encode(<span>"utf8"</span>)
    <span>bytes_ </span>= <span>base64.encodebytes(b64)
</span>    <span>bytestring </span>= <span>""</span>.<span>join(["{:08b}".format(x) </span>for x in <span>bytes_])
</span>    <span>bytestring </span>+= ENDOFMESSAGE
    return <span>bytestring</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we can handle some basic text encoding, let's look at images.</p>
<h2 id="getting-pixels-from-an-image">Getting pixels from an image</h2>
<p>Find a PNG image somewhere - either one you've taken yourself or from a site like unsplash. You can use any online JPG to PNG converter if you only have <code>.jpg</code> files available.</p>
<p>Upload your PNG file by clicking on the three dot menu in the repl sidebar, in the top right corner of the files pane to the left, and selecting <code>upload file</code> or by simply dragging and dropping your file within the files pane.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.repl.it/images/tutorials/13-steganography/05-upload-file.png" alt="Image showing file upload"></p>
<p>We're going to write a function that extracts the raw pixel data from this image file. Add an import to the top of the file.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> png</code></pre>
<p>And then add a new function to the bottom of <code>main.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get_pixels_from_image</span><span>(fname)</span></span>:
    img = png.Reader(fname).read()
    pixels = img[<span>2</span>]
    <span>return</span> pixels</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read()</code> method returns a 4‑tuple consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>width: Width of PNG image in pixels</li>
<li>height: Height of PNG image in pixels</li>
<li>rows: A sequence or iterator for the row data</li>
<li>info: An info dictionary containing some meta data</li>
</ul>
<p>We are primarily interested in the third item, "rows", which is an iterator containing all the pixels of the image, row by row. If you're not familiar with Python generators take a look at <a href="https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/">this guide</a>, but they are essentially memory-efficient lists.</p>
<h2 id="encoding-the-image-with-the-message">Encoding the image with the message</h2>
<p>Now that we have the encoded message and pixels of the image ready we can combine them to form our secret encoded image.</p>
<p>Add the following function to the bottom of the <code>main.py</code> file. This function takes in the outputs from the previous functions (our raw pixels and our message encoded as a binary string), and combines them.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>encode_pixels_with_message</span>(<span>pixels, bytestring</span>):</span>
    <span>'''modifies pixels to encode the contents from bytestring'''</span>

    enc_pixels = []
    string_i = <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> row <span>in</span> pixels:
        enc_row = []
        <span>for</span> i, char <span>in</span> <span>enumerate</span>(row):
            <span>if</span> string_i &gt;= <span>len</span>(bytestring):
                pixel = row[i]
            <span>else</span>:
                <span>if</span> row[i] % <span>2</span> != <span>int</span>(bytestring[string_i]):
                    <span>if</span> row[i] == <span>0</span>:
                        pixel = <span>1</span>
                    <span>else</span>:
                        pixel = row[i] - <span>1</span>
                <span>else</span>:
                    pixel = row[i]
            enc_row.append(pixel)
            string_i += <span>1</span>

        enc_pixels.append(enc_row)
    <span>return</span> enc_pixels</code></pre>
<p>This is the most complicated part of our project, but most of the code is there to handle edge cases. The important insight is that we want to control whether each pixel has an odd value (representing a 1 in our binary string) or an even one (to represent a 0). By chance, half of the pixel values will already have the correct value.</p>
<p>We simply loop through the binary string and the pixel and 'bump' each value that isn't correct by one. That is, we subtract 1 from the value if we need to change it from odd to even or vice versa. We don't want any negative numbers, so if we need to change any of the <code>0</code> values, we add 1 instead.</p>
<h3 id="writing-our-modified-pixels-back-to-an-image">Writing our modified pixels back to an image</h3>
<p>We now have all the image data, including the encoded message but it is still just a list of pixels. Let's add a function that will compile our pixels back into a PNG image.</p>
<p>Add the following function to the bottom of the <code>main.py</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>def write<span>_pixels_to_image(<span>pixels</span>, <span>fname</span>)</span>:
    png.from<span>_array(<span>pixels</span>, 'RGB')</span>.save(fname)</code></pre>
<p>The above function takes the array <code>pixels</code> and uses the <code>png</code> module to write these to a brand new <code>.png</code> file.</p>
<p>Play around with these functions to make sure you understand how they work. Before we write some wrapper code to actually use these, we're going to do everything backwards so that we can also extract hidden messages from previously encoded PNG files.</p>
<h2 id="decoding-messages-from-image-files">Decoding messages from image files</h2>
<p>First we need a function that can turn a binary string back into readable text. As before, we'll go via base64 for better compatability. Add the following function to the bottom of the <code>main.py</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>def decode<span>_message_from_bytestring(<span>bytestring</span>)</span>:
    bytestring = bytestring.split(ENDOFMESSAGE)<span>[<span>0</span>]</span>
    message = <span>int</span>(bytestring, <span>2</span>).<span>to</span><span>_bytes(<span>len</span>(<span>bytestring</span>)</span> 
    message = base64.decodebytes(message).decode(<span>"utf8"</span>)
    return message</code></pre>
<p>Remember how we added a special <code>E…</code></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h4>Introduction</h4><p>Escrow is a payment setup where the payer sends funds to a third party rather than directly to the payee. If certain conditions are met, the third party routes the funds to the recipient; if not, the funds get returned to the sender. Escrow is particularly useful for high value payments because the payer is guaranteed their money back if the payee doesn’t meet the conditions.</p><p>Many Americans encounter escrow when they buy or sell a home. In the US, the final step in buying a home is referred to as the “closing process.” While it can vary from state to state, the basic premise is that the buyer delivers the funds to a third party, the seller signs over the deed (or title) to the property, and that third party then transfers the funds to the seller once all the documents are complete. The third party is often referred to as a “title and escrow agent.”</p><p>This post takes the sale of a residential home and walks through how to build the flow of funds associated with the escrow process. We hope this guide is useful in demystifying how an escrow company might automate its payment operations using Modern Treasury.</p><h4>The User Experience</h4><p>Let’s say you’re building a title and escrow company in the US that helps clients sell their homes online. The user experience steps might look something like this:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Billie Buyer commits to buying a house. Billie will make a 20% down payment in cash and will take out a mortgage for the remaining 80%. </li><li>You assign an escrow bank account to the transaction, collect the two incoming wire transfers from Billie Buyer and the lender, and inform the seller when the funds are in your possession.</li><li>At that point, Sandy Seller signs over the property.</li><li>Once you’ve determined all the documentation is completed correctly, you disburse the full purchase amount to Sandy Seller via wire transfer. </li></ol><p>The flow of funds is straightforward: two incoming wire transfers, and one outgoing wire transfer. This can get significantly more complicated if there are multiple sources of funds, or if there are other parties to be paid, such as tax authorities or other settlement agents. But for the sake of clarity, we’ll start with this simple scenario.</p><h4>Payment Ops Architecture<br></h4><p>To start, you should decide on the account structure itself. Escrow accounts have specific legal designations at banks and not all banks offer them. In addition, you should decide whether to use a single bank account for multiple transactions or to use virtual accounts.<br></p><p><a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/docs/virtual-accounts" target="_blank">Virtual accounts</a> are accounts with unique account numbers within a physical bank account. They are much faster to provision than real bank accounts and guarantee one-to-one reconciliation. For our architecture, using virtual accounts as escrow accounts is ideal because we can create one account per house sale. This helps us segregate funds in our reconciliation, as opposed to mixing the funds of multiple house sales in a single account. Also, single transactions per virtual account create a more manageable audit trail.<br></p><figure id="w-node-18dd9f1739d7-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/6009051bee1c4e7860a4289f_Escrow%20Journal%20Post%20Diagram.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><h4>API Calls and Timings</h4><p>With our payment ops architecture in hand, we’re ready to build. <br></p><h5>Step 1: Assign a Virtual Account to a sale and share numbers with Buyer and Lender</h5><p>As soon as you learn of an impending house sale, you create a virtual account and share its details with Billie Buyer. You might also generate an invoice for Billie Buyer to share with their mortgage lender, along with specific instructions as to the amount and breakdown to be included in the wires.<br></p><p>To do so, you’d make an Modern Treasury API request like the following:<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br> &nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br> &nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/virtual_accounts \<br> &nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br> &nbsp;-d '{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Sale of 123 Main Street",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"internal_account_id": "c743edb7-4059-496a-94b8-06fc081156fd",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"account_details": [<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"account_number": "2000001",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"account_number_type": "other"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;]<br> &nbsp;}'</h6><p><em>‍</em>The response includes the unique routing details for the newly created account. &nbsp;You might also want to add additional information about the sale in the account’s metadata, for example: details about the buyer, seller, property in question, expected close date, any unique arrangements, and other information.</p><h5>Step 2: Create Expected Payments to monitor the wires you expect to receive<br></h5><p>Though not required, it’s useful to create Expected Payments for the two incoming wires you expect to receive. This way, Modern Treasury will notify your system via webhook whether a given payment succeeds within your specified time range, or if it is overdue:<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br> &nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br> &nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/expected_payments \<br> &nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br> &nbsp;-d '{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"description": "Sale of 123 Main Street (Billie’s Portion)",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"internal_account_id": "c743edb7-4059-496a-94b8-06fc081156fd",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"virtual_account_id": "virtual-account-id",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"direction": "credit",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"amount_upper_bound": 6000000,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"amount_lower_bound": 6000000,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"date_upper_bound": "2021-01-15"<br> &nbsp;}'</h6><p><em>‍</em>Some banks will notify you in advance of a payment settling in an account. Modern Treasury captures that notification in the form of an Incoming Payment Detail object. Subscribing to Incoming Payment Detail <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#incoming-payment-details" target="_blank">webhooks</a> will be the first indication from the bank that the wires will settle soon.</p><h5>Step 3: Disburse funds </h5><p>Once the funds have arrived and the documents have been signed, you can disburse the total amount due to Sandy Seller. Let’s say Sandy Seller is getting $300,000 in net proceeds, which will go out via a single wire. Note that the amount is in cents, not dollars, so it is presented as 30000000:</p><h6>‍<br>curl --request POST \<br> &nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br> &nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/payment_orders \<br> &nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br> &nbsp;-d '{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"description": "Sale of 123 Main Street (Sandy’s Payout)",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"type": "wire",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"amount": 30000000,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"direction": "credit",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"currency": "USD",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"originating_account": "virtual-account-id",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"receiving_account_id": "sandy-external-account-id",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"counterparty_id": "sandy-counterparty-id"<br> &nbsp;}'</h6><p><em>‍</em>Once the payment goes through, the account will be debited $300,000 and the transaction will be complete.</p><p>Lastly, you want to add <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#metadata" target="_blank">metadata</a> to the payment for future reference. In addition to metadata tags (eg. key value pairs such as Type: Residential or State: Colorado) you might also attach the PDF for the legal docs, or the CSV calculating the amounts. This will be useful for finance teams that might have questions about this payment in the future.</p><p>That’s it. You have just built a sophisticated payment ops architecture for a house sale with a few API calls.</p><div><p>In reality, of course, things can be more elaborate. Billie Buyer could have multiple sources of funds for the down payment, as they may be receiving funds from family or from a service like <a href="http://haus.com/" target="_blank">Haus</a>. They may also be working with multiple lenders if they have a second mortgage. And depending on the state and county the house is located in, the escrow company may have to disburse funds for sales tax or other fees.</p></div><h4>What Can Go Wrong?</h4><p>Payment operations software, such as <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/" target="_blank">Modern Treasury</a>, can manage not only the happy path as described above but also edge cases when things go wrong. A common issue could be that a seller could mistype their bank account details, causing the payment to be returned. Modern Treasury supports account verification with providers like <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/docs/plaid-integration-guide" target="_blank">Plaid</a>, so both you and the seller can be confident that funds are routed to the right destination.</p><p>Customer service issues are another type of problem that can arise, such as when a lender sends the incorrect amount. In that case, there might be an additional transaction necessary or an explanatory note for future audits. Modern Treasury supports tracking funds using double-entry <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/docs/ledgers-overview" target="_blank">Ledgers</a>. This way, ops teams can refer to an immutable history of the transaction data, since all money movements are captured and displayed. In the future, accountants and auditors won’t be left wondering about a wire, since contextual information will be tied to the bank statement transaction in question.<br></p><h4>More?</h4><p>This post laid out a simple yet robust foundation for payment ops at an escrow company, leaving plenty of room for future functionality. </p><p>For any specific questions, or to see how Modern Treasury can help make your company’s payment ops simple, scalable, and secure, <a href="https://app.moderntreasury.com/sign_up" target="_blank">sign up today</a>.<br><em>Note: Modern Treasury empowers teams to make payment operations simple, scalable, and secure.

<p>In the past four years, I wrote three eBooks about programming. It’s like an
addiction.</p>
<p>I would be terrible at talking about writing techniques, so I won’t. But the
content is not everything when you write an eBook. You have to care about
creating <strong>beautiful files to release</strong>: PDF, ePub, Kindle…</p>
<p>Here is the story of how I built my eBooks, especially
<a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">the last one</a>. After some trial and errors, in the
end, I used the same recipe as the two previous ones, and it involves a
fantastic tool: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p>I wanted my last eBook to be a practical guide, not an academic manual. So I
imagined a very <strong>custom design</strong>, with a <strong>dark theme</strong> and many colors (it is
not designed to be printed).</p>
<p>Since it was about coding, I also wanted to include some source code examples
with <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Bust most of all, I wanted an efficient workflow.</p>

<p>I intended to release a first version of the book ASAP, then iterate thanks to
readers’ feedback and new ideas I had. For this reason, I wanted to focus on the
content and on the appearance <strong>independently</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to spend time on the presentation each time I updated the content.
I’m a web developer; it wouldn’t occur to me to edit my CSS each time I update
the HTML content. Same here.</p>

<p>I thought: why not just use <strong>MS Word</strong> or its Apple version, <strong>Pages</strong>? Well, I
tried. It didn’t go well.</p>
<p>You can customize pretty much everything you want. Every color, font family,
font size… But it gets trickier when you want to include source code.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to have syntax highlighting, the <em>less bad</em> solution I found was
to copy and paste from VS Code. At first, it looked (kind of) okay, but as soon
as I wanted to modify it, it went terribly: the formatting was lost, spaces were
inserted where I didn’t want them…</p>
<p>Definitely, these tools are not made to write content with embedded source code.</p>
<p>I also tried <strong>Illustrator</strong> and its open-source alternative,
<a href="https://www.scribus.net/"><strong>Scribus</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>I admire people able to use these applications. They seem to require a lot of
training and practice. Unfortunately, I intended to release my book in the next
two years, so I didn’t have time to learn them. 😉</p>

<p>I’m used to writing content using <strong>Markdown</strong>. Or in <strong>Slack</strong>. Or in
<strong>Notion</strong> (for this blog post). Today, we have such perfect tools for
writing. I didn’t want to struggle each time I update some examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the end, I relied on the tool I used for my previous books: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a command-line tool whose main feature is
converting some text (usually Markdown) to another format: HTML, ePub, PDF, etc.</p>
<p>I used it for my other books, and it’s perfect for “academic” work (thesis,
research articles). But I wasn’t sure that creating something a bit more
original, with shiny colors and such, was possible.</p>

<p>To write the content, I could now write using Markdown, with the basic

<p>By the way, syntax highlighting is themeable, and I really wanted to use

created

<p>The only thing I find problematic with Pandoc is
<a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">its documentation</a>. It contains a lot of
information, but it’s on one page.</p>
<p>One page!</p>
<p>So you scroll, then scroll, and scroll again. And when you want to find
something, you do Cmd/Ctrl+F, type “color”, oh cool, there is something. Then
you realize you’re in the section concerning the generation of some obscure and
unknown document format…</p>
<p>Anyway, you can usually find what you’re looking for. I’d just prefer if it used
something more modern, such as Gitbook or Docusaurus, to maintain the
documentation and make it easier to navigate.</p>

<p>Pandoc is very good to generate HTML or an ePub file. You can give it some CSS
to customize anything you want. It would be a dream if you were able to do the
same to generate a customized PDF.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is slightly more complicated…</p>

<p>To generate PDFs, Pandoc uses <em>pdflatex</em>, which relies on
<strong><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></strong>. The LaTeX language is used to write
documents with a powerful but unusual syntax. These documents are then converted
to PDF, Postscript, etc.</p>
<p>So, a little like Pandoc. But with a weird syntax instead of beautiful Markdown.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you want to customize the PDF rendered by Pandoc with
<em>pdflatex</em>, you don’t have a choice: you need to provide some LaTeX code, a bit
like CSS.</p>
<p>And I didn’t want to spend several months learning LaTeX—it’s truly fantastic,
you can do anything you want with it. So I did what every good developer hates
doing: search on Google and copy-paste pieces of code.</p>
<p>Here is, for example, how I managed to have the book title in the page footer:
(sorry if you are a LaTeX guru, it probably will hurt your eyes)</p>
<pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span><span>fancyhdr</span><span>}</span><br><span>\pagestyle</span><span>{</span>fancy<span>}</span><br><span>\fancyhf</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><br><span>\lfoot</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><span>[</span>overlay,baseline=<span>{</span>(0,0)<span>}</span><span>]</span><br>  <span>\node</span><span>[</span>rectangle, outer sep=0pt, text=white, anchor=west <span>]</span><br>    (pageno)<br>    <span>{</span>A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks, © Sebastien Castiel<span>}</span>;<br>  <span>\draw</span><span>[</span>fill=comment, draw=comment<span>]</span><br>    (<span>[</span>xshift=-<span>\oddsidemargin</span>-1in<span>]</span>pageno.north west)<br>      rectangle<br>    (<span>[</span>yshift=1.5pt<span>]</span>pageno.south east);<br>  <span>\end</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Well, to be fair, it would have been much more straightforward if I just wanted
the book title. But I wanted it in an indigo rectangle starting from the far
left of the page.</p>

<p>Still, most of the time, I was able to get what I wanted. It just took more time
than I wanted to spend on it.</p>
<p><em>You can find here
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-header-tex">the complete LaTeX header file</a>
I used for my book. I cleaned it a little and added some comments.</em></p>
<p>Although I didn’t interact with them, I’m sure the LaTeX community is fantastic
because you can find many resources on the Internet: answers on forums,
tutorials, manuals, etc.</p>

<p>I think the last time I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU make</a> utility was like
ten years ago. I had this idea that it was only used by C or C++ projects.</p>
<p>If you never heard of <strong>GNU make</strong>, it’s a utility program to run specific
commands to generate files. It’s mostly used to compile and build programs, but
you can use it for any command.</p>
<p>My first intuition was to write a shell script to generate my book in several
formats. Quickly, I realized a <strong>Makefile</strong> would make more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had <em>content</em> files and <em>resource</em> files (images, the LaTeX header, for
example)</li>
<li>I needed to generate intermediate files, such as the cover as a PDF from a PNG</li>
<li>Some formats (ePub) were used to create other formats (Kindle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a Makefile, I regenerated only the needed parts, based on which files were
updated since the latest build. I could run <code>make pdf</code>, <code>make epub</code>,
<code>make mobi</code>, or just <code>make</code> to generate all formats.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of my Makefile used to generate the <em>ePub</em> and <em>mobi</em>
(Kindle) files:</p>
<pre><code>BOOK_TITLE <span>=</span> A\ React\ Developer’s\ Guide\ to\ Hooks\ -\ Sebastien\ Castiel<p><span>epub</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>echo <span>'✅  ePub'</span></p><p><span>kindle</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi<br>  <span>@</span>echo ‘✅  Kindle’</p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.epub</span><span>:</span> dist content/*.md images/* resources/dracula.theme resources/metadata.xml resources/epub.css<br>  <span>@</span>pandoc content/foreword.md content/ch*.md content/resources.md \<br>  --output<span>=</span>dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub \<br>  --highlight-style resources/dracula.theme \<br>  --standalone \<br>  --epub-metadata<span>=</span>resources/metadata.xml \<br>  -c resources/epub.css \<br>  --epub-cover-image<span>=</span>cover.png \<br>  --toc --toc-depth<span>=</span>1 \<br>  --metadata title<span>=</span><span>"A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks"</span></p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.mobi</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>kindlegen dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub -o <span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p></code></pre>
<p>Okay, maybe slightly overkill for my needs, but I felt so powerful! 💪🏻</p>
<p><em>You can find
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-makefile">here the complete Makefile</a>
for my book.</em></p>

<p>I embedded the examples’ source code in a small <strong>React</strong> application to run
them locally. The user can start it by running <code>yarn start</code> and navigate easily
through them.</p>
<p>Now, I feel a bit silly not to have thought of using
<a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a>, which could have been a perfect
solution.</p>

<p>I often design graphics using <strong><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></strong> (for
example, the banner for the <a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">Gumroad page</a>), even if
at the end I manipulate and generate bitmap images. I know it’s not its first

<p>If you know a better choice, please please please tell me!</p>

<p>From the beginning, I really wanted a custom presentation with a dark theme.</p>
<p>Now, I realize this wish took me a lot of extra time. And I would have preferred
spending that time on the content. Plus, I don’t know if the readers actually
like this theme or not…</p>
<p>Also, it may have been better to focus first on the <strong>web support</strong>.
<a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> could do an excellent job: readers could
navigate the sections, search for keywords, etc.</p>
<p>The PDF or ePub version would be secondary content: available, but maybe with a
generic appearance. So what?</p>

<p>In the end, if the user finds the content useful, shouldn’t it be all that

<p>I will probably consider this change soon. Plus, I’d like to create a <strong>course</strong>

<p>Regarding the workflow with Pandoc, I’m quite satisfied with it. Writing using
Markdown is lovely to focus on the content without caring how it will render.

    <p>Teams, especially at growth companies, often have a pattern of taking two steps forward and one step back. Let’s explore how teams often unknowingly slip after growing and let’s explore ways to prevent that from happening. Only forward steps!</p>

<h2 id="this-happens-a-lot---the-setup">This Happens A Lot - The Setup</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about my favorite pretend team, The Acme Widget Builders. It’s a cross-functional team with a product manager, an engineering manager, and a number of engineers. The team is operating very well and is growing with the company. Eventually the Original Product Manager has to hire another PM to manage the team, so the Original Product Manager can manage a larger group of teams.</p>

<p>About 6 months later the team starts to suffer a string of quality issues. Nobody really knows why this is happening, but it’s frustrating. The team starts to focus much more heavily on QA and gets back on the righteous path over time. However, a concern remains - what happened?</p>

<h2 id="this-happens-a-lot---the-diagnosis">This Happens A Lot - The Diagnosis</h2>

<p>After doing some soul searching about what the heck happened, you realize that the Original Product Owner was a Widget Whiz. They knew every single thing about the Acme Widgets, and, in fact, they were catching a lot of bugs when reviewing features-to-be-launched at the UAT phase. Herein lies the issue.</p>

<p>It’s not really the PMs primary job to catch bugs in the UAT phase. Actually, when the Original Product Owner transferred the team responsibility to the new PM, the Original Product Owner never mentioned the QA they were doing in UAT. As a result, the team lost a critical QA resource and never thought about how to counteract that reality.</p>

<h2 id="implicit-responsibilities">Implicit Responsibilities</h2>

<p>When team’s grow, explicit responsibilities are often transferred deftly and quickly as new team members join. However, implicit or unstated responsibilities often fall by the wayside. It’s not part of the official checklist, it might not even be part of the job, but the reality remains - if you’re filling a gap and leave without finding a replacement, that gap is going to show up as soon as you leave.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you might have an explicit responsibility that you do way better than expected. Handing off that responsibility to someone who is not going to fully fill your shoes (even if at first), is another form of creating implicit gaps on the team.</p>

<h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2>

<p>When you transition a team that you were previously a leader in, take stock of the things you were doing that weren’t part of the official role. Consider things that you are disproportionately owning for the team. It can be anything: meeting running, architecture, QA, recruiting.</p>

<p>Then, find ways to do some of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Let people know the gaps will exist. Announce the diagnosis.</li>
  <li>Find ways to personally ensure continuity and resource the gap.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Drive prediction @ Datto</strong></h4>
<p>	We’ve all had a hard drive fail on us, and often it’s as sudden as booting your machine and realizing you can’t access a bunch of your files. It’s not a fun experience. It’s especially not fun when you have an entire data center full of drives that are all important to keeping your business running. What if we could predict when one of those drives would fail, and get ahead of it by preemptively replacing the hardware before the data is lost? This is where the history of predictive drive failure at Datto begins.</p>
<p>	First and foremost, to make a prediction you need data. Hard drives have a built-in utility called SMART<em> (</em><strong><em>S</em></strong><em>elf-</em><strong><em>M</em></strong><em>onitoring, </em><strong><em>A</em></strong><em>nalysis and </em><strong><em>R</em></strong><em>eporting </em><strong><em>T</em></strong><em>echnology)</em> that reports an array of statistics about how the drive is functioning. Here’s an abbreviated view of what that looks like:<br></p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/smart_file_sample.png" alt=""></figure><p>	Datto collects a report like this from each hard drive in its storage servers once per day. Each attribute in the report has three important numbers associated with it: value, thresh, and worst. Each attribute also has a feature named raw_value, but this is discarded due to inconsistent reporting standards between drive manufacturers. </p>
<p>	<strong>Value:</strong> A number between 1 and 253, inclusive. The value reflects how well the drive is operating with respect to the attribute, with 1 being the worst and 253 being the best. The initial value is arbitrarily determined by the manufacturer, and can vary by drive model. </p>
<p>	<strong>Thresh: </strong>A threshold below which the value should not fall in normal operation. If the value falls below the threshold, there is likely something wrong with the drive.</p>
<p>	<strong>Worst: </strong>A record of the lowest value ever recorded for the attribute.</p>
<p>	A quick approach to using these values to make useful predictions is to pick a couple of attributes that seem important and make an alert if any of their values pass below the associated threshold. This is how the first iteration of predictive drive failure at Datto worked. It wasn’t perfect, but it was definitely better than nothing!</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/code_snippet_1.png" alt=""></figure><p>The next iteration of drive failure prediction was assigning a weighted health score to each drive. This score was defined by assigning weight to several different attributes based on how severe they appeared to be, then adding them together. This prediction method was better than its predecessor, but could potentially be improved even further.</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/code_snippet_2.png" alt=""></figure><p>This brings us to the most recent iteration of drive failure prediction at Datto and the topic of this article: <strong>smarterCTL</strong>, a machine learning model using most attributes reported by SMART to make the most informed prediction possible. <code>Smartctl</code> is the command line utility used to collect SMART reports. SmarterCTL is a machine learning model making use of <code>smartctl</code>, so it’s the smart-ER version of it. Yeah, it’s a bad pun, but I’m an engineer not a comedian.</p>
<h4><strong>Machine learning &amp;&amp; SMART</strong></h4>
<p>Before we get into the details of smarterCTL, let’s briefly go over machine learning. At its core, machine learning is the process of applying statistics to a dataset to find patterns in it. Once the patterns are found, they can be applied to new data to make assumptions about what that new data means. The defining feature of machine learning is that the programmer doesn’t have any input in figuring out the patterns in the data; the algorithm does that on its own through trial and error. For a great high level introduction to how machine learning works, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_uwKZIAeM0">this</a> two minute video. </p>
<p>	To get a feel for workflow and terminology, let’s walk through a simplified application of machine learning on drive failure prediction. This example glosses over details and makes some leaps of logic to keep the scope broad. For a more accurate look under the hood of decision tree-based machine learning models, check out this <a href="https://e2eml.school/how_decision_trees_work.html">article</a> and the other resources linked throughout this section.</p>
<p>To make predictions, we need a dataset to train the model on. In this case, the data points are hard drives and the features of those data points are the attributes SMART provides.</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/datapoint_example.png" alt=""></figure><p>	These data points are labelled as members of the negative or positive class, which in this case means “hard drive operates normally” or “hard drive has failed.” Note that the “positive” in “positive class” doesn’t mean “good.” Instead, it means “this sample exhibits the behavior we’re looking out for.” A machine learning model would read this dataset, then look for patterns in the features that determine why each hard drive ended up in its class.</p>
<p>Normally there would be enough data points and features that a human couldn’t read the whole dataset—let alone spot a pattern in it! This example is simplified enough for us to step through the process that a model might follow. Let’s look for a pattern in each feature:</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/seek_error_rate.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Nothing to see here, neither class is homogeneous when it comes to seek_error_rate.<br></p>

<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/spin_up_time.png" alt=""></figure><p>Again, we can’t make a determination based on this attribute alone. There isn’t an obvious split, like high numbers being good and low numbers being bad.</p>

<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/power_on_hours.png" alt=""></figure><p>This time it looks like there is a pattern! Drives with high power-on hours are healthy and drives with low power-on hours will fail. This doesn’t make logical sense though—a drive with low power-on hours should be the healthiest, since it’s the closest to mint condition. Let’s look a little deeper, and see if we can find a correlation between this feature and another that tells us something more logical. </p>

<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/spin_up_over_poh.png" alt=""></figure><p>A-ha! There’s still a difference in magnitude between the two classes, but this time there’s an explanation for it that makes sense: an older drive with a high spin-up time is aging and degrading normally, while a very young drive with a high spin-up time indicates that there might be something like a factory defect.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve figured out the pattern, let’s see how our theoretical model would classify these new SMART reports:</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/unclassified.png" alt=""></figure><p>	The ratio of spin-up time over power-on hours for drive X is 0.0002, which indicates that it will remain healthy. The ratio for drive Y is 0.045, pointing toward failure.<br>	So how do we know if the model made correct predictions? Well, we just have to wait and see. One of the trickier parts of this problem space is verifying results, because the whole point is to allow us to take action before the thing we’re predicting ever happens. Keep this in mind, it’ll come back to bite us later.</p>
<p>SmarterCTL’s job is to classify hard drives as “failing” or “not failing” so Datto can avoid being blindsided by lost drives and preemptively swap them for healthy ones. If there are patterns in SMART stats that indicate drive failure, smarterCTL will learn those patterns from SMART data Datto has collected over the past 3 years. Then smarterCTL can monitor new daily SMART reports and produce an alert when a drive is exhibiting a pattern that indicates failure.</p>

<h2><strong>Act 2 - Data preparation</strong></h2>
<p>We have several hundred gigabytes of SMART files spanning 3 years and a relatively beefy server to train a machine learning model on—the next step is to set it up and let it churn through the data, right? Unfortunately the work has just begun. Even though machine learning models have a reputation for taking days, or even weeks to train, preparing the data is often the most time consuming part of the process! </p>
<p>	Software folks know that computers are “dumb” and will only do exactly what they’re instructed to. Therefore, the data fed into a machine learning model needs to be very carefully curated. The model has no intuition about whether the conclusions it’s coming to are logical or not, so data that doesn’t accurately describe the whole problem space will lead to a model that confidently spouts nonsense.</p>
<p>In machine learning, the job of the programmer isn’t to spot the patterns in the data: it’s to spot the antipatterns that the model might fall into along the way. Good data treatment and preparation are the first steps in avoiding those antipatterns. </p>
<h4><strong>Shaping the data</strong></h4>
<p>The first step is turning the human readable SMART reports into something more machine readable.</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/sample_smart_data_1.png" alt=""></figure><p>	I condensed all of the data in each day of smart reports into its own csv file, but some key information was still missing. Since this data will be used to train a model, every data point needs to have a class label associated with it—the model needs to know whether these are healthy or failed drives so it can start to learn about potential patterns. </p>
<p>Producing the class labels ended up being a little tricky—if a drive is in poor enough health to be a member of the failing class, it might already be failing badly enough to not report SMART stats. To get a clearer idea of how drives were behaving and when they were failing out, I wrote a script that walked through every day of SMART reports and tracked how and when each drive failed. </p>
<p>Our servers use the filesystem ZFS, which pools together storage devices into groups called “zpools”. The zpool reports a health status for each drive in the pool. When my script comes across a failing zpool status for a drive, it notes on which day the failure occurred then goes through every daily csv and adds the following features to that drive’s row:</p>
<ol><li>Whether this drive ever fails (class label)</li><li>If so, in how many days from this csv’s date the failure would occur, and</li><li>The zpool status associated with the failure</li></ol><p>With the addition of those features, our data now looks like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/sample_smart_data_2.png" alt=""></figure><p>	At this point the dataset is a collection of csv files, one per day, that contain:</p>
<ul><li>One row per drive</li><li>The SMART data reported by each drive on that day</li><li>Whether each drive is currently failed</li><li>Whether each drive ever failed while we tracked it</li></ul><p>	Seems like enough data to start making predictions, right? Well, kind of! At this point, the data is well-formed enough that a model could understand it and start producing predictions. The quality of those predictions would be poor, though; the data needs a lot more treatment to remove the pitfalls lurking within.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Cleaning the data</strong></h4>
<p>	Right now, the data is well formed but messy. It’s in the right shape, …</p></div></div>

<h3>Piracy in the pandemic</h3>



<p>The pandemic may have stopped many from going to the cinema, but that doesn’t mean people didn’t watch films in 2020. Whether through streaming services like Netflix or old-fashioned TV channels and DVDs, there are still many ways to enjoy films at home.</p>



<p>And, of course, there’s always piracy.</p>



<p>According to London-based company Muso, which tracks copyright infringement in 196 countries, visits to sites hosting pirated streams of films increased <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6347345/Has%20the%20displaced%20cinema%20audience%20become%20the%20new%20piracy%20audience.pdf?utm_campaign=COVID-19%20Protect%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=89190861&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fsAlLpaO7ia-oGXZtShQz3YvarSVxz-MOcRsd6n-2MdwgaqkuJst2pleQF6wqtV2M9iKJJrEHjfzWrF6zIi64vzWBy6G_Y04I0aTFZKM8_SzKuys&amp;utm_content=89190861&amp;utm_source=hs_automation">as much as 90%</a> in some countries during the first few months of the pandemic. The company provided<em> Rest of World</em> with its list of the top 50 foreign films accessed via illegal streaming sites from January to October last year.</p>



<p>Predictably, many of the films are from the last two years. One notable exception? “The Flu,” a 2013 film about a lethal, airborne virus that infects a South Korean city. But which films made the top ten?</p>



<h2 id="attraction-2-invasion">Attraction 2: Invasion</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Russia<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Horror<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 12/19/2019</p>

</p></figure>



<p>An ordinary girl becomes the object of study after she gains superpowers from exposure to extraterrestrial technology in this film from Russian director Fyodor Bondarchuk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Invasion” picks up where the 2017 film “Attraction” left off, after an alien ship has crash-landed in a Russian city. Exposed to alien technology, Julia is brought into a secret government lab to be studied. After gaining superpowers that threaten not only humans but also extraterrestrial life, Julia has to decide which side she is on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the film has not been widely reviewed in Western media outlets, the entertainment website <a href="https://www.eclecticpop.com/2020/12/movie-review-does-attraction-2-invasion-vtorzhenie-satisfy-as-a-sequel.html">Eclectic Pop</a> noted that “the sequel avoids the mind-numbing quality of its genre peers to provide something captivating,” providing a worthy sequel to its predecessor. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt8060328/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$15.9 million</a> worldwide.</p>

Ronnie, played by Indian actor Tiger Shroff, beats up men, cars, tanks, and helicopters, mostly shirtless. “He bounces off buildings, treads on air; delivers triple roundhouse kicks and does devastating stuff with his hands and feet,” the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/baaghi-3-movie-review-tiger-shroff-saves-syria-but-not-sanity/story-wrmhhjpvtV40GFYOsZCsUI.html"><em>Hindustan Times </em>wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the film attempts to reach beyond Bollywood cliches, one trope remains: demonizing Muslims as villains. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt8366590/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$16.7 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="sputnik">Sputnik</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Russia<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Drama<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 9/10/2020</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Two Russian cosmonauts return to Earth from a research mission in 1983, but their spacecraft malfunctions on the way home. Only one crew member, Konstantin Sergeyevich, survives. But he is not alone. Konstantin’s body houses a slimy, spindly creature that is dormant during the day, in his stomach. At night, it climbs out of his body in search of human flesh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reviewer Matt Zoller Seitz says a “very Russian vibe of <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sputnik-movie-review-2020">soulful heaviness</a>” sets the film apart. Rather than give up his dream of space travel, Konstantin, whose spouse passed away before the journey, put his son in an orphanage. When he returns to Earth, Konstantin must confront his responsibility. Though “Sputnik” is about an alien, it focuses heavily on humans: how and where our weak points are, how we can be manipulated, and how our biology can fail us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Released in the middle of a pandemic, “Sputnik” grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt11905962/?ref_=bo_se_r_2">$307,062</a> at the box office worldwide and was shown as part of the <a href="https://tribecafilm.com/films/sputnik-2020">Tribeca Film Festival</a>.</p>



<h2 id="one-piece-stampede">One Piece: Stampede</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Japan<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Animation<br><strong>Release date: </strong>8/9/2019</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s probably no surprise that this anime film is on the list, as it’s based on one of the most popular Japanese manga series of all time: “One Piece,” by Eiichiro Oda. It is the 14th film in the franchise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pirates from around the world gather at a festival where they race to an island containing the legendary lost treasure of Gol D. Roger, king of the pirates. The race quickly unravels into fantasy violence, which the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-10-23/one-piece-stampede-review-anime"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> called “nonstop mayhem” — explosions, fistfights, earthquakes, and naval bombardments dart across the screen with colorful special effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luffy, the protagonist of the series, teams up with his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates. They face off against Bullet, who hopes to make his name as the strongest pirate, the new king, and someone who relies on only himself. Luffy, like all good role models, values friendship and teamwork. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt9430698/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$81.6 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="son-of-a-richnbsp">Son of a Rich&nbsp;</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>Here’s a comedic plot for the ages: an oligarch’s pampered son is tricked into believing that he has traveled through time to become a serf in a 19th-century village, in a bid to rehabilitate his appalling behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grigory’s family is so wealthy, he believes that he is above the law. He parties hard, gets into trouble, and scoffs in the face of authority. One day, he goes too far — and so his father, as one does, buys a large tract of land and hires a group of actors to create a 19th-century village. His son gets into an orchestrated fake car accident and wakes up in the village, believing that he’s traveled back through time. Watched by a network of hidden cameras (and a team of psychologists), the oligarch watches his son discard his privileged ways and learn the value of hard work.</p>



<p>Clearly, this relatable tale of redemption struck a chord with people: the Russian comedy directed by Klim Shipenko grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt11418452/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$43.8 million</a> and was one of the most pirated films of the year.</p>



<h2 id="recep-vedik-6">Recep İvedik 6</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>Recep, a man with a unibrow and a penchant for slapping people in the face, has misadventures in Kenya, in this Turkish slapstick comedy, directed by Togan Gökbakar.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Recep_%C4%B0vedik_6?id=3sJ0zlYkZME.P&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Recep İvedik</a> is at home watching television, when the mailman delivers him an invitation to a dried beans festival in Turkey’s Konya province. But instead of getting plane tickets to Konya, Recep and his best friend Nurullah end up on a flight to Kenya.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recep and Nurullah join a safari tour. A series of escalating comical escapades ensue, with everything from close encounters with the local wildlife to mediating a dispute between two tribes. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt7399138/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$17 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="peninsula">Peninsula</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> South Korea<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Thriller<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 7/15/2020</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVucSRLLeIM?feature=oembed" title="TRAIN TO BUSAN PRESENTS: PENINSULA (2020) Official Teaser | Zombie Action Movie" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The 2016 zombie thriller “Train to Busan” was met with universal critical acclaim and became one of the films that marked South Korea’s rise as a cinematic power. Peninsula, however, is another example of a sequel that doesn’t live up to the original.</p>



<p>“A sequel was inevitable, and despite some truly white-knuckle car chases and creative lighting, <em>Peninsula,</em> like many films that jump on the surprise hit bandwagon, proves lightning in a bottle happens only once,” the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/peninsula-ban-do-film-review"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a> wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, “Peninsula” shows people trying to escape the zombie-ridden South Korea of the first film. Captain Jung-Seok is unable to get his entire family out safely and, four years later, goes back to the country from the safe harbor of Hong Kong, to attempt to recover $20 million from a food truck. The captain dodges flesh-hungry zombies in their quest to find the money. Peninsula grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt8850222/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$39.7 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="miracle-in-cell-no">Miracle in Cell No. 7&nbsp;</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Turkey<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Drama<br><strong>Release date: </strong>10/10/2019</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2wPoBy2JQI?feature=oembed" title="Miracle in Cell No. 7 (Trailer- English subtitles) 2019 #MiracleInCell #Netflix #MiracleInCellNo7" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This Turkish drama, directed by Mehmet Ada Öztekin, is a remake of the 2013 South Korean film of the same name. The story focuses on Memo, a disabled father, and his seven-year-old daughter, Ova. At the film’s <a href="https://www.goldenglobes.com/articles/miracle-cell-no7-turkey">outset</a>, Memo and Ova live with her grandmother, Fatma Ana, in a small Aegean town.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Memo, who works as a shepherd, is sentenced to death after being accused of murdering the garrison commander’s young daughter. He is sent to cell number 7, where he awaits his execution. The prisoners realize that Memo could not have committed the crime. Back home, Fatma Ana passes away. Ova, now alone, sets out on a quest to be reunited with her father.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Miracle in Cell No. 7” was chosen as Turkey’s Oscar nominee for the 93rd Academy Awards and was the <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/arts/cinema/what-makes-turkish-miracle-in-cell-no-7-a-popular-hit">most-watched</a> film in the country in 2019. By the end of the film, viewers are forced to reckon internally with their own perceptions of good and evil — and to take a long look at abuses of power and flaws within the justice system. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt10431500/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$17.2 million</a> at the box office worldwide.</p>



<h2 id="ip-man-4-the">Ip Man 4: The Finale</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Hong Kong<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>12/19/2019</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3LzxNct3eA?feature=oembed" title="IP MAN 4: THE FINALE  Trailer (2019) Donnie Yen Action Movie" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The final film in the saga of Bruce Lee’s martial arts master, “Ip Man 4” turns the lens on racism in the United States. In the film, which grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2076298/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$176 million</a> worldwide, fight scenes are used as a way to turn foreigners’ biases against them.</p>



<p>Mostly set in 1964 San Francisco, the film pits karate against kung fu — in the forms of a racist marine and Ip Man, a master of the Wing Chun school of the Chinese martial art, played again by Donnie Yen.</p>



<p>Yuen Woo-Ping, whose resume includes work on “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and “The Matrix” films, stages fights that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/movies/ip-man-4-the-finale-review.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> deemed “thrilling” and full of “fluttering limbs in action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its imagery is “bathed in a mid-century wash that makes the film look like it came from an ad in <em>Life</em> magazine,” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ip-man-4-finale-1264391"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> wrote. The film’s signature scene involves a teacup, a revolving circular glass table, and two people who won’t back down.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="parasitenbsp">Parasite&nbsp;</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> South Korea<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Thriller<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 5/30/2019</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The most pirated film last year shouldn’t be a surprise: as the first foreign-language film to win the Academy Award for best picture, it’s none other than “Parasite.”&nbsp;</p></div></div>

<p>A question, or some version of it, that keeps popping up on social media lately is, “How can $24 billion worth of tethers move a $650 billion bitcoin market cap?” </p>



<p>This is “a blitheringly stupid question on multiple levels, starting with basic arithmetic,” bitcoin hater David Gerard <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgerard/status/1351497484091224065">said on Twitter</a>. “It’s also a perennial dumb question.”</p>



<p>The question is being put forth by bitcoiners in an attempt to put people’s minds at ease about Tether. The thesis is that if tethers were to vanish—something that could happen if the U.S. Department of Justice were to give Tether <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-charges-against-liberty-reserve-one-world-s-largest">the Liberty Reserve treatment</a>—it would have little impact on bitcoin’s price, so you should stop worrying and keep buying bitcoin.</p>



<p>Someone posed the query recently on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/kxpr4k/genuinely_curious_how_does_tether_pump_btc_when/">r/buttcoin.</a> I am going to take a stab at sensibly answering the question in three parts starting with, What is market cap?</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah exactly – Tether is $24.5b, Bitcoin's market cap alone is $696b. Even if Tether somehow had $0 of the $24.5b it wouldn't cause Bitcoin to drop to $0.</p>— Riccardo Spagni (@fluffypony) <a href="https://twitter.com/fluffypony/status/1350473644233916416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>1. Market cap is meaningless nonsense</h2>



<p>Market cap is a nonsensical number when it comes to bitcoin. It’s calculated by multiplying the last transaction price of bitcoin by the number of bitcoins in circulation—currently $35,000 x 18.6 million. </p>



<p>That doesn’t mean that people bought every bitcoin in existence for that price. The vast majority of people who own bitcoin bought it at a far lower price than what it is today. It also doesn’t mean that if everyone suddenly decided to sell all of their bitcoins, each bitcoin would bring them $35,000. </p>



<p>In fact, it doesn’t mean that bitcoin has any value at all other than the hope that some bigger dummy will stroll along who is willing to pay more for it than you did. Bitcoiners like to imagine that bitcoins are valuable because there will only ever be 21 million of them. That makes them scarce. </p>



<p>Beanie Babies were scarce in the 90s, too, with some fetching upwards thousands of dollars on eBay. But by the end of the Beanie Baby bubble, no amount of scarcity could make them desirable. They became worthless</p>



<p>Market cap is just another way to make something that is worthless appear valuable. </p>



<p>Market cap came out of the traditional finance world. And then websites like <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a> came along and began applying the term to bitcoin. In the stock market, market capitalization refers to the total value of a company’s share of stock. But while companies have an intrinsic value, bitcoin does not. There is nothing behind bitcoin. It’s not a company. It is not a thing. It is simply a number in a database. </p>



<p>Here is an example of how silly market cap is when applied to crypto. Say I create 1 million CastorCoins and start listing them on some little-known offshore exchange for $1. Suddenly CastorCoin has a market cap of $1 million dollars. Does that mean I have a million dollars? No, it does not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or, as u/Ifinallycracked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/kxpr4k/genuinely_curious_how_does_tether_pump_btc_when/gjbrjrj/?context=3">puts it on r/buttcoin</a>: “If a bog roll contains 100 sheets and I manage to sell one sheet for a dollar, that doesn’t make it a $100 bog roll. Apply same logic to Bitscoin market cap. Success.”</p>



<p>Once you grasp that the bitcoin market cap does not mean that people have spent $650 billion on bitcoin, $24 billion worth of tethers—which represents 0.03% of the total bitcoin market cap—becomes a lot more significant.</p>

<h2>2. Price is determined at the margins</h2>



<p>The price of bitcoin is determined at the margins. If you want to drive up the price of bitcoin, you don’t have to buy every single bitcoin at the current price level. You simply have to scoop up the ones that are for sale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money flowing into bitcoin is what keeps the price afloat. If demand increases and people are willing to pay more for bitcoin, that pushes the price up. The more dollars people throw at it, the higher BTC will go. And it doesn’t matter if you are buying bitcoin with real dollars on a banked exchange like Coinbase—or fake dollars on an offshore exchange like Binance, Huobi, or Bitfinex.   </p>

<p>Right now, the latter is more prevalent—there are far more tethers flowing into bitcoin than actual dollars. In fact, 55% of all bitcoin is currently traded against tethers while only about 15% trade against real dollars, according to <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/btc/analysis/USDT">CoinCompare.</a> </p>



<p>This is what makes the current bitcoin bubble different than the last. In 2017, when the price of bitcoin ran up to nearly $20,000, there were a lot more real dollars in the system and only 1.5 billion tethers in circulation. Now, it’s mostly tethers pushing up the price of BTC.</p>

Pretty neat trick!</p>— David (@freeAgent85) <a href="https://twitter.com/freeAgent85/status/1351529387187867648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>3. Bitcoin is illiquid</h2>



<p>Bitcoin is relatively illiquid. According to <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-liquid-supply/">data from Glassnodes</a>, 78% of all bitcoin are not moving. In other words, of the 18.6 million bitcoins currently in existence, only about 4.2 million are in constant circulation. </p>



<p>At least 3 million bitcoin are lost because people like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html">this guy</a> can’t find their keys. (Just because you are the former CTO of Ripple, that doesn’t make you clever when it comes to safekeeping bitcoin.) And there are still plenty of folks holding on to their BTC in the hopes it will go stratospheric. Strong hands!</p>



<p>As a result, it doesn’t take a large buy or sell request to move the price of bitcoin. Printing billions of dollars out of thin air and using it to put supply-side pressure on a market as thin as bitcoin forces the prices up. Conversely, if enough people were to get panicky and rush to sell their bitcoin—<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7d1da0/definition_of_weak_hand/">weak hands!</a>—the results could be catastrophic. Literally, the entire market cap can go to zero in a moment.  </p>



<p>The whole point of Tether is to push up the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and then move those assets to OTC desks and banked exchanges, where they can be turned into fiat. As <a href="https://twitter.com/baskee/status/1351498416799567873">@Baskee</a> puts it: “Tether is a ladle; Bitcoin and USD are ashes and bullet casings, respectively.”</p>

<p>A collection of “unpopular opinion” and get-rich-quick party spoiler “stop the music” articles on “Is Bitcoin a Ponzi? Is Bitcoin a Speculative Bubble? Is Bitcoin a Digital 21st Century Tulip Mania? Is Bitcoin Comedy Gold?”</p>

<p>From the Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Prize Economists at various times, including Robert Shiller on 1 March 2014, Joseph Stiglitz on 29 November 2017, and Richard Thaler on 21 December 2017. On 29 January 2018, a noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as “a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology”, on 2 February 2018, professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called bitcoin the “mother of all bubbles”, and on 27 April 2018, a University of Chicago economist James Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania.</p>

<p>On 4 December 2013, Alan Greenspan referred to it as a “bubble” as did George Soros on 25 January 2018. Warren Buffett called bitcoin a “mirage” on 13 March 2014.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Some “unpopular” bitcoin facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin Proof-of-Waste Mining Is an Environmental Disaster</li>
  <li>Bitcon Is a Greater Fool BagHODLer Zero-Sum Fraudsters’ Greed Fest</li>
  <li>The Bigger the Lies the Better - To the Moon! Number Go Up! Will Quadruple to $100 000 in 2021!</li>

<p>Do surgeries work? Most of us assume they do, but is there any scientific evidence that they do?</p>

<p>In this episode, I talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/drianharris">Dr Ian Harris</a> who is a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Australia. He is a practicing orthopedic surgeon specializing in trauma surgery. Outside his practice, his research interests broadly cover the topic of surgical effectiveness and clinical research.</p>

<h3>What we talk about</h3>

<h3>Dive into Dr Ian Harris’ research</h3>

<li><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g3253">Relevant paper</a> backing the claim that most surgeries are ineffective</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes and key insights</h3>

<p>1/ <strong>What is a placebo surgery?</strong> It’s where you make an incision but not do anything. </p>

<p>It’s analogous to traditional placebo in medicine, where a sugar or salt pill is given instead of an active chemical to see whether the intended medicine has an actual impact.</p>

<p>2/ <strong>Majority of surgeries that Dr Ian Harris and other researchers have studied in fact are not more effective than placebos</strong>. This is shocking because even when we have no proof that they work, many of these surgeries are happening even today.</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Examples of such ineffective surgeries include back pain surgeries and knee pain surgeries.</strong> For such surgeries, randomized control trials have found that if you make an incision in the knee but don’t do anything, it’s as effective as actually conducting the surgery of the knee.</p>

<p>4/ Why do patients get better if the surgery doesn’t work? It’s because<strong> many diseases or pain have a natural progression</strong>, and we generally seek surgical/medicinal intervention when we’re in the worst condition. If the body heals / condition becomes better after that, we attribute improvement to the intervention rather than thinking it could have happened anyway (due to the natural course of the condition).</p>

<p>5/ As Dr Ian Harris said, the unsaid attitude could be stated like: “<strong>you have to operate on patients quickly before they get better</strong>“.</p>

<p>Remember: in many cases, if you get sick, you get better after that. And that is why placebos seem to work.</p>

<p>6/ It’s shocking to hear that randomized controlled trials (RCT) for many surgical interventions end up finding that they’re ineffective.</p>

<p>But what’s most shocking is that <strong>many other interventions have never been subjected to an RCT against a placebo</strong>. For many of the common procedures traditionally practiced, we don’t know whether they work at all or not.</p>

<p>7/ For sure, there are many studies that study variations of surgical methods. That is, they try to find out whether an incision from the left is better or from the right. </p>

<p>But very few studies try to find out whether the incision does anything at all for the patient. Shocking, but that’s the truth.</p>

<p>8/ In that sense, <strong>surgery is different than medicine</strong>. All new pharmaceutical molecules are subjected to rigorous clinical trials where they’re tested against placebo or doing nothing. In many countries, there’s no such procedure for surgical treatments. If there is a procedure for new surgical procedures, nobody is testing old ones that have been getting performed every day without evidence.</p>

<p>8/ If research indicates many of the currently practiced surgeries don’t work, why are they still practiced?</p>

<p>Well, <strong>if your salary depends on not believing something, you won’t believe it.</strong></p>

<p>9/ And such <strong>denial is not new</strong>. The most common surgical procedure in history was bloodletting. This practice which lasted for thousands of years was only questioned in mid 19th century, and even after randomized trials showed that it hurt the patient, it wasn’t abandoned suddenly. It died a slow death as its practitioners started dying. </p>

<p>10/ Even today, the fact that practices like Homeopathy survive suggests that <strong>seeking evidence of what works isn’t a big priority for society</strong>. Perhaps keeping traditions is a bigger priority.</p>

<p>11/ But because it’s costly and risky to perform surgeries, the urgent question is: <strong>what surgical procedures are today’s equivalent of bloodletting</strong>? And those that we know are bloodletting, how do we get rid of them as a society?</p>

<p>12/ As a patient, what should you do? Dr Ian Harris recommends that every time your doctor recommends a medical procedure, <strong>ALWAYS ask for risks and benefits</strong>. </p>

<p>Risks are a given and doctors generally are happy to talk about them. But nobody asks for benefits because they’re assumed to be there. </p>

<p>Ask and confirm about benefits explicitly.</p>

<p>13/ What if the pain isn’t going away at all? Should you then get surgery?</p>

<p>Golden advice by Dr Ian -&gt;  “<strong>the severity of your symptoms does not change the effectiveness of the operation</strong>“</p>

There was a fantastic turnout, with 1,000 women playing!&nbsp; For many of the participants, it was their first time playing a CTF.</p><p>After the event was over, there was some discussion on what to do if you wanted to play more CTFs, if you got stumped a lot, etc.&nbsp; This is intended to be <strong>a guide for beginners who have just started playing CTFs</strong> (or for people who have never played, but would like to).</p><p>It certainly isn’t the only CTF resource out there, but I find that a lot of the resources are either big information dumps (hard to pick through as a beginner) or links without context or guidance on how to improve.&nbsp; This post seeks to change that.&nbsp; : )</p><h2 id="what-is-a-ctf">What is a CTF?</h2><p>CTF stands for “<strong>capture the flag</strong>.”&nbsp; It’s a hacking competition where the challenges (or a hacking environment, or both) are set up for you to hack.&nbsp; Once you successfully solve a challenge or hack something, you get a “flag”, which is a specially formatted piece of text.&nbsp; You can then submit that flag for points… the player or team with the most points wins!</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPcqmx1mpCOJJp6/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>Each challenge is usually oriented around a single concept.&nbsp; By solving challenges, you (hopefully!) learn about a new concept, vulnerability, tool, class of attack, etc.</p><h3 id="ctf-styles">CTF Styles</h3><p>Most CTFs are “<strong>jeopardy style</strong>", meaning that there are a handful of categories, and each of the (typically standalone) challenges falls in to one of those categories.</p><p>The categories vary from CTF to CTF, but typically include:</p><ul><li><strong>RE (reverse engineering)</strong>:&nbsp; get a binary and reverse engineer it to find a flag</li><li><strong>Pwn</strong>:&nbsp; get a binary and a link to a program running on a remote server.&nbsp; Cause a buffer overflow, etc. to bypass normal functionality and get the program to read the flag to you.</li><li><strong>Crypto</strong>:&nbsp; crypto means cryptography!&nbsp; Get an encrypted flag and figure out how to decrypt it (includes both classical and modern ciphers)</li><li><strong>Web</strong>:&nbsp; web-based challenges where you are directed to a website, and you have to find and exploit a vulnerability (SQL injection, XSS, etc.) to get a flag.</li><li><strong>Forensics/Stego</strong>:&nbsp; given a PCAP file, image, audio or other file, find a hidden message and get the flag.</li><li><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; this is a bit of a grab bag.&nbsp; Includes random puzzles, electronics-based things, OSINT, anything that doesn’t fit into the other categories.</li></ul><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/1vZaAcldbX8Xh6lMlV/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>Jeopardy isn’t the only style.&nbsp; There are a few <strong>attack/defense CTFs</strong>, where you are given control of a server that you must protect from other players, while also attacking other servers.&nbsp; These are fairly rare (and pretty difficult to set up, I imagine).</p><p>There are also CTFs that emulate <strong>pen testing</strong>, where you are given a target VM (“box”) to hack into, and escalate your privileges until you are a root user.&nbsp; These are also fairly rare but a lot of fun.&nbsp; Check out <strong>Metasploitable</strong> in late November (<a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2018/11/05/announcing-the-2018-metasploit-community-ctf/">here is the announcement from 2018</a>), or <strong><a href="https://hackthebox.eu/">Hack The Box</a></strong> year-round.</p><h2 id="logistics-and-how-to-find-ctfs">Logistics and How to Find CTFs</h2><h3 id="wait-before-you-go-any-further">Wait!&nbsp; Before you go any further</h3><p>It’s definitely more fun to play with friends, or even internet strangers.&nbsp; Playing with other people means that you can get each other unstuck, and you can also support each other when you make progress, get a new tool working, or find a flag… or when you don’t.&nbsp; Especially when you’re new, CTFs can feel like repeatedly banging your head against the wall (there’s so much to learn in this field!).&nbsp; Having others to play alongside can definitely help lift that emotional burden when things aren’t going well, and give you people to celebrate with when you make a breakthrough.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/haBeggedmenEA/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>You might think, “who am I going to convince to play CTFs” with me?&nbsp; &nbsp;There are many online groups that are open to beginners.&nbsp; A short list includes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://opentoallctf.github.io/">OpenToAll</a></li><li><a href="https://www.womenhackerz.com/">Women Hackers</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1068173165610831872">CTF Circle</a></li></ul><p>You can try Slack/Discord for local security meet-up groups to see if there’s any interest in teaming up.&nbsp; Same goes for university groups, if you’re a student.&nbsp; Finally, you can also check Slack or Discord for a given CTF, as often there are other people looking for teammates.</p><p>Even if your first response to this idea is “oh hell no”, give it try, at least once.&nbsp; : )</p><h3 id="where-to-find-ctfs">Where to find CTFs</h3><p>There are <strong>in-person CTFs</strong> (especially if you live on the east or west coast in the US) throughout the year, plus many at <strong>conferences</strong>.</p><p>But there are also plenty of <strong>online CTFs</strong>, which is what I mostly play.&nbsp; They typically happen on weekends, and run for 1-3 days, although some go for a week or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;To find them, check out <a href="https://ctftime.org/"><strong>CTFTime</strong></a> and click on “Upcoming”.&nbsp; This is continually updated (and sometimes at the last minute).&nbsp; Also keep an eye out on Twitter.</p><p>A few CTFs and CTF platforms are <strong>available online, year round</strong>.&nbsp; See the bottom of this post (“Bonus Round!") for more.</p><h2 id="and-now-for-the-resource-list">And now for the resource list!</h2><p>There’s really no substitute for actually doing CTF challenges, even if you only make a little bit of progress.&nbsp; This resource list has a few goals:</p><ul><li>Equip you with enough tools and knowledge to get started on a CTF challenge in a given category</li><li>Point you towards additional resources if you want to build up your skills outside of time-limited CTF events, and alert you to any category-specific sites or platforms</li><li>Give you a basic list of things to try if you have no idea where to start with a challenge</li></ul><p>There’s a LOT to learn.&nbsp; If you’re new, I recommend that you <strong>find a few beginner CTFs that are “jeopardy” style, and try a few challenges from each category and see what you enjoy doing</strong>.&nbsp; If you like doing one category, that’s great!&nbsp; It’s also great if you like to do a bit of everything.&nbsp; My top recommendation for a “jeopardy”-style beginner CTF is <strong><a href="https://picoctf.com/">PicoCTF</a></strong>, but there are more options in the “Bonus Round!” section at the bottom of this post.</p><p>This guide is by no means comprehensive.&nbsp; I know there are a ton of sites and resources out there.&nbsp; I wanted to share my top picks for each category, with options for different learning styles.</p><h2 id="re">RE</h2><p>Reverse engineering (RE), involves taking a binary and, well, reverse engineering it to determine its functionality (and find a flag).</p><p>In industry, RE skills are used for vulnerability research.&nbsp; You might be given a software program and asked to find vulnerabilities (without having source code).&nbsp; Similarly, malware research involves a lot of reverse engineering.&nbsp; In my view, it’s a bit more niche than its inclusion in CTFs would lead you to believe, but still a challenging/fun category.</p><p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/4UzW8S83pWoKs/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><h3 id="resources-to-get-started">Resources to get started</h3><p>It can be pretty daunting to get started in reverse engineering, especially if you have little or no experience in low-level programming languages like assembly.&nbsp; As you get started, try to find something in the code to orient yourself… a call to a standard library function (read, scanf, printf, etc.), comments, strings, etc.&nbsp; Then keep expanding and iterating from there.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Learning by doing</strong>:&nbsp; My top recommendation is <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong>.&nbsp; It’s a game where you try to reverse engineer (fictitious) bluetooth locks of increasing difficulty.&nbsp; It’s all in-browser (which means no tool setup), and has a tutorial level that introduces you some of the assembly and environment.&nbsp; I have <a href="https://jaimelightfoot.com/blog/category/microcorruption/">write-ups for each level</a> if you get stuck.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning by reading</strong>:&nbsp; I’m going to double dip between this section and Pwn.&nbsp; I’d suggest <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441">Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</a></strong> and then <strong><a href="https://practicalbinaryanalysis.com/">Practical Binary Analysis</a></strong>.&nbsp; Hacking: The Art of Exploitation takes you from a very basic level through C, assembly, program memory, exploits, and much more.&nbsp; It’s incredibly thorough and definitely worth a read</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning by watching</strong>:&nbsp; Live Overflow has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN"><strong>series on binary exploitation</strong></a>.&nbsp; Check out the playlist of videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN">here</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="re-focused-ctfs">RE-focused CTFs:</h3><p>I’m going to suggest <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong> one more time.&nbsp; : )&nbsp; There’s also FireEye’s yearly <strong><a href="http://flare-on.com/">Flare-On</a></strong> challenge, which will probably kick your ass (it always kicks mine) but it’s worth a try.</p><p>You can also find plenty of RE challenges in jeopardy-style events, both year-round and regular/short-term CTFs.</p><h3 id="tools-and-other-resources">Tools and other resources</h3><p>You will definitely need special tools to do RE challenges.&nbsp; There are lots of tools to choose from, as well as different categories of tools (disassembler, decompiler, debugger, etc.).&nbsp; In addition to having varying functionality, different tools are needed for different file types.</p><p>If you are a total beginner, I’ll once again recommend <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong>.&nbsp; A lot of the tools listed below can be difficult to set up, and in the interest of removing barriers to entry, I’m suggesting Microcorruption as an introduction to RE, because you don’t have to install anything to get started.</p><p>Eventually though, you’ll want to install and get familiar with different tools:</p><ul><li>My favorite is <strong><a href="https://binary.ninja/">Binary Ninja</a></strong> and have done some previous write-ups using it.&nbsp; I like the UI/UX and the available features.&nbsp; The only downside is that you need a license (I got mine originally through a BSides RE workshop, otherwise it’s $149).</li><li>There are plenty of free options as well.&nbsp; My second choice is <strong><a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a></strong>, which is free and fairly beginner friendly.&nbsp; There’s also <strong><a href="https://www.radare.org/r/">Radare</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.ollydbg.de/">Ollydb</a></strong>, <strong>gdb</strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml">IDAPro</a></strong>, <strong>Objdump</strong> and many more.</li></ul><p>Similar to “try a bunch of categories and see what you prefer”, I recommend trying a bunch of tools and see what you prefer.&nbsp; I realize that installing a bunch of tools can be a gigantic pain in the ass, so here are a couple VM options that get you a bunch of pre-installed tools:</p><ul><li><strong>FireEye</strong> provides a VM image as part of their Flare-On competition (<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/07/flare-vm-the-windows-malware.html">see this link for more info</a>) that includes many pre-installed RE tools.</li><li>You can also install a <strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali</a> VM</strong>, which comes pre-installed with various tools as well.</li></ul><p>As for more resources, <strong>OpenToAll</strong> has a <a href="https://github.com/OpenToAllCTF/REsources">fantastic list of RE Resources here</a>.&nbsp; This includes some foundational knowledge like C, x86 assembly, and more.</p><p>There’s also this free <strong><a href="https://www.begin.re/">beginner RE workshop</a></strong> that uses IDA.</p><p><strong>If you have no idea where to start with an RE challenge</strong>:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li>does <code>strings &lt;filename&gt;</code> reveal find any interesting strings in the program?&nbsp;
Open the file in a debugger/disassembler/decompiler tool (as listed above) and try to get a sense of what the program does.&nbsp; Are there any ASCII-range characters?&nbsp;</li><li>What user …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Let’s say my goal this year is to get to 10k monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>

<p>MRR first, everything else second. I would ruthlessly cut out all activities that don’t lead to a measurable MRR increase. For example, I would stop writing blog posts like the one you’re currently reading. I certainly wouldn’t create fun projects like What to Tweet or take the time for non-transactional Zoom calls.</p>

<p>I would focus on my revenue generating projects, crank up the advertising machinery and do everything I can think of that potentially increases my MRR.
I’m fairly confident that I would reach 10k MRR by the end of the year. But at what price?</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back for a second.</p>

<p>You know who manages by metrics? Big companies like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>And what do they have in common?</p>

<p>Their core product got notably worse over time.</p>

<p>Google’s search results are dominated by ads and many users now use workarounds to find what they’re looking for (“Best headphone reddit”). LinkedIn looks like Minesweeper. Facebook was a fun place to meet friends. And if you search for an electronics product on Amazon, you immediately feel like you’re at a flea market in the middle of Shenzhen.
This is the result of hundreds of decisions that were motivated by a short-term focus on specific metrics like revenue and click rates. And while these decisions most likely optimized the metrics, they made the user experience worse.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t have the technology to measure the right thing. Or maybe the “right thing” is inherently immeasurable.</p>

<p>Or, and that’s my personal favorite, we’re dealing with a Schrödinger’s cat like situation. The “right thing” is only the right thing as long as we’re not trying to optimize it.
This is known as Goodhart’s law. “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.“</p>

<p>Let’s consider another example.</p>

<p>Who else manages by metrics? Politicians!</p>

<p>Instead of some boring historic example (there are plenty, just read “Seeing like a State”), I’m going to spice things up by talking about something that’s happening right now.
It’s not hard to anticipate what I want to talk about since there’s precisely one thing that’s currently happening: Covid-19.</p>

<p>Politicians try to manage the situation by focusing on metrics like the “R number”. At least here in Germany the motto is: let’s lower the R number at all costs.
Turns out the cost of this strategy is incredibly high. It’s just not immediately measurable.</p>

<p>For example, everyone’s getting fatter since all gyms and sport clubs are closed. Most people are developing unhealthy eating habits because there’s simply nothing else to do. Social connections are rapidly degregating even though everyone knows how important they’re for the human wellbeing.</p>

<p>I’m not a doctor and don’t play one on the internet, but I can easily imagine that there are lots of further unintended consequences of the current lockdown policy. For example, since most people now spend most of their time indoors alone and wear masks when they leave their homes, their immune system isn’t stressed regularly like it usual is. Hence I wouldn’t be surprised if many people will get sick of other diseases once the lockdown ends as a result of weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I’m all for taking Covid seriously. In fact, I’ve been hoarding masks since 2009. I spent the summer of 2009 with a bunch of friends in Lloret de Mar (a party hotspot in Spain) just when news of the swine flu started to emerge. Long story short, everyone in our group got sick (20+ people) except for my girlfriend and me because we’ve been wearing masks.
Now the most famous example how focusing on metrics can have unhealthy consequences is the cobra effect. I’ll just quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The term cobra effect originated in an anecdote that describes an occurrence during India under British rule. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi. The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one more example I always have to talk about when the topic comes up: academia.</p>

<p>Stagnation apologists love to argue that the lack of progress in science is simply a result of the fact that all low-hanging fruit are gone.</p>

<p>That’s complete nonsense. There’s still plenty of low-hanging fruit. It’s just that everyone is so busy chasing meaningless metrics that they can’t see them.</p>

<p>In academia the metric of choice usually has something to do with the number of citations. But just like Google’s backlink-driven algorithm (which was in fact inspired by academia’s citation metrics) was quickly gamed by savvy webmasters, academia’s algorithm is gamed by careerists.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about some tiny minority here. If you want to survive in academia, you have to play the citation game. And if everyone is cheating, at the very least you have to do the same to stand a chance.</p>

<p>You have to partner up with others because five people can write five times as many papers. You agree to constantly cite each other. Likewise, you focus on incremental additions to established ideas because that’s the safest way to new publications regularly. You work on the stuff everyone else is working on because how else are you going to get citations?</p>

<p>And one thing you absolutely have to avoid like the plague is the risky and deep kind of research that leads to real progress in the field.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that citations are a bad metric, and we need to come up with smarter ones. Instead, it’s just Goodhart’s law in action.
Every attempt to manage academia makes it worse.</p>

<p>As soon a new metric is introduced it will misdirect the attention of scientists towards playing the game, instead of progressing science.</p>

<p>I talked about three areas, but the same pattern occurs almost everywhere. For example, just remember when everyone started minimizing fat in their diet or how grades are used to measure “learning”.</p>

<p>Crucially the problem is not the specific metric that’s being used. Whatever new metric gets introduced will soon again be made useless by Goodhart’s law. The metrics game will always be akin to Whac-A-Mole.</p>

<p>Now where does this leave us? If management by metrics doesn’t work, what else should we do?</p>

<p>First of all, I think that looking at metrics can be helpful. They just shouldn’t be the sole yardstick decisions are measured against.</p>

<p>And while the map never will be the territory, the picture you’re looking at gets more accurate the more metrics you consider. For example, if politicians would not just consider the R number but hundreds of metrics that take different aspects of a population’s wellbeing into account, the decisions would be better ones.</p>

<p>The obvious problem is that decisions become much harder if you consider more than one metric.</p>

<p>But more importantly there are so many factors we can’t measure that nevertheless should be taken into account.</p>

<p>The more I think about it the more I become convinced that it all boils down to talking to people.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about surveys that distill thousands of standardized “conversations” into a few numbers or analytics tools that do similar things for behavior. I’m talking about real one-on-one interactions.</p>

<p>Just imagine if Jeff Bezos would talk to hundreds of real (non pre-vetted) Amazon customers each month and take what he hears in these conversations seriously. Or if politicians would have long conversations with regular people from all wakes of life. Or if academic committees would actually talk to applicants before filtering them out based on citation metrics.</p>

<p>In our hyper rational world it’s extremely hard to justify decisions based on the mere gut feeling you got from a few conversations. But this is exactly what people should be doing.</p>

<p>Engagement metrics will never tell you if users are genuinely happy when they use your product. But a few genuine conversations will.</p>

<p>A resume will never tell you if a person is genuinely interested in uncovering unknown truths about nature. But a 30-minute conversation will.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s so much easier to reach a consensus if you just hire the candidate with the highest citation metrics or implement the feature that will lead to the largest revenue increase in the next quarter. But while it’s the easiest decision it’s usually not the best one.</p>

<p>And I think the same applies not just to managing organizations but also to managing ourselves.</p>

<p>Just by listening to my own body I’ll always know better than any fitness tracker if I slept well, better than any blood test if my diet is healthy, and better than my bank account if I’m happy.
That doesn’t mean that I’ll not use a fitness tracker, make regular blood tests, or check my bank account. But I certainly won’t allow them to dictate my decisions.</p>

<p>I’ll look at all the facts and take everything in, even the stuff that can’t be measured, and then I’ll just go with my gut.</p>

        <p>Throughout my engineering career, I've come across dozens if not hundreds of equipment suppliers. But there are a few suppliers that leave a long lasting impression. Thorlabs is one of them. Why?</p><p>It is quite silly actually. Everytime I order a linear actuator, motorized stage or axis controller... something that's just normal industrial hardware, it ships unremarkably with billable weight in hundreds of dollars, docks and sits at the shipping &amp; receiving until I haul it into the lab. Cut open the box, and you see this:</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://jlfenimore.wixsite.com/jenniferfenimore/lab-snacks</figcaption></figure><p>This little red box brings so much joy it is hard to describe. Thorlabs shipping boxes contain one or more of these red boxes, it's got - cookies, candies, granola bars, chips, etc. with seemingly a singular heartwarming goal - to put a smile on my face. They didn't have to do it but they did. And they've been doing this for many years. Infact, they've trademarked "Lab Snacks" which is such a cool name on its own! Food and Drink are not allowed in our lab, except when it comes to the Thorlabs Snacks.</p><p>Thorlabs founder, Alex Cable, wrote an <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">article</a> about his vision of what customer centricity is, there is so much to learn from it, Wikipedia quotes:</p><blockquote>An important part of Thorlabs' brand and culture is Lab Snacks. Lab Snacks were created to support the famished grad student researching all night, serving as an occasional meal for someone hard at work.</blockquote><p>I implore you to read the original <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">article</a> because it exemplifies what a CEO and Founder should do to build an honest, customer centric business and how to genuinely connect with them. Everything at Thorlabs, from their phone support to documentation, is focusing on how best to make you, the customer, successful. Therein lies their success and they double-down on it.</p><p>Thorlabs has left such a long-lasting impact on me that I am writing this post after last enjoying Lab Snacks 2 years ago.</p>

		<div>

			
<p>Let me state up front that, while we’re going to be talking about an open source project that was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833206">recently submitted</a> to Hacker News’s “Show HN” section, the intent of this post is not at all to shame the developer who tried their damnedest to do the right thing. They’re the victim, not the culprit.</p>



<h2>RSA, Ya Don’t Say</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, an HN user shared <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet">their open source fork of a Facebook’s messenger client</a>, with added encryption. Their motivation was, as stated in the readme:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>It is known that <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-reads-messenger-messages/">Facebook scans your messages</a>. If you need to keep using Facebook messenger but care about privacy, Zuccnet might help.</p><p>It’s pretty simple: you and your friend have Zuccnet installed. Your friend gives you their Zuccnet public key. Then, when you send a message to your friend on Zuccnet, your message is encrypted on your machine before it is sent across Facebook to your friend. Then, your friend’s Zuccnet decrypts the message. Facebook never sees the content of your message.</p><p>I’m not a security person and there’s probably some stuff I’ve missed – any contributions are very welcome! This is <em>very</em> <strong>beta</strong>, don’t take it too seriously.</p></div><cite>From Zuccnet’s very humble README.</cite></blockquote>



<p>So far, so good. Facebook is abysmal for privacy, so trying to take matters into your own hands to encrypt data so Facebook can’t see what you’re talking about is, in spirit, a wonderful idea.</p>







<p>However, there is a problem with the <em>execution</em> of this idea. And this isn’t a problem unique to Zuccnet. Several times per year, I come across some well-meaning software project that makes the same mistake: Encrypting messages with RSA directly is bad.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet/blob/42e351e36b3b5dbaef06256ed11313fab77adb25/src/util/crypto.js#L57-L84">Zuccnet source code</a>:</p>


<pre title="">const encryptMessage = (message, recipientPublicKey) =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessage = crypto.publicEncrypt(
    {
      key: recipientPublicKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(message),
  );

  return encryptedMessage.toString("base64");
};

/**
 *
 * @param {String} encryptedMessage - base64 encoded string
 */
const decryptMessage = encryptedMessage =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessageBuffer = Buffer.from(encryptedMessage, "base64");
  const { privateKey } = getOrCreateZuccnetKeyPair();
  const message = crypto.privateDecrypt(
    {
      key: privateKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(encryptedMessageBuffer),
  );
};
</pre>


<p>To the Zuccnet author’s credit, they’re using OAEP padding, not PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This means their code isn’t vulnerable to Bleichenbacher’s 1998 padding oracle attack (n.b. most of the RSA code I encounter in the wild is vulnerable to this attack).</p>



<p>However, there are other problems with this code:</p>



<ol><li>If you try to encrypt a message longer than 256 bytes with a 2048-bit RSA public key, it will fail. (Bytes matter here, not characters, even for English speakers–because emoji.)</li><li>This design (encrypting with a static RSA public key per recipient) completely lacks forward secrecy. This is the same reason that <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP encryption sucks</a> (or, at least, one of the reasons PGP sucks).</li></ol>



<p>There are many ways to work around the first limitation.</p>



<p>Some cryptography libraries let you treat RSA as a block cipher in <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/">ECB mode</a> and encrypt each chunk independently. This is an incredibly stupid API deign choice: It’s slow (asymmetric cryptography operations are on the order of tens-to-hundreds-of-thousands times slower than symmetric cryptography) and you can drop/reorder/replay blocks, since ECB mode provides <em>no semantic security</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>much</strong> better strategy is to encrypt the data with a symmetric key, then encrypt <em>that key</em> with RSA. (See the <a href="#rsa-pkcs1">end of the post</a> for special treatment options that are especially helpful for RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.)</p>



<p>Working around the second problem usually requires an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE), similar to what I covered in my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/11/14/going-bark-a-furrys-guide-to-end-to-end-encryption/">Guide to End-to-End Encryption</a>. Working around this second problem <em>also</em> solves the first problem, so it’s usually better to just implement a forward-secret key exchange protocol than try to make RSA secure. </p>



<p>(You can get forward secrecy without an AKE, by regularly rotating keys, but AKEs make forward secrecy automatic and on-by-default without forcing humans to make a decision to rotate a credential– something most people don’t do unless they have to. AKEs trade user experience complexity for protocol complexity–and this trade-off is almost universally worth taking.)</p>



<p>Although AKEs are extremely useful, they’re a bit complex for most software developers to pick up without prior cryptography experience. (If they were easier, after all, there wouldn’t be so much software that encrypts messages directly with RSA in the first place.)</p>



<p>Note: RSA itself isn’t the reason that this lacks forward secrecy. The problem is how RSA is used.</p>



<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>



<h3>For Developers</h3>



<p>First, consider <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">not using RSA</a>. Hell, while you’re at it, <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">don’t write <em>any</em> cryptography code that you don’t have to</a>. </p>



<p>Libsodium (<a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages">which you should use</a>) does most of this for you, and can easily be turned into <a href="https://github.com/soatok/rawr-x3dh">an AKE comparable to the one Signal uses</a>. The less cryptography code you have to write, the less can go catastrophically wrong–especially in production systems.</p>



<p>If jettisoning RSA from your designs is a non-starter, you should at least consider taking the Dhole Moments Pledge for Software Developers:</p>



<blockquote><p>I will not encrypt messages directly with RSA, or any other asymmetric primitive.</p><cite>Simple enough, right?</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead, if you find yourself needing to encrypt a message with RSA, remind yourself that RSA is <em>for encrypting symmetric keys, not messages</em>. And then plan your protocol design accordingly.</p>



<p>Also, I’m pretty sure RSA isn’t random-key robust. Ask your favorite cryptographer if it matters for whatever you’re building.</p>



<p>(But seriously, you’re better off not using RSA at all.)</p>



<h3>For Cryptography Libraries</h3>



<p>Let’s ask ourselves, “Why are we forcing developers to know or even care about these details?”</p>



<p>Libsodium doesn’t encumber developers with unnecessary decisions like this. Why does the crypto module built into JavaScript? Why does the crypto module built into <em>most</em> programming languages that offer one, for that matter? (Go is a notable exception here, because their security team is awesome and forward-thinking.)</p>



<p>In my opinion, we should stop shipping cryptography interfaces that…</p>



<ul><li>Mix symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in the same API</li><li>Allow developers to encrypt directly with asymmetric primitives</li><li>Force developers to manage their own nonces/initialization vectors</li><li>Allow public/private keys to easily get confused (e.g. lack of type safety)</li></ul>



<p>For example: <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">Dhole Crypto</a> is close to my ideal for general-purpose encryption.</p>



<h3 id="rsa-pkcs1">Addendum: Securing RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5</h3>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> Neil Madden informs me that what I wrote here is actually very similar to a standard construction called <a href="https://kel.bz/post/kem/">RSA-KEM</a>. You should use RSA-KEM instead of what I’ve sketched out, since that’s better studied by cryptographers.</p>



<p>(I’ve removed the original sketch below, to prevent accidental misuse.)</p>

<p>I’m trying to convince friends and family to switch to Signal. Opened the Signal App after several months today and I was welcomed with 100+ unread “X just joined Signal” messages. And it irritated me right away! Not for some privacy concern but because looking at 100+ automated, unread messages is simply unpleasant. So many email apps base their whole business plan around the ‘zero inbox’ idea. Instead here I was on Signal, greeted with unnecessary messages. You don’t expect me to click each one to mark as read! Or go look for solutions to bulk-delete or mark-all-read right after I signup. The two friends that I had chatted with long back were embedded deep into the sea of these messages.</p>
<p>I go back and forth between whether first impressions are as important — but dare I say, for Web and Mobile Apps they are.</p>
<p><strong>Signal ought to act confidently about its presence in the messaging Apps domain now and not act as a newbie in the market.</strong></p>
<p>P.S.: There’s an option under settings to Switch Off the “Contact Joined Signal” notifications. This should be default off or completely removed from the App.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is a pure 6510 assembly program for the Commodore 64 made by Bright Pixel in 2019, because why not.</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/demo.gif?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">C64</a> was a famous 8-bit machine in the 80s and the highest-selling single computer model ever.</p>

<p>Its hardware and architecture set it appart from other 8-bit personal computers at the time. Unlike most of the others, the C64 had dedicated advanced MOS chips for graphics and sprites (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VIC-II">VIC-II</a>), sound (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6581">SID</a>), I/O (the CIA), and many others.</p>

<p>These chips were not only powerful for the time, but they could perform their tasks autonomously, independently of what the main CPU, a MOS technology 6510 microprocessor, was doing. For instance, the VIC-II could generate interrupts on automatic sprite collisions. The CPU and the other chips also shared common data and memory BUSes.</p>

<p>To cope with all these chips inside 64Kbytes of addressable memory, the C64 had something called memory overlay, in which different chips would access different physical data locations for the same memory address. For instance the $D000-$DFFF block could be used for RAM, I/O or access to Character ROM, by the CPU, depending on a $0001 setting. Chips would have to be turned on or off, or instructed to look for data at specific RAM/ROM locations all the time to make the most of the machine as a whole.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/0430_-_C64_Mainboard_ASSY250407_RevB.jpg" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>This was impressive in the 80s, for a relatevily cheap mass-market personal computer.</p>

<p>Programming the C64 was more than a lot of fun, it was a form of art. Because of the way all this hardware was packed together, handling the machine meant knowing its memory map and registers by heart, and dominating quite a collection of tricks, some of which weren’t documented at all. What ended up being written for the C64 by the fervent community of developers all over the world went way beyond the imagination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a>.</p>

<p>Today, in 2019, the cult is still alive. There are vast groups of developers still writing C64 games and demos, restoring and using old machines, or using emulators. The SID sound chip was so revolutionary that it still drives a community of chiptune artists <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/8-bit-symphony/8-bit-symphony-pro-double-orchestral-cd-of-8-bit-classics">all over</a> the world. The <a href="https://www.hvsc.c64.org/">High Voltage SID Collection</a> has more than 50,000 songs archived and growing.</p>

<p>At Bright Pixel, we like to go low-level, and we think that understanding how things work down there, even if we’re talking about a 40 years old machine, is enriching, helps us become better computer engineers and better problem solvers. This is especially important in a time when we’re flooded with hundreds of high-level frameworks that just “do the job.” Until they don’t.</p>

<p>This is a simple demo for the C64:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was coded entirely in 6510 assembly.</li>
  <li>It makes use of the VIC-II graphics, character ROM and sprites.</li>
  <li>It plays music using the SID chip.</li>
  <li>Uses raster-based interrupts, perfectly timed.</li>
  <li>Implements a random number generator.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download the source code for it in <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64">this repository</a>, change it and run it a real machine or an emulator. The code is all annotated, and you can use the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/issues">issue tracker</a> to ask us questions or make suggestions, we’ll be listening.</p>

<p>We used the <a href="http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/">Kick Assembler</a> to build the PRG from the source. KA is still maintained up until today, with regular releases launched every couple of months. It supports <a href="http://www.unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/brti.htm">MOS 65xx assembler</a>, macros, pseudo commands and has a couple of helpers to load SID and graphics files into memory. Unfortunately, you need Java to run it, but it’s worth the trouble.</p>

<p>Here’s the setup in OSX.</p>

<p>Install Java</p>

<div><div><pre><code>brew update
brew install homebrew/cask/java
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Install Kick Assembler</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/KickAssembler.zip -o /tmp/KickAssembler.zip
sudo unzip /tmp/KickAssembler.zip -d /usr/local/KickAssembler
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should be the contents of /usr/local/KickAssembler/KickAss.cfg</p>



<p>And we have this alias in our ~/.bash_profile for convenience.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>alias kick="java -jar /usr/local/KickAssembler/KickAss.jar"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="c64-emulator">C64 emulator</h3>

<p>There are plenty of Commodore 64 emulators out there.</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/emulator.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/">VICE</a>, the Versatile Commodore Emulator, is a program that runs on a Unix, Win32, or Mac OS X machines and emulates the C64 (and every other 65xx Commodore machine too).</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dirkwhoffmann.de/virtualc64/">VirtualC64</a> is an interesting alternative for OSX written from scratch using C++ and native Cocoa and provides a real-time graphical inspector of the CPU, Memory, and the other Chips, while it’s running.</li>
</ul>

<p>We used VICE. One more bash alias:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>alias c64="/Applications/x64.app/Contents/MacOS/x64"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>

<p>Debugging assembly when things go south can be challenging. Back in the 80s, debugging meant spending hours doing trial and error, rebooting the machine, reloading the code from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette">cassette</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541">disk drive</a>, if you were lucky), and writing code to paper just in case you’d lose it in the process.</p>

<p>Luckily, now we have way better tools.</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/debugger.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c64-debugger/">C64 65XE Debugger</a> is a C64 and Atari XL/XE code and memory debugger that works in real-time and embeds the VICE emulator in the same graphical interface. It allows you to see what’s happening with every chip, register, memory block; you can set breakpoints, run the program instruction by instruction, and see what’s happening right in the embedded emulator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The VICE emulator <a href="http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_12.html#SEC271">built-in monitor</a> can also be used to examine, disassemble, and assemble machine language programs, as well as debug them through breakpoints. It has loads of powerful features.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where were these tools in 1986?</p>

<h3 id="graphics">Graphics</h3>

<p>Dealing with graphics is a lot easier now too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/micheldebree/retropixels">Retropixels</a> is a cross-platform command-line tool to convert any image to Commodore 64 graphical modes and file formats, including Koala (.kla or .koa), which is supported by the Kick Assembler load helpers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Esshahn/spritemate">Spritemate</a> is an online browser-based Commodore 64 sprite editor and supports importing and exporting of the most common file formats, as well as direct Kick Assembler hexadecimal arrays.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sid-songs">SID songs</h3>

<p>SID is short for the MOS 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device, the programmable sound generator chip inside the C64.</p>

<p>A SID file (song.sid) is a special file format, later popularized by modern age SID Players and emulators, which contains both the data and the 6510 code necessary to play a music song on the SID chip.</p>

<p>Here are a few things you should know about SID and SID files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A SID file contains both the data and the code to play the music. The code must reside in a specific RAM address, specified inside the SID file, and changes from music to music, which means that if you want to use another .sid file with this demo, you need to make sure that:
    <ul>
      <li>It starts in the same memory address.</li>
      <li>You change the code accordingly if it doesn’t (advanced).</li>
      <li>It doesn’t overlap with the rest of the memory we need to run our program (Kick Assembler will warn you if it does). RAM is scarce and musics can be big.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can check the SID file <a href="https://www.hvsc.de/download/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt">specification here</a>.</li>
  <li>You should absolutely take a look at the <a href="https://www.hvsc.de/">High Voltage SID Collection</a> and this <a href="https://tamats.com/apps/sid/">SID player &amp; visualizer</a> (<a href="https://github.com/jagenjo/sidviz">github</a>) in javascript</li>
</ul>

<p>Kick Assembler has a helper script to load and parse a SID file directly into your project. <a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s03.html">loadSid()</a> places the song code and data in the proper RAM location while assembling, and provides the initialization and play subroutines which you can use with your code. Check <a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s03.html">here</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="other-resources">Other resources</h3>

<p>These are handy resources you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://sta.c64.org/cbm64mem.html">Commodore 64 memory map</a> explaining the functioning of all addresses, registers and memory blocks.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/">C64 Wiki</a> is the online bible of all things Commodore 64, including detailed information of how the hardware works.</li>
  <li>Not the bible, but <a href="https://codebase64.org/">Codebase64</a> is pretty good too.</li>
  <li>A Kick Assembler <a href="https://github.com/gryf/kickass-syntax-vim">syntax file</a> for Vim.</li>
  <li>Understanding the <a href="http://www.coding64.org/?p=164">character and bitmap</a> graphics modes, memory banks, and how the chips interact with each other.</li>
  <li>6510 CPU <a href="http://www.unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/bmain.htm">instructions</a>.</li>
  <li>Great article explaining the VIC-II <a href="https://dustlayer.com/vic-ii/2013/4/26/vic-ii-for-beginners-screen-modes-cheaper-by-the-dozen">screen modes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>

<p>We’ve annotated the .asm sources with all the information you need to understand what we’re doing, why, and where to find more. You can start by looking at the main <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">card.asm</a> file and move from there.</p>

<p>To assemble the sources into an executable PRG file, all you need to do is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>java -jar /usr/local/KickAssembler/KickAss.jar card.asm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the output should be something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/assembly.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>Here’s a quick run through the main components of this little demo. Find the rest of the information in the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">source</a> itself.</p>

<p><strong>Loading external files with Kick Assembler</strong></p>

<p>Kick Assembler has a couple of helpers to load known file formats into memory at assembly time. We’re using two of these, <a href="http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s02.html">LoadBinary()</a> and <a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s03.html">LoadSid()</a>.</p>

<p>LoadBinary is loading the Koala screen bitmaps we previously converted with <a href="https://github.com/micheldebree/retropixels">retropixels</a>, while LoadSid is loading the data and code to play the music.sid file. You can check the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">code</a> to see how we handle the music playing and the screen bitmaps in memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>.var music = LoadSid("music.sid")
.var picture1 = LoadBinary("screen1.koa", BF_KOALA)
.var picture2 = LoadBinary("screen2.koa", BF_KOALA)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Setting and using the interrupts</strong></p>

<p>We’re using <a href="http://www.unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/brti.htm">raster interrupts</a> with our demo. These interrupts trigger at specific scan lines that we set with $D012.</p>

<p>First, we need to turn on the interrupts and set the first one when the program starts. This is how:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// disable the interrupts
sei
// first interrupt will be irq1 at scan line 240
setupirq(240, irq1);
// interrupt control - enable all interrupts with $7b
lda #%01111011
sta $dc0d
// interrupt control register - enable raster interrupt with $81
lda #%10000001
sta $d01a
// enable interrupts now
cli
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Later we use the irq1 and irq2 interrupts.</p>

<p>irq1 is triggered at scanline 240, and we use it to change the VIC-II to text mode, scroll the bottom text message and play the music.</p>

<p>irq2 is triggered at scanline 10, and we use it to alternate between the two pictures by switching the VIC-II to bitmap mode and pointing it to the right memory banks.</p>

<p>Here’s irq1 from the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">code</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>irq1:
    ack();
    // keep scrolling the bottom line
    jsr scroll_message
    // keep the music playing
    jsr music.play
    // jump to irq2 at line 10
    …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust has taken the programming language world by storm. Since its 1.0 release in 2015, it has been one of the most loved programming languages with a loyal following of developers and contributors.</p><p>To learn why this language is favored so much between developers, we have started a new series on Rust in production. In it, we’ll interview people that have used Rust for significant projects: apps, services, startup MVPs, and others.</p><p>For the first installment of the series, we interview Michael Fey, VP of Engineering at <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. Read further to find out why they chose Rust for their product, the benefits of Rust for security-centered applications, and what cool libraries you should look into if you’re developing something similar in Rust.</p><h3 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</h3><p>1Password is a password manager trusted by millions of people and 70,000 businesses to secure their sensitive data. It remembers all your passwords so you don’t have to, and comes with apps for all major browsers, plus desktop and mobile.</p><p>I am the VP of Engineering for Client Apps here at 1Password. If you have ever had the pleasure to use 1Password on your Mac, Windows PC, iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or tablet, or in your browser, then you’ve been lucky enough to use something my team has built. We’ve been around since 2004, and we take a lot of pride in building a well-crafted experience and keeping people safe online.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/xa/xarnasmy.111_(5).jpg" alt="Michael Fey" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="can-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-1password%3F-how-big-a-part-of-your-codebase-is-written-in-rust%3F">Can you talk about the stack of 1Password? How big a part of your codebase is written in Rust?</h3><p>We’ve been using Rust in production at 1Password for a few years now. Our Windows team was the frontrunner on this effort to the point where about 70% of 1Password 7 for Windows is written in Rust. We also ported the 1Password Brain – the engine that powers our browser filling logic – from Go to Rust at the end of 2019 so that we could take advantage of the speed and performance of deploying Rust to WebAssembly in our browser extension.</p><p>These have been in production for the last few years and we’ve seen great success. So much so that we’re now in the midst of a complete rewrite of nearly our entire product lineup, and Rust is a major part of that story. We are using Rust to create a headless 1Password app that encompasses all of the business logic, cryptography, database access, server communication, and more wrapped in a thin UI layer that is native to the system on which we’re deploying.</p><h3 id="did-any-of-rust%E2%80%99s-advantages-like-speed-or-type%2Fmemory-safety-influence-the-choice-of-using-rust-for-1password%3F">Did any of Rust’s advantages like speed or type/memory-safety influence the choice of using Rust for 1Password?</h3><p>One of the main things that drew us to Rust initially was the memory safety; it definitely excites us knowing that Rust helps us maximize our confidence in the safety of our customers’ secrets. Beyond memory safety, though, there’s so much more we love about the Rust ecosystem. There is a significant performance benefit to the lack of a traditional runtime; we don’t have to worry about the overhead of a garbage collector, for instance. Rust offers a form of “program correctness” and many guarantees against undefined behaviour at runtime. The strong type system enforces these rules at compile-time. Carefully aligning application logic with Rust’s strong type rules makes APIs difficult to use incorrectly and results in simpler code that’s free from runtime checking of constraints and invariants; the compiler can guarantee there are no invalid runtime code paths that will lead your program astray before it executes. Having to perform less runtime state validation leads to cleaner, more efficient, more focused, and higher quality code. Rust requires very little runtime debugging compared to other languages. If it compiles, you can be fairly sure it won’t exhibit unexpected behaviour. It may not be what you <em>want</em> but it will be “correct”. 🙂</p><p>Another very powerful (and often overlooked) feature of Rust is its procedural macro system, which has allowed us to write a tool that automatically shares types defined in Rust with our client-side languages (Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript). The output from this tool handles the serialization/deserialization process automatically, meaning our client-side devs can continue to work in their language of choice while interacting with the Rust library and can be free from the concerns of JSON parsing over the foreign function interface (FFI). We get all of this while enjoying the benefits of compile-time type checking in every one of our target languages. We’ve integrated this tool into our continuous integration server as well, meaning that changes to the Rust models can result in compilation failures in the client applications that are caught during our review process.</p><p>This tool has been an integral component in our development process, allowing us to move much more quickly than ever before. Once our types are defined in Rust, we are able to immediately generate equivalent types in our client-side languages. This allows our devs to focus on solving problems without having to hand-roll boilerplate code to communicate over the FFI.</p><h3 id="how-good-is-rust%E2%80%99s-support-(library-and-otherwise)-for-developing-security-centric-applications-like-1password%3F">How good is Rust’s support (library and otherwise) for developing security-centric applications like 1Password?</h3><p>There is more than enough to build a majority of the base that security-centered applications require. There are two large, prominent cryptography platforms (<em><a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring">ring</a></em> and the <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">Rust Crypto</a> group) that together provide a wealth of functionality. As I mentioned above, writing with Rust itself gives you much greater confidence in your memory usage and makes it much harder to accidentally introduce a memory-related exploit into your application. There is also a wonderful system in place for keeping track of vulnerabilities that do show up from time to time in Rust crates: the <a href="https://rustsec.org/">RustSec</a> database, which is community-sourced by other Rust developers and is updated frequently with new information that can be consumed in CI audit scans. The batteries-included test framework that Rust and Cargo also include mean that you always have an easy way to write unit-test suites for correct behavior in critical code, like any cryptographic functions that you write.</p><p>While safe native Rust libraries for everything are the dream (and they will come in time), there is always the option to dip down and easily consume something in C or from native platform libraries. We use this to great effect in our Rust code for things like calling out to the native implementations of biometric unlock (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) and platform-specific settings implementations like NSUserDefaults on Apple platforms.</p><h3 id="any-particular-rust-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Any particular Rust libraries that you want to feature?</h3><p>Absolutely. Tokio, Hyper/Reqwest, Ring, and Neon all have a home in 1Password and are fundamental in allowing us to tackle this ambitious project at all. You should also check out our <a href="https://crates.io/crates/password-rules-parser">password-rules-parser</a> on <a href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, which is based on a spec primarily being backed by Apple. Their tools and docs can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/">here</a>.</p><h3 id="where-is-rust-great-to-use%2C-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Rust great to use, and where does it fall short in your stack?</h3><p>Rust has fulfilled 90% of what we were hoping for when we started this project. We’ve been able to deploy it to nearly every one of our target platforms in some way shape or form (with the exception of Apple Watch). The language itself has been designed with modern sensibilities and is improving with every release. It has great documentation and an active community.</p><p>Although there are countless crates available for use, we did have to roll our own logging and tracing tools to ensure that they were safe to use in 1Password. Additionally, we constructed a substantial localization implementation to meet the requirements of our products.</p><p>It did fall short for us in one key area: We were hoping WebAssembly would take us further in the browser and our browser extension than it has. WebAssembly has been great as a function library, but attempting to stand up an entire runtime in WASM has been a challenge. Many of the issues we ran into, however, were not limitations of Rust but of WebAssembly as a deployment platform.</p><h3 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-while-developing-1password-with-rust%3F">What was the biggest challenge while developing 1Password with Rust?</h3><p>Many of the folks on our team were new to Rust, and they experienced the typical learning curve that comes with its memory management and ownership model. We are also finding the compile times to be pretty beefy; our CPUs and fans are definitely getting a workout. 😄</p><h3 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h3><p>Absolutely.</p><p>If you’re new to Rust, start small and build on top of that. We ran a large number of experiments when we were getting started to try and find the edges of what a Rust-based solution could provide. When your experiments pan out, try to reimagine the ways you used to work with other languages and see if your code can benefit from Rust’s philosophy.</p><p>If you’re new to 1Password, you can <a href="https://start.1password.com/sign-up/plan?c=1PCORE2021">sign up today with this link</a> and save 50% off your first year for family and individual accounts.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<blockquote>
<p>We have made Arm servers&nbsp;boring.</p>
<p>Jon&nbsp;Masters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Standards are boring. Satisfied users may not want to migrate to other boards
the market tries to sell&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>So Arm market is flooded with piles of small board computers (<span>SBC</span>). Often they
are compliant to standards only when it comes to&nbsp;connectors.</p>
<h3>But our hardware is not&nbsp;standard</h3>
<p>It is not a matter of ‘let produce <span>UEFI</span> ready hardware’ but rather ‘let write
<span>EDK2</span> firmware for boards we already&nbsp;have’.</p>
<p>Look at Raspberry/Pi then. It is shitty hardware but got popular. And group of
people wrote <span>UEFI</span> firmware for it. Probably without vendor support&nbsp;even.</p>
<h3>Start with <span>EBBR</span></h3>
<p>Each new board should be <span>EBBR</span> compliant at start. Which is easy — do ‘whatever
hardware’ and put properly configured U-Boot on it. Upstreaming support for your
small device should not be hard as you often base on some already existing&nbsp;hardware.</p>
<p>Add <span>16MB</span> of <span>SPI</span> flash to store firmware. Your users will be able to boot <span>ISO</span>
without wondering where on boot media they need to write&nbsp;bootloaders.</p>
<p>Then work on <span>EDK2</span> for board. Do <span>SMBIOS</span> (easy) and keep your existing Device
Tree.  You are still <span>EBBR</span>. Remember about upstreaming your work — some people
will complain, some will improve your&nbsp;code.</p>
<h3>Add <span>ACPI</span>, go <span>SBBR</span></h3>
<p>Next step is moving from Device Tree to <span>ACPI</span>. May take some time to understand
why there are so many tables and what <span>ASL</span> is. But as several other systems show
it can be&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>And this brings you to <span>SBBR</span> compliance. Or SystemReady <span>ES</span> if you like&nbsp;marketing.</p>
<h3><span>SBSA</span> for future&nbsp;design</h3>
<p>Doing new SoC tends to be “let us take previous one and improve a bit”. So this
time change it a bit and make your next SoC compliant with <span>SBSA</span> level 3. All
needed components are probably already included in your Arm&nbsp;license.</p>
<p>Grab <span>EDK2</span> support you did for previous board. Look at <span>QEMU</span> <span>SBSA</span> Reference
Platform support, look at other <span>SBSA</span> compliant hardware. Copy, reuse their
drivers, their&nbsp;code.</p>
<h3>Was it&nbsp;worth?</h3>
<p>At the end you will have <span>SBSA</span> compliant hardware running <span>SBBR</span> compliant&nbsp;firmware. </p>
<p>Congratulations, your board is SystemReady <span>SR</span> compliant. Your marketing team may
write that you are on same list as Ampere with their Altra&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Users buy your hardware and can install whatever <span>BSD</span>, Linux distribution they
want. Some will experiment with Microsoft Windows. Others may work on porting
Haiku or other exotic operating&nbsp;system. </p>
<p>But none of them will have to think “how to get this shit running”. And they
will tell friends that your device is as boring as it should be when it comes to
running <span>OS</span> on it == more&nbsp;sales.</p>
